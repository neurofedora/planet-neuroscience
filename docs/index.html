<p>We present a novel methodology for control of neural circuits based on deep
reinforcement learning. Our approach achieves aimed behavior by generating
external continuous stimulation of existing neural circuits (neuromodulation
control) or modulations of neural circuits architecture (connectome control).
Both forms of control are challenging due to nonlinear and recurrent complexity
of neural activity. To infer candidate control policies, our approach maps
neural circuits and their connectome into a grid-world like setting and infers
the actions needed to achieve aimed behavior. The actions are inferred by
adaptation of deep Q-learning methods known for their robust performance in
navigating grid-worlds. We apply our approach to the model of \textit{C.
elegans} which simulates the full somatic nervous system with muscles and body.
Our framework successfully infers neuropeptidic currents and synaptic
architectures for control of chemotaxis. Our findings are consistent with in
vivo measurements and provide additional insights into neural control of
chemotaxis. We further demonstrate the generality and scalability of our
methods by inferring chemotactic neural circuits from scratch.

<p>Spiking neural networks are nature's solution for parallel information
processing with high temporal precision at a low metabolic energy cost. To that
end, biological neurons integrate inputs as an analog sum and communicate their
outputs digitally as spikes, i.e., sparse binary events in time. These
architectural principles can be mirrored effectively in analog neuromorphic
hardware. Nevertheless, training spiking neural networks with sparse activity
on hardware devices remains a major challenge. Primarily this is due to the
lack of suitable training methods that take into account device-specific
imperfections and operate at the level of individual spikes instead of firing
rates. To tackle this issue, we developed a hardware-in-the-loop strategy to
train multi-layer spiking networks using surrogate gradients on the analog
BrainScales-2 chip. Specifically, we used the hardware to compute the forward
pass of the network, while the backward pass was computed in software. We
evaluated our approach on downscaled 16x16 versions of the MNIST and the
fashion MNIST datasets in which spike latencies encoded pixel intensities. The
analog neuromorphic substrate closely matched the performance of equivalently
sized networks implemented in software. It is capable of processing 70 k
patterns per second with a power consumption of less than 300 mW. Added
activity regularization resulted in sparse network activity with about 20
spikes per input, at little to no reduction in classification performance.
Thus, overall, our work demonstrates low-energy spiking network processing on
an analog neuromorphic substrate and sets several new benchmarks for hardware
systems in terms of classification accuracy, processing speed, and efficiency.
Importantly, our work emphasizes the value of hardware-in-the-loop training and
paves the way toward energy-efficient information processing on non-von-Neumann
architectures.

<p>The power that machine learning models consume when making predictions can be
affected by a model's architecture. This paper presents various estimates of
power consumption for a range of different activation functions, a core factor
in neural network model architecture design. Substantial differences in

<p>Current methods for training recurrent neural networks are based on
backpropagation through time, which requires storing a complete history of
network states, and prohibits updating the weights `online' (after every
timestep). Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) eliminates the need for history
storage and allows for online weight updates, but does so at the expense of
computational costs that are quartic in the state size. This renders RTRL
training intractable for all but the smallest networks, even ones that are made
highly sparse.
</p>
<p>We introduce the Sparse n-step Approximation (SnAp) to the RTRL influence
matrix, which only keeps entries that are nonzero within n steps of the
recurrent core. SnAp with n=1 is no more expensive than backpropagation, and we
find that it substantially outperforms other RTRL approximations with
comparable costs such as Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization. For highly
sparse networks, SnAp with n=2 remains tractable and can outperform
backpropagation through time in terms of learning speed when updates are done
online. SnAp becomes equivalent to RTRL when n is large.

<p>In many real-life tasks of application of supervised learning approaches, all
the training data are not available at the same time. The examples are lifelong
image classification or recognition of environmental objects during interaction
of instrumented persons with their environment, enrichment of an
online-database with more images. It is necessary to pre-train the model at a
"training recording phase" and then adjust it to the new coming data. This is
the task of incremental/continual learning approaches. Amongst different
problems to be solved by these approaches such as introduction of new
categories in the model, refining existing categories to sub-categories and
extending trained classifiers over them, ... we focus on the problem of
adjusting pre-trained model with new additional training data for existing
categories. We propose a fast continual learning layer at the end of the
neuronal network. Obtained results are illustrated on the opensource CIFAR
benchmark dataset. The proposed scheme yields similar performances as
retraining but with drastically lower computational cost.

<p>The state-of-the art machine learning approach to training deep neural
networks, backpropagation, is implausible for real neural networks: neurons
need to know their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass
(computation) and a backward pass (learning); and the algorithm needs a large
amount of labeled data. Biologically plausible approximations to
backpropagation, such as feedback alignment, solve the weight transport
problem, but not the other two. Thus, fully biologically plausible learning
rules have so far remained elusive. Here we present a family of learning rules
that does not suffer from any of these problems. It is motivated by the
information bottleneck principle (extended with kernel methods), in which
networks learn to squeeze as much information as possible out of the input
without sacrificing prediction of the output. The resulting rules have a
3-factor Hebbian structure: they require pre- and post-synaptic firing rates
and a global error signal - the third factor - that can be supplied by a
neuromodulator. Moreover, they do not require precise labels; instead, they
rely on the similarity between the desired outputs. They thus solve all three
implausibility issues of backpropagation. Moreover, to obtain good performance
on hard problems and retain biologically plausible learning rules, our rules
need divisive normalization - a known feature of biological networks. Finally,
simulations show that our rule performs nearly as well as backpropagation on
image classification tasks.

<p>Fixed-budget theory is concerned with computing or bounding the fitness value
achievable by randomized search heuristics within a given budget of fitness
function evaluations. Despite recent progress in fixed-budget theory, there is
a lack of general tools to derive such results. We transfer drift theory, the
key tool to derive expected optimization times, to the fixed-budged
perspective. A first and easy-to-use statement concerned with iterating drift
in so-called greed-admitting scenarios immediately translates into bounds on
the expected function value. Afterwards, we consider a more general tool based
on the well-known variable drift theorem. Applications of this technique to the
LeadingOnes benchmark function yield statements that are more precise than the
previous state of the art.

<p>Catastrophic forgetting affects the training of neural networks, limiting
their ability to learn multiple tasks sequentially. From the perspective of the
well established plasticity-stability dilemma, neural networks tend to be
overly plastic, lacking the stability necessary to prevent the forgetting of
previous knowledge, which means that as learning progresses, networks tend to
forget previously seen tasks. This phenomenon coined in the continual learning
literature, has attracted much attention lately, and several families of
approaches have been proposed with different degrees of success. However, there
has been limited prior work extensively analyzing the impact that different
training regimes -- learning rate, batch size, regularization method-- can have
on forgetting. In this work, we depart from the typical approach of altering
the learning algorithm to improve stability. Instead, we hypothesize that the
geometrical properties of the local minima found for each task play an
important role in the overall degree of forgetting. In particular, we study the
effect of dropout, learning rate decay, and batch size, on forming training
regimes that widen the tasks' local minima and consequently, on helping it not
to forget catastrophically. Our study provides practical insights to improve
stability via simple yet effective techniques that outperform alternative
baselines.

<p>Living neural networks in our brains autonomously self-organize into large,
complex architectures during early development to result in an organized and
functional organic computational device. A key mechanism that enables the
formation of complex architecture in the developing brain is the emergence of
traveling spatio-temporal waves of neuronal activity across the growing brain.
Inspired by this strategy, we attempt to efficiently self-organize large neural
networks with an arbitrary number of layers into a wide variety of
architectures. To achieve this, we propose a modular tool-kit in the form of a
dynamical system that can be seamlessly stacked to assemble multi-layer neural
networks. The dynamical system encapsulates the dynamics of spiking units,
their inter/intra layer interactions as well as the plasticity rules that
control the flow of information between layers. The key features of our
tool-kit are (1) autonomous spatio-temporal waves across multiple layers
triggered by activity in the preceding layer and (2) Spike-timing dependent
plasticity (STDP) learning rules that update the inter-layer connectivity based
on wave activity in the connecting layers. Our framework leads to the
self-organization of a wide variety of architectures, ranging from multi-layer
perceptrons to autoencoders. We also demonstrate that emergent waves can
self-organize spiking network architecture to perform unsupervised learning,
and networks can be coupled with a linear classifier to perform classification
on classic image datasets like MNIST. Broadly, our work shows that a dynamical
systems framework for learning can be used to self-organize large computational
devices.

<p>In this paper, we develop an algorithm called hierarchal online sequential
learning algorithm (H-OS-ELM) for single feed feedforward network with features
combined from hundreds of midlayers, the algorithm can learn chunk by chunk
with fixed or varying block size, we believe that the diverse selectivity of
neurons in top layers which consists of encoded distributed information
produced by the other neurons offers better computational advantage over
inference accuracy. Thus this paper proposes a Hierarchical model framework
combined with Online-Sequential learning algorithm, Firstly the model consists
of subspace feature extractor which consists of subnetwork neuron, using the
sub-features which is result of the feature extractor in first layer of the
hierarchy we get rid of irrelevant factors which are of no use for the learning
and iterate this process so that to recast the the subfeatures into the
hierarchical model to be processed into more acceptable cognition. Secondly by
using OS-Elm we are using non-iterative style for learning we are implementing
a network which is wider and shallow which plays a important role in
generalizing the overall performance which in turn boosts up the learning speed

<p>Training neural networks with binary weights and activations is a challenging
problem due to the lack of gradients and difficulty of optimization over
discrete weights. Many successful experimental results have been recently
achieved using the empirical straight-through estimation approach. This
approach has generated a variety of ad-hoc rules for propagating gradients
through non-differentiable activations and updating discrete weights. We put
such methods on a solid basis by obtaining them as viable approximations in the
stochastic binary network (SBN) model with Bernoulli weights. In this model
gradients are well-defined and the weight probabilities can be optimized by
continuous techniques. By choosing the activation noises in SBN appropriately
and choosing mirror descent (MD) for optimization, we obtain methods that
closely resemble several existing straight-through variants, but unlike them,
all work reliably and produce equally good results. We further show that
variational inference for Bayesian learning of Binary weights can be
implemented using MD updates with the same simplicity.

<p>To improve the search efficiency for Neural Architecture Search (NAS),
One-shot NAS proposes to train a single super-net to approximate the
performance of proposal architectures during search via weight-sharing. While
this greatly reduces the computation cost, due to approximation error, the
performance prediction by a single super-net is less accurate than training
each proposal architecture from scratch, leading to search inefficiency. In
this work, we propose few-shot NAS that explores the choice of using multiple
super-nets: each super-net is pre-trained to be in charge of a sub-region of
the search space. This reduces the prediction error of each super-net.
Moreover, training these super-nets can be done jointly via sequential
fine-tuning. A natural choice of sub-region is to follow the splitting of
search space in NAS. We empirically evaluate our approach on three different
tasks in NAS-Bench-201. Extensive results have demonstrated that few-shot NAS,
using only 5 super-nets, significantly improves performance of many search
methods with slight increase of search time. The architectures found by DARTs
and ENAS with few-shot models achieved 88.53% and 86.50% test accuracy on
CIFAR-10 in NAS-Bench-201, significantly outperformed their one-shot
counterparts (with 54.30% and 54.30% test accuracy). Moreover, on AUTOGAN and
DARTS, few-shot NAS also outperforms previously state-of-the-art models.

into other use is the goal of neuroscientists' study. Due to that the field of
neuroscience is utilizing the traditional methods presently, we hence combine
the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with the theory of neuron

that is related to neuron activity in hippocampus is statistically examined as
well. The experiments suggest that our state-of-the-art deep learning-based

prediction accuracy and additionally, there is strong evidence against
equivalence of mouse stress level under diverse environments.

<p>Neurofeedback is a non-invasive brain training with long-term medical and
non-medical applications. Despite the existence of several emotion regulation
studies using neurofeedback, further investigation is needed to understand
interactions of the brain regions involved in the process. We implemented EEG
neurofeedback with simultaneous fMRI using a modified happiness-inducing task
through autobiographical memories to upregulate positive emotion. The results
showed increased activity of prefrontal, occipital, parietal, and limbic
regions and increased functional connectivity between prefrontal, parietal,
limbic system, and insula in the experimental group. New connectivity links
were identified by comparing the functional connectivity of different
experimental conditions within the experimental group and between the
experimental and control groups. The proposed multimodal approach quantified
the changes in the brain activity (up to 1.9% increase) and connectivity
(FDR-corrected for multiple comparison, q = 0.05) during emotion regulation
in/between prefrontal, parietal, limbic, and insula regions. Psychometric
assessments confirmed significant changes in positive and negative mood states
by neurofeedback with a p-value smaller than 0.002 in the experimental group.
This study quantifies the effects of EEG neurofeedback in changing functional
connectivity of all brain regions involved in emotion regulation. For the brain
regions involved in emotion regulation, we found significant BOLD and
functional connectivity increases due to neurofeedback in the experimental
group but no learning effect was observed in the control group. The results
reveal the neurobiological substrate of emotion regulation by the EEG
neurofeedback and separate the effect of the neurofeedback and the recall of
the autobiographical memories.

<p>Recent articles indicate that deep neural networks are efficient models for
various learning problems. However they are often highly sensitive to various
changes that cannot be detected by an independent observer. As our
understanding of deep neural networks with traditional generalization bounds
still remains incomplete, there are several measures which capture the
behaviour of the model in case of small changes at a specific state. In this
paper we consider adversarial stability in the tangent space and suggest
tangent sensitivity in order to characterize stability. We focus on a
particular kind of stability with respect to changes in parameters that are
induced by individual examples without known labels. We derive several easily
computable bounds and empirical measures for feed-forward fully connected ReLU
(Rectified Linear Unit) networks and connect tangent sensitivity to the
distribution of the activation regions in the input space realized by the
network. Our experiments suggest that even simple bounds and measures are
associated with the empirical generalization gap.

<p>In this paper, we propose a design methodology to partition and map the
neurons and synapses of online learning SNN-based applications to neuromorphic
architectures at {run-time}. Our design methodology operates in two steps --
step 1 is a layer-wise greedy approach to partition SNNs into clusters of
neurons and synapses incorporating the constraints of the neuromorphic
architecture, and step 2 is a hill-climbing optimization algorithm that
minimizes the total spikes communicated between clusters, improving energy
consumption on the shared interconnect of the architecture. We conduct
experiments to evaluate the feasibility of our algorithm using synthetic and
realistic SNN-based applications. We demonstrate that our algorithm reduces SNN
mapping time by an average 780x compared to a state-of-the-art design-time
based SNN partitioning approach with only 6.25\% lower solution quality.

<p>High-performance tensor programs are crucial to guarantee efficient execution
of deep learning models. However, obtaining performant tensor programs for
different operators on various hardware platforms is notoriously difficult.
Currently, deep learning systems rely on vendor-provided kernel libraries or
various search strategies to get performant tensor programs. These approaches
either require significant engineering efforts in developing platform-specific
optimization code or fall short in finding high-performance programs due to
restricted search space and ineffective exploration strategy.
</p>
<p>We present Ansor, a tensor program generation framework for deep learning
applications. Compared with existing search strategies, Ansor explores much
more optimization combinations by sampling programs from a hierarchical
representation of the search space. Ansor then fine-tunes the sampled programs
with evolutionary search and a learned cost model to identify the best
programs. Ansor can find high-performance programs that are outside the search
space of existing state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, Ansor utilizes a
scheduler to simultaneously optimize multiple subgraphs in a set of deep neural
networks. Our evaluation shows that Ansor improves the execution performance of
deep neural networks on the Intel CPU, ARM CPU, and NVIDIA GPU by up to
$3.8\times$, $2.6\times$, and $1.7 \times$, respectively.

<p>Automated machine learning (AutoML) and deep learning (DL) are two
cutting-edge paradigms used to solve a myriad of inductive learning tasks. In
spite of their successes, little guidance exists for when to choose one
approach over the other in the context of specific real-world problems.
Furthermore, relatively few tools exist that allow the integration of both
AutoML and DL in the same analysis to yield results combining both of their
strengths. Here, we seek to address both of these issues, by (1.) providing a
head-to-head comparison of AutoML and DL in the context of binary
classification on 6 well-characterized public datasets, and (2.) evaluating a
new tool for genetic programming-based AutoML that incorporates deep
estimators. Our observations suggest that AutoML outperforms simple DL
classifiers when trained on similar datasets for binary classification but
integrating DL into AutoML improves classification performance even further.
However, the substantial time needed to train AutoML+DL pipelines will likely
outweigh performance advantages in many applications.

<p>Training generative adversarial networks (GAN) using too little data
typically leads to discriminator overfitting, causing training to diverge. We
propose an adaptive discriminator augmentation mechanism that significantly
stabilizes training in limited data regimes. The approach does not require
changes to loss functions or network architectures, and is applicable both when
training from scratch and when fine-tuning an existing GAN on another dataset.
We demonstrate, on several datasets, that good results are now possible using
only a few thousand training images, often matching StyleGAN2 results with an
order of magnitude fewer images. We expect this to open up new application
domains for GANs. We also find that the widely used CIFAR-10 is, in fact, a
limited data benchmark, and improve the record FID from 5.59 to 2.67.

<p>Normalization layers and activation functions are fundamental components in
deep networks and typically co-locate with each other. Here we propose to
design them using an automated approach. Instead of designing them separately,
we unify them into a single tensor-to-tensor computation graph, and evolve its
structure starting from basic mathematical functions. Examples of such
mathematical functions are addition, multiplication and statistical moments.
The use of low-level mathematical functions, in contrast to the use of
high-level modules in mainstream NAS, leads to a highly sparse and large search
space which can be challenging for search methods. To address the challenge, we
develop efficient rejection protocols to quickly filter out candidate layers
that do not work well. We also use multi-objective evolution to optimize each
layer's performance across many architectures to prevent overfitting. Our
method leads to the discovery of EvoNorms, a set of new
normalization-activation layers with novel, and sometimes surprising structures
that go beyond existing design patterns. For example, some EvoNorms do not
assume that normalization and activation functions must be applied
sequentially, nor need to center the feature maps, nor require explicit
activation functions. Our experiments show that EvoNorms work well on image
classification models including ResNets, MobileNets and EfficientNets but also
transfer well to Mask R-CNN with FPN/SpineNet for instance segmentation and to
BigGAN for image synthesis, outperforming BatchNorm and GroupNorm based layers
in many cases.

<p>Machine learning applications such as finance and medicine demand accurate
and justifiable predictions, barring most deep learning methods from use. In
response, previous work combines decision trees with deep learning, yielding
models that (1) sacrifice interpretability to maintain accuracy or (2)
underperform modern neural networks to maintain interpretability. We forgo this
dilemma by proposing Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs), modified
hierarchical classifiers that use trees constructed in weight-space. Our NBDTs
achieve (1) interpretability and (2) neural network accuracy: We preserve
interpretable properties -- e.g., leaf purity and a non-ensembled model -- and
demonstrate interpretability of model predictions both qualitatively and
quantitatively. Furthermore, NBDTs match state-of-the-art neural networks on
CIFAR10, CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet to within 1-2%. This yields
state-of-the-art interpretable models on ImageNet, with NBDTs besting all
decision-tree-based methods by ~14% to attain 75.30% top-1 accuracy. Code and
pretrained NBDTs are at

<p>This paper relates parameter distance to gradient breakdown for a broad class
of nonlinear compositional functions. The analysis leads to a new distance
function called deep relative trust and a descent lemma for neural networks.
Since the resulting learning rule seems not to require learning rate grid
search, it may unlock a simpler workflow for training deeper and more complex
neural networks. Please find the Python code used in this paper here:

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03001">A Novel Evolution Strategy with Directional Gaussian Smoothing for Blackbox Optimization. (arXiv:2002.03001v2 [math.OC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>We propose an improved evolution strategy (ES) using a novel nonlocal
gradient operator for high-dimensional black-box optimization. Standard ES
methods with $d$-dimensional Gaussian smoothing suffer from the curse of
dimensionality due to the high variance of Monte Carlo (MC) based gradient
estimators. To control the variance, Gaussian smoothing is usually limited in a
small region, so existing ES methods lack nonlocal exploration ability required
for escaping from local minima. We develop a nonlocal gradient operator with
directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) to address this challenge. The DGS
conducts 1D nonlocal explorations along $d$ orthogonal directions in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each of which defines a nonlocal directional derivative as a 1D
integral. We then use Gauss-Hermite quadrature, instead of MC sampling, to
estimate the $d$ 1D integrals to ensure high accuracy (i.e., small variance).
Our method enables effective nonlocal exploration to facilitate the global
search in high-dimensional optimization. We demonstrate the superior
performance of our method in three sets of examples, including benchmark
functions for global optimization, and real-world science and engineering
applications.

<p>Immunolabeling for adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors (A<sub>1</sub>Rs) is high in hippocampal area CA2 in adult rats, and the potentiating effects of caffeine or other A<sub>1</sub>R-selective antagonists on synaptic responses are particularly robust at Schaffer collateral synapses in CA2. Interestingly, the pronounced staining for A<sub>1</sub>Rs in CA2 is not apparent until rats are 4 weeks old, suggesting that developmental changes other than receptor distribution underlie the sensitivity of CA2 synapses to A<sub>1</sub>R antagonists in young animals. To evaluate the role of A<sub>1</sub>R-mediated postsynaptic signals at these synapses, we tested whether A<sub>1</sub>R agonists regulate synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral inputs to CA2 and CA1. We found that the selective A<sub>1</sub>R agonist CCPA caused a lasting depression of synaptic responses in both CA2 and CA1 neurons in slices obtained from juvenile rats (P14), but that the effect was observed only in CA2 in slices prepared from adult animals (~P70). Interestingly, blocking phosphodiesterase activity with rolipram inhibited the CCPA-induced depression in CA1, but not in CA2, indicative of robust phosphodiesterase activity in CA1 neurons. Likewise, synaptic responses in CA2 and CA1 differed in their sensitivity to the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, in that it increased synaptic transmission in CA2, but had little effect in CA1. These findings suggest that the A<sub>1</sub>R-mediated synaptic depression tracks the postnatal development of immunolabeling for A<sub>1</sub>Rs and that the enhanced sensitivity to antagonists in CA2 at young ages is likely due to robust adenylyl cyclase activity and weak phosphodiesterase activity rather than to enrichment of A<sub>1</sub>Rs.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58807">Meta-Research: COVID-19 medical papers have fewer women first authors than expected</a></h4>

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in school closures and distancing requirements that have disrupted both work and family life for many. Concerns exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally. Many medical journals have published papers on the pandemic, which were generated by researchers facing the challenges of these disruptions. Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the gender distribution of authors on 1,893 medical papers related to the pandemic with that on papers published in the same journals in 2019, for papers with first authors and last authors from the United States. Using mixed-effects regression models, we estimated that the proportion of COVID-19 papers with a woman first author was 19% lower than that for papers published in the same journals in 2019, while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion of women authors per paper were inconclusive. A closer examination suggested that women’s representation as first authors of COVID-19 research was particularly low for papers published in March and April 2020. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the research productivity of women, especially early-career women, has been affected more than the research productivity of men.

The surface of insects is coated in cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs); variations in the composition of this layer affect a range of traits including adaptation to arid environments and defence against pathogens and toxins. In the African malaria vector, <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> quantitative and qualitative variance in CHC composition have been associated with speciation, ecological habitat and insecticide resistance. Understanding how these modifications arise will inform us of how mosquitoes are responding to climate change and vector control interventions. CHCs are synthesised in sub-epidermal cells called oenocytes that are very difficult to isolate from surrounding tissues. Here we utilise a transgenic line with fluorescent oenocytes to purify these cells for the first time. Comparative transcriptomics revealed the enrichment of biological processes related to long chain fatty acyl-CoA biosynthesis and elongation of mono-, poly-unsaturated and saturated fatty acids and enabled us to delineate, and partially validate, the hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathway in <i>An</i><i>.</i><i> gambiae</i>.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57591">Evolutionarily conserved regulation of immunity by the splicing factor RNP-6/PUF60</a></h4>

Splicing is a vital cellular process that modulates important aspects of animal physiology, yet roles in regulating innate immunity are relatively unexplored. From genetic screens in <i>C. elegans</i>, we identified splicing factor RNP-6/PUF60 whose activity suppresses immunity, but promotes longevity, suggesting a tradeoff between these processes. Bacterial pathogen exposure affects gene expression and splicing in a <i>rnp-6</i> dependent manner, and <i>rnp-6</i> gain and loss-of-function activities reveal an active role in immune regulation. Another longevity promoting splicing factor, SFA-1, similarly exerts an immuno-suppressive effect, working downstream or parallel to RNP-6. RNP-6 acts through TIR-1/PMK-1/MAPK signaling to modulate immunity. The mammalian homolog, PUF60, also displays anti-inflammatory properties, and its levels swiftly decrease after bacterial infection in mammalian cells, implying a role in the host response. Altogether our findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved modulation of immunity by specific components of the splicing machinery.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57288">PreBötzinger complex neurons drive respiratory modulation of blood pressure and heart rate</a></h4>

Heart rate and blood pressure oscillate in phase with respiratory activity. A component of these oscillations is generated centrally, with respiratory neurons entraining the activity of pre-sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular neurons. Using a combination of optogenetic inhibition and excitation <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in situ</i> in rats, as well as neuronal tracing, we demonstrate that preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) neurons, which form the kernel for inspiratory rhythm generation, directly modulate cardiovascular activity. Specifically, inhibitory preBötC neurons modulate cardiac parasympathetic neuron activity whilst excitatory preBötC neurons modulate sympathetic vasomotor neuron activity, generating heart rate and blood pressure oscillations in phase with respiration. Our data reveal yet more functions entrained to the activity of the preBötC, with a role in generating cardiorespiratory oscillations. The findings have implications for cardiovascular pathologies, such as hypertension and heart failure, where respiratory entrainment of heart rate is diminished and respiratory entrainment of blood pressure exaggerated.

The DNA damage response (DDR) is a highly orchestrated process but how double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are initially recognized is unclear. Here, we show that polymerized SIRT6 deacetylase recognizes DSBs and potentiates the DDR in human and mouse cells. First, SIRT1 deacetylates SIRT6 at residue K33, which is important for SIRT6 polymerization and mobilization toward DSBs. Then, K33-deacetylated SIRT6 anchors to γH2AX, allowing its retention on and subsequent remodeling of local chromatin. We show that a K33R mutation that mimics hypoacetylated SIRT6 can rescue defective DNA repair as a result of <i>SIRT1 </i>deficiency in cultured cells. These data highlight the synergistic action between SIRTs in the spatiotemporal regulation of the DDR and DNA repair in humans and mice.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55678">Quantitative modeling of the effect of antigen dosage on B-cell affinity distributions in maturating germinal centers</a></h4>

Affinity maturation is a complex dynamical process allowing the immune system to generate antibodies capable of recognizing antigens. We introduce a model for the evolution of the distribution of affinities across the antibody population in germinal centers. The model is amenable to detailed mathematical analysis, and gives insight on the mechanisms through which antigen availability controls the rate of maturation and the expansion of the antibody population. It is also capable, upon maximum-likelihood inference of the parameters, to reproduce accurately the distributions of affinities of IgG-secreting cells we measure in mice immunized against Tetanus Toxoid under largely varying conditions (antigen dosage, delay between injections). Both model and experiments show that the average population affinity depends non-monotonically on the antigen dosage. We show that combining quantitative modelling and statistical inference is a concrete way to investigate biological processes underlying affinity maturation (such as selection permissiveness), hardly accessible through measurements.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55357">Leptin increases sympathetic nerve activity via induction of its own receptor in the paraventricular nucleus</a></h4>

Whether leptin acts in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to increase sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) is unclear, since PVN leptin receptors (LepR) are sparse. We show in rats that PVN leptin slowly increases SNA to muscle and brown adipose tissue, because it induces the expression of its own receptor and synergizes with local glutamatergic neurons. PVN LepR are not expressed in astroglia and rarely in microglia; instead, glutamatergic neurons express LepR, some of which project to a key presympathetic hub, the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). In PVN slices from mice expressing GCaMP6, leptin excites glutamatergic neurons. LepR are expressed mainly in thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) neurons, some of which project to the RVLM. Injections of TRH into the RVLM and dorsomedial hypothalamus increase SNA, highlighting these nuclei as likely targets. We suggest that this neuropathway becomes important in obesity, in which elevated leptin maintains the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis, despite leptin resistance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54253">The transition state and regulation of γ-TuRC-mediated microtubule nucleation revealed by single molecule microscopy</a></h4>

Determining how microtubules (MTs) are nucleated is essential for understanding how the cytoskeleton assembles. While the MT nucleator, γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) has been identified, precisely how γ-TuRC nucleates a MT remains poorly understood. Here we developed a single molecule assay to directly visualize nucleation of a MT from purified <i>Xenopus laevis</i> γ-TuRC. We reveal a high γ-/αβ-tubulin affinity, which facilitates assembly of a MT from γ-TuRC. Whereas spontaneous nucleation requires assembly of 8 αβ-tubulins, nucleation from γ-TuRC occurs efficiently with a cooperativity of 4 αβ-tubulin dimers. This is distinct from pre-assembled MT seeds, where a single dimer is sufficient to initiate growth. A computational model predicts our kinetic measurements and reveals the rate-limiting transition where laterally-associated αβ-tubulins drive γ-TuRC into a closed conformation. Putative activation domain of CDK5RAP2, NME7 and TPX2 do not enhance γ-TuRC-mediated nucleation, while XMAP215 drastically increases the nucleation efficiency by strengthening the longitudinal γ-/αβ-tubulin interaction.

High variability between individuals (i.e. inter-individual variability) in response to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has become a commonly reported issue in the tDCS literature in recent years. Inherent genetic differences between individuals has been proposed as a contributing factor to observed response variability. This study investigated whether tDCS inter-individual variability was genetically mediated. A large sample-size of sixty-one healthy males received cathodal-tDCS (c-tDCS) and sham-tDCS, of the primary motor cortex at 1mA and 10-minutes via 6x4cm active and 7x5cm return electrodes. Corticospinal excitability (CSE) was assessed via twenty-five single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation motor evoked potentials (MEP). Intracortical inhibition (ICI) was assessed via twenty-five 3ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI) paired-pulse MEPs, known as short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). Intracortical facilitation (ICF) was assessed via twenty-five 10ms ISI paired-pulse MEPs. Gene variants encoding for excitatory and inhibitory neuroreceptors were determined via saliva samples. Pre-determined thresholds and statistical cluster analyses were used to subgroup individuals. Two distinct subgroups were identified, Responders reducing CSE following c-tDCS and Non-Responders showing no reduction or even increase in CSE. Differences in CSE between responders and non-responders following c-tDCS were not explained by changes in SICI or ICF. No significant relationships were reported between gene variants and inter-individual variability to c-tDCS suggesting the chosen gene variants did not influence the activity of the neuroreceptors involved in eliciting changes in CSE in responders following c-tDCS. In this largest c-tDCS study of its kind, novel insights were reported into the contribution genetic factors may play in observed inter-individual variability to c-tDCS.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disability (ID) are comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders with complex genetic architectures. Despite large-scale sequencing studies only a fraction of the risk genes were identified for both. Here, we present a novel network-based gene risk prioritization algorithm named DeepND that performs cross-disorder analysis to improve prediction power by exploiting the comorbidity of ASD and ID via multitask learning. Our model leverages information from gene co-expression networks that model human brain development using graph convolutional neural networks and learns which spatio-temporal neurovelopmental windows are important for disorder etiologies. We show that our approach substantially improves the state-of-the-art prediction power in both single-disorder and cross-disorder settings. DeepND identifies mediodorsal thalamus and cerebral cortex brain region and infancy to childhood period as the highest neurodevelopmental risk window for both ASD and ID. We observe that both disorders are enriched in transcription regulators. Despite tight regulatory links in between ASD risk genes, such is lacking across ASD and ID risk genes or within ID risk genes. Finally, we investigate frequent ASD and ID associated copy number variation regions and confident false findings to suggest several novel susceptibility gene candidates. DeepND can be generalized to analyze any combinations of comorbid disorders and is released at http://github.com/ciceklab/deepnd.

A hexanucleotide repeat expansion GGGGCC in the noncoding region of C9orf72 is the most common cause of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Potentially toxic dipeptide repeats (DPRs) are synthesized from the GGGGCC sequence via repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. We developed C. elegans models that express, either ubiquitously or exclusively in neurons, a transgene with 75 GGGGCC repeats flanked by intronic C9orf72 sequence. The worms generate DPRs (poly-glycine-alanine [poly-GA], poly-glycine-proline [poly-GP]) and display neurodegeneration, locomotor and lifespan defects. Mutation of a non-canonical translation-initiating codon (CUG) upstream of the repeats blocked poly-GA production and ameliorated disease, suggesting poly-GA is pathogenic. Importantly, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2D (eif-2D/eIF2D) was necessary for RAN translation. Genetic removal of eif-2D increased lifespan in both C. elegans models. In vitro findings in human cells demonstrated a conserved role for eif-2D/eIF2D in RAN translation that could be exploited for ALS and FTD therapy.

In this brief report, we examined the test-retest reliability of our in-house explicit auditory processing measures in the context of 30 L1 and L2 English users. The participants took the same test battery which consisted of a total of four discrimination tasks (encoding acoustic details of formant, pitch, duration, and rise time) and two reproduction tasks (repeating novel melodic and rhythmic patterns) at Days 1 and 2. According to the results, the participants' initial and second test scores demonstrated medium-to-large associations (r = .562-.907). The results suggest that the tests can tap into various dimensions of individuals' auditory acuity and integration abilities.

<p>Golgi tendon organ pathways contribute to coordination of limb extensors during motor tasks including locomotion. Normally, these inhibitory force feedback pathways are flexibly weighted. We show that following spinal cord injury, force feedback is permanently reorganized. Balance is lost and biased inhibition emerges from toe flexors onto ankle extensors.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Inhibitory pathways from Golgi tendon organs project widely between muscles crossing different joints and axes of rotation. Evidence suggests that the strength and distribution of this intermuscular inhibition is dependent on motor task and corresponding signals from the brainstem. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether this sensory network is altered after spinal cord hemisection as a potential explanation for motor deficits observed after spinal cord injury (SCI). Force feedback was assessed between the long toe flexor and ankle plantarflexor (flexor hallucis longus), and the three major ankle extensors, (combined gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles) in the hind limbs of unanesthetized, decerebrate, female cats. Data were collected from animals with intact spinal cords (control) and lateral spinal hemisections (LSHs) including chronic LSH (4–20 weeks), subchronic LSH (2 weeks), and acute LSH. Muscles were stretched individually and in pairwise combinations to measure intermuscular feedback between the toe flexor and each of the ankle extensors. In control animals, three patterns were observed (balanced inhibition between toe flexor and ankle extensors, stronger inhibition from toe flexor to ankle extensor, and vice versa). Following spinal hemisection, only strong inhibition from toe flexors onto ankle extensors was observed independent of survival time. The results suggest immediate and permanent reorganization of force feedback in the injured spinal cord. The altered strength and distribution of force feedback after SCI may be an important future target for rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) released by platelets, mast cells, and immunocytes is a potent inflammatory mediator which modulates pain and itch sensing in the peripheral nervous system. We focused on the identification of the signaling pathways involved in the activation of rat primary afferent neurons by 5‐HT and their involvement in itch and pain sensing. Transient responses evoked by 5‐HT are mediated by ionotropic 5‐HT3 receptors. Sustained responses to 5‐HT require activation of 5‐HT1A receptors coupled to Gi/o, leading to a decrease in membrane conductance, membrane depolarization, opening of voltage‐gated calcium channels and calcium entry. Both responses appear to be involved in triggering serotonergic itch in both male and female Wistar rats.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) released by platelets, mast cells, and immunocytes is a potent inflammatory mediator which modulates pain and itch sensing in the peripheral nervous system. The serotonergic receptors expressed by primary afferent neurons involved in these sensory functions are not fully identified and appear to be to a large extent species dependent. Moreover, the mechanisms through which 5‐HT receptor activation is coupled to changes in neuronal excitability have not been completely revealed. Using a combination of <i>in vitro </i> (calcium and voltage imaging and patch‐clamp) and <i>in vivo </i> behavioral methods, we used both male and female Wistar rats to provide evidence for the involvement of two 5‐HT receptor subtypes, 5‐HT1A and 5‐HT3, in mediating the sustained and transient effects, respectively, of 5‐HT on rat primary afferent neurons involved in pain and itch processing. In addition, our results are consistent with a model in which sustained serotonergic responses triggered via the 5‐HT1A receptor are due to closure of background potassium channels, followed by membrane depolarization and action potentials, during which the activation of voltage‐gated calcium channels leads to calcium entry. Our results may provide a better understanding of mammalian serotonergic itch signaling.</p>

<p>A voxel‐based morphometry analysis of 20 capuchin T1‐magnetic resonance imaging scans identified several sex differences in gray matter morphology. Male capuchins showed enlargement in a region of the posterior hypothalamus, possibly including the mammillary bodies, paraventricular nucleus, and/or lateral hypothalamus. Female capuchins showed enlargement in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, likely Crus II, and in the left occipitotemporal cortex, possibly including V2, V3, V4, TEO, and/or MT. These female‐enlarged regions have shown experience‐dependent plasticity in prior primate studies, and tractography indicated that they connect with a distributed network of perceptual and association regions. We postulate that capuchin brains, like human brains and in contrast to rodent brains, may show sex differences related to differential lifetime experience on top of more innate sex differences.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study reports an analysis of 20 T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans from tufted capuchin monkeys (5 male, 15 female). We carried out a data‐driven, whole‐brain volumetric analysis on regional gray matter anatomy using voxel‐based morphometry. This revealed that males showed statistically significant expansion of a region of the hypothalamus, while females showed significant expansion in a distributed set of regions, including the cerebellum, early visual cortex, and higher‐order visual regions spanning occipital and temporal cortex. In order to elucidate the network connectivity of these regions, we employed probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data. This showed that the female‐enlarged regions connect with distributed association networks across the brain. Notably, this contrasts with rodent studies, where sex differences are focused in deep, ancestral limbic regions involved in the control of reproductive behavior. Additionally, in our data set, for several regions, male and female volumetric measures were completely nonoverlapping. This contrasts with human studies, where sex differences in cortical regions have been reported but are characterized by overlapping rather than divergent male and female values. We suggest that these results can be understood in the context of the different lifetime experiences of males and females, which may produce increased experience‐dependent cortical plasticity in capuchins compared to rodents, and in humans compared to capuchins.</p>

Human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) is a cortical expanse that performs different functions and computations, but is especially critical for visual categorization. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence shows that category-selective regions persist in VTC in the absence of visual experience - for example, in congenitally blind (CB) participants. Despite this evidence, a large body of previous work comparing functional representations in VTC between sighted and CB participants performed univariate analyses at the group level, which assume a homogeneous population - an assumption that has not been formally tested until the present study. Specifically, using fMRI in CB and sighted participants (male and female), we empirically show that at the group level, distributed category representations in VTC are more reliable in the sighted (when viewing visual stimuli) compared to the CB (when hearing auditorily-substituted visual stimuli). Despite these group differences, there is extensive heterogeneity in VTC category representations in the CB to the point that VTC category representations in a subset of CB participants (some who were born without eyes, but not all) are more similar to sighted individuals compared to other CB participants. Together, our findings support a novel idea that driving factors contributing to the formation of VTC category representations in the blind are subject-specific, which complements factors that may generalize across group members. More broadly, the present findings caution conclusions of homogeneity across subjects within a group when performing group neuroimaging analyses without explicitly quantifying individual differences.

A major problem with current anxiolytic medications is abuse liability; thus, new pharmaceutical targets are being explored. The cannabinoid system is one potential target. The current paper examined behavioral and neurochemical changes related to abuse liability following chronic administration of the indirect cannabinoid agonist arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and the direct cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) agonist arachidonyl-2-chloro-ethylamide (ACEA). AA-5-HT indirectly agonizes the cannabinoid system via inhibition of the dual fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) while also inhibiting transient vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channels. Neither AA-5-HT nor ACEA induced conditioned place preference (CPP) or altered behaviors during open field (OF) or saccharin preference testing. AA-5-HT did not alter phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, as measured with in vivo fixed potential amperometry; however, ACEA decreased dopamine release and enhanced the dopaminergic effect of cocaine. Overall, neither AA-5-HT nor ACEA induced behavioral or neurochemical changes associated with abuse liability; however, indirect mechanisms of agonizing the cannabinoid system may be a better alternative than direct mechanisms if concerned with disrupting dopamine function.

Environmental insults that activate the maternal immune system are potent primers of developmental neuropathology and maternal immune activation (MIA) has emerged as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Animal models of MIA provide an opportunity to identify molecular pathways that initiate disease processes and lead to neuropathology and behavioral deficits in offspring. MIA-induced behaviors are accompanied by anatomical and neurochemical alterations in adult offspring that parallel those seen in affected human populations. We performed transcriptional profiling and neuroanatomical characterization in a time course across mouse embryonic cortical development, following MIA via single injection of the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) at E12.5. Transcriptional changes identified in the cortex of MIA offspring at E17.5 were validated and mapped to cortical neuroanatomy and cell types via protein analysis and immunohistochemistry. MIA induced strong transcriptomic signatures, including induction of genes associated with hypoxia, immune signaling, and angiogenesis. The acute response identified 6h after the MIA insult was followed by changes in proliferation, neuronal and glial differentiation, and cortical lamination that emerged at E14.5 and peaked at E17.5. Decreased numbers of proliferative cell types in germinal zones and alterations in neuronal and glial cell types across cortical lamina were identified in the MIA-exposed cortex. MIA-induced transcriptomic signatures in fetal offspring overlap significantly with perturbations identified in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), and provide novel insights into alterations in molecular and developmental timing processes linking MIA and neuropathology, potentially revealing new targets for development of novel approaches for earlier diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

Introduction: Firing rate (FR) and population coupling (PC) are intrinsic properties of cortical neurons. Neurons with different FR and PC have diverse excitability to stimulation, tuning curve, and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, investigation of the effect of anesthesia on neurons with different FR and PC would be important to understand state-dependent information processing in neuronal circuits. Methods: To test how anesthesia affects neurons with diverse PC and FR, we measured single-unit activities in deep layers of primary visual cortex at three levels of anesthesia with desflurane and in wakefulness. Based on PC and FR in wakefulness, neurons were classified into three distinct groups: high PC-high FR (HPHF), low PC-high FR (LPHF), and low PC-low FR (LPLF) neurons. Results: Applying repeated light flashes as visual stimuli, HPHF neurons showed the strongest early response (FR at 20-150ms post-stimulus) among the three groups, whereas the response of LPHF neurons persisted longest (up to 440ms). Anesthesia profoundly altered PC and FR, and differently affected the three neuron groups: (i) PC and FR became strongly correlated suppressing population-independent spike activity; (ii) Pairwise correlation of spikes between neurons could be predicted by a PC-based raster model suggesting uniform neuron-to-neuron coupling; (iii) Contrary to evoked-potential studies under anesthesia, the flash-induced early response of HPHF neurons was attenuated, and their spike timing was split and delayed; (iv) Late response (FR at 200-400ms post-stimulus) was suppressed both in HPHF and LPHF neurons. Conclusions: Anesthetic-induced association between PC and FR suggests reduced information content in the neural circuit. Altered response of HPHF neurons to visual stimuli suggests that anesthesia interferes with conscious sensory processing in primary sensory cortex.

How anesthesia affects cortical neuronal spiking and information transfer could help understand the neuronal basis of conscious state. Recent investigations suggest that global state of the anesthetized brain is not stationary but changes spontaneously at a fixed level of anesthetic concentration. How cortical unit activity changes with dynamically transitioning brain states under anesthesia is unclear. We hypothesized that distinct cortical states are characterized by distinct neuronal spike patterns. Extracellular unit activity was measured with sixty-four-channel silicon microelectrode arrays in cortical layers 5/6 of primary visual cortex of chronically instrumented, freely moving male rats (N = 7) during stepwise reduction of the anesthetic desflurane (6, 4, 2, and 0%). Unsupervised machine learning applied to multi-unit spike patterns revealed five distinct brain states of which four occurred at various anesthetic concentrations and shifted spontaneously. In deeper anesthesia states, the number of active units and overall spike rate decreased while the remaining active units showed increased bursting (excitatory neurons), spike timing variability, unit-to-population correlation and unit-to-unit transfer entropy, especially among putative excitatory units, despite the overall decrease in transfer entropy. A novel desynchronized brain state with increased spike timing variability, entropy and electromyographic activity that occurred mostly in deep anesthesia was discovered. These results provide evidence for distinct unit activity patterns associated with spontaneous changes in local cortical brain states at stationary anesthetic conditions. The appearance of a paradoxical, desynchronized brain state in deep anesthesia contends the prevailing view of monotonic dose-dependent anesthetic effects on the brain.

Ciona larvae have two distinct visuomotor behaviors - a looming shadow response and negative phototaxis. These are mediated by separate neural pathways that initiate from different clusters of photoreceptors. We report that input from both pathways is processed to generate fold-change detection (FCD) outputs - making the behavioral outputs reflective of relative changes in input, not absolute input values. Visual inputs from both pathways project first to the posterior brain vesicle (pBV). We find that the pBV shares hallmarks with the vertebrate midbrain optic tectum, including its anatomy, connectivity, function and gene expression - despite previous speculation that Ciona lacks a midbrain. The connectivity and properties (excitatory or inhibitory) of pBV interneurons conform to known FCD circuits, but with different circuit architectures for the two pathways. The negative phototaxis circuit forms an incoherent feedforward loop that involves interconnecting cholinergic and GABAergic interneurons. The looming shadow circuit uses the same cholinergic and GABAergic interneurons, but with different synaptic inputs to create a nonlinear integral feedback loop. Consequently, the two FCD circuits generate different behavioral profiles, with the negative phototaxis circuit resulting in a power-function relationship of behavioral output versus fold-change, while in the dimming response this relationship is linear.

Stimuli presented at short temporal delays before functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can have a robust impact on the organization of synchronous activity in resting state networks. This presents an opportunity to investigate how sensory, affective and cognitive stimuli alter functional connectivity in rodent models. Here, we assessed the effect of a familiar contextual stimulus presented 10 minutes prior to sedation for imaging on functional connectivity. A subset of animals were co-presented with an unfamiliar social stimulus in the same environment to further investigate the effect of familiarity on network topology. Female and male rats were imaged at 11.1 Tesla and graph theory analysis was applied to matrices generated from seed-based functional connectivity data sets with 144 nodes and 10,296 edge weights. Our results show an unconventional network topology in response to the familiar (context) but not the unfamiliar (social) stimulus. The familiar stimulus strongly reduced network strength, global efficiency, and altered the location of the highest eigenvector centrality nodes from cortex to the hypothalamus. We did not observe changes in modular organization, nodal cartographic assignments, assortative mixing, rich club organization, and network resilience. The results suggest that experiential factors, perhaps involving associative or episodic memory, can exert a dramatic effect on functional network strength and efficiency when presented at a short temporal delay before imaging.

Neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction are two early symptoms of most neurological diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying microglia-associated neuroinflammation in the regulation of synaptic activity remain obscure. We report here that acute neuroinflammation induced by a single-dose proinflammatory cytokine inducer, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), results in enhanced inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) of glutamatergic neurons, upregulated levels of GABAAR subunits, glutamine synthetase (GS) and vGAT, and downregulated BDNF and pTrkB levels, due to enhanced activation of microglia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Blockage of microglial activation by minocycline ameliorated LPS-induced aberrant mIPSCs and associated aberrant protein expression and behavior. Exogenous application of BDNF prior to LPS challenge also ameliorated LPS-induced abnormal mIPSCs. Thus, this study elucidates a critical role for microglia in the neurobiology of GABAergic synaptic dysfunction induced by neuroinflammation, revealing a novel GABAergic signaling pathway that might be targeted therapeutically to treat neuroinflammation-induced abnormal synaptic activity and associated aberrant behavior.

Background: This study aims to investigate whether dimensional constructs of psychopathology relate to advanced, attenuated or normal patterns of brain development, and to determine whether these constructs share common neurodevelopmental profiles. Methods: Psychiatric symptom ratings from 9312 youths (8-21 years) were parsed into 7 independent dimensions of clinical psychopathology representing conduct, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, attention, depression, bipolar, and psychosis symptoms. Using a subset of this cohort with structural MRI (n=1313), a normative model of brain morphology was established and the model was then applied to predict the age of youth with clinical symptoms. We investigated whether the deviation of brain-predicted age from true chronological age, called the brain age gap, explained individual variation in each psychopathology dimension. Results: Individual variation in the brain age gap significantly associated with clinical dimensions representing psychosis (t=3.16, p=0.0016), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (t=2.5, p=0.01), and general psychopathology (t=4.08, p&lt;0.0001). Greater symptom severity along these dimensions was associated with brain morphology that appeared older than expected for typically developing youth of the same age. Psychopathology dimensions clustered into two modules based on shared brain loci where putative accelerated neurodevelopment was most prominent. Patterns of morphological development were accelerated in frontal cortices for depression, psychosis and conduct symptoms (Module I), whereas acceleration was most evident in subcortex and insula for the remaining dimensions (Module II). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that advanced brain development, particularly in frontal cortex and subcortical nuclei, underpins clinical psychosis and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in youth. Psychopathology dimensions share common neural substrates, despite representing clinically independent symptom profiles.

On-going, large-scale neuroimaging initiatives have produced many MRI datasets with hundreds, even thousands, of individual participants and scans. These databases can aid in uncovering neurobiological causes and correlates of poor mental health, disease pathology, and many other important factors. While volumetric quantification of brain structures can be completed by expert hand-tracing, automated segmentations are becoming the only truly tractable approach for particularly large datasets. Here, we assessed the spatial and numerical reliability for newly-deployed automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei in FreeSurfer. In a sample of participants with repeated structural imaging scans (N=118), we found numerical reliability (as assessed by intraclass correlations) to be generally high, with 92% of the subregions having ICCs above 0.90 and the remainder still above 0.75. Spatial reliability was lower with only 11% of regions having Dice coefficients above 0.90, but 70% with Dice coefficients above 0.75. Of particular concern, three regions, the hippocampal fissure, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the paralaminar nucleus, had only moderate spatial reliability (0.50-0.75). We also examined correlations between spatial reliability and person-level factors (e.g., age, inter-scan interval, and difference in image quality). For these factors, interscan interval and image quality were related to variations in spatial reliability. Examined collectively, our work suggests strong numerical and spatial reliability for the majority of hippocampal and amygdala subdivisions; however, caution should be exercised for a few regions with more variable reliability.

High-resolution fMRI in the sub-millimeter regime allows researchers to resolve brain activity across cortical layers and columns non-invasively. While these high-resolution data make it possible to address novel questions of directional information flow within and across brain circuits, the corresponding data analyses are challenged by MRI artifacts, including image blur- ring, image distortions, low SNR, and restricted coverage. These challenges often result in insufficient performance accuracy of conventional analysis pipelines. Here we introduce a new software suite that is specifically designed for layer-specific functional MRI: LAYNII. This toolbox is a collection of command- line executable programs written in C/C++ and is distributed open-source and as pre-compiled binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS. LAYNII is designed for layer-fMRI data that suffer from SNR and coverage constraints and thus cannot be straightforwardly analysed in alternative software packages. Some of the most popular programs of LAYNII contain layerification and columnarization in the native voxel space of functional data as well as many other layer-fMRI specific analysis tasks: layer- specific smoothing, vein-removal of GE-BOLD data, quality assessment of artifact dominated sub-millimeter fMRI, as well as analyses of VASO data

Throughout the nervous system, the convergence of two or more presynaptic inputs on a target cell is commonly observed. The question we ask here is to what extent converging inputs influence each other's structural and functional synaptic plasticity. In complex circuits, isolating individual inputs is difficult because postsynaptic cells can receive thousands of inputs. An ideal model to address this question is the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction where each postsynaptic muscle cell receives inputs from two glutamatergic types of motor neurons (MNs), known as 1b and 1s MNs. Notably, each muscle is unique and receives input from a different combination of 1b and 1s motor neurons. We surveyed synapses on multiple muscles for this reason. Here, we identified a cell-specific promoter to ablate 1s MNs after innervation. Additionally, we genetically blocked 1s innervation. Then we measured 1b MN structural and functional responses using electrophysiology and microscopy. For all muscles, 1s MN ablation resulted in 1b MN synaptic expansion and increased basal neurotransmitter release. This demonstrates that 1b MNs can compensate for the loss of convergent inputs. However, only a subset of 1b MNs showed compensatory evoked activity, suggesting spontaneous and evoked plasticity are independently regulated. Finally, we used DIP- mutants that block 1s MN synaptic contacts; this eliminated robust 1b synaptic plasticity, raising the possibility that muscle co-innervation may define an activity 'set point' that is referenced when subsequent synaptic perturbations occur. This model can be tested in more complex circuits to determine if co-innervation is fundamental for input-specific plasticity.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The present series of studies examine the impact of systemically administered therapeutics on peripheral nerve injury (males; unilateral sciatic chronic constriction injury [CCI])‐induced suppression of voluntary wheel running, across weeks after dosing cessation. Following CCI, active phase running distance and speed are suppressed throughout the 7‐week observation period. A brief course of morphine, however, increased active phase running distance and speed throughout this same period, an effect apparent only in sham rats. For CCI rats, systemic co‐administration of morphine with antagonists of either P2X7 (A438079) or TLR4 ((+)‐naloxone) (receptors critical to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and consequent inflammatory cascades) returned running behavior of CCI rats to that of shams through 5+ weeks after dosing ceased. This is a striking difference in effect compared to our prior CCI allodynia results using systemic morphine plus intrathecal delivery of these same antagonists, wherein a sustained albeit partial suppression of neuropathic pain was observed. This may point to actions of the systemic drugs at multiple sites along the neuraxis, modulating injury‐induced, inflammasome‐mediated effects at the injured sciatic nerve and/or dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and potentially higher levels. Given that our data to date point to morphine amplifying neuroinflammatory processes put into motion by nerve injury, it is intriguing to speculate that co‐administration of TLR4 and/or P2X7 antagonists can intervene in these inflammatory processes in a beneficial way. That is, that systemic administration of such compounds may suppress inflammatory damage at multiple sites, rapidly and persistently returning neuropathic animals to sham levels of response.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is a medial temporal lobe structure in the brain and is widely studied for its role in memory and learning, in particular, spacial memory and emotional responses. It was thought to be a homogenous structure but emerging evidence shows differentiation along the dorsoventral axis and even microdomains for functional and cellular markers. We have examined in two cell‐types of the hippocampal projection neurons, the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons, if the GABA‐activated tonic current density varied between the dorsal (septal) and the ventral (temporal) poles of the male mouse hippocampus. Tonic synaptic currents, arising from spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC, mIPSC), and extrasynaptic tonic currents were evaluated. The results revealed different levels of sIPSC but not mIPSC density between the dorsal and ventral hippocampal neurons for both the DG granule cells and the CA3 pyramidal neurons. The extrasynaptic tonic current density was larger in the DG granule cells as compared to the CA3 pyramidal neurons but did not vary between the dorsal and ventral regions. IPSC bursting was observed in both cell‐types in the ventral hippocampus but was more common in the CA3 pyramidal neurons. Only in the dorsal DG granule cells was the level of the sIPSC and mIPSC density similar. The results indicate that the tonic GABAergic inhibition is particularly strong in the ventral hippocampal DG granule cells and enhanced in the dorsal as compared to the ventral hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons.</p>

A recent paper by Carter et al. identifies a novel organelle, the ribosome-associated vesicle (RAV), that might serve as a portable, local factory for producing proteins destined for the secretory pathway. The appearance of RAVs in dendrites suggests they may serve to generate membrane and secreted proteins in distal processes.

Absolute pitch (AP) refers to the ability of identifying the pitch of a given tone without reliance on any reference pitch. The downside of possessing AP may be the experience of disturbance when exposed to out-of-tune tones. Here, we investigated this so-far unexplored phenomenon in AP, which we refer to as auditory aversion. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in a sample of AP possessors and matched control musicians without AP while letting them perform a task underlying a so-called affective priming paradigm: Participants judged valenced pictures preceded by musical primes as quickly and accurately as possible. The primes were bimodal, presented as tones in combination with visual notations that either matched or mismatched the actually presented tone. Regardless of the prime condition, AP possessors performed more poorly in judging pleasant pictures and their EEG revealed later peaks at around 200 ms (P200) after prime onset. Their performance dropped when responding to pleasant pictures preceded by incongruent primes, especially when mistuned by one semitone. This interference was also reflected in an EEG deflection at around 400 ms (N400) after picture onset, preceding the behavior responses. These findings suggest that AP possessors process mistuned musical stimuli and pleasant pictures as affectively unrelated with each other, supporting an aversion towards out-of-tune tones in AP possessors. The longer prime-related P200 latencies exhibited by AP possessors suggest a delay in integrating musical stimuli, underlying an altered affinity towards pitch-label associations.

Excitatory inputs arriving at the dendrites of a neuron can engage active mechanisms that nonlinearly amplify the depolarizing currents. Interneuron-mediated inhibition can modulate this active process, in a subtype-dependent manner. For example, dendrite-targeting inhibition is hypothesized to increase the amplitude of synaptic input required to activate voltage-dependent nonlinear synaptic integration. To examine how inhibition influences active synaptic integration, we optogenetically manipulated the activity of two different subtypes of interneurons: dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SOM) and perisomatic-targeting parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons. In acute slices of mouse primary visual cortex, electrical stimulation evoked nonlinear synaptic integration that depended on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Optogenetic activation of SOM neurons in conjunction with electrical stimulation resulted in predominantly divisive inhibitory gain control, reducing the magnitude of the nonlinear response without affecting its threshold. PV activation, on the other hand, had a minimal effect on dendritic nonlinearities, resulting in a small subtractive effect. Furthermore, we found that mutual inhibition among SOM interneurons was strong and more prevalent than previously thought, while mutual inhibition among PV interneurons was minimal. These results challenge previous models of inhibitory modulation of active synaptic integration. The major effect of SOM inhibition is not a shift in threshold for activation of nonlinear integration, but rather a decrease the amplitude of the nonlinear response.

As the human brain transforms incoming sounds, it remains unclear whether semantic meaning is assigned via distributed, domain-general architectures or specialized hierarchical streams. Here we show that the spatiotemporal progression from acoustic to semantically dominated representations is consistent with a hierarchical processing scheme. Combining magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns, we found superior temporal responses beginning ~80 ms post-stimulus onset, spreading to extratemporal cortices by ~130 ms. Early acoustically-dominated representations trended systematically toward semantic category dominance over time (after ~200 ms) and space (beyond primary cortex). Semantic category representation was spatially specific: vocalizations were preferentially distinguished in temporal and frontal voice-selective regions and the fusiform face area; scene and object sounds were distinguished in parahippocampal and medial place areas. Our results are consistent with an extended auditory processing hierarchy in which acoustic representations give rise to multiple streams specialized by category, including areas typically considered visual cortex.

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane glycoprotein central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) with functions in brain development and plasticity, including in neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) are well described neurotrophic and neuromodulator EGFR ligands, both implicated in neurological disorders like Schizophrenia and AD. Here we show that APP interacts with these two EGFR ligands and characterize the effects of APP-EGF interaction in ERK activation and neuritogenesis. HB-EGF was identified as a novel APP interactor in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library. Yeast co-transformation and co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed APP interaction with HB-EGF. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation also revealed that APP binds to cellular pro-EGF. Overexpression of HB-EGF in HeLa cells, or exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to EGF, both resulted in increased APP protein levels. EGF and APP were also observed to synergistically activate the ERK signaling pathway, crucial for early neuronal differentiation. Immunofluorescence analysis of cellular neuritogenesis in conditions of APP overexpression and EGF exposure, confirmed a synergistic effect in promoting the number and the mean length of neurite-like processes per cell. Synergistic ERK activation and neuritogenic effects were completely blocked by the EGFR inhibitor PD 168393, implying EGF-induced activation of EGFR as part of the mechanism. This work shows novel APP protein interactors and provides a major insight into the APP-driven mechanisms underlying neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation, with potential relevance for AD and for adult neuroregeneration.

Brain atlases have proven to be valuable neuroscience tools for localizing regions of interest and performing statistical inferences on populations. Although many human brain atlases exist, most do not contain information about white matter structures, often neglecting them completely or labelling all white matter as a single homogenous substrate. While few white matter atlases do exist based on diffusion MRI fiber tractography, they are often limited to descriptions of white matter as spatially separate "regions" rather than as white matter "bundles" or fascicles, which are well-known to overlap throughout the brain. Additional limitations include small sample sizes, few white matter pathways, and the use of outdated diffusion models and techniques. Here, we present a new population-based collection of white matter atlases represented in both volumetric and surface coordinates in a standard space. These atlases are based on 2443 subjects, and include 216 white matter bundles derived from 6 different state-of-the-art tractography techniques. This atlas is freely available and will be a useful resource for parcellation and segmentation.

How the task-based intrinsic neural timescale is shaped by resting state's spatial topography especially the recently established core-periphery hierarchy (with the default-mode network (DMN) at the core and sensory networks at the periphery) remains an open issue. Using MEG data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we investigated the intrinsic neural timescales by measuring the autocorrelation window in short (ACW-50) and, introducing a novel variant, long (ACW-0) windows in various networks following core-periphery hierarchy. We demonstrate longer ACW-50 and ACW-0 in networks located at the core, i.e., DMN, frontoparietal network, and cingulum-operculum network, during both rest and task states. While networks at the periphery, i.e., auditory, visual, and somatomotor networks, exhibit shorter ACW-50 and ACW-0. Comparing both ACW scales during rest and task, i.e., rest-task difference revealed task- and network-specific effects. That is complemented by strong correlation of both ACW scales in rest with their counterpart during task states, following again the core-periphery hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate that the longer window (ACW-0) exhibits better prediction in classifying a region's time window as belonging to either core or periphery. Overall, our findings provide fundamental insight into how the human cortex's temporal hierarchy of intrinsic neural timescales converges with spatial topography, the core-periphery hierarchy.

Circadian clocks orchestrate daily rhythms in organismal physiology and behavior to promote optimal performance and fitness. In Drosophila, key pacemaker proteins PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) are progressively phosphorylated to perform phase-specific functions. Whereas PER phosphorylation has been extensively studied, systematic analysis of site-specific TIM phosphorylation is lacking. Here, we identified phosphorylation sites of PER-bound TIM by mass spectrometry, given the importance of TIM as a modulator of PER function in the oscillator. Among the twelve TIM phosphorylation sites we identified, at least two of them are critical for circadian timekeeping as mutants expressing non-phosphorylatable mutations exhibit altered behavioral rhythms. In particular, we observed that CK2-dependent phosphorylation of TIM(S1404) promotes nuclear accumulation of PER-TIM heterodimers by inhibiting the interaction of TIM and nuclear export component, Exportin 1 (XPO1). We postulate that proper level of nuclear PER-TIM accumulation is necessary to facilitate kinase recruitment for the regulation of daily phosphorylation rhythm and phase-specific transcriptional activity of CLOCK (CLK). Our results highlight the contribution of phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export of PER-TIM heterodimers to the maintenance of circadian periodicity and identify a new mechanism by which the negative elements of the circadian oscillator (PER-TIM) regulate the positive elements (CLK-CYC). Finally, since the molecular phenotype of tim(S1404A) non-phosphorylatable mutant exhibits remarkable similarity to that of a mutation in human timeless that underlies Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS), our results revealed an unexpected parallel between the functions of Drosophila and human TIM and may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying human FASPS.

High-resolution electron microscopy (EM) of nervous systems enables the reconstruction of neural circuits at the level of individual synaptic connections. However, for invertebrates, such as Drosophila melanogaster, it has so far been unclear whether the phenotype of neurons or synapses alone is sufficient to predict specific functional properties such as neurotransmitter identity. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster artificial convolutional neural networks can confidently predict the type of neurotransmitter released at a synaptic site from EM images alone. The network successfully discriminates between six types of neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine) with an average accuracy of 87% for individual synapses and 94% for entire neurons, assuming each neuron expresses only one neurotransmitter. This result is surprising as there are often no obvious cues in the EM images that human observers can use to predict neurotransmitter identity. We apply the proposed method to quantify whether, similar to the ventral nervous system (VNS), all hemilineages in the Drosophila melanogaster brain express only one fast acting transmitter within their neurons. To test this principle, we predict the neurotransmitter identity of all identified synapses in 89 hemilineages in the Drosophila melanogaster adult brain. While the majority of our predictions show homogeneity of fast-acting neurotransmitter identity within a single hemilineage, we identify a set of hemilineages that express two fast-acting neurotransmitters with high statistical significance. As a result, our predictions are inconsistent with the hypothesis that all neurons within a hemilineage express the same fast-acting neurotransmitter in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster.

The parahippocampus-hippocampus complex in the mesiotemporal lobe (MTL) is implicated in many different cognitive processes, is compromised in numerous disorders, and exhibits a unique cytoarchitectural transition from six-layered isocortex to three-layered allocortex. Our study leveraged an ultra-high-resolution histological reconstruction of a human brain to (i) develop a continuous surface model of the MTL iso-to-allocortex transition and (ii) quantitatively characterise the region's cytoarchitecture. We projected the model into the native space of in vivo functional magnetic resonance imaging of healthy adults to (iii) construct a generative model of its intrinsic circuitry and (iv) determine its relationship with distributed functional dynamics of macroscale isocortical fluctuations. We provide evidence that the most prominent axis of cytoarchitectural differentiation of the MTL follows infolding from iso-to-allocortex and is defined by depth-specific variations in neuron density. Intrinsic effective connectivity exhibited a more complex relationship to MTL geometry, varying across both iso-to-allocortical and anterior-posterior axes. Variation along the long axis of the MTL was associated with differentiation between transmodal and unimodal systems, with anterior regions linked to transmodal cortex. In contrast, the iso-to-allocortical gradient was associated with the multiple demand system, with isocortex linked to regions activated when task demands prohibit the use of prior knowledge. Our findings establish a novel model of the MTL, in which its broad influence on neural function emerges through the combination micro- and macro-scale structural features.

Increasing levels of migration and constant redefinition of a 'sense of belonging' characterize modern societies. Thus, social perception of people from different ethnicities as in-group or out-group members is influenced by a shared culture that might go beyond ethnicity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we aim to study how sharing a common culture changes the social perceptions of in-groups and out-groups. We presented same- and different-race faces to young adults living in an integrated multicultural society. Same- and different-race faces were primed by images of environmental context that promotes identification with the participants' ethnicity or a common shared culture. We found that same and different-race faces recruit similar brain networks only when associated with an environmental context, which promoted identification with a common shared culture. These results support a possible emergent phenomenon in multicultural societies that we call enlarged multi-ethnic in-group effect, which may form the basis of a potential new way to categorize oneself and others in terms of membership.

Brain injury affecting the isocortical frontal cortex is a common pathological occurrence. Many patients report severe deficits to functions of daily living. However, there is a variable degree of motor recovery that occurs with some individuals recovering astounding degrees of motor recovery while others have not. This variability has led researchers into investigating the possible mechanisms for this variability. Recently, several non-human primate studies have shed light on the possibility of spared, ipsilesional motor area taken over the lost function to the damaged cortex. Unfortunately, these studies have focused on long-term adaption ranging from 5months to one year post injury. In this present study, we are the first use rigorous stereological quantification to show that significant neuroplastic changes in the form of changes to neuroanatomical connections between distant cortical area occurs at a very early time point of 4 weeks post injury. Much like the Dancause study in 2005, we found that ishemic damage to the distal forelimb area (DFL) of the primary motor cortex (M1) induced plastic changes between the DFL of the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and area 1/2 of the somatosensory cortex. Indeed, we found a nearly 2 fold increase in the number of boutons between PMV and area 1/2. Additionally, labeled fibers from PMv change direction from their normal termination within M1 and traveled in a ventral posterior direction toward the somatosensory cortex. Also of interest, several labeled fibers actually traveled through the glial scar of M1 toward the somatosensory cortex. These data demonstrate that a massive neuroplastic response has occurred following an ischemic insult to the DFL of M1. These data may suggest that the brain may be undergoing an attempt to re-establish a degree of motor and or sensory control to compensate for the lost function due to the injury.

Spike-frequency adaptation is a prominent feature of spiking neurons. Using a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model, we studied adaptation originating from the Na,K-ATPase electrogenic pump and its evolution in presence of a medium-duration calcium-dependent potassium channel. We found that the Na,K-ATPase induces spike-frequency adaptation with a time constant of up to a few seconds and interacts with the calcium-dependent potassium current through the output frequency, yielding a very typical pattern of instantaneous frequencies. Because channels responsible for spike-frequency adaptation can interact with each other, our results suggest that their meaningful time courses and parameters can be difficult to measure experimentally. To circumvent this problem, we developed a simple phenomenological model that captures the interaction between currents and allows the direct evaluation of the underlying biophysical parameters directly from the frequency vs. current curves. Finally, we found that for weak stimulations, the pump induces phasic spiking and linearly converts the stimulus amplitude in a finite number of spikes acting like an inhibitory spike-counter. Our results point to the importance of considering interacting currents involved in spike-frequency adaptation collectively rather than as isolated elements and underscore the importance of sodium as a messenger for long-term signal integration in neurons. Within this context, we propose that the Na,K-ATPase plays an important role and show how to recover relevant biological parameters from adapting channels using simple electrophysiological measurements.

Cortical injuries (e.g. strokes or traumatic brain injuries) can create a host of secondary events that further impair the brain's sensory, motor, or cognitive capabilities. Here, we attempted to isolate the acute effects of the primary injury, i.e., the loss of cortical activity, on rodent motor cortex (caudal forelimb area, CFA) without the secondary effects that arise from damage to cortical tissue. We then observed the effects of this loss of activity on the rodent premotor cortex (rostral forelimb area, RFA). In anesthetized rats, CFA was temporarily inactivated with the GABA-A agonist muscimol, disrupting motor network function while leaving neural connectivity intact. Using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) techniques, we found that CFA inactivation completely abolished ICMS-evoked forelimb movement from RFA yet spared some CFA evoked-movement. Neural recordings confirmed that neural suppression by muscimol was isolated to CFA and did not spread into RFA. We next observed how CFA inactivation suppressed RFA influence on forelimb muscles by obtaining intramuscular electromyographical (EMG) recordings from forelimb muscles during ICMS. EMG recordings showed that despite the presence of evoked movement in CFA, but not RFA, muscle activation in both areas were similarly reduced. These results suggest that the primary reason for the loss of ICMS-evoked movement in RFA is not reduced forelimb muscle activity, but rather a loss of the specific activity between RFA and CFA. Therefore, within the intact motor network of the rat, RFA's influence on forelimb movement is mediated by CFA, similar to the premotor and motor organization observed in non-human primates.

Helping a friend move house, donating to charity, volunteering assistance during a crisis. Humans and other species alike regularly undertake prosocial behaviors—actions that benefit others without necessarily helping ourselves. But how does the brain learn what acts are prosocial? Basile and colleagues show that removal of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) prevents monkeys from learning what actions are prosocial but does not stop them carrying out previously learned prosocial behaviors. This highlights that the ability to learn what actions are prosocial and choosing to perform helpful acts may be distinct cognitive processes, with only the former depending on ACC.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZkflowchtXg" width="1" />

A key feature of most social relationships is that we like seeing good things happen to others. Research has implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in attaching value to social outcomes. For example, single neurons in macaque ACC selectively code reward delivery to the self, a partner, both monkeys, or neither monkey. Here, we assessed whether the ACC’s contribution to social cognition is causal by testing rhesus monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) on a vicarious reinforcement task before and after they sustained ACC lesions. Prior to surgery, actors learned that 3 different visual cues mapped onto 3 distinct reward outcomes: to self (“Self”), to the other monkey (“Other”), or to neither monkey (“Neither”). On each trial, actors saw a cue that predicted one of the 3 juice offers and could accept the offer by making a saccade to a peripheral target or reject the offer by breaking fixation. Preoperatively, all 6 actors displayed prosocial preferences, indicated by their greater tendency to give reward to Other relative to Neither. Half then received selective, bilateral, excitotoxic lesions of the ACC, and the other half served as unoperated controls. After surgery, all monkeys retained the social preferences they had demonstrated with the preoperatively learned cues, but this preference was reduced in the monkeys with ACC lesions. Critically, none of the monkeys in the ACC lesion group acquired social preferences with a new set of cues introduced after surgery. These data indicate that the primate ACC is necessary for acquisition of prosocial preferences from vicarious reinforcement.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3igHUMWRxWg" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Melanin‐concentrating hormone (MCH) is a ubiquitous vertebrate neuropeptide predominantly synthesized by neurons of the diencephalon that can act through two G protein‐coupled receptors, called MCHR1 and MCHR2. The expression of <i>Mchr1 </i> has been investigated in both rats and mice, but its synthesis remains poorly described. After identifying an antibody that detects MCHR1 with high specificity, we employed immunohistochemistry to map the distribution of MCHR1 in the CNS of rats and mice. Multiple neurochemical markers were also employed to characterize some of the neuronal populations that synthesize MCHR1. Our results show that MCHR1 is abundantly found in a subcellular structure called the primary <i>cilium </i>, which has been associated, among other functions, with the detection of free neurochemical messengers present in the extracellular space. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in a wide range of areas, including the olfactory bulb, cortical mantle, <i>striatum </i>, hippocampal formation, amygdala, midline thalamic nuclei, periventricular hypothalamic nuclei, midbrain areas, and in the spinal cord. No differences were observed between male and female mice, and interspecies differences were found in the caudate‐putamen nucleus and the subgranular zone. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in close association with several neurochemical markers, including tyrosine hydroxylase, calretinin, kisspeptin, estrogen receptor, oxytocin, vasopressin, and corticotropin‐releasing factor. Given the role of neuronal primary <i>cilia </i> in sensing free neurochemical messengers in the extracellular fluid, the widespread distribution of ciliary MCHR1, and the diverse neurochemical populations who synthesize MCHR1, our data indicate that nonsynaptic communication plays a prominent role in the normal function of the MCH system.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescents with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) exhibit mood and cognitive deficits, which may result from injury to the basal ganglia structures, including the caudate nuclei. However, the integrity of the caudate in SVHD adolescents is unclear. Our aim was to examine the global and regional caudate volumes, and evaluate the relationships between caudate volumes and cognitive and mood scores in SVHD and healthy adolescents. We acquired two high‐resolution T1‐weighted images from 23 SVHD and 37 controls using a 3.0‐Tesla MRI scanner, as well as assessed mood (Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 [PHQ‐9]; Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) and cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]; Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning–2; General Memory Index [GMI]) functions. Both left and right caudate nuclei were outlined, which were then used to calculate and compare volumes between groups using ANCOVA (covariates: age, gender, and head‐size), as well as perform 3D surface morphometry. Partial correlations (covariates: age, gender, and head‐size) were used to examine associations between caudate volumes, cognition, and mood scores in SVHD and controls. SVHD subjects showed significantly higher PHQ‐9 and BAI scores, indicating more depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as reduced GMI scores, suggesting impaired cognition, compared to controls. SVHD patients showed significantly reduced caudate volumes (left, 3,198.8 ± 490.1 vs. 3,605.0 ± 480.4 mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.004; right, 3,162.1 ± 475.4 vs. 3,504.8 ± 465.9 mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.011) over controls, and changes were localized in the rostral, mid‐dorsolateral, and caudal areas. Significant negative correlations emerged between caudate volumes with PHQ‐9 and BAI scores and positive correlations with GMI and MoCA scores in SVHD and controls. SVHD adolescents show significantly reduced caudate volumes, especially in sites that have projections to regulate mood and cognition, which may result from developmental and/or hypoxia‐/ischemia‐induced processes.</p>

<p>In this paper, we show that although the minimizers of cross-entropy and
related classification losses are off at infinity, network weights learned by
gradient flow converge in direction, with an immediate corollary that network
predictions, training errors, and the margin distribution also converge. This
proof holds for deep homogeneous networks -- a broad class of networks allowing
for ReLU, max pooling, linear, and convolutional layers -- and we additionally
provide empirical support not just close to the theory (e.g., the AlexNet), but
also on non-homogeneous networks (e.g., the ResNet). If the network further has
locally Lipschitz gradients, we show that these gradients converge in
direction, and asymptotically align with the gradient flow path, with
consequences on margin maximization. Our analysis complements and is distinct
from the well-known neural tangent and mean-field theories, and in particular
makes no requirements on network width and initialization, instead merely
requiring perfect classification accuracy. The proof proceeds by developing a
theory of unbounded nonsmooth Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequalities for functions
definable in an o-minimal structure, and is also applicable outside deep
learning.

<p>Pruning is a legitimate method for reducing the size of a neural network to
fit in low SWaP hardware, but the networks must be trained and pruned offline.
We propose an algorithm, Artificial Neurogenesis (ANG), that grows rather than
prunes the network and enables neural networks to be trained and executed in
low SWaP embedded hardware. ANG accomplishes this by using the training data to
determine critical connections between layers before the actual training takes
place. Our experiments use a modified LeNet-5 as a baseline neural network that
achieves a test accuracy of 98.74% using a total of 61,160 weights. An ANG
grown network achieves a test accuracy of 98.80% with only 21,211 weights.

<p>One of the most challenging problems in evolutionary computation is to select
from its family of diverse solvers one that performs well on a given problem.
This algorithm selection problem is complicated by the fact that different
phases of the optimization process require different search behavior. While
this can partly be controlled by the algorithm itself, there exist large
differences between algorithm performance. It can therefore be beneficial to
swap the configuration or even the entire algorithm during the run. Long deemed
impractical, recent advances in Machine Learning and in exploratory landscape
analysis give hope that this dynamic algorithm configuration~(dynAC) can
eventually be solved by automatically trained configuration schedules. With
this work we aim at promoting research on dynAC, by introducing a simpler
variant that focuses only on switching between different algorithms, not
configurations. Using the rich data from the Black Box Optimization
Benchmark~(BBOB) platform, we show that even single-switch dynamic Algorithm
selection (dynAS) can potentially result in significant performance gains. We
also discuss key challenges in dynAS, and argue that the BBOB-framework can
become a useful tool in overcoming these.

<p>Prisoner's Dilemma mainly treat the choice to cooperate or defect as an
atomic action. We propose to study online learning algorithm behavior in the
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game, where we explored the full spectrum of
reinforcement learning agents: multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits and
reinforcement learning. We have evaluate them based on a tournament of iterated
prisoner's dilemma where multiple agents can compete in a sequential fashion.
This allows us to analyze the dynamics of policies learned by multiple
self-interested independent reward-driven agents, and also allows us study the
capacity of these algorithms to fit the human behaviors. Results suggest that
considering the current situation to make decision is the worst in this kind of
social dilemma game. Multiples discoveries on online learning behaviors and
clinical validations are stated.

<p>Generalized linear models are one of the most efficient paradigms for
predicting the correlated stochastic activity of neuronal networks in response
to external stimuli, with applications in many brain areas. However, when
dealing with complex stimuli, their parameters often do not generalize across
different stimulus statistics, leading to degraded performance and blowup
instabilities. Here, we develop a two-step inference strategy that allows us to
train robust generalized linear models of interacting neurons, by explicitly
separating the effects of stimulus correlations and noise correlations in each
training step. Applying this approach to the responses of retinal ganglion
cells to complex visual stimuli, we show that, compared to classical methods,
the models trained in this way exhibit improved performance, are more stable,
yield robust interaction networks, and generalize well across complex visual
statistics. The method can be extended to deep convolutional neural networks,
leading to models with high predictive accuracy for both the neuron firing
rates and their correlations.

<p>We introduce the novel concept of anti-transfer learning for neural networks.
While standard transfer learning assumes that the representations learned in
one task will be useful for another task, anti-transfer learning avoids
learning representations that have been learned for a different task, which is
not relevant and potentially misleading for the new task and should be ignored.
Examples of such tasks are style vs content recognition or pitch vs timbre from
audio. By penalizing similarity between the second network and the previously
learned features, co-incidental correlations between the target and the
unrelated task can be avoided, yielding more reliable representations and
better performance on the target task. We implemented anti-transfer learning
with different similarity metrics and aggregation functions. We evaluate the
approach in the audio domain with different tasks and setups, using four
datasets in total. The results show that anti-transfer learning consistently
improves accuracy in all test cases, proving that it can push the network to
learn more representative features for the task at hand.

<p>In this work, we develop efficient disruptions of black-box image translation
deepfake generation systems. We are the first to demonstrate black-box deepfake
generation disruption by presenting image translation formulations of attacks
initially proposed for classification models. Nevertheless, a naive adaptation
of classification black-box attacks results in a prohibitive number of queries
for image translation systems in the real-world. We present a frustratingly
simple yet highly effective algorithm Leaking Universal Perturbations (LUP),
that significantly reduces the number of queries needed to attack an image. LUP
consists of two phases: (1) a short leaking phase where we attack the network
using traditional black-box attacks and gather information on successful
attacks on a small dataset and (2) and an exploitation phase where we leverage
said information to subsequently attack the network with improved efficiency.
Our attack reduces the total number of queries necessary to attack GANimation
and StarGAN by 30%.

<p>The endocannabinoid system (ECS) acts as a negative feedback mechanism to suppress synaptic transmission and plays a major role in a diverse range of brain functions including, for example, the regulation of mood, energy balance, and learning and memory. The function and dysfunction of the ECS are strongly implicated in multiple psychiatric, neurological, and neurodegenerative diseases. Cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in the brain and, as for any synaptic receptor, CB1R needs to be in the right place at the right time to respond appropriately to changing synaptic circumstances. While CB1R is found intracellularly throughout neurons, its surface expression is highly polarized to the axonal membrane, consistent with its functional expression at presynaptic sites. Surprisingly, despite the importance of CB1R, the interacting proteins and molecular mechanisms that regulate the highly polarized distribution and function of CB1R remain relatively poorly understood. Here we set out what is currently known about the trafficking pathways and protein interactions that underpin the surface expression and axonal polarity of CB1R, and highlight key questions that still need to be addressed.</p>

<p>Physical or psychological stress can cause an immunologic imbalance that disturbs the central nervous system followed by neuroinflammation. The association between inflammation and depression has been widely studied in recent years, though the molecular mechanism is still largely unknown. Thus, targeting the signaling pathways that link stress to neuroinflammation might be a useful strategy against depression. The current study investigated the protective effect of melatonin against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and depression. Our results showed that LPS treatment significantly induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Moreover, LPS-treatment enhanced oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β, NF-κB phosphorylation, and glial cell activation markers including GFAP and Iba-1 in the brain of mice. Melatonin treatment significantly abolished the effect of LPS, as indicated by improved depressive-like behaviors, reduced cytokines level, reduced oxidative stress, and normalized LPS-altered Sirt1, Nrf2, and HO-1 expression. However, the melatonin protective effects were reduced after luzindole administration. Collectively, it is concluded that melatonin receptor-dependently protects against LPS-induced depressive-like behaviors via counteracting LPS-induced neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>This review focuses on the purinergic ionotropic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) as a potential target for developing drugs that delay the onset and/or disease progression in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Description of clinical and genetic ALS features is followed by an analysis of advantages and drawbacks of transgenic mouse models of disease based on mutations in a bunch of proteins, particularly Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), TAR-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43), Fused in Sarcoma/Translocated in Sarcoma (FUS), and Chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72). Though of limited value, these models are however critical to study the proof of concept of new compounds, before reaching clinical trials. The authors also provide a description of ALS pathogenesis including protein aggregation, calcium-dependent excitotoxicity, dysfunction of calcium-binding proteins, ultrastructural mitochondrial alterations, disruption of mitochondrial calcium handling, and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Understanding disease pathogenic pathways may ease the identification of new drug targets. Subsequently, neuroinflammation linked with P2X7Rs in ALS pathogenesis is described in order to understand the rationale of placing the use of P2X7R antagonists as a new therapeutic pharmacological approach to ALS. This is the basis for the hypothesis that a P2X7R blocker could mitigate the neuroinflammatory state, indirectly leading to neuroprotection and higher motoneuron survival in ALS patients.</p>

<p>Background: The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients is highly dependent on the precise localization of the target structures such as subthalamic nucleus (STN). Most commonly, microelectrode single unit activity (SUA) recordings are performed to refine the target. This process is heavily experience based and can be technically challenging. Local field potentials (LFPs), representing the activity of a population of neurons, can be obtained from the same microelectrodes used for SUA recordings and allow flexible online processing with less computational complexity due to lower sampling rate requirements. Although LFPs have been shown to contain biomarkers capable of predicting patients’ symptoms and differentiating various structures, their use in the localization of the STN in the clinical practice is not prevalent.</p><p>Methods: Here we present, for the first time, a randomized and double-blinded pilot study with intraoperative online LFP processing in which we compare the clinical benefit from SUA- versus LFP-based implantation. Ten PD patients referred for bilateral STN-DBS were randomly implanted using either SUA or LFP guided targeting in each hemisphere. Although both SUA and LFP were recorded for each STN, the electrophysiologist was blinded to one at a time. Three months postoperatively, the patients were evaluated by a neurologist blinded to the intraoperative recordings to assess the performance of each modality. While SUA-based decisions relied on the visual and auditory inspection of the raw traces, LFP-based decisions were given through an online signal processing and machine learning pipeline.</p><p>Results: We found a dramatic agreement between LFP- and SUA-based localization (16/20 STNs) providing adequate clinical improvement (51.8% decrease in 3-month contralateral motor assessment scores), with LFP-guided implantation resulting in greater average improvement in the discordant cases (74.9%, n = 3 STNs). The selected tracks were characterized by higher activity in beta (11–32 Hz) and high-frequency (200–400 Hz) bands (p &lt; 0.01) of LFPs and stronger non-linear coupling between these bands (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Our pilot study shows equal or better clinical benefit with LFP-based targeting. Given the robustness of the electrode interface and lower computational cost, more centers can utilize LFP as a strategic feedback modality intraoperatively, in conjunction to the SUA-guided targeting.</p>

<p>Brand awareness plays an important role in most aspects of marketing. However, consumers’ cognitive process of brand awareness, which plays an important role in purchase decision or product usage experiences, is still unclear in the brain. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), the influences of two different brand awareness on consumers’ cognitive process was investigated. Phone pictures with high or low brand awareness and girl pictures were used to carry out this experiment research. An amended oddball task was designed in which girl photos were taken as target stimuli, and phone pictures were taken as non-target stimuli. Subjects were asked to identify the girl pictures. Smaller ERPs components N2 and P3 along with high brand awareness phone pictures were found compared to the low brand awareness ones. The amplitude variation in N2 and P3 indicated that the cognitive process of identification and attention distribution were changed along with the magnitude of brand awareness, which meant consumers could allocate different attention resources to distinguish high or low brand awareness product unconsciously. This may indicate the identification and attention distribution caused by brand awareness can be detected by N2 and P3, and event-related potentials methodology may be a sensitive measurement technique for brand awareness.</p>

<p>Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) improves functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and is the standard first-line treatment; however, it is associated with many complications, including cerebral hemorrhage. Cancer patients are susceptible to thrombotic events – collectively referred to as Trousseau syndrome (TS) – owing to their hypercoagulable state. Here, we describe the case of a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension for over 10 years who underwent surgery for removal of a cancer of lower esophagus, with no subsequent treatment. Three months later, he was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital with sudden dizziness and incoherent speech. Brain computed tomography revealed multiple cerebral infarctions. The patient was treated by IVT with tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) after the onset of symptoms, which improved by the end of the treatment. However, a few months later, he experienced a recurrence of cerebral infarction and hemorrhage, which has rarely been reported. The clinical course of this case suggests that the suitability of thrombolysis with rtPA in the acute phase of cerebral infarction complicated with TS should be carefully considered.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that vestibular migraine (VM) is a cerebral disease with recurrent vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is an effective type of physical therapy for minimizing vestibular symptoms, as it improves vestibular compensation in patients with VM. Currently, the cerebral regions that are associated with the pathogenesis of VM are largely unknown. To further understand the underlying mechanisms of VM, we performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after 1 month of VR in 14 patients with VM. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores were included as clinical outcomes. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was assessed to characterize spontaneous brain activity. The correlations between the clinical characteristics and ALFF values were assessed. After 1 month of VR training, the DHI scores in patients with VM were significantly lower than those at baseline (p = 0.03), as were the HAMA scores (p = 0.02). We also found that the ALFF values in the left posterior cerebellum of VM patients increased significantly after 1 month of VR training. Moreover, the ALFF values in the left cerebellum were inversely correlated with the patients’ DHI scores. Overall, this study showed that VR exercise for 1 month has a positive effect on vestibular symptoms in patients with VM. Asymmetric cerebellar hyperactivity might be a functional compensation for vestibular dysfunction in patients with VM.</p>

<p>Neural synchrony in the brain at rest is usually variable and intermittent, thus intervals of predominantly synchronized activity are interrupted by intervals of desynchronized activity. Prior studies suggested that this temporal structure of the weakly synchronous activity might be functionally significant: many short desynchronizations may be functionally different from few long desynchronizations even if the average synchrony level is the same. In this study, we used computational neuroscience methods to investigate the effects of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on the temporal patterns of synchronization in a simple model. We employed a small network of conductance-based model neurons that were connected via excitatory plastic synapses. The dynamics of this network was subjected to the time-series analysis methods used in prior experimental studies. We found that STDP could alter the synchronized dynamics in the network in several ways, depending on the time scale that plasticity acts on. However, in general, the action of STDP in the simple network considered here is to promote dynamics with short desynchronizations (i.e., dynamics reminiscent of that observed in experimental studies). Complex interplay of the cellular and synaptic dynamics may lead to the activity-dependent adjustment of synaptic strength in such a way as to facilitate experimentally observed short desynchronizations in the intermittently synchronized neural activity.</p>

<p>Striatal interneurons and spiny projection (SP) neurons are differentially tuned to spectral components of their input. Previous studies showed that spike responses of somatostatin/NPY-expressing low threshold spike (LTS) interneurons have broad frequency tuning, setting these cells apart from other striatal GABAergic interneurons and SP neurons. We investigated the mechanism of LTS interneuron spiking resonance and its relationship to non-spiking membrane impedance resonance, finding that abolition of impedance resonance did not alter spiking resonance. Because LTS interneurons are pacemakers whose rhythmic firing is perturbed by synaptic input, we tested the hypothesis that their spiking resonance arises from their phase resetting properties. Phase resetting curves (PRCs) were measured in LTS interneurons and SP neurons and used to make phase-oscillator models of both cell types. The models reproduced the broad tuning of LTS interneurons, and the differences from SP neurons. The spectral components of the PRC predicted each cell’s sensitivity to corresponding input frequencies. LTS interneuron PRCs contain larger high-frequency components than SP neuron PRCs, providing enhanced responses to input frequencies above the cells’ average firing rates. Thus, LTS cells can be entrained by input oscillations to which SP neurons are less responsive. These findings suggest that feedforward inhibition by LTS interneurons may regulate SP neurons’ entrainment by oscillatory afferents.</p>

<p>Somatosensation encompasses a variety of essential modalities including touch, pressure, proprioception, temperature, pain, and itch. These peripheral sensations are crucial for all types of behaviors, ranging from social interaction to danger avoidance. Somatosensory information is transmitted from primary afferent fibers in the periphery into the central nervous system via the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The dorsal horn functions as an intermediary processing center for this information, comprising a complex network of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons as well as projection neurons that transmit the processed somatosensory information from the spinal cord to the brain. It is now known that there can be dysfunction within this spinal cord circuitry in pathological pain conditions and that these perturbations contribute to the development and maintenance of pathological pain. However, the complex and heterogeneous network of the spinal dorsal horn has hampered efforts to further elucidate its role in somatosensory processing. Emerging optical techniques promise to illuminate the underlying organization and function of the dorsal horn and provide insights into the role of spinal cord sensory processing in shaping the behavioral response to somatosensory input that we ultimately observe. This review article will focus on recent advances in optogenetics and fluorescence imaging techniques in the spinal cord, encompassing findings from both in vivo and in vitro preparations. We will also discuss the current limitations and difficulties of employing these techniques to interrogate the spinal cord and current practices and approaches to overcome these challenges.</p>

<p>Dopaminergic neurons are located in several brain areas including the olfactory bulb (OB) and involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. In the OB, dopamine (DA) is released exclusively by a population of interneurons termed short axon cells (SACs) in the glomerular layer, the initial synaptic integration site of the whole olfactory system. SACs corelease GABA and extend their processes to many glomeruli forming the interglomerular circuit. Two major groups of DA receptors D1-like (D1LRs) and D2-like (D2LRs) types are differentially distributed in the OB, i.e., D1LRs are broadly present except the most superficial olfactory nerve (ON) layer while D2LRs are predominantly confined to the ON and glomerular layers, suggesting that they mediate different physiological functions. In contrast to the well-known D2LR-mediated presynaptic inhibition of ON terminals in the OB, the cellular and circuit targets of the D1LR-mediated DA actions remain unclear even though D1LR activation improves odor detection and discrimination. We recently demonstrated that endogenous DA released from SACs or exogenous DA excites a population of excitatory glomerular neurons termed external tufted cells (ETCs) via D1LRs. But the physiological significance of this D1LR activation is largely unknown. In the present study, we addressed these questions by a systematic examination of exogenous DA actions on synaptic activities and excitabilities in most glomerular neurons and OB output neurons with the following major findings: (1) DA via D1LRs enhances OB output by potentiating the ETC-mediated feedforward excitation to the OB output neurons but suppresses spontaneous excitatory synaptic activities in both types of inhibitory glomerular interneurons periglomerular (PGCs) and SACs; (2) this suppression of excitatory synaptic activities in PGCs and SACs depends on activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors; (3) DA via D1LRs augments spontaneous inhibitory synaptic activities in all glomerular neurons and OB output neurons; (4) DA selectively activates SACs via D1LRs. These findings suggest that activation of D1LRs elevates the system’s sensitivity to odor stimuli and provide a mechanistic basis for the functional roles of DA in modulating odor detection and discrimination.</p>

<p>Recent studies suggest that the cell-to-cell spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) plays important roles in the development of Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD patients who carry α-syn gene mutations often have an earlier onset and more severe clinical symptoms and pathology than sporadic PD cases who carry the wild-type (WT) α-syn gene. However, the molecular mechanism by which α-syn gene mutations promote PD remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that pathogenic mutations facilitate the intercellular transfer and cytotoxicity of α-syn, favoring an early disease onset and faster progression. We investigated the effects of eight known pathogenic mutations in human α-syn (A18T, A29S, A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D, A53E, and A53T) on its pathological transmission in terms of secretion, aggregation, intracellular level, cytotoxicity, seeding, and induction of neuroinflammation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, cultured rat neurons, and microglia, and the rat substantia nigra pars compacta. We found that 2 of the 8 mutations (H50Q and A53T) significantly increased α-syn secretion while 6 mutations (A18T, A29S, A30P, G51D, A53E, and E46K) tended to enhance it. In vitroα-syn aggregation experiments showed that H50Q promoted while G51D delayed aggregation most strongly. Interestingly, 3 mutations (E46K, H50Q, and G51D) greatly increased the intracellular α-syn level when cultured cells were treated with preformed α-syn fibrils (PFFs) compared with the WT, while the other 5 had no effect. We also demonstrated that H50Q, G51D, and A53T PFFs, but not E46K PFFs, efficiently seeded in vivo and acutely induced neuroinflammation in rat substantia nigra pars compacta. Our data indicate that pathogenic mutations augment the prion-like spread of α-syn at different steps and blockade of this pathogenic propagation may serve as a promising therapeutic intervention for PD.</p>

<p>Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an important modulatory peptide throughout the CNS acting as a neurotransmitter, neurotrophic or neuroprotective factor. In the hippocampus, a brain area implicated in learning and memory processes, VIP has a crucial role in the control of GABAergic transmission and pyramidal cell activity in response to specific network activity by either VIP-containing basket cells or interneuron-selective (IS) interneurons and this appears to have a differential impact in hippocampal-dependent cognition. At the cellular level, VIP regulates synaptic transmission by either promoting disinhibition, through activation of VPAC<sub>1</sub> receptors, or enhancing pyramidal cell excitability, through activation of VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptors. These actions also control several important synaptic plasticity phenomena such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). This paper reviews the current knowledge on the activation and multiple functions of VIP expressing cells in the hippocampus and their role in controlling synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory processes, discussing also the role of VPAC<sub>1</sub> and VPAC<sub>2</sub> VIP receptors in the regulation of these different processes. Furthermore, we address the current knowledge regarding changes in VIP mediated neurotransmission in epileptogenesis and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS), and discuss the therapeutic opportunities of using selective VIP receptor ligands to prevent epileptogenesis and cognitive decline in MTLE-HS.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic brain disorder characterized by progressive intellectual decline and memory and neuronal loss, caused mainly by extracellular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, primarily in areas implicated in memory and learning as prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. There are two forms of AD, a late-onset form that affects people over 65 years old, and the early-onset form, which is hereditable and affect people at early ages ~45 years. To date, there is no cure for the disease; consequently, it is essential to develop new tools for the study of processes implicated in the disease. Currently, in vitro AD three-dimensional (3D) models using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons have broadened the horizon for in vitro disease modeling and gained interest for mechanistic studies and preclinical drug discovery due to their potential advantages in providing a better physiologically relevant information and more predictive data for in vivo tests. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a 3D cell culture model of AD in vitro using iPSCs carrying the A246E mutation. We generated human iPSCs from fibroblasts from a patient with AD harboring the A246E mutation in the PSEN1 gene. Cell reprogramming was performed using lentiviral vectors with Yamanaka’s factors (OSKM: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). The resulting iPSCs expressed pluripotency genes (such as Nanog and Oct4), alkaline phosphatase activity, and pluripotency stem cell marker expression, such as OCT4, SOX2, TRA-1-60, and SSEA4. iPSCs exhibited the ability to differentiate into neuronal lineage in a 3D environment through dual SMAD inhibition as confirmed by Nestin, MAP2, and Tuj1 neural marker expression. These iPSC-derived neurons harbored Aβ oligomers confirmed by Western Blot (WB) and immunostaining. With human iPSC-derived neurons able to produce Aβ oligomers, we established a novel human hydrogel-based 3D cell culture model that recapitulates Aβ aggregation without the need for mutation induction or synthetic Aβ exposure. This model will allow the study of processes implicated in disease spread throughout the brain, the screening of molecules or compounds with therapeutic potential, and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Neuroscience is a relatively new and fashionable word that emerged in the 1950s in several countries, including the UK, to describe a multidisciplinary clinical and laboratory approach to the study of the brain, mind, and neuropsychiatric disorders. However collaborative study of neurological and psychiatric disorders can be traced to the 17th century with roots in antiquity. I describe the evolution of our understanding of epilepsy beginning with the first detailed clinical descriptions, associated with supernatural theories, in Babylonian medicine in the second millennium BC. Interest in natural causation arose in the Greco-Roman period when it was first suggested that “the sacred disease” was a disorder of the brain. However, this theory did not take root until the 17th and 18th centuries AD when epilepsy began to be separated from other “convulsive” diseases, including hysteria. In the 19th century developments in neuropathology and our understanding of cortical localization led to the much-debated separation of idiopathic from symptomatic epilepsy which continues to influence international classifications of seizures and epilepsies. Also in the 19th century, the concept of seizures as electrical discharges in the brain evolved, reinforced in the 20th century by the discovery of the electroencephalogram. For many reasons, people with epilepsy have experienced a high incidence of cognitive and psychosocial disorders. Epilepsy, which is a global problem, has, therefore, remained a bridge between neurology and psychiatry. Furthermore, the study of epilepsy continues to shed light on brain function and other neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Aging is associated with disruptions in the resting-state functional architecture of the brain. Previous studies have primarily focused on age-related declines in the default mode network (DMN) and its implications in Alzheimer’s disease. However, due to mixed findings, it is unclear if changes in resting-state network functional connectivity are linked to cognitive decline in healthy older adults. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of intra-network coherence for four higher-order cognitive resting-state networks on a sensitive measure of cognitive aging (i.e., NIH Toolbox Fluid Cognition Battery) in 154 healthy older adults with a mean age of 71 and education ranging between 12 years and 21 years (mean = 16). Only coherence within the cingulo-opercular network (CON) was significantly related to Fluid Cognition Composite scores, explaining more variance in scores than age and education. Furthermore, we mapped CON connectivity onto fluid cognitive subdomains that typically decline in advanced age. Greater CON connectivity was associated with better performance on episodic memory, attention, and executive function tasks. Overall, the present study provides evidence to propose CON coherence as a potential novel neural marker for nonpathological cognitive aging.</p>

<p>The regenerative capacity of injured peripheral nerves is diminished with aging. To identify factors that contribute to this impairment, we compared the immune cell response in young vs. aged animals following nerve injury. First, we confirmed that macrophage accumulation is delayed in aged injured nerves which is due to defects in monocyte migration as a result of defects in site-specific recruitment signals in the aged nerve. Interestingly, impairment in both macrophage accumulation and functional recovery could be overcome by transplanting bone marrow from aged animals into young mice. That is, upon exposure to a youthful environment, monocytes/macrophages originating from the aged bone marrow behaved similarly to young cells. Transcriptional profiling of aged macrophages following nerve injury revealed that both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes were largely downregulated in aged compared to young macrophages. One ligand of particular interest was macrophage-associated secreted protein (MCP1), which exhibited a potent role in regulating aged axonal regrowth in vitro. Given that macrophage-derived MCP1 is significantly diminished in the aged injured nerve, our data suggest that age-associated defects in MCP1 signaling could contribute to the regenerative deficits that occur in the aged nervous system.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the neural mechanisms of the contextual interference effect (CIE) and parameter similarity on motor learning in older adults. Sixty older adults (mean age, 67.68 ± 3.95 years) were randomly assigned to one of six experimental groups: blocked-similar, algorithm-similar, random-similar, blocked-dissimilar, algorithm-dissimilar, and random-dissimilar. Algorithm practice was a hybrid practice schedule (a combination of blocked, serial, and random practice) that switching between practice schedules were based on error trial number, ≤33%. The sequential motor task was used to record the absolute timing for the absolute timing goals (ATGs). In similar conditions, the participants’ performance was near ATGs (1,350, 1,500, 1,650 ms) and in dissimilar conditions, they performed far ATGs (1,050, 1,500, 1,950 ms) with the same spatial sequence for all groups. EEG signals were continuously collected during the acquisition phase and delayed retention. Data were analyzed in different bands (alpha and beta) and scalp locations (frontal: Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4; central: C3, C4; and parietal: P3, P4) with repeated measures on the last factor. The analyses were included motor preparation and intertrial interval (motor evaluation) periods in the first six blocks and the last six blocks, respectively. The results of behavioral data indicated that algorithm practice resulted in medium error related to classic blocked and random practice during the acquisition, however, algorithm practice outperformed the classic blocked and random practice in the delayed retention test. The results of EEG data demonstrated that algorithm practice, due to optimal activity in the frontal lobe (medium alpha and beta activation at prefrontal), resulted in increased activity of sensorimotor areas (high alpha activation at C3 and P4) in older adults. Also, EEG data showed that similar conditions could affect the intertrial interval period (medium alpha and beta activation in frontal in the last six-block), while the dissimilar conditions could affect the motor preparation period (medium alpha and beta activation in frontal in the first six-block). In conclusion, algorithm practice can enhance motor learning and optimize the efficiency of brain activity, resulting in the achievement of a desirable goal in older adults.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54097">A survey-based analysis of the academic job market</a></h4>

Many postdoctoral researchers apply for faculty positions knowing relatively little about the hiring process or what is needed to secure a job offer. To address this lack of knowledge about the hiring process we conducted a survey of applicants for faculty positions: the survey ran between May 2018 and May 2019, and received 317 responses. We analyzed the responses to explore the interplay between various scholarly metrics and hiring outcomes. We concluded that, above a certain threshold, the benchmarks traditionally used to measure research success – including funding, number of publications or journals published in – were unable to completely differentiate applicants with and without job offers. Respondents also reported that the hiring process was unnecessarily stressful, time-consuming, and lacking in feedback, irrespective of outcome. Our findings suggest that there is considerable scope to improve the transparency of the hiring process.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53247">Fatty acid β-oxidation is required for the differentiation of larval hematopoietic progenitors in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Cell-intrinsic and extrinsic signals regulate the state and fate of stem and progenitor cells. Recent advances in metabolomics illustrate that various metabolic pathways are also important in regulating stem cell fate. However, our understanding of the metabolic control of the state and fate of progenitor cells is in its infancy. Using <i>Drosophila</i> hematopoietic organ: lymph gland, we demonstrate that Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO) is essential for the differentiation of blood cell progenitors. In the absence of FAO, the progenitors are unable to differentiate and exhibit altered histone acetylation. Interestingly, acetate supplementation rescues both histone acetylation and the differentiation defects. We further show that the CPT1/whd (<i>withered</i>), the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, is transcriptionally regulated by Jun-Kinase (JNK), which has been previously implicated in progenitor differentiation. Our study thus reveals how the cellular signaling machinery integrates with the metabolic cue to facilitate the differentiation program.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) comprise a range of early age-onset neurodevelopment disorders with genetic heterogeneity. Most ASD related genes are involved in synaptic function, which is oppositely regulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF): the precursor proBDNF inhibits while mature BDNF (mBDNF) potentiates synapses. Here we generated a knock-in mouse line (BDNFmet/leu) in which the conversion of proBDNF to mBDNF is inhibited. Similar to other ASD mouse models, the BDNFmet/leu mice showed decreased brain volumes, reduced dendritic arborization, altered spines, and impaired synaptic transmission and plasticity. They also exhibited ASD-like phenotypes, including stereotypical behaviors, deficits in social interaction, hyperactivity, and elevated stress response. Interestingly, the plasma level of proBDNF, but not mBDNF, was significantly elevated in ASD patients. These results suggest that proBDNF level, but not Bdnf gene, is associated with autism-spectrum behaviors, and identify a potential blood marker and therapeutic target for ASD.

<p>by Lauren A. White, Sue VandeWoude, Meggan E. Craft</p>

Although movement ecology has leveraged models of home range formation to explore the effects of spatial heterogeneity and social cues on movement behavior, disease ecology has yet to integrate these potential drivers and mechanisms of contact behavior into a generalizable disease modeling framework. Here we ask how dynamic territory formation and maintenance might contribute to disease dynamics in a territorial, solitary predator for an indirectly transmitted pathogen. We developed a mechanistic individual-based model where stigmergy—the deposition of signals into the environment (e.g., scent marking, scraping)—dictates local movement choices and long-term territory formation, but also the risk of pathogen transmission. Based on a variable importance analysis, the length of the infectious period was the single most important variable in predicting outbreak success, maximum prevalence, and outbreak duration. Host density and rate of pathogen decay were also key predictors. We found that territoriality best reduced maximum prevalence in conditions where we would otherwise expect outbreaks to be most successful: slower recovery rates (i.e., longer infectious periods) and higher conspecific densities. However, for slower pathogen decay rates, stigmergy-driven movement increased outbreak durations relative to random movement simulations. Our findings therefore support a limited version of the “territoriality benefits” hypothesis—where reduced home range overlap leads to reduced opportunities for pathogen transmission, but with the caveat that reduction in outbreak severity may increase the likelihood of pathogen persistence. For longer infectious periods and higher host densities, key trade-offs emerged between the strength of pathogen load, the strength of the stigmergy cue, and the rate at which those two quantities decayed; this finding raises interesting questions about the evolutionary nature of these competing processes and the role of possible feedbacks between parasitism and territoriality. This work also highlights the importance of considering social cues as part of the movement landscape in order to better understand the consequences of individual behaviors on population level outcomes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hx7Ij3rh8bk" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Epidemiological data from the last decades point to an exponential growth in the number of obese people. Different behavioral factors, mainly associated with food consumption, appear to contribute significantly to its development. Concomitant with increased obesity rates, an increase in the consumption of fructose has been observed; therefore, fructose consumption has been implicated as an important obesogenic factor. However, changes in brain activity due to fructose consumption are possible, especially in relation to hypothalamic satiety mechanisms. In addition, the obese state may provide an environment of chronic inflammation and further contribute to the discontinuation of satiety mechanisms in the hypothalamus. We briefly review the intrinsic alterations to the increased adipose tissue, its connections with the hypothalamus in the control of energy signaling mechanisms and, consequently, the participation of fructose as a co‐adjuvant or trigger. Presenting the current context with clinical trials involving human and animal studies, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of the role of fructose in the progression of obesity.</p>

<p>A major part of the circuit that coordinates bladder voiding is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Storage and voiding of urine from the lower urinary tract (LUT) must be timed precisely to occur in appropriate behavioral contexts. A major part of the CNS circuit that coordinates this activity is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Immediate early gene (IEG) activity mapping has been widely used to investigate the lumbosacral LUT‐related circuit, but most reports focus on the effects of noxious stimulation in anesthetized female rats. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In females, after cystometry c‐Fos neurons in spinal cord segments L5–S2 were concentrated in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN), dorsal horn laminae II–IV, and dorsal commissural nucleus (SDCom). Comparisons of cystometry and control groups in male and female revealed sex differences. Activity mapping suggested dorsal horn laminae II–IV was activated in females but showed net inhibition in males. However, inhibition in male rats was not detected by EGR‐1 activity mapping, which showed low coexpression with c‐Fos. A class of catecholamine neurons in SPN and SDCom neurons were also more strongly activated by micturition in females. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression. In conclusion, IEG mapping in awake male and female rats has extended our understanding of the functional molecular anatomy of the LUT‐related circuit in spinal cord. Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.</p>

<p>
Rats and mice have similar patterns of retrogradely labeled neurons that project axons to the NTS.
Afferent neurons in the hypothalamus are glutamatergic, while those in the amygdala are GABAergic.
In the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, NTS afferent neurons are distinct from neuroendocrine neurons.
Injecting retrograde tracers into the medial and lateral NTS subdivisions produce similar patterns of retrograde labeling.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regulates life‐sustaining functions ranging from appetite and digestion to heart rate and breathing. It is also the brain's primary sensory nucleus for visceral sensations relevant to symptoms in medical and psychiatric disorders. To better understand which neurons may exert top‐down control over the NTS, here we provide a brain‐wide map of all neurons that project axons directly to the caudal, viscerosensory NTS, focusing on a medial subregion with aldosterone‐sensitive HSD2 neurons. Injecting an axonal tracer (cholera toxin b) into the NTS produces a similar pattern of retrograde labeling in rats and mice. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area, and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contain the densest concentrations of NTS‐projecting neurons. PVH afferents are glutamatergic (express <i>Slc17a6 </i>/Vglut2) and are distinct from neuroendocrine PVH neurons. CeA afferents are GABAergic (express <i>Slc32a1 </i>/Vgat) and are distributed largely in the medial CeA subdivision. Other retrogradely labeled neurons are located in a variety of brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (insular and infralimbic areas), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, Barrington's nucleus, Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, hindbrain reticular formation, and rostral NTS. Similar patterns of retrograde labeling result from tracer injections into different NTS subdivisions, with dual retrograde tracing revealing that many afferent neurons project axon collaterals to both the lateral and medial NTS subdivisions. This information provides a roadmap for studying descending axonal projections that may influence visceromotor systems and visceral “mind–body” symptoms.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25813?af=R">Association Between Pregnancy and Cervical Artery Dissection</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether pregnancy is associated with cervical artery dissection.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a case–control study using claims data from all nonfederal emergency departments and acute care hospitals in New York and Florida between 2005–2015. Cases were women 12–42 years of age hospitalized with cervical artery dissection, defined using validated diagnosis codes for carotid/vertebral artery dissection. Controls were women 12–42 years of age with a primary diagnosis of renal colic. Cases and controls were matched 1:1 on age, race, insurance, income, state, and visit year. The exposure variable was pregnancy, defined as labor and delivery within 90 days before or 6 months after the index visit. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of pregnancy between cases and controls. We performed a secondary cohort‐crossover study comparing the risk of cervical artery dissection during pregnancy versus the same time period 1 year later.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Pregnancy was twice as common among 826 women with cervical artery dissection compared to the 826 matched controls with renal colic (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–4.7). In our secondary analysis, pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of cervical artery dissection (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.5), with the heightened risk limited to the postpartum period (IRR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.6–11.7).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pregnancy, specifically the postpartum period, was associated with hospitalization for cervical artery dissection. Although these findings may partly reflect ascertainment bias, our results suggest that arterial dissection is one mechanism by which pregnancy can lead to stroke.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00579">Neurofilament-Light Chain as Biomarker of Neurodegenerative and Rare Diseases With High Translational Value</a></h4>

<p>Neurofilament-light chain (NF-L) is a well-known clinical biomarker of many neurodegenerative diseases. By analyzing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma, progression of NF-L levels can forecast conversion from the presymptomatic to symptomatic stage and time of survival. The use of plasma for NF-L measurement makes this biomarker exceptionally valuable for clinical studies since sample collection can be performed repeatedly without causing much harm. Detailed analyses of NF-L expression in neurodegenerative disease patient’s samples were already performed, while NF-L levels of preclinical models of ALS, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease as well as lysosomal storage diseases are still widely unknown. We therefore evaluated NF-L levels in the plasma of the ALS models SOD1-G93A low expressor and TAR6/6 mice, the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model 5xFAD, the Parkinson’s disease model Line 61 and the Gaucher disease (GD) model 4L/PS-NA and the CSF of selected models. Our results show that NF-L levels are highly increased in the plasma of ALS, Alzheimer’s and GD models, while in the analyzed Parkinson’s disease model NF-L plasma levels barely changed. Most analyzed models show a progressive increase of NF-L levels. NF-L measurements in the plasma of the neurodegenerative disease mouse models of ALS and AD are thus a good tool to evaluate disease progression. Compared to analyses in human tissues, our results suggest a high translation value of murine NF-L levels and their progression. Furthermore, our data indicate that NF-L might also be a good biomarker for disorders with a neuronal component like some lysosomal storage diseases.</p>

<p>Progressive neuronal death during tauopathies is associated with aggregation of modified, truncated or mutant forms of tau protein. Such aggregates are neurotoxic, promote spreading of tau aggregation, and trigger release of pro-inflammatory factors by glial cells. Counteracting such pathogenic effects of tau by simultaneously inhibiting protein aggregation as well as pro-inflammatory glial cell responses would be of significant therapeutic interest. Here, we examined the use of the small heat-shock protein HspB5 for this purpose. As a molecular chaperone, HspB5 counteracts aggregation of a wide range of abnormal proteins. As a TLR2 agonist, it selectively activates protective responses by CD14-expressing myeloid cells including microglia. We show that intracerebral infusion of HspB5 in transgenic mice with selective neuronal expression of mutant human P301S tau has significant neuroprotective effects in the superficial, frontal cortical layers. Underlying these effects at least in part, HspB5 induces several potent neuroprotective mediators in both astrocytes and microglia including neurotrophic factors and increased potential for removal of glutamate. Together, these findings highlight the potentially broad therapeutic potential of HspB5 in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.</p>

<p>The misfolding of transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions, but also plays a role in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease. It is thought that different truncations at the N- and C-termini of TDP-43 contribute to its misfolding and aggregation in the brain, and that these aberrant TDP-43 fragments contribute to disease. Despite this, little is known about whether different truncation events influence the protein’s transmissibility between cells and how this cell-to-cell transfer occurs. In this study, we use a well-established cellular model to study the efficiency by which full-length and truncated TDP-43 fragments are transferred between neuron-like cells. We demonstrate that preservation of the N-terminus of TDP-43 enhances its transmissibility between cells and that this protein transmission occurs in a manner exclusive of extracellular vesicles, instead requiring cellular proximity for efficient propagation. These data indicate that the N-terminus of TDP-43 might be a useful target in the generation of therapeutics to limit the spread of TDP-43 pathology.</p>

<p>The linearity and stationarity of fMRI time series need to be understood due to their important roles in the choice of approach for brain network analysis. In this paper, we investigated the stationarity and linearity of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) time-series data from the Midnight Scan Club datasets. The degree of stationarity (DS) and the degree of non-linearity (DN) were, respectively, estimated for the time series of all gray matter voxels. The similarity and difference between the DS and DN were assessed in terms of voxels and intrinsic brain networks, including the visual network, somatomotor network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention network, limbic network, frontoparietal network, and default-mode network. The test-retest scans were utilized to quantify the reliability of DS and DN. We found that DS and DN maps had overlapping spatial distribution. Meanwhile, the probability density estimate function of DS had a long tail, and that of DN had a more normal distribution. Specifically, stronger DS was present in the somatomotor, limbic, and ventral attention networks compared to other networks, and stronger DN was found in the somatomotor, visual, limbic, ventral attention, and default-mode networks. The percentage of overlapping voxels between DS and DN in different networks demonstrated a decreasing trend in the order default mode, ventral attention, somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, visual, and limbic. Furthermore, the ICC values of DS were higher than those of DN. Our results suggest that different functional networks have distinct properties of non-stationarity and non-linearity owing to the complexity of rs-fMRI time series. Thus, caution should be taken when analyzing fMRI data (both resting-state and task-activation) using simplified models.</p>

Objective<p>Prior studies have shown that there is an inverse association between birth weight and stroke in adulthood; however, whether such association is causal remains yet known and those studies cannot distinguish between the direct fetal effect and the indirect maternal effect. The aim of the study is to untangle such relationship using novel statistical genetic approaches.</p>Methods<p>We first utilized linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and Genetic analysis incorporating Pleiotropy and Annotation (GPA) to estimate the overall genetic correlation between birth weight and stroke. Then, with a set of valid birth-weight instruments which had adjusted fetal and maternal effects, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate its causal effect on stroke based summary statistics from large scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 264,498 for birth weight and 446,696 for stroke). We further validated the MR results with extensive sensitivity analyses.</p>Results<p>Both LDSC and GPA demonstrated significant evidence of shared maternal genetic foundation between birth weight and stroke, with the genetic correlation estimated to −0.176. However, no fetal genetic correlation between birth weight and stroke was detected. Furthermore, the inverse variance weighted MR demonstrated the maternally causal effect of birth weight on stroke was 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.27). The maternal ORs of birth weight on three subtypes of stroke including cardioembolic stroke (CES), large artery stroke (LAS) and small vessel stroke (SVS) were 1.16 (95% CI 0.93–1.43), 1.50 (95% CI 1.14–1.96) and 1.47 (95% CI 1.15–1.87), respectively. In contrast, no fetal causal associations were found between birth weight and stroke or the subtypes. Those results were robust against extensive sensitivity analyses, with Egger regression ruling out the possibility of pleiotropy and multivariable MR excluding the likelihood of confounding or mediation effects of other risk factors of stroke.</p>Conclusion<p>This study provides empirically supportive evidence on the fetal developmental origins of stroke and its subtypes. However, further investigation is warranted to understand the pathophysiological role of low birth weight in developing stroke.</p>

<p>Among dementia-like diseases, Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) are two of the most frequent. AD and VD may share multiple neurological symptoms that may lead to controversial diagnoses when using conventional clinical and MRI criteria. Therefore, other approaches are needed to overcome this issue. Machine learning (ML) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of several neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia. To this end, in this study, we investigated, first, whether different kinds of ML algorithms, combined with advanced MRI features, could be supportive in classifying VD from AD and, second, whether the developed approach might help in predicting the prevalent disease in subjects with an unclear profile of AD or VD. Three ML categories of algorithms were tested: artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Multiple regional metrics from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 60 subjects (33 AD, 27 VD) were used as input features to train the algorithms and find the best feature pattern to classify VD from AD. We then used the identified VD–AD discriminant feature pattern as input for the most performant ML algorithm to predict the disease prevalence in 15 dementia patients with a “mixed VD–AD dementia” (MXD) clinical profile using their baseline MRI data. ML predictions were compared with the diagnosis evidence from a 3-year clinical follow-up. ANFIS emerged as the most efficient algorithm in discriminating AD from VD, reaching a classification accuracy greater than 84% using a small feature pattern. Moreover, ANFIS showed improved classification accuracy when trained with a multimodal input feature data set (e.g., DTI + rs-fMRI metrics) rather than a unimodal feature data set. When applying the best discriminant pattern to the MXD group, ANFIS achieved a correct prediction rate of 77.33%. Overall, results showed that our approach has a high discriminant power to classify AD and VD profiles. Moreover, the same approach also showed potential in predicting earlier the prevalent underlying disease in dementia patients whose clinical profile is uncertain between AD and VD, therefore suggesting its usefulness in supporting physicians' diagnostic evaluations.</p>

<p>Plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS) allows for responses to changing environmental signals. While the majority of studies on brain plasticity focus on neuronal synapses, myelin plasticity has now begun to emerge as a potential modulator of neuronal networks. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) produce myelin, which provides fast signal transmission, allows for synchronization of neuronal inputs, and helps to maintain neuronal function. Thus, myelination is also thought to be involved in learning. OLs differentiate from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which are distributed throughout the adult brain, and myelination continues into late adulthood. This process is orchestrated by numerous cellular and molecular signals, such as axonal diameter, growth factors, extracellular signaling molecules, and neuronal activity. However, the relative importance of, and cooperation between, these signaling pathways is currently unknown. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge about myelin plasticity in the CNS. We discuss new insights into the link between this type of plasticity, learning and behavior, as well as mechanistic aspects of myelin formation that may underlie myelin plasticity, highlighting OPC diversity in the CNS.</p>

<p>We recently reported that intravenous bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) transplantation in stroke improves neurological function through improvement of cerebral metabolism. Cerebral metabolism is known to diminish with aging, and the reduction of metabolism is one of the presumed causes of neurological decline in the elderly. We report herein that transcription of glucose transporters, monocarboxylate transporters, and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is downregulated in the hippocampus of aged mice with impaired neurological functions. Intravenous BM-MNC transplantation in aged mice stimulated the transcription of glucose transporter 1 and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1 followed by restoration of neurological function. As glucose transporters and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases are closely related to cerebral metabolism and neurological function, our data indicate that BM-MNC transplantation in aged mice has the potential to restore neurological function by activating transcription of glucose transporter and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Furthermore, our data indicate that changes in transcription of glucose transporter and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase could be surrogate biomarkers for age-related neurological impairment as well as quantifying the efficacy of therapies.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53159">FoxO suppresses endoplasmic reticulum stress to inhibit growth of Tsc1-deficient tissues under nutrient restriction</a></h4>

The transcription factor FoxO has been shown to block proliferation and progression in mTORC1-driven tumorigenesis but the picture of the relevant FoxO target genes remains incomplete. Here, we employed RNA-seq profiling on single clones isolated using laser capture microdissection from <i>Drosophila</i> larval eye imaginal discs to identify FoxO targets that restrict the proliferation of Tsc1-deficient cells under nutrient restriction (NR). Transcriptomics analysis revealed downregulation of endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation pathway components upon <i>foxo</i> knockdown. Induction of ER stress pharmacologically or by suppression of other ER stress response pathway components led to an enhanced overgrowth of <i>Tsc1</i> knockdown tissue. Increase of ER stress in <i>Tsc1</i> loss-of-function cells upon <i>foxo</i> knockdown was also confirmed by elevated expression levels of known ER stress markers. These results highlight the role of FoxO in limiting ER stress to regulate <i>Tsc1</i> mutant overgrowth.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48881">mPFC spindle cycles organize sparse thalamic activation and recently active CA1 cells during non-REM sleep</a></h4>

Sleep oscillations in the neocortex and hippocampus are critical for the integration of new memories into stable generalized representations in neocortex. However, the role of the thalamus in this process is poorly understood. To determine the thalamic contribution to non-REM oscillations (sharp-wave ripples, SWRs; slow/delta; spindles), we recorded units and local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously in the limbic thalamus, mPFC, and CA1 in rats. We report that the cycles of neocortical spindles provide a key temporal window that coordinates CA1 SWRs with sparse but consistent activation of thalamic units. Thalamic units were phase-locked to delta and spindles in mPFC, and fired at consistent lags with other thalamic units within spindles, while CA1 units that were active during spatial exploration were engaged in SWR-coupled spindles after behavior. The sparse thalamic firing could promote an incremental integration of recently acquired memory traces into neocortical schemas through the interleaved activation of thalamocortical cells.

Understanding cellular remodeling in response to mechanical stimuli is a critical step in elucidating mechanical activation of biochemical signaling pathways. Experimental evidence indicates that external stress-induced subcellular adaptation is accomplished through dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization. To study the interactions between subcellular structures involved in transducing mechanical signals, we combined experimental and computational simulations to evaluate real-time mechanical adaptation of the actin cytoskeletal network. Actin cytoskeleton was imaged at the same time as an external tensile force was applied to live vascular smooth muscle cells using a fibronectin-functionalized atomic force microscope probe. Moreover, we performed computational simulations of active cytoskeletal networks under an external tensile force. The experimental data and simulation results suggest that mechanical structural adaptation occurs before chemical adaptation during filament bundle formation: actin filaments first align in the direction of the external force by initializing anisotropic filament orientations, then the chemical evolution of the network follows the anisotropic structures to further develop the bundle-like geometry. Our findings present an alternative two-step explanation for the formation of actin bundles due to mechanical stimulation and provide new insights into the mechanism of mechanotransduction.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JNg99gy_cCc" width="1" />

Mitochondrial metabolic remodeling is a hallmark of the <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> digenetic life cycle because the insect stage utilizes a cost-effective oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to generate ATP, while bloodstream cells switch to aerobic glycolysis. Due to difficulties in acquiring enough parasites from the tsetse fly vector, the dynamics of the parasite’s metabolic rewiring in the vector have remained obscure. Here, we took advantage of in vitro–induced differentiation to follow changes at the RNA, protein, and metabolite levels. This multi-omics and cell-based profiling showed an immediate redirection of electron flow from the cytochrome-mediated pathway to an alternative oxidase (AOX), an increase in proline consumption, elevated activity of complex II, and certain tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, which led to mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Interestingly, these ROS molecules appear to act as signaling molecules driving developmental progression because ectopic expression of catalase, a ROS scavenger, halted the in vitro–induced differentiation. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of the parasite’s mitochondrial rewiring and reinforce the emerging concept that mitochondria act as signaling organelles through release of ROS to drive cellular differentiation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1GfoirEEJbI" width="1" />

In the tumor microenvironment, local immune dysregulation is driven in part by macrophages and dendritic cells that are polarized to a mixed proinflammatory/immune-suppressive phenotype. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is emerging as the possible origin of these events. Here we report that the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α) branch of the UPR is directly involved in the polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo, including the up-regulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-23, Arginase1, as well as surface expression of CD86 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Macrophages in which the IRE1α/X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) axis is blocked pharmacologically or deleted genetically have significantly reduced polarization and CD86 and PD-L1 expression, which was induced independent of IFNγ signaling, suggesting a novel mechanism in PD-L1 regulation in macrophages. Mice with IRE1α- but not Xbp1-deficient macrophages showed greater survival than controls when implanted with B16.F10 melanoma cells. Remarkably, we found a significant association between the IRE1α gene signature and <i>CD274</i> gene expression in tumor-infiltrating macrophages in humans. RNA sequencing (RNASeq) analysis showed that bone marrow–derived macrophages with IRE1α deletion lose the integrity of the gene connectivity characteristic of regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD) and the ability to activate <i>CD274</i> gene expression. Thus, the IRE1α/Xbp1 axis drives the polarization of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment initiating a complex immune dysregulation leading to failure of local immune surveillance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/BN5X2l_bEwY" width="1" />

<h2>
   <b>Objective: </b> To foster trial‐readiness of coenzyme Q8A (COQ8A)‐ataxia, we map the clinicogenetic, molecular, and neuroimaging spectrum of COQ8A‐ataxia in a large worldwide cohort, and provide first progression data, including treatment response to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).</h2>


<h2>
   <b>Methods: </b> Cross‐modal analysis of a multicenter cohort of 59 COQ8A patients, including genotype–phenotype correlations, 3D‐protein modeling, in vitro mutation analyses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers, disease progression, and CoQ10 response data.</h2>


<h2>
   <b>Results: </b> Fifty‐nine patients (39 novel) with 44 pathogenic <i>COQ8A </i> variants (18 novel) were identified. Missense variants demonstrated a pleiotropic range of detrimental effects upon protein modeling and in vitro analysis of purified variants. COQ8A‐ataxia presented as variable multisystemic, early‐onset cerebellar ataxia, with complicating features ranging from epilepsy (32%) and cognitive impairment (49%) to exercise intolerance (25%) and hyperkinetic movement disorders (41%), including dystonia and myoclonus as presenting symptoms. Multisystemic involvement was more prevalent in missense than biallelic loss‐of‐function variants (82–93% vs 53%; <i>p </i> = 0.029). Cerebellar atrophy was universal on MRI (100%), with cerebral atrophy or dentate and pontine T2 hyperintensities observed in 28%. Cross‐sectional (n = 34) and longitudinal (n = 7) assessments consistently indicated mild‐to‐moderate progression of ataxia (SARA: 0.45/year). CoQ10 treatment led to improvement by clinical report in 14 of 30 patients, and by quantitative longitudinal assessments in 8 of 11 patients (SARA: −0.81/year). Explorative sample size calculations indicate that ≥48 patients per arm may suffice to demonstrate efficacy for interventions that reduce progression by 50%.</h2>


<h2>
   <b>Interpretation: </b> This study provides a deeper understanding of the disease, and paves the way toward large‐scale natural history studies and treatment trials in COQ8A‐ataxia.</h2>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The anatomy and physiology of monosynaptic connections in rodent hippocampal CA1 have been extensively studied in recent decades. Yet, the resulting knowledge remains disparate and difficult to reconcile. Here, we present a data‐driven approach to integrate the current state‐of‐the‐art knowledge on the synaptic anatomy and physiology of rodent hippocampal CA1, including axo‐dendritic innervation patterns, number of synapses per connection, quantal conductances, neurotransmitter release probability, and short‐term plasticity into a single coherent resource. First, we undertook an extensive literature review of paired recordings of hippocampal neurons and compiled experimental data on their synaptic anatomy and physiology. The data collected in this manner is sparse and inhomogeneous due to the diversity of experimental techniques used by different groups, which necessitates the need for an integrative framework to unify these data. To this end, we extended a previously developed workflow for the neocortex to constrain a unifying in silico reconstruction of the synaptic physiology of CA1 connections. Our work identifies gaps in the existing knowledge and provides a complementary resource toward a more complete quantification of synaptic anatomy and physiology in the rodent hippocampal CA1 region.</p>

<p>Cortical feedback pathways are proposed to guide cognition and behavior according to context and goal-direction. At the cellular level, cortical feedback pathways target multiple excitatory and inhibitory populations. However, we currently lack frameworks that link how the cellular mechanisms of cortical feedback pathways underlie their cognitive/behavioral functions. To establish this link, we expand on the framework of signal routing, the ability of cortical feedback pathways to proactively modulate how feedforward signals are propagated throughout the cortex. We propose that cortical feedback modulates routing through multiple mechanisms: preparing intended motor representations, setting the trigger conditions for evoking cortical outputs, altering coupling strengths between cortical regions, and suppressing expected sensory representations. In developing this framework, we first define the anatomy of cortical feedback pathways and identify recent advances in studying their functions at high specificity and resolution. Second, we review the diverse functions of cortical feedback pathways throughout the cortical hierarchy and evaluate these functions from the framework of signal routing. Third, we review the conserved cellular targets and circuit impacts of cortical feedback. Fourth, we introduce the concept of the “cortical landscape,” a graphical depiction of the routes through cortex that are favored at a specific moment in time. We propose that the cortical landscape, analogous to energy landscapes in physics and chemistry, can capture important features of signal routing including coupling strength, trigger conditions, and preparatory states. By resolving the cortical landscape, we may be able to quantify how the cellular processes of cortical feedback ultimately shape cognition and behavior.</p>

<p>In animal models, monocular deprivation (MD) by lid closure mimics the effects of unilateral amblyopia in humans. Temporary inactivation of one or both eyes with intraocular administration of tetrodotoxin (TTX) has recently been shown to promote recovery from the anatomical effects of MD at post-critical period ages when standard recovery strategies fail. In the current study, the retinae and optic nerves of animals subjected to 10 days of monocular retinal inactivation were assessed for pathological changes as a means of assessing the viability of this potential new amblyopia therapy. Retinal sections from both eyes were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and were then examined for cell density and soma size in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Sections of the optic nerve from each eye were examined for neurofilament protein, myelin, glial cell density, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Our study revealed no evidence of gross histopathological abnormalities following inactivation for 10 days, nor was there evidence of degeneration of axons or loss of myelin in the optic nerve serving inactivated eyes. On all measurements, the inactivated eye was indistinguishable from the fellow eye, and both were comparable to normal controls. We confirmed that our inactivation protocol obliterated visually-evoked potentials for 10 consecutive days, but visual responses were restored to normal after the effects of inactivation wore off. Notwithstanding the critical need for further assessment of ocular and retinal health following inactivation, these results provide evidence that retinal inactivation as a treatment for amblyopia does not produce significant retinal damage or degeneration.</p>

<p>The neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) connect muscle fibers with motor neurons and enable the coordinated contraction of skeletal muscles. The dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC) is an essential component of the postsynaptic machinery of the NMJ and is important for the maintenance of NMJ structural integrity. To identify novel proteins that are important for NMJ organization, we performed a mass spectrometry-based screen for interactors of α-dystrobrevin 1 (aDB1), one of the components of the DGC. The guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Arhgef5 was found to be one of the aDB1 binding partners that is recruited to Tyr-713 in a phospho-dependent manner. We show here that Arhgef5 localizes to the NMJ and that its genetic depletion in the muscle causes the fragmentation of the synapses in conditional knockout mice. Arhgef5 loss in vivo is associated with a reduction in the levels of active GTP-bound RhoA and Cdc42 GTPases, highlighting the importance of actin dynamics regulation for the maintenance of NMJ integrity.</p>

<p>Studies on transcranial current stimulation have shown that a direct current stimulation of the occipital cortex can influence the amplitude size of a visual evoked potential (VEP). The current direction (cathodal or anodal) determines whether the VEP amplitudes increase or decrease. The aim of this study was to design a new experimental setup that will enable a simultaneous ocular direct current stimulation and electroretinogram (ERG) recording which will broaden our understanding of current stimulation effects on the visual system. Furthermore, we examined whether a direct current stimulation on the eye has a similar effect on an ERG as on a VEP. The pattern-reversal ERG was measured with sintered Ag/AgCl skin-electrodes, positioned on the lower eyelid (active), the earlobe (reference), and the forehead (ground). Direct current was applied through a ring rubber electrode placed around the eye and a 5 cm × 5 cm rubber electrode placed at the ipsilateral temple with a current strength of 500 μA and a duration time of 5 min. Fifty-seven healthy volunteers were divided into three groups depending on the current direction (cathodal, anodal, and sham stimulation, n = 19 each). One ERG measurement (ERG 1) was performed before and another (ERG 2) during the direct current stimulation. The difference between ERG 1 and ERG 2 measurements for the characteristic P50, N95 and N95′ (N95 minimum measured from zero line) amplitudes were evaluated by both confidence interval analysis and t-test for related samples (α = 0.05, after Bonferroni correction p<sup>∗</sup> = 0.0055). The P50 amplitude was significantly decreased for ERG 2 measurement in the cathodal and anodal stimulation group (cathodal p = 0.001, anodal p = 0.000). No significant changes could be found in the N95 and N95′ amplitudes as well as in the sham-stimulation group. Additionally, the latencies did not undergo any significant changes. In conclusion, the newly designed experimental setup enables simultaneous current stimulation and ERG recording. The current influenced P50 amplitude although not the N95 and N95′ amplitudes. Furthermore, the amplitude size decreased for both current directions and did not lead to contrary effects as expected.</p>

<p>The core learning mechanisms of neurofeedback (NF) training are associative, implicit, and, consequently, largely impervious to consciousness. Many other aspects of training that determine training outcomes, however, are accessible to conscious processing. The outcomes of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) up-regulation training are related to the strategies reported by participants. The classification methods of individual strategies employed hitherto were possibly under influence of the idiosyncratic interpretation of the rater. To measure and possibly overcome this limitation, we employed independent raters to analyze strategies reported during SMR up-regulation training. Sixty-two healthy young participants took part in a single session of SMR up-regulation training. After completing six blocks of training, in which they received either simple visual feedback or a gamified version thereof, participants were required to report the strategies employed. Their individual learning outcomes were computed as well. Results point out that individual strategies as well as NF learning outcomes were not particularly sensitive to the presence of gamified elements in training the SMR up-regulation. A high degree of consistency across independent raters classifying strategy reports was observed. Some strategies were more typical of responders while other ones were more common among non-responders. In summary, we demonstrate a more objective and transparent way to analyze individual mental strategies to shed more light on the differences between NF responders and non-responders.</p>

<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising brain imaging modality for studying the neural substrates of moral emotions. However, the feasibility of using fNIRS to measure moral emotions has not been established. In the present study, we used fNIRS to detect the brain activation evoked by two typical moral emotions—guilt and shame. We presented the participants with guilt and shame context to evoke emotional responses and measured the brain activity by using fNIRS. The univariate general linear model analysis showed significant activations for both emotions in the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and middle temporal gyrus, and specific activation for guilt in the right temporoparietal junction. The multivariate classification analysis showed an overall recognition accuracy of 52.50%, which was significantly higher than the chance level in classifying the guilt, shame, and neutral emotions. These results suggested the feasibility of using fNIRS to assess the brain activation evoked by guilt and shame and demonstrated the potentials of fNIRS in studying the neural correlates of moral emotions.</p>

<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are among the most prevalent and frequently co-occurring psychiatric disorders in adults and may have, at least in part, a common etiology. However, the unique and the shared neuroanatomical characteristics of the two disorders have not been fully identified. The aim of this study was to compare the topological organization of gray matter networks between non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients and SAD patients. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from 37 non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients, 24 non-comorbid medication-naive SAD patients, and 41 healthy controls. Single-subject gray matter graphs were extracted from structural MRI scans, and whole-brain neuroanatomic organization was compared across the three groups. The relationships between brain network measures and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Relative to healthy controls, both the MDD and the SAD patients showed global decreases in clustering coefficient, normalized clustering coefficient, and small-worldness and locally decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the left insular, lingual, and calcarine cortices. Compared with healthy controls, the SAD patients exhibited increased nodal centralities and morphological connections mainly involving the prefrontal cortex and the sensorimotor network. Furthermore, compared to the SAD patients, the MDD patients showed increased characteristic path length, reduced global efficiency, and decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus. Our findings provide new evidence for shared and specific similarity-based gray matter network alterations in MDD and SAD and emphasize that the psychopathological changes in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus might be different between the two disorders.</p>

<p>The APOE gene alleles modify human aging and the response to the diet at many levels with diverse pleotropic effects from gut to brain. To understand the interactions of APOE isoforms and diet, we analyze how cellular trafficking of apoE proteins affects energy metabolism, the immune system, and reproduction. The age-accelerating APOE4 allele alters the endosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors that mediate lipid and glucose metabolism. The APOE4 allele is the ancestral human allele, joined by APOE3 and then APOE2 in the human species. Under conditions of high infection, uncertain food, and shorter life expectancy, APOE4 may be adaptive for reducing mortality. As humans transitioned into modern less-infectious environments and longer life spans, APOE4 increased risks of aging-related diseases, particularly impacting arteries and the brain. The association of APOE4 with glucose dysregulation and body weight promotes many aging-associated diseases. Additionally, the APOE gene locus interacts with adjacent genes on chromosome 19 in haplotypes that modify neurodegeneration and metabolism, for which we anticipate complex gene-environment interactions. We summarize how diet and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk are altered by APOE genotype in both animal and human studies and identify gaps. Much remains obscure in how APOE alleles modify nutritional factors in human aging. Identifying risk variant haplotypes in the APOE gene complex will clarify homeostatic adaptive responses to environmental conditions.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57215">Globus pallidus dynamics reveal covert strategies for behavioral inhibition</a></h4>

Flexible behavior requires restraint of actions that are no longer appropriate. This behavioral inhibition critically relies on frontal cortex - basal ganglia circuits. Within the basal ganglia the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe), has been hypothesized to mediate selective proactive inhibition: being prepared to stop a specific action, if needed. Here we investigate population dynamics of rat GPe neurons during preparation-to-stop, stopping, and going. Rats selectively engaged proactive inhibition towards specific actions, as shown by slowed reaction times (RTs). Under proactive inhibition, GPe population activity occupied state-space locations farther from the trajectory followed during normal movement initiation. Furthermore, the state-space locations were predictive of distinct types of errors: failures-to-stop, failures-to-go, and incorrect choices. Slowed RTs on correct proactive trials reflected starting bias towards the alternative action, which was overcome before progressing towards action initiation. Our results demonstrate that rats can exert cognitive control via strategic adjustments to their GPe network state.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55289">Different neuronal populations mediate inflammatory pain analgesia by exogenous and endogenous opioids</a></h4>

Mu-opioid receptors (MORs) are crucial for analgesia by both exogenous and endogenous opioids. However, the distinct mechanisms underlying these two types of opioid analgesia remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that analgesic effects of exogenous and endogenous opioids on inflammatory pain are mediated by MORs expressed in distinct subpopulations of neurons in mouse. We found that the exogenous opioid-induced analgesia of inflammatory pain is mediated by MORs in Vglut2<sup>+</sup> glutamatergic but not GABAergic neurons. In contrast, analgesia by endogenous opioids is mediated by MORs in GABAergic rather than Vglut2<sup>+</sup> glutamatergic neurons. Furthermore, MORs expressed at the spinal level is mainly involved in the analgesic effect of morphine in acute pain, but not in endogenous opioid analgesia during chronic inflammatory pain. Thus, our study revealed distinct mechanisms underlying analgesia by exogenous and endogenous opioids, and laid the foundation for further dissecting the circuit mechanism underlying opioid analgesia.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55143">CRISPR-Cas12a exploits R-loop asymmetry to form double-strand breaks</a></h4>

Type V CRISPR-Cas interference proteins use a single RuvC active site to make RNA-guided breaks in double-stranded DNA substrates, an activity essential for both bacterial immunity and genome editing. The best-studied of these enzymes, Cas12a, initiates DNA cutting by forming a 20-nucleotide R-loop in which the guide RNA displaces one strand of a double-helical DNA substrate, positioning the DNase active site for first-strand cleavage. However, crystal structures and biochemical data have not explained how the second strand is cut to complete the double-strand break. Here, we detect intrinsic instability in DNA flanking the RNA-3′ side of R-loops, which Cas12a can exploit to expose second-strand DNA for cutting. Interestingly, DNA flanking the RNA-5′ side of R-loops is not intrinsically unstable. This asymmetry in R-loop structure may explain the uniformity of guide RNA architecture and the single-active-site cleavage mechanism that are fundamental features of all type V CRISPR-Cas systems.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54936">Distinct signals in medial and lateral VTA dopamine neurons modulate fear extinction at different times</a></h4>

Dopamine (DA) neurons are known to encode reward prediction error (RPE), in addition to other signals, such as salience. While RPE is known to support learning, the role of salience in supporting learning remains less clear. To address this, we recorded and manipulated VTA DA neurons in mice during fear extinction, a behavior we observed to generate spatially segregated RPE and salience signals. We applied deep learning to classify mouse freezing behavior, eliminating the need for human scoring. Our fiber photometry recordings showed that DA neurons in medial and lateral VTA have distinct activity profiles during fear extinction: medial VTA activity more closely reflected RPE, while lateral VTA activity more closely reflected a salience-like signal. Optogenetic inhibition of DA neurons in either region slowed fear extinction, with the relevant time period for inhibition differing across regions. Our results indicate that salience-like signals can have similar downstream consequences to RPE-like signals, although with different temporal dependencies.

Despite evidence that context promotes the visual recognition of objects, decades of research have led to the pervasive notion that the object processing pathway in primate cortex consists of multiple areas that each process the intrinsic features of a few particular categories (e.g. faces, bodies, hands, objects, and scenes). Here we report that such category-selective neurons do not in fact code individual categories in isolation but are also sensitive to object relationships that reflect statistical regularities of the experienced environment. We show by direct neuronal recording that face-selective neurons respond not just to an image of a face, but also to parts of an image where contextual cues—for example a body—indicate a face ought to be, even if what is there is not a face.

Petersen et al. demonstrate that cooling of the medial septum slows theta oscillation and increases choice errors without affecting spatial features of pyramidal neurons. Cooling affects distance-time, but not distance-theta phase, compression. The findings reveal that cell assemblies are organized by theta phase and not by external (clock) time.

<p>by Matthijs Pals, Terrence C. Stewart, Elkan G. Akyürek, Jelmer P. Borst</p>

In this paper, we present a functional spiking-neuron model of human working memory (WM). This model combines neural firing for encoding of information with activity-silent maintenance. While it used to be widely assumed that information in WM is maintained through persistent recurrent activity, recent studies have shown that information can be maintained without persistent firing; instead, information can be stored in activity-silent states. A candidate mechanism underlying this type of storage is short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP), by which the strength of connections between neurons rapidly changes to encode new information. To demonstrate that STSP can lead to functional behavior, we integrated STSP by means of calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation in a large-scale spiking-neuron model and added a decision mechanism. The model was used to simulate a recent study that measured behavior and EEG activity of participants in three delayed-response tasks. In these tasks, one or two visual gratings had to be maintained in WM, and compared to subsequent probes. The original study demonstrated that WM contents and its priority status could be decoded from neural activity elicited by a task-irrelevant stimulus displayed during the activity-silent maintenance period. In support of our model, we show that it can perform these tasks, and that both its behavior as well as its neural representations are in agreement with the human data. We conclude that information in WM can be effectively maintained in activity-silent states by means of calcium-mediated STSP.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-YEmivJgBl0" width="1" />

<p>by David Lamparter, Rajat Bhatnagar, Katja Hebestreit, T. Grant Belgard, Alice Zhang, Victor Hanson-Smith</p>

A longstanding goal of regulatory genetics is to understand how variants in genome sequences lead to changes in gene expression. Here we present a method named Bayesian Annotation Guided eQTL Analysis (BAGEA), a variational Bayes framework to model cis-eQTLs using directed and undirected genomic annotations. We used <i>BAGEA</i> to integrate directed genomic annotations with eQTL summary statistics from tissues of various origins. This analysis revealed epigenetic marks that are relevant for gene expression in different tissues and cell types. We estimated the predictive power of the models that were fitted based on directed genomic annotations. This analysis showed that, depending on the underlying eQTL data used, the directed genomic annotations could predict up to 1.5% of the variance observed in the expression of genes with top nominal eQTL association p-values &lt; 10<sup>−7</sup>. For genes with estimated effect sizes in the top 25% quantile, up to 5% of the expression variance could be predicted. Based on our results, we recommend the use of <i>BAGEA</i> for the analysis of cis-eQTL data to reveal annotations relevant to expression biology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LH4CA4aXWNY" width="1" />

<p>by Yuxiu Shao, Jiwei Zhang, Louis Tao</p>

Modern electrophysiological recordings and optical imaging techniques have revealed a diverse spectrum of spatiotemporal neural activities underlying fundamental cognitive processing. Oscillations, traveling waves and other complex population dynamical patterns are often concomitant with sensory processing, information transfer, decision making and memory consolidation. While neural population models such as neural mass, population density and kinetic theoretical models have been used to capture a wide range of the experimentally observed dynamics, a full account of how the multi-scale dynamics emerges from the detailed biophysical properties of individual neurons and the network architecture remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed coarse-graining framework for reduced-dimensional descriptions of neuronal networks to model visual cortical dynamics. We show that, without introducing any new parameters, how a sequence of models culminating in an augmented system of spatially-coupled ODEs can effectively model a wide range of the observed cortical dynamics, ranging from visual stimulus orientation dynamics to traveling waves induced by visual illusory stimuli. In addition to an efficient simulation method, this framework also offers an analytic approach to studying large-scale network dynamics. As such, the dimensional reduction naturally leads to mesoscopic variables that capture the interplay between neuronal population stochasticity and network architecture that we believe to underlie many emergent cortical phenomena.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cH8b_BlTI7M" width="1" />

The development of multicellularity is a key evolutionary transition allowing for differentiation of physiological functions across a cell population that confers survival benefits; among unicellular bacteria, this can lead to complex developmental behaviors and the formation of higher-order community structures. Herein, we demonstrate that in the social δ-proteobacterium <i>Myxococcus xanthus</i>, the secretion of a novel biosurfactant polysaccharide (BPS) is spatially modulated within communities, mediating swarm migration as well as the formation of multicellular swarm biofilms and fruiting bodies. BPS is a type IV pilus (T4P)-inhibited acidic polymer built of randomly acetylated β-linked tetrasaccharide repeats. Both BPS and exopolysaccharide (EPS) are produced by dedicated Wzx/Wzy-dependent polysaccharide-assembly pathways distinct from that responsible for spore-coat assembly. While EPS is preferentially produced at the lower-density swarm periphery, BPS production is favored in the higher-density swarm interior; this is consistent with the former being known to stimulate T4P retraction needed for community expansion and a function for the latter in promoting initial cell dispersal. Together, these data reveal the central role of secreted polysaccharides in the intricate behaviors coordinating bacterial multicellularity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4YmZR26DMMQ" width="1" />

Inherited prion diseases are caused by autosomal dominant coding mutations in the human prion protein (PrP) gene (<i>PRNP</i>) and account for about 15% of human prion disease cases worldwide. The proposed mechanism is that the mutation predisposes to conformational change in the expressed protein, leading to the generation of disease-related multichain PrP assemblies that propagate by seeded protein misfolding. Despite considerable experimental support for this hypothesis, to-date spontaneous formation of disease-relevant, transmissible PrP assemblies in transgenic models expressing only mutant human PrP has not been demonstrated. Here, we report findings from transgenic mice that express human PrP 117V on a mouse PrP null background (117VV Tg30 mice), which model the <i>PRNP</i> A117V mutation causing inherited prion disease (IPD) including Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease phenotypes in humans. By studying brain samples from uninoculated groups of mice, we discovered that some mice (≥475 days old) spontaneously generated abnormal PrP assemblies, which after inoculation into further groups of 117VV Tg30 mice, produced a molecular and neuropathological phenotype congruent with that seen after transmission of brain isolates from IPD A117V patients to the same mice. To the best of our knowledge, the 117VV Tg30 mouse line is the first transgenic model expressing only mutant human PrP to show spontaneous generation of transmissible PrP assemblies that directly mirror those generated in an inherited prion disease in humans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7pN5DjjPHiU" width="1" />

<p>by Akinori Yamasaki, Yui Jin, Yoshinori Ohsumi</p>

Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway targeting organelles and macromolecules, thereby regulating various cellular functions. Phosphorylation is a key posttranscriptional protein modification implicated in the regulation of biological function including autophagy. Under asynchronous conditions, autophagy activity is predominantly suppressed by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, but whether autophagy-related genes (ATG) proteins are phosphorylated differentially throughout the sequential phases of the cell cycle remains unclear. In this issue, Li and colleagues report that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylates the ULK complex during mitosis. This phosphorylation induces autophagy and, surprisingly, is shown to drive cell cycle progression. This work reveals a yet-unappreciated role for autophagy in cell cycle progression and enhances our understanding of the specific phase-dependent autophagy regulation during cellular growth and proliferation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tFg0FHdgWlk" width="1" />

<p>by Zhiyuan Li, Xiaofei Tian, Xinmiao Ji, Junjun Wang, Hanxiao Chen, Dongmei Wang, Xin Zhang</p>

Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1)–autophagy-related 13 (ATG13) is the most upstream autophagy initiation complex that is phosphorylated by mammalian target-of-rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to induce autophagy in asynchronous conditions. However, their phospho-regulation and functions in mitosis and cell cycle remain unknown. Here we show that ULK1-ATG13 complex is differentially regulated throughout the cell cycle, especially in mitosis, in which both ULK1 and ATG13 are highly phosphorylated by the key cell cycle machinery cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B. Combining mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that CDK1-induced ULK1-ATG13 phosphorylation promotes mitotic autophagy and cell cycle progression. Moreover, double knockout (DKO) of ULK1 and ATG13 could block cell cycle progression and significantly decrease cancer cell proliferation in cell line and mouse models. Our results not only bridge the mutual regulation between the core machinery of autophagy and mitosis but also illustrate the positive function of ULK1-ATG13 and their phosphorylation by CDK1 in mitotic autophagy regulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/K9geLmzvZ_w" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genome sequencing (GS) is promising for unsolved leukodystrophies, but its efficacy has not been prospectively studied.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A prospective time‐delayed crossover design trial of GS to assess the efficacy of GS as a first‐line diagnostic tool for genetic white matter disorders took place between December 1, 2015 and September 27, 2017. Patients were randomized to receive GS immediately with concurrent standard of care (SoC) testing, or to receive SoC testing for 4 months followed by GS.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty‐four individuals were assessed at interim review. The genetic origin of 2 patient's leukoencephalopathy was resolved before randomization. Nine patients were stratified to the immediate intervention group and 23 patients to the delayed‐GS arm. The efficacy of GS was significant relative to SoC in the immediate (5/9 [56%] vs 0/9 [0%]; Wild–Seber, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.005) and delayed (control) arms (14/23 [61%] vs 5/23 [22%]; Wild–Seber, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate‐GS group (log‐rank test, <i>p </i> = 0.04). The overall diagnostic efficacy of combined GS and SoC approaches was 26 of 34 (76.5%, 95% confidence interval = 58.8–89.3%) in &lt;4 months, greater than historical norms of &lt;50% over 5 years. Owing to loss of clinical equipoise, the trial design was altered to a single‐arm observational study.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this study, first‐line GS provided earlier and greater diagnostic efficacy in white matter disorders. We provide an evidence‐based diagnostic testing algorithm to enable appropriate clinical GS utilization in this population. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection has the potential for targeting the central nervous system, and several neurological symptoms have been described in patients with severe respiratory distress. Here, we described the case of a 60‐year‐old patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection but only mild respiratory abnormalities who developed an akinetic mutism attributable to encephalitis. Magnetic resonance imaging was negative, whereas electroencephalography showed generalized theta slowing. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses during the acute stage were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2, positive for pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia, and showed increased interleukin‐8 and tumor necrosis factor‐α concentrations. Other infectious or autoimmune disorders were excluded. A progressive clinical improvement along with a reduction of cerebrospinal fluid parameters was observed after high‐dose steroid treatment, thus arguing for an inflammatory‐mediated brain involvement related to COVID‐19.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Peripapillary hyper‐reflective ovoid masslike structures (PHOMS) are a new spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) finding.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective, longitudinal study included patients (n = 212) with multiple sclerosis (MS; n = 418 eyes), 59 healthy controls (HCs; n = 117 eyes), and 267 non‐MS disease controls (534 eyes). OCT and diffusion tensor imaging were used.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were no PHOMS in HC eyes (0/117, 0%). The prevalence of PHOMS was significantly higher in patients with MS (34/212, <i>p </i> = 0.001) and MS eyes (45/418, <i>p </i> = 0.0002) when compared to HCs (0/59, 0/117). The inter‐rater agreement for PHOMS was 97.9% (kappa = 0.951). PHOMS were present in 16% of patients with relapsing–remitting, 16% of patients with progressive, and 12% of patients with secondary progressive disease course (2% of eyes). There was no relationship of PHOMS with age, disease duration, disease course, disability, or disease‐modifying treatments. The fractional anisotropy of the optic radiations was lower in patients without PHOMS (0.814) when compared to patients with PHOMS (0.845, <i>p </i> = 0.03). The majority of PHOMS remained stable, but increase in size and de novo development of PHOMS were also observed. In non‐MS disease controls, PHOMS were observed in intracranial hypertension (62%), optic disc drusen (47%), anomalous optic discs (44%), isolated optic neuritis (19%), and optic atrophy (12%).</p>

<p>These data suggest that PHOMS are a novel finding in MS pathology. Future research is needed to determine whether development of PHOMS in MS is due to intermittently raised intracranial pressure or an otherwise impaired “glymphatic” outflow from eye to brain. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>This review aims to discuss (1) the refinement of mammalian visual cortical circuits and the maturation of visual functions they subserve in primary visual cortex (V1) and other visual cortical areas, and (2) existing evidence supporting the notion of differential rates of maturation of visual functions in different species. It is well known that different visual functions and their underlying circuitry mature and attain adultlike characteristics at different stages in postnatal development with varying growth rates. The developmental timecourse and duration of refinement varies significantly both in V1 of various species and among different visual cortical areas; while basic visual functions like spatial acuity mature earlier requiring less time, higher form perception such as contour integration is more complex and requires longer postnatal time to refine. This review will highlight the importance of systematic comparative analysis of the differential rates of refinement of visual circuitry and function as that may help reveal underlying key mechanisms necessary for healthy visual development during infancy and adulthood. This type of approach will help future studies to establish direct links between various developmental aspects of different visual cortical areas in both human and animal models; thus enhancing our understanding of vision related neurological disorders and their potential therapeutic remedies.</p>

<p>The role of ion channels in neurons and muscles has been well characterized. However, recent work has demonstrated both the presence and necessity of ion channels in diverse cell types for morphological development. For example, mutations that disrupt ion channels give rise to abnormal structural development in species of flies, frogs, fish, mice, and humans. Furthermore, medications and recreational drugs that target ion channels are associated with higher incidence of birth defects in humans. In this review we establish the effects of several teratogens on development including epilepsy treatment drugs (topiramate, valproate, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), nicotine, heat, and cannabinoids. We then propose potential links between these teratogenic agents and ion channels with mechanistic insights from model organisms. Finally, we talk about the role of a particular ion channel, Kir2.1, in the formation and development of bone as an example of how ion channels can be used to uncover important processes in morphogenesis. Because ion channels are common targets of many currently used medications, understanding how ion channels impact morphological development will be important for prevention of birth defects. It is becoming increasingly clear that ion channels have functional roles outside of tissues that have been classically considered excitable.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that targets motor neurons (MNs) in the brain and spinal cord. It leads to gradual loss of motor signals to muscles leading to atrophy and weakness. Most patients do not survive for more than 3–5 years after disease onset. Current ALS treatments provide only a small delay of disease progression. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to explore new therapeutic approaches. One of the major hindrances in achieving this goal is poor understanding of causes of the disease. ALS has complex pathophysiological mechanisms in its genetic and sporadic forms. Protein aggregates are a common hallmark of ALS regardless of cause making protein pathways attractive therapeutic targets in ALS. Here, we provide an overview of compounds in different stages of pharmacological development and their protein pathway targets.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents one of the major causes of death worldwide and leads to persisting neurological deficits in many of the survivors. One of the most significant long-term sequelae deriving from TBI is neurodegenerative disease, which is a group of incurable diseases that impose a heavy socio-economic burden. However, mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of TBI to neurodegenerative disease remain elusive. The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a functional unit composed of neurons, neuroglia, vascular cells, and the basal lamina matrix. The key role of NVU dysfunction in many central nervous system diseases has been revealed. Studies have proved the presence of prolonged structural and functional abnormalities of the NVU after TBI. Moreover, growing evidence suggests impaired NVU function is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we propose the Neurovascular Unit Dysfunction (NVUD) Hypothesis, in which the persistent NVU dysfunction is thought to underlie the development of post-TBI neurodegeneration. We deduce NVUD Hypothesis through relational inference and supporting evidence, and suggest continued NVU abnormalities following TBI serve as the pathophysiological substrate and trigger yielding chronic neuroinflammation, proteinopathies and oxidative stress, consequently leading to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The NVUD Hypothesis may provide potential treatment and prevention strategies for TBI and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxias (polyQ SCAs) include SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 and constitute a group of adult onset neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat sequence located within the coding region of specific genes, which translates into polyglutamine tract in the corresponding proteins. PolyQ SCAs are characterized by degeneration of the cerebellum and its associated structures and lead to progressive ataxia and other diverse symptoms. In recent years, gene and epigenetic deregulations have been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of polyQ SCAs. Here, we provide an overview of the functions of wild type and pathogenic polyQ SCA proteins in gene regulation, describe the extent and nature of gene expression changes and their pathological consequences in diseases, and discuss potential avenues to further investigate converging and distinct disease pathways and to develop therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Central nervous system (CNS) disorders especially neurodegenerative disorders are the major challenge for public health and demand the great attention of researchers to protect people against them. In past few decades, different treatment strategies have been adopted, but their therapeutic efficacy are not enough and have only shown partial mitigation of symptoms. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BSCFB) guard the CNS from harmful substances and pose as the major challenges in delivering drugs into CNS for treatment of CNS complications such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), stroke, epilepsy, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis (MS), and encephalitis, etc. Nanotechnology has come out as an exciting and promising new platform of treating neurological disorders and has shown great potential to overcome problems related to the conventional treatment approaches. Molecules can be nanoengineered to carry out multiple specific functions such as to cross the BBB, target specific cell or signaling pathway, respond to endogenous stimuli, and act as a vehicle for gene delivery, support nerve regeneration and cell survival. In present review, the role of nanocarrier systems such as liposomes, micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs), dendrimers, and nanoemulsions for delivery of various neurotherapeutic agents has been discussed, besides this, their mechanism of action, and nanoformulation of different neuroprotective agents like curcumin, edaravone, nerve growth factors in CNS disorders like Alzheimer’s, Parkinsonism, epilepsy, stroke, and brain tumors has been reviewed.</p>

<p>Stroke has a debilitating effect on the human body and a serious negative effect on society, with a global incidence of one in every six people. According to the World Health Organization, 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide each year. Of these, 5 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled. Motor and cognitive deficits like hemiparesis, paralysis, chronic pain, and psychomotor and behavioral symptoms can persist long term and prevent the patient from fully reintegrating into society, therefore continuing to add to the costly healthcare burden of stroke. Regenerative medicine using stem cells seems to be a panacea for sequelae after stroke. Stem cell-based therapy aids neuro-regeneration and neuroprotection for neurological recovery in patients. However, the use of stem cells as a therapy in stroke patients still needs a lot of research at both basic and translational levels. As well as the mode of action of stem cells in reversing the symptoms not being clear, there are several clinical parameters that need to be addressed before establishing stem cell therapy in stroke, such as the type of stem cells to be administered, the number of stem cells, the timing of dosage, whether dose-boosters are required, the route of administration, etc. There are upcoming prospects of cell-free therapy also by using exosomes derived from stem cells. There are several ongoing pre-clinical studies aiming to answer these questions. Despite still being in the development stage, stem cell therapy holds great potential for neurological rehabilitation in patients suffering from stroke.</p>

Objective<p>Previous studies showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves pain symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) patients when programmed for motor-symptom relief. One factor involved in pain processing is sensory perception of stimuli. With the advent of directional leads, we explore whether directional DBS affects quantitative sensory testing (QST) metrics acutely.</p>Methods<p>PD patients with subthalamic (STN) DBS and directional leads were tested in 5 settings (DBS-OFF, DBS-ON with omnidirectional stimulation, and DBS-ON) for each of three directional segments of contact used for clinical programming. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) assessed patient’s motor skills at time of study visit at clinical contact and at contact which produced optimal sensory threshold (defined by the greatest tolerance to mechanical stimuli). Correlation analyses were performed between stimulation parameters [amplitude, frequency, pulse width (PW), total electrical energy delivered (TEED)] and outcome metrics.</p>Results<p>Sensory thresholds were obtained in nine patients. Directional stimulation did not significantly alter patient perceptions of sensory stimulus [cold pain (p = 0.69), warm pain (p = 0.99), Von frey fibers (p = 0.09), pin-prick (p = 0.88), vibration (p = 0.40), pressure (p = 0.98)]. With correlation analysis, increasing PW at the posterior contact increased pin prick and vibration sensitivity (p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, an increase in TEED caused a decrease in sensitivity to warm detection when using the anterior (p = 0.04), lateral (p = 0.02), and medial contacts (p = 0.03), and also caused a decrease in sensitivity to cold detection when using the medial contact (p = 0.03). UPDRS-III remained stable during testing.</p>Conclusion<p>Motor benefit can be acutely maintained at directional contacts, whereas directional stimulation can modulate thermal and mechanical sensitivity. Further investigation will determine whether these changes are maintained chronically or can be improved with optimized programming.</p>

Background<p>High-frequency oscillation (HFO) represents a promising biomarker of epileptogenicity. However, the significant interindividual differences among patients limit its application in clinical practice. Here, we applied and evaluated an individualized, frequency-based approach of HFO analysis in stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data for localizing the epileptogenic zones (EZs).</p>Methods<p>Clinical and SEEG data of 19 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were retrospectively analyzed. The individualized spectral power of all signals recorded by electrode array, i.e., the relative strength of HFO, was computed with a wavelet method for each patient. Subsequently, the clinical value of the relative strength of HFO for identifying the EZ was evaluated.</p>Results<p>Focal increase in the relative strength of HFO in SEEG recordings were identified in all 19 patients. HFOs identified inside the clinically identified seizure onset zone had more spectral power than those identified outside (p &lt; 0.001), and HFOs in 250–500 Hz band (fast ripples) seemed to be more specific identifying the EZ than in those in 80–250 Hz band (ripples) (p &lt; 0.01). The resection of brain regions generating HFOs resulted in a favorable seizure outcome in 17 patients (17/19; 89.5%), while in the cases of other patients with poor outcomes, the brain regions generating HFOs were not removed completely.</p>Conclusion<p>The relative strength of HFO, especially fast ripples, is a promising effective biomarker for identifying the EZ and can lead to a favorable seizure outcome if used to guide epilepsy surgery.</p>

<p>The prevalence of obesity skyrocketed over the past decades to become a significant public health problem. Obesity is recognized as a low-grade inflammatory disease and is linked with several comorbidities such as diabetes, circulatory disease, common neurodegenerative diseases, as well as chronic pain. Adipocytes are a major neuroendocrine organ that continually, and systemically, releases pro-inflammatory factors. While the exact mechanisms driving obesity-induced pain remain poorly defined, nociceptor hypersensitivity may result from the systemic state of inflammation characteristic of obesity as well as weight surplus-induced mechanical stress. Obesity and pain also share various genetic mutations, lifestyle risk factors, and metabolic pathways. For instance, fat pads are often found hyper-innervated and rich in immune cell types of multiple origins. These immunocytes release cytokines, amplifying nociceptor function, which, in turn, via locally released neuropeptides, sustain immunocytes’ function. Here, we posit that along with mechanical stress stemming from extra weight, the local neuro-immune interplay occurring within the fat pads maintains the state of chronic low-grade inflammation and heightens sensory hypersensitivity. Overall, stopping such harmful neuro-immune crosstalk may constitute a novel pathway to prevent obesity-associated comorbidities, including neuronal hypersensitivity.</p>

<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can potentially enable people to non-invasively and directly communicate with others using brain activities. Artifacts generated from body activities (e.g., eyeblinks and teeth clenches) often contaminate EEGs and make EEG-based classification/identification hard. Although independent component analysis (ICA) is the gold-standard technique for attenuating the effects of such contamination, the estimated independent components are still mixed with artifactual and neuronal information because ICA relies only on the independence assumption. The same problem occurs when using independent vector analysis (IVA), an extended ICA method. To solve this problem, we designed an independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA)-based automatic artifact reduction technique that clearly models sources from observations under the independence assumption and a low-rank nature in the frequency domain. For automatic artifact reduction, we combined the signal separation technique with an independent component classifier for EEGs named ICLabel. To assess the comparative efficiency of the proposed method, the discriminabilities of artifact-reduced EEGs using ICA, IVA, and ILRMA were determined using an open-access EEG dataset named OpenBMI, which contains EEG data obtained through three BCI paradigms [motor-imagery (MI), event-related potential (ERP), and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)]. BCI performances were obtained using these three paradigms after applying artifact reduction techniques, and the results suggested that our proposed method has the potential to achieve higher discriminability than ICA and IVA for BCIs. In addition, artifact reduction using the ILRMA approach clearly improved (by over 70%) the averaged BCI performances using artifact-reduced data sufficiently for most needs of the BCI community. The extension of ICA families to supervised separation that leaves the discriminative ability would further improve the usability of BCIs for real-life environments in which artifacts frequently contaminate EEGs.</p>

<p>In the brain, there is a vast diversity of different structures, circuitries, cell types, and cellular genetic expression profiles. While this large diversity can often occlude a clear understanding of how the brain works, careful analyses of analogous studies performed across different brain areas can hint at commonalities in neuronal organization. This in turn can yield a fundamental understanding of necessary circuitry components that are crucial for how information is processed across the brain. In this review, we outline recent in vivo and in vitro studies that have been performed in different cortical areas to characterize the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and/or calretinin (CR)-expressing cells that specialize in inhibiting GABAergic interneurons. In doing so, we make the case that, across cortical structures, interneuron-specific cells commonly specialize in the synaptic disinhibition of excitatory neurons, which can ungate the integration and plasticity of external inputs onto excitatory neurons. In line with this, activation of interneuron- specific cells enhances animal performance across a variety of behavioral tasks that involve learning, memory formation, and sensory discrimination, and may represent a key target for therapeutic interventions under different pathological conditions. As such, interneuron-specific cells across different cortical structures are an essential network component for information processing and normal brain function.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00026">Neurophotonics Approaches for the Study of Pattern Separation</a></h4>

<p>Successful memory involves not only remembering over time but also keeping memories distinct. Computational models suggest that pattern separation appears as a highly efficient process to discriminate between overlapping memories. Furthermore, lesion studies have shown that the dentate gyrus (DG) participates in pattern separation. However, these manipulations did not allow identifying the neuronal mechanism underlying pattern separation. The development of different neurophotonics techniques, together with other genetic tools, has been useful for the study of the microcircuit involved in this process. It has been shown that less-overlapped information would generate distinct neuronal representations within the granule cells (GCs). However, because glutamatergic or GABAergic cells in the DG are not functionally or structurally homogeneous, identifying the specific role of the different subpopulations remains elusive. Then, understanding pattern separation requires the ability to manipulate a temporal and spatially specific subset of cells in the DG and ideally to analyze DG cells activity in individuals performing a pattern separation dependent behavioral task. Thus, neurophotonics and calcium imaging techniques in conjunction with activity-dependent promoters and high-resolution microscopy appear as important tools for this endeavor. In this work, we review how different neurophotonics techniques have been implemented in the elucidation of a neuronal network that supports pattern separation alone or in combination with traditional techniques. We discuss the limitation of these techniques and how other neurophotonic techniques could be used to complement the advances presented up to this date.</p>

<p>Microglia are brain macrophages that mediate neuroinflammation and contribute to and protect against neurodegeneration. The terminal sugar residue of all glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of mammalian cells is normally sialic acid, and addition of this negatively charged residue is known as “sialylation,” whereas removal by sialidases is known as “desialylation.” High sialylation of the neuronal cell surface inhibits microglial phagocytosis of such neurons, via: (i) activating sialic acid receptors (Siglecs) on microglia that inhibit phagocytosis and (ii) inhibiting binding of opsonins C1q, C3, and galectin-3. Microglial sialylation inhibits inflammatory activation of microglia via: (i) activating Siglec receptors CD22 and CD33 on microglia that inhibit phagocytosis and (ii) inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), complement receptor 3 (CR3), and other microglial receptors. When activated, microglia release a sialidase activity that desialylates both microglia and neurons, activating the microglia and rendering the neurons susceptible to phagocytosis. Activated microglia also release galectin-3 (Gal-3), which: (i) further activates microglia via binding to TLR4 and TREM2, (ii) binds to desialylated neurons opsonizing them for phagocytosis via Mer tyrosine kinase, and (iii) promotes Aβ aggregation and toxicity in vivo. Gal-3 and desialylation may increase in a variety of brain pathologies. Thus, Gal-3 and sialidases are potential treatment targets to prevent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Cuprizone (CPZ) is a chemical chelator toxic to mitochondria of cells. While inducing oligodendrocyte (OL) loss and demyelination, CPZ caused no fatal damage to the other brain cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in previous studies, suggesting differential susceptibility and vulnerability of brain cells to the CPZ intoxication. To demonstrate this interpretation, C57BL/6 mice were fed rodent chow without or with CPZ (0.2%, w/w) for 7 days. One day later, mitochondrial function of brain cells was assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) and biochemical analysis. Another batch of mice were processed to localize the CPZ-induced damage to mitochondrial DNA, label brain cells, and identify apoptotic cells. Compared to controls, CPZ-exposed mice showed significantly lower levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartate, phosphocreatine, and ATP detected by <sup>1</sup>H-MRS, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction in brain cells. Susceptibility analysis showed an order of OLs, microglia, and astrocytes from high to low, in terms of the proportion of 8-OHdG labeled cells in each type of these cells in corpus callosum. Vulnerability analysis showed the highest proportion of caspase-3 positive cells in labeled OLs in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where neurons showed no caspase-3 labeling, but the highest proportion of 8-OHdG labeling, indicating a lowest vulnerability but highest susceptibility to CPZ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Immature OLs, microglia, and astrocytes showed adaptive changes in proliferation and activation in response to CPZ-exposure. These data for the first time demonstrated the CPZ-induced mitochondria dysfunction in brain cells of living mouse and specified the differential susceptibility and vulnerability of brain cells to the CPZ intoxication.</p>

<p>Neurexins and neuroligins are common synaptic adhesion molecules that are associated with autism and interact with each other in the synaptic cleft. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) bouton is a well-known model system in neuroscience, and ghost and satellite boutons, respectively, indicate the poor development and overgrowth of the NMJ boutons. However, the Drosophila neurexin (DNrx) and Drosophila neuroligins (DNlgs) are mainly observed in type Ib boutons, indicating the ultrastructural and developmental phenotypes of the Drosophila NMJ. Here, we identified the ultrastructural and developmental features of ghost and satellite boutons by utilizing dneurexin (dnrx) and dneuroligins (dnlgs) fly mutants and other associated fly strains. Ghost boutons contain synaptic vesicles with multiple diameters but very rarely contain T-bar structures and swollen or thin subsynaptic reticulum (SSR) membranes. The muscle cell membrane is invaginated at different sites, stretches to the ghost bouton from different directions, forms several layers that enwrap the ghost bouton, and then branches into the complex SSR. Satellite boutons share a common SSR membrane and present either a typical profile in which a main bouton is encircled by small boutons or two atypical profiles in which the small boutons are grouped together or distributed in beads without a main bouton. Electron and confocal microscopy data showed that dnrx, dnlg1, dnlg2, dnlg3, and dnlg4 mutations led to ghost boutons; the overexpression of dnrx, dnlg1, dnlg2, dnlg3, and dnlg4 led to satellite boutons; and the dnlg2;dnlg3 double mutation also led to satellite boutons. These results suggested that DNrx and DNlgs jointly maintain the development and function of NMJ boutons by regulating the balance of ghost and satellite boutons in Drosophila.</p>

<p>Astrocytes have a high impact on the structure of the central nervous system, as they control neural activity, development, and plasticity. Heterogeneity of astrocytes has been shown before, but so far only a few studies have demonstrated heterogeneous morphology of astrocytes concerning aging. In this study, we examined morphologic differences of astrocyte subpopulations in adult mice and the progression of these differences with age. We surveyed astrocytes in olfactory bulb slices of mice aged 3 months, 1 year and 2 years (three animals each age group), based on their appearance in anti-GFAP immunostaining. Based on this data we established three different types of astrocytes: type I (stellate), type II (elliptic), and type III (squid-like). We found that with the advanced age of the mice, astrocytes grow in size and complexity. Major changes occurred between the ages of 3 months and 1 year, while between 1 and 2 years no significant development in cell size and complexity could be detected. Our results show that astrocytes in the olfactory bulb are heterogeneous and undergo morphological transformation until late adolescence but not upon senescence. Structural plasticity is further substantiated by the expression of vimentin in some astrocyte processes in all age groups.</p>

<p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is a disease of neurologic impairment that involves mechanisms of damage similar to other degenerative neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the current era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 replication is well-suppressed, and yet, HIV-1-infected patients still have high levels of chronic inflammation, indicating that factors other than viral replication are contributing to the development of neurocognitive impairment in these patients. The underlying mechanisms of HAND are still unknown, but the HIV-1 protein, Tat, has been highlighted as a potential viral product that contributes to the development of cognitive impairment. In AD, the presence of senescent cells in the CNS has been discussed as a contributing factor to the progression of cognitive decline and may be a mechanism also involved in the development of HAND. This mini-review discusses the viral protein HIV-1 Tat, and its potential to induce senescence in the CNS, contributing to the development of HAND.</p>

<p>Objective: To investigate the effect of telmisartan, rosuvastatin, or their combination on dementia and to understand the impact of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on the effect of the medications in older patients with hypertension.</p><p>Methods: This is a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial using a 2 × 2 factorial design. Between April 2008 and November 2010, 1,244 hypertensive patients aged ≥60 years without cognitive impairment were recruited from communities in six cities in Shandong area, China. Patients were randomized into telmisartan and rosuvastatin administration after a 2-week washout period. APOE genotype was identified at the baseline. Possible dementia was determined using the combination of the global cognitive function and Assessment of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE).</p><p>Results: Over an average follow-up of 7 [interquartile range (IQR): 6.7–7.2] years, telmisartan and rosuvastatin significantly reduced the cognitive impairment progression and the incidence of dementia. There was a synergistic interaction between telmisartan and rosuvastatin to reduce the cognitive impairment and the incidence of dementia (P<sub>adjusted</sub> &lt; 0.001).

<p>Astrocytes are the largest group of glial cells in the brain and participate in several essential functions of the central nervous system (CNS). Disruption of their normal physiological function can lead to metabolism disequilibrium and the pathology of CNS. As an important mechanism of aging, cellular senescence has been considered as a primary inducing factor of age-associated neurodegenerative disorders. Senescent astrocytes showed decreased normal physiological function and increased secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, which contribute to Aβ accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Astrocyte senescence also leads to a number of detrimental effects, including induced glutamate excitotoxicity, impaired synaptic plasticity, neural stem cell loss, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction.

<p>Demyelination in vascular dementia (VD) is partly attributable to inflammation induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Remyelination contributes to the recovery of cognitive impairment by inducing the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. It was previously reported that Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) promotes cognitive improvement. However, whether NBP can stimulate remyelination and suppress inflammation after CCH remains unclear. To answer this question, the present study investigated the effects of NBP on remyelination in a rat model of CCH established by bilateral carotid artery occlusion. Functional recovery was evaluated with the Morris water maze (MWM) test, and myelin integrity, regeneration of mature oligodendrocytes, and inhibition of astrocyte proliferation were assessed by immunohistochemistry and histologic analysis. Additionally, activation of 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Sirtuin (SIRT)1 and Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3/nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathways was evaluated by western blotting. The results showed that NBP treatment improved memory and learning performance in CCH rats, which was accompanied by increased myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte regeneration, and reduced astrocyte proliferation and inflammation. Additionally, NBP induced the activation of AMPK/SIRT1 signaling while inhibiting the STAT3/NF-κB pathway. These results indicate that NBP alleviates cognitive impairment following CCH by promoting remyelination and suppressing inflammation via modulation of AMPK/SIRT1 and STAT3/NF-κB signaling.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58039">G protein-regulated endocytic trafficking of adenylyl cyclase type 9</a></h4>

GPCRs are increasingly recognized to initiate signaling via heterotrimeric G proteins as they move through the endocytic network, but little is known about how relevant G protein effectors are localized. Here we report selective trafficking of adenylyl cyclase type 9 (AC9) from the plasma membrane to endosomes while adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1) remains in the plasma membrane, and stimulation of AC9 trafficking by ligand-induced activation of Gs-coupled GPCRs. AC9 transits a similar, dynamin-dependent early endocytic pathway as ligand-activated GPCRs. However, unlike GPCR traffic control which requires β-arrestin but not Gs, AC9 traffic control requires Gs but not β-arrestin. We also show that AC9, but not AC1, mediates cAMP production stimulated by endogenous receptor activation in endosomes. These results reveal dynamic and isoform-specific trafficking of adenylyl cyclase in the endocytic network, and a discrete role of a heterotrimeric G protein in regulating the subcellular distribution of a relevant effector.

Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are proteins whose expression is normally restricted to germ cells yet aberrantly activated in tumors, where their functions remain relatively cryptic. Here we report that ZNF165, a CT antigen frequently expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), associates with SMAD3 to modulate transcription of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-dependent genes and thereby promote growth and survival of human TNBC cells. In addition, we identify the KRAB zinc finger protein, ZNF446, and its associated tripartite motif protein, TRIM27, as obligate components of the ZNF165-SMAD3 complex that also support tumor cell viability. Importantly, we find that TRIM27 alone is necessary for ZNF165 transcriptional activity and is required for TNBC tumor growth <i>in vivo </i>using an orthotopic xenograft model in immunocompromised mice. Our findings indicate that aberrant expression of a testis-specific transcription factor is sufficient to co-opt somatic transcriptional machinery to drive a pro-tumorigenic gene expression program in TNBC.

Energy-coupling factor type (ECF-transporters) represent trace nutrient acquisition systems. Substrate binding components of ECF-transporters are membrane proteins with extraordinary affinity, allowing them to scavenge trace amounts of ligand. A number of molecules have been described as substrates of ECF-transporters, but an involvement in iron-acquisition is unknown. Host-induced iron limitation during infection represents an effective mechanism to limit bacterial proliferation. We identified the iron-regulated ECF-transporter Lha in the opportunistic bacterial pathogen <i>Staphylococcus lugdunensis</i> and show that the transporter is specific for heme. The recombinant substrate-specific subunit LhaS accepted heme from diverse host-derived hemoproteins. Using isogenic mutants and recombinant expression of Lha, we demonstrate that its function is independent of the canonical heme acquisition system Isd and allows proliferation on human cells as sources of nutrient iron. Our findings reveal a unique strategy of nutritional heme acquisition and provide the first example of an ECF-transporter involved in overcoming host-induced nutritional limitation.

Sister chromatid cohesion essential for mitotic chromosome segregation is thought to involve the co-entrapment of sister DNAs within cohesin rings. Although cohesin can load onto chromosomes throughout the cell cycle, it only builds cohesion during S phase. A key question is whether cohesion is generated by conversion of cohesin complexes associated with un-replicated DNAs ahead of replication forks into cohesive structures behind them, or from nucleoplasmic cohesin that is loaded de novo onto nascent DNAs associated with forks, a process that would be dependent on cohesin’s Scc2 subunit. We show here that in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, both mechanisms exist and that each requires a different set of replisome-associated proteins. Cohesion produced by cohesin conversion requires Tof1/Csm3, Ctf4 and Chl1 but not Scc2 while that created by Scc2-dependent de novo loading at replication forks requires the Ctf18-RFC complex. The association of specific replisome proteins with different types of cohesion establishment opens the way to a mechanistic understanding of an aspect of DNA replication unique to eukaryotic cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56469">Acute disruption of the synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptotagmin 1 using knockoff in mouse hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

The success of comparative cell biology for determining protein function relies on quality disruption techniques. Long-lived proteins, in postmitotic cells, are particularly difficult to eliminate. Moreover, cellular processes are notoriously adaptive; for example, neuronal synapses exhibit a high degree of plasticity. Ideally, protein disruption techniques should be both rapid and complete. Here, we describe knockoff, a generalizable method for the druggable control of membrane protein stability. We developed knockoff for neuronal use but show it also works in other cell types. Applying knockoff to synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) results in acute disruption of this protein, resulting in loss of synchronous neurotransmitter release with a concomitant increase in the spontaneous release rate, measured optically. Thus, SYT1 is not only the proximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast neurotransmitter release but also serves to clamp spontaneous release. Additionally, knockoff can be applied to protein domains as we show for another synaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin 1.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56344">A 10-year follow-up study of sex inclusion in the biological sciences</a></h4>

In 2016, to address the historical overrepresentation of male subjects in biomedical research, the US National Institutes of Health implemented a policy requiring investigators to consider sex as a biological variable. In order to assess the impact of this policy, we conducted a bibliometric analysis across nine biological disciplines for papers published in 34 journals in 2019, and compared our results with those of a similar study carried out by Beery and Zucker in 2009. There was a significant increase in the proportion of studies that included both sexes across all nine disciplines, but in eight of the disciplines there was no change in the proportion studies that included data analyzed by sex. The majority of studies failed to provide rationale for single-sex studies or the lack of sex-based analyses, and those that did relied on misconceptions surrounding the hormonal variability of females. Together, these data demonstrate that while sex-inclusive research practices are more commonplace, there are still gaps in analyses and reporting of data by sex in many biological disciplines.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55526">Delineating the early transcriptional specification of the mammalian trachea and esophagus</a></h4>

The genome-scale transcriptional programs that specify the mammalian trachea and esophagus are unknown. Though NKX2-1 and SOX2 are hypothesized to be co-repressive master regulators of tracheoesophageal fates, this is untested at a whole transcriptomic scale and their downstream networks remain unidentified. By combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with bulk RNA-sequencing of <i>Nkx2-1</i> mutants and NKX2-1 ChIP-sequencing in mouse embryos, we delineate the NKX2-1 transcriptional program in tracheoesophageal specification, and discover that the majority of the tracheal and esophageal transcriptome is NKX2-1 independent. To decouple the NKX2-1 transcriptional program from regulation by SOX2, we interrogate the expression of newly-identified tracheal and esophageal markers in <i>Sox2</i>/<i>Nkx2-1</i> compound mutants. Finally, we discover that NKX2-1 binds directly to <i>Shh</i> and <i>Wnt7b</i> and regulates their expression to control mesenchymal specification to cartilage and smooth muscle, coupling epithelial identity with mesenchymal specification. These findings create a new framework for understanding early tracheoesophageal fate specification at the genome-wide level.

Lecca et al. show that the lateral habenula (LHb) underlies threat-driven defensive behaviors in mice. LHb calcium dynamics increase when mice run away and decrease when mice remain immobile upon a threat presentation. Distinct cell clusters emerge in LHb during defensive strategies: some representing the action and others holding predictive power.

DiFiore et al. address whether the distinct methyl-lysine states catalyzed by Set2 on nucleosomes have unique or shared functions in transcription and other cellular processes. Their studies show that H3K36me1/2 and H3K36me3 act redundantly in many cellular contexts, including preventing antisense transcription during nutrient stress.

Lo et al. demonstrate that PRMT8 is localized at neuronal synapses and methylates the dendritic RNA-binding protein G3BP1. This promotes synapse maturation by regulating Rac1 and synaptic actin dynamics. Therefore, arginine methylation, a well-known protein modification in the nucleus, also acts in dendrites to control neuronal development.

Robert et al. show that Vangl2 is required for proper granule cell maturation, thus influencing network integration, and that Vangl2 absence in the hippocampus inversely modulates pattern completion and pattern separation. These findings demonstrate inter-independence of the two processes via Vangl2 control of the dentate gyrus network.

Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) preferentially originates from ER-negative luminal stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs). Christin et al. show that the transcription factor SOX9 acts as a key regulator for these LSPCs. Inactivation of BLBC tumor suppressors co-opt SOX9 upregulation to promote luminal-basal reprogramming and tumor progression.

Jackson-Weaver et al. show that PRMT1 drives epicardial invasion and differentiation in heart development. PRMT1 regulates splicing of Mdm4 and decreases p53 stability, which enhances Slug degradation to block epicardial EMT. The PRMT1-p53 axis is required for epicardial invasion and formation of epicardial-derived lineages during development.

For an improved versatility and reliability of 3D human brain organoids in modeling GBM, Goranci-Buzhala et al. established an array of methods that allow rapid and efficient assaying of glioma stem cell (GSC) invasion. Readouts described here can be used to study GSC invasion, integration, interaction with mature neurons, and drug screening.

With optogenetics, protein-protein interactions and cell signaling can be controlled with light. To allow user-defined illumination patterns to be projected onto cell cultures, Repina et al. designed programmable photostimulation devices called LAVA devices and use them to optogenetically induce patterns of Wnt signaling in human embryonic stem cells.

Vandehoef et al. show that the Drosophila homolog of NF-κB, Relish, can modulate diet-dependent shifts in intestinal microbiota composition through limiting the inducibility of 4E-BP/Thor. 4E-BP is a critical regulator of cap-dependent translation, which dictates host-microbiota associations in response to sugar-rich, protein-poor dietary imbalances.

Kawamura et al. find that the endocytic regulator Rab7 is required for gastrulation in mouse embryos. Rab7-dependent endocytosis participates in Wnt signaling activity by removal of the antagonist Dkk1. This study demonstrates that the endocytic pathway is essential for spatiotemporal patterning of Wnt signaling and plays a role in mammalian development.

Long-term directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can yield variable outcomes. Strano et al. assess variation in neural differentiation among PSC lines, revealing that variation occurs along developmental spatial and regional axes and depends on PSC-line-specific differences in endogenous Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which can be rescued exogenously.

Apoptosis is considered a complete event, efficiently killing cancer cells. Here, Berthenet et al. show that suboptimal apoptotic triggers can induce failed apoptosis, a process that enhances melanoma cancer cell aggressiveness. Moreover, failed apoptosis has a specific transcriptional signature regulated by JNK, which is enriched in metastatic melanoma.

Jones and Sheets show that a nerve injury model of chronic pain produces distinct changes to separate, but major, subclasses of GABAergic neurons in the prelimbic cortex. These changes are different between male and female mice and provide insight into how chronic pain alters brain circuits in a sex-specific manner.

Hence, nerve terminals have adapted a Golgin-like mechanism for vesicle capture and have spatially separated capture from exocytotic sites for regulation.

<p>by Hui Yu, Shilin Zhao, Scott Ness, Huining Kang, Quanhu Sheng, David C. Samuels, Olufunmilola Oyebamiji, Ying-yong Zhao, Yan Guo</p>

Very short tandem repeats bear substantial genetic, evolutional, and pathological significance in genome analyses. Here, we compiled a census of tandem mono-nucleotide/di-nucleotide/tri-nucleotide repeats (MNRs/DNRs/TNRs) in GRCh38, which we term “polytracts” in general. Of the human genome, 144.4 million nucleotides (4.7%) are occupied by polytracts, and 0.47 million single nucleotides are identified as polytract hinges, i.e., break-points of tandem polytracts. Preliminary exploration of the census suggested polytract hinge sites and boundaries of AAC polytracts may bear a higher mapping error rate than other polytract regions. Further, we revealed landscapes of polytract enrichment with respect to nearly a hundred genomic features. We found MNRs, DNRs, and TNRs displayed noticeable difference in terms of locational enrichment for miscellaneous genomic features, especially RNA editing events. Non-canonical and C-to-U RNA-editing events are enriched inside and/or adjacent to MNRs, while all categories of RNA-editing events are under-represented in DNRs. A-to-I RNA-editing events are generally under-represented in polytracts. The selective enrichment of non-canonical RNA-editing events within MNR adjacency provides a negative evidence against their authenticity. To enable similar locational enrichment analyses in relation to polytracts, we developed a software Polytrap which can handle 11 reference genomes. Additionally, we compiled polytracts of four model organisms into a Tract Hub which can be integrated into USCS Genome Browser as an official track for convenient visualization of polytracts.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TC2yPlj2Td4" width="1" />

The transition to daylight saving time (DST) is beneficial for energy conservation but at the same time it has been reported to increase the risk of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular problems. Here, we evaluate the effect of the DST shift on a whole spectrum of diseases—an analysis we hope will be helpful in weighing the risks and benefits of DST shifts. Our study relied on a population-based, cross-sectional analysis of the IBM Watson Health MarketScan insurance claim dataset, which incorporates over 150 million unique patients in the US, and the Swedish national inpatient register, which incorporates more than nine million unique Swedes. For hundreds of sex- and age-specific diseases, we assessed effects of the DST shifts forward and backward by one hour in spring and autumn by comparing the observed and expected diagnosis rates after DST shift exposure. We found four prominent, elevated risk clusters, including cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks), injuries, mental and behavioral disorders, and immune-related diseases such as noninfective enteritis and colitis to be significantly associated with DST shifts in the United States and Sweden. While the majority of disease risk elevations are modest (a few percent), a considerable number of diseases exhibit an approximately ten percent relative risk increase. We estimate that each spring DST shift is associated with negative health effects–with 150,000 incidences in the US, and 880,000 globally. We also identify for the first time a collection of diseases with relative risks that appear to decrease immediately after the spring DST shift, enriched with infections and immune system-related maladies. These diseases’ decreasing relative risks might be driven by the documented boosting effect of a short-term stress (such as that experienced around the spring DST shift) on the immune system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_88UCXPIUkI" width="1" />

The <i>K</i>* algorithm provably approximates partition functions for a set of states (e.g., protein, ligand, and protein-ligand complex) to a user-specified accuracy <i>ε</i>. Often, reaching an <i>ε</i>-approximation for a particular set of partition functions takes a prohibitive amount of time and space. To alleviate some of this cost, we introduce two new algorithms into the osprey suite for protein design: fries, a Fast Removal of Inadequately Energied Sequences, and <i>EWAK</i>*, an Energy Window Approximation to <i>K</i>*. fries pre-processes the sequence space to limit a design to only the most stable, energetically favorable sequence possibilities. <i>EWAK</i>* then takes this pruned sequence space as input and, using a user-specified energy window, calculates <i>K</i>* scores using the lowest energy conformations. We expect fries/<i>EWAK</i>* to be most useful in cases where there are many unstable sequences in the design sequence space and when users are satisfied with enumerating the low-energy ensemble of conformations. In combination, these algorithms provably retain calculational accuracy while limiting the input sequence space and the conformations included in each partition function calculation to only the most energetically favorable, effectively reducing runtime while still enriching for desirable sequences. This combined approach led to significant speed-ups compared to the previous state-of-the-art multi-sequence algorithm, <i>BBK</i>*, while maintaining its efficiency and accuracy, which we show across 40 different protein systems and a total of 2,826 protein design problems. Additionally, as a proof of concept, we used these new algorithms to redesign the protein-protein interface (PPI) of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. The Ras-binding domain of the protein kinase c-Raf (c-Raf-RBD) is the tightest known binder of KRas, a protein implicated in difficult-to-treat cancers. fries/<i>EWAK</i>* accurately retrospectively predicted the effect of 41 different sets of mutations in the PPI of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. Notably, these mutations include mutations whose effect had previously been incorrectly predicted using other computational methods. Next, we used fries/<i>EWAK</i>* for prospective design and discovered a novel point mutation that improves binding of c-Raf-RBD to KRas in its active, GTP-bound state (KRas<sup>GTP</sup>). We combined this new mutation with two previously reported mutations (which were highly-ranked by osprey) to create a new variant of c-Raf-RBD, c-Raf-RBD(RKY). fries/<i>EWAK</i>* in osprey computationally predicted that this new variant binds even more tightly than the previous best-binding variant, c-Raf-RBD(RK). We measured the binding affinity of c-Raf-RBD(RKY) using a bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay, and found that this new variant exhibits single-digit nanomolar affinity for KRas<sup>GTP</sup>, confirming the computational predictions made with fries/<i>EWAK</i>*. This new variant binds roughly five times more tightly than the previous best known binder and roughly 36 times more tightly than the design starting point (wild-type c-Raf-RBD). This study steps through the advancement and development of computational protein design by presenting theory, new algorithms, accurate retrospective designs, new prospective designs, and biochemical validation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pDB664ObOSc" width="1" />

The genetic adaptation of humans to the consumption of milk from dairying animals is one of the most emblematic cases of recent human evolution. While the phenotypic change under selection, lactase persistence (LP), is known, the evolutionary advantage conferred to persistent individuals remains obscure. One informative but underappreciated observation is that not all populations whose ancestors had access to milk genetically adapted to become lactase persistent. Indeed, Central Asian herders are mostly lactase nonpersistent, despite their significant dietary reliance on dairy products. Investigating the temporal dynamic of the −13.910:C&gt;T Eurasian mutation associated with LP, we found that, after its emergence in Ukraine 5,960 before present (BP), the T allele spread between 4,000 BP and 3,500 BP throughout Eurasia, from Spain to Kazakhstan. The timing and geographical progression of the mutation coincides well with the migration of steppe populations across and outside of Europe. After 3,000 BP, the mutation strongly increased in frequency in Europe, but not in Asia. We propose that Central Asian herders have adapted to milk consumption culturally, by fermentation, and/or by colonic adaptation, rather than genetically. Given the possibility of a nongenetic adaptation to avoid intestinal symptoms when consuming dairy products, the puzzle then becomes this: why has LP been selected for at all?<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vh1UQAS97XI" width="1" />

<p>by Roni O. Maimon Mor, Tamar R. Makin</p>

The potential ability of the human brain to represent an artificial limb as a body part (embodiment) has been inspiring engineers, clinicians, and scientists as a means to optimise human–machine interfaces. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we studied whether neural embodiment actually occurs in prosthesis users’ occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). Compared with controls, different prostheses types were visually represented more similarly to each other, relative to hands and tools, indicating the emergence of a dissociated prosthesis categorisation. Greater daily life prosthesis usage correlated positively with greater prosthesis categorisation. Moreover, when comparing prosthesis users’ representation of their own prosthesis to controls’ representation of a similar looking prosthesis, prosthesis users represented their own prosthesis more dissimilarly to hands, challenging current views of visual prosthesis embodiment. Our results reveal a use-dependent neural correlate for wearable technology adoption, demonstrating adaptive use–related plasticity within the OTC. Because these neural correlates were independent of the prostheses’ appearance and control, our findings offer new opportunities for prosthesis design by lifting restrictions imposed by the embodiment theory for artificial limbs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/H1ArChGLDVo" width="1" />

Lymphatic filariasis (LF) afflicts over 60 million people worldwide and leads to severe pathological outcomes in chronic cases. The nematode parasites (Nematoda: Filarioidea) that cause LF require both arthropod (mosquito) intermediate hosts and mammalian definitive hosts for their propagation. The invasion and migration of filarial worms through host tissues are complex and critical to survival, yet little is known about the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate directed migration in these medically important species. In order to better understand the role of chemosensory signaling in filarial worm taxis, we employ comparative genomics, transcriptomics, reverse genetics, and chemical approaches to identify putative chemosensory receptor proteins and perturb chemotaxis phenotypes in filarial worms. We find that chemoreceptor family size is correlated with the presence of environmental (extrahost) stages in nematode life cycles, and that filarial worms contain compact and highly diverged chemoreceptor complements and lineage-specific ion channels that are predicted to operate downstream of chemoreceptor activation. In <i>Brugia malayi</i>, an etiological agent of LF, chemoreceptor expression patterns correspond to distinct parasite migration events across the life cycle. To interrogate the role of chemosensation in the migration of larval worms, arthropod and mammalian infectious stage <i>Brugia</i> parasites were incubated in nicotinamide, an agonist of the nematode transient receptor potential (TRP) channel OSM-9. Exposure of microfilariae to nicotinamide alters intramosquito migration, and exposure of L3s reduces chemotaxis toward host-associated cues in vitro. Nicotinamide also potently modulates thermosensory responses in L3s, suggesting a polymodal sensory role for <i>Brugia osm-9</i>. Reverse genetic studies implicate both <i>Brugia osm-9</i> and the cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channel subunit <i>tax-4</i> in larval chemotaxis toward host serum, and these ion channel subunits partially rescue sensory defects in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans osm-9</i> and <i>tax-4</i> knock-out strains. Together, these data reveal genetic and functional diversification of chemosensory signaling proteins in filarial worms and encourage a more thorough investigation of clade- and parasite-specific facets of nematode sensory receptor biology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8K0z3sNB4sE" width="1" />

Zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) infections, such as those responsible for the current severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, cause grave international public health concern. In infected cells, the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). Although double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) appear to be a pan-CoV RO element, studies to date describe an assortment of additional CoV-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it remains unclear which RO element(s) accommodate viral RNA synthesis. Here we provide detailed 2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs and show that diverse CoVs essentially induce the same membrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs) previously thought to be restricted to gamma- and delta-CoV infections and proposed as sites of replication. Metabolic labeling of newly synthesized viral RNA followed by quantitative electron microscopy (EM) autoradiography revealed abundant viral RNA synthesis associated with DMVs in cells infected with the beta-CoVs Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV and the gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus. RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular or virus-induced structure. Our results provide a unifying model of the CoV RO and clearly establish DMVs as the central hub for viral RNA synthesis and a potential drug target in CoV infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vq0kB884ydE" width="1" />

Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are abundant antimicrobial T cells in humans and recognize antigens derived from the microbial riboflavin biosynthetic pathway presented by the MHC-Ib-related protein (MR1). However, the mechanisms responsible for MAIT cell antimicrobial activity are not fully understood, and the efficacy of these mechanisms against antibiotic resistant bacteria has not been explored. Here, we show that MAIT cells mediate MR1-restricted antimicrobial activity against <i>Escherichia coli</i> clinical strains in a manner dependent on the activity of cytolytic proteins but independent of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or induction of apoptosis in infected cells. The combined action of the pore-forming antimicrobial protein granulysin and the serine protease granzyme B released in response to T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated recognition of MR1-presented antigen is essential to mediate control against both cell-associated and free-living, extracellular forms of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. Furthermore, MAIT cell-mediated bacterial control extends to multidrug-resistant <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> primary clinical isolates additionally resistant to carbapenems, a class of last resort antibiotics. Notably, high levels of granulysin and granzyme B in the MAIT cell secretomes directly damage bacterial cells by increasing their permeability, rendering initially resistant <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> susceptible to the bactericidal activity of carbapenems. These findings define the role of cytolytic effector proteins in MAIT cell-mediated antimicrobial activity and indicate that granulysin and granzyme B synergize to restore carbapenem bactericidal activity and overcome carbapenem resistance in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LLLbEM92uH0" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pathogenic variants in <i>SCN3A </i>, encoding the voltage‐gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.3, cause severe childhood‐onset epilepsy and malformation of cortical development. Here, we define the spectrum of clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging features of <i>SCN3A </i>‐related neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were ascertained via an international collaborative network. We compared sodium channels containing wild‐type vs. variant Nav1.3 subunits co‐expressed with β1 and β2 subunits using whole‐cell voltage clamp electrophysiological recordings in a heterologous mammalian system (HEK‐293 T cells).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 22 patients with pathogenic <i>SCN3A </i> variants, most had treatment‐resistant epilepsy beginning in the first year of life (16/21, 76%; median onset, 2 weeks), with severe or profound developmental delay (15/20; 75%). Many, but not all (15/19; 79%), exhibited malformations of cortical development. Pathogenic variants clustered in transmembrane segments 4–6 of domains II‐IV. Most pathogenic missense variants tested (10/11; 91%) displayed gain of channel function, with increased persistent current and/or a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, and all variants associated with malformation of cortical development exhibited gain of channel function. One variant (p.Ile1468Arg) exhibited mixed effects, with gain and partial loss of function. Two variants demonstrated loss of channel function.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study defines <i>SCN3A‐ </i>related neurodevelopmental disorder along a spectrum of severity, but typically including epilepsy and severe or profound developmental delay/intellectual disability. Malformations of cortical development are a characteristic feature of this unusual channelopathy syndrome, present in over 75% of affected individuals. Gain of function at the channel level in developing neurons is likely an important mechanism of disease pathogenesis.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Here we present a flatmap of the mouse central nervous system (brain) and substantially enhanced flatmaps of the rat and human brain. Also included are enhanced representations of nervous system white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and an enhanced series of ten flatmaps showing different stages of rat brain development. The adult mouse and rat brain flatmaps provide layered diagrammatic representation of central nervous system divisions, according to their arrangement in corresponding reference atlases: Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4, rat) (Swanson, 2018), and the first version of the Allen Reference Atlas (mouse) (Dong, 2007). To facilitate comparative analysis, both flatmaps are scaled equally, and the divisional hierarchy of gray matter follows a topographic arrangement used in BM4. Also included with the mouse and rat brain flatmaps are cerebral cortex atlas level contours based on the reference atlases, and direct graphical and tabular comparison of regional parcellation. To encourage use of the brain flatmaps, they were designed and organized, with supporting reference tables, for ease‐of‐use and to be amenable to computational applications. We demonstrate how they can be adapted to represent novel parcellations resulting from experimental data, and we provide a proof‐of‐concept for how they could form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform. The mouse, rat, and human brain flatmap vector graphics files (Adobe Reader/Acrobat viewable and Adobe Illustrator editable) and supporting tables are provided open access; they constitute a broadly applicable neuroscience toolbox resource for researchers seeking to map and perform comparative analysis of brain data.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tanycytes are highly specialized ependymal cells that line the bottom and the lateral walls of the third ventricle. In contact with the cerebrospinal fluid through their cell bodies, they send processes into the arcuate nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus and the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>In the present work, we combined transgenic and immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the neuroanatomical associations between tanycytes and neural cells present in the hypothalamic parenchyma, in particular in the arcuate nucleus. The specific expression of tdTomato in tanycytes first allowed the observation of peculiar subcellular protrusions along tanycyte processes and at their endfeet such as spines, swelling, en passant boutons, boutons or claws. Interestingly, these protrusions contact different neural cells in the brain parenchyma including blood vessels and neurons, and in particular NPY and POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Using both fluorescent and electron microscopy, we finally observed that these tanycyte protrusions contain ribosomes, mitochondria, diverse vesicles, and transporters, suggesting dense tanycyte/neuron and tanycyte/blood vessel communications.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results lay the neuroanatomical basis for tanycyte/neural cell interactions, which will be useful to further understand cell‐to‐cell communications involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions.</p>

<p>Long‐term in vitro culture of neural stem cells (NSCs) resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes. The induction of four reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c‐Myc) could decrease expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes during the long‐term culture.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult stem cells age during long‐term <i>in vitro </i> culture, and neural stem cells (NSCs), which can self‐renew and differentiate into neurons and glial cells, also display reduced differentiation potential after repeated passaging. However, the mechanistic details underlying this process remain unclear. In this study, we found that long‐term in vitro culture of NSCs resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes, including the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)1β and IL6, the senescence‐associated enzyme matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), and the ER stress‐responsive transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). However, the cyclic and transient induction of four reprogramming factors (POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1, also known as octamer‐binding transcription factor 4; SRY [sex determining region Y]‐box 2; Kruppel‐like factor 4; and myelocytomatosis oncogene; collectively referred to as OSKM) can inhibit NSC aging, as indicated by the decreased expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes. We used ROSA‐4F NSCs, which express OSKM from only one allele, to minimize the potential for full reprogramming or tumor formation during NSC rejuvenation. We expect that this novel rejuvenation method will enhance the potential of NSCs as a clinical approach to the treatment of neurological diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is well known to be essential for declarative memory. However, a growing body of research suggests that MTL structures might be involved in perceptual processes as well. Our previous modeling work suggests that sensory representations in cortex influence the accuracy of episodic memory retrieved from the MTL. We adopt that model here to show that, conversely, episodic memory can also influence the quality of sensory representations. We model the effect of episodic memory as (a) repeatedly replaying episodes from memory and (b) recombining episode fragments to form novel sequences that are more informative for learning sensory representations than the original episodes. We demonstrate that the performance in visual discrimination tasks is superior when episodic memory is present and that this difference is due to episodic memory driving the learning of a more optimized sensory representation. We conclude that the MTL can, even if it has only a purely mnemonic function, influence perceptual discrimination indirectly.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, in part because the available treatments are inadequate and do not work for many people. The neurobiology of depression, and the mechanism of action of common antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is not well understood. One mechanism thought to underlie the effects of these drugs is upregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Evidence indicates that vesicular zinc is required for modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, at least under some circumstances. Vesicular zinc refers to zinc that is stored in the synaptic vesicles of certain neurons, including in the hippocampus, and released in response to neuronal activity. It can be eliminated from the brain by deletion of zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3), as is the case in ZnT3 knockout mice. Here, we examined the effects of repeated social defeat stress and subsequent chronic treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine on behavior and neurogenesis in ZnT3 knockout mice. We hypothesized that fluoxetine treatment would increase neurogenesis and reverse stress‐induced behavioral symptoms in wild type, but not ZnT3 knockout, mice. As anticipated, stress induced persistent depression‐like effects, including social avoidance and anxiety‐like behavior. Fluoxetine decreased social avoidance, though the effect was not specific to the stressed mice, but did not affect anxiety‐like behavior. Surprisingly, stress increased the survival of neurons born 1 day after the last episode of defeat stress. Fluoxetine treatment also increased cell survival, particularly in wild type mice, though it did not affect proliferation. Our results did not support our hypothesis that vesicular zinc is required for the behavioral benefits of fluoxetine treatment. As to whether vesicular zinc is required for the neurogenic effects of fluoxetine, our results were inconclusive, warranting further investigation into the role of vesicular zinc in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In rodents, pyramidal cell firing patterns from waking may be replayed in nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM) sleep during hippocampal sharp wave ripples (HC‐SWR). In humans, HC‐SWR have only been recorded with electrodes implanted to localize epileptogenicity. Here, we characterize human HC‐SWR with rigorous rejection of epileptiform activity, requiring multiple oscillations and coordinated sharp waves. We demonstrated typical SWR in those rare HC recordings which lack interictal epileptiform spikes (IIS) and with no or minimal seizure involvement. These HC‐SWR have a similar rate (~12 min<sup>−1</sup> on average, variable across NREM stages and anterior/posterior HC) and apparent intra‐HC topography (ripple maximum in putative stratum pyramidale, slow wave in radiatum) as rodents, though with lower frequency (~85 Hz compared to ~140 Hz in rodents). Similar SWR are found in HC with IIS, but no significant seizure involvement. These SWR were modulated by behavior, being largely absent (&lt;2 min<sup>−1</sup>) except during NREM sleep in both Stage 2 (~9 min<sup>−1</sup>) and Stage 3 (~15 min<sup>−1</sup>), distinguishing them from IIS. This study quantifies the basic characteristics of a strictly selected sample of SWR recorded in relatively healthy human hippocampi.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ventral portion of the rodent hippocampus (HPC; anterior in primates) has been implicated in the detection and resolution of approach–avoidance conflict, which arises when an organism encounters a stimulus that predicts both positive and negative outcomes. Previous work has found differential regulation of approach–avoidance conflict behavior by the CA3 and CA1 subfields, with inhibition of ventral CA3 increasing approach toward conflicting stimuli and inhibition of the ventral CA1 potentiating avoidance. Here, we sought to extend these findings by investigating the role of the dentate gyrus (DG), the input region of the HPC, in learned approach–avoidance conflict processing in rats. Animals were first trained to acquire three different visuotactile cue‐outcome associations in separate arms of a Y‐maze (appetitive, aversive, and neutral). Postacquisition, they were administered a “conflict test,” in which they were presented with a choice between exploring an arm in which the appetitive and aversive cues were concurrently presented (conflict stimulus), and another arm containing the neutral stimulus. GABAR‐mediated inactivation of the ventral DG, but not dorsal DG, potentiated approach behavior toward the conflict stimulus, similar to the effects of ventral CA3 inactivation. In contrast, dorsal DG, but not ventral DG, inactivation was found to impair performance on a metric spatial discrimination task, which is commonly used as a test of pattern separation. The findings of this study demonstrate a robust double dissociation between the ventral and dorsal aspects of the DG, in line with previous reports of functional differences along the longitudinal axis of the HPC.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus encodes distinct contexts with unique patterns of activity. Representational shifts with changes in context, referred to as remapping, have been extensively studied. However, less is known about transitions between representations. In this study, we leverage a large dataset of neuronal recordings taken while rats performed an olfactory memory task with a predictable temporal structure involving trials and intertrial intervals (ITIs), separated by salient boundaries at the trial start and trial end. We found that trial epochs were associated with stable hippocampal representations despite moment‐to‐moment variability in stimuli and behavior. Representations of trial and ITI epochs were far more distinct than spatial factors would predict and the transitions between the two were abrupt. The boundary was associated with a large spike in multiunit activity, with many individual cells specifically active at the start or end of each trial. Both epochs and boundaries were encoded by hippocampal populations, and these representations carried information on orthogonal axes readily identified using principal component analysis. We suggest that the hippocampus orthogonalizes representations of the trial and ITI epochs and the activity spike at trial boundaries might serve to drive hippocampal activity from one stable state to the other.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>α‐Thalassemia X‐linked intellectual disability (ATR‐X) syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the <i>ATRX </i> gene that encodes a SNF2‐type chromatin‐remodeling protein. The ATRX protein regulates chromatin structure and gene expression in the developing mouse brain and early inactivation leads to DNA replication stress, extensive cell death, and microcephaly. However, the outcome of <i>Atrx </i> loss of function postnatally in neurons is less well understood. We recently reported that conditional inactivation of <i>Atrx </i> in postnatal forebrain excitatory neurons (ATRX‐cKO) causes deficits in long‐term hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory. Thus, we hypothesized that ATRX‐cKO mice will display impaired hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity. In the present study, evoked field potentials and current source density analysis were recorded from a multichannel electrode in male, urethane‐anesthetized mice. Three major excitatory synapses, the Schaffer collaterals to basal dendrites and proximal apical dendrites, and the temporoammonic path to distal apical dendrites on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were assessed by their baseline synaptic transmission, including paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF) at 50‐ms interpulse interval, and by their long‐term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta‐frequency burst stimulation. Baseline single‐pulse excitatory response at each synapse did not differ between ATRX‐cKO and control mice, but baseline PPF was reduced at the CA1 basal dendritic synapse in ATRX‐cKO mice. While basal dendritic LTP of the first‐pulse excitatory response was not affected in ATRX‐cKO mice, proximal and distal apical dendritic LTP were marginally and significantly reduced, respectively. These results suggest that ATRX is required in excitatory neurons of the forebrain to achieve normal hippocampal LTP and PPF at the CA1 apical and basal dendritic synapses, respectively. Such alterations in hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity could explain the long‐term spatial memory deficits in ATRX‐cKO mice and provide insight into the physiological mechanisms underlying intellectual disability in ATR‐X syndrome patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23172?af=R">Characterization of hippocampal subfields using ex vivo MRI and histology data: Lessons for in vivo segmentation</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal subfield segmentation on in vivo MRI is of great interest for cognition, aging, and disease research. Extant subfield segmentation protocols have been based on neuroanatomical references, but these references often give limited information on anatomical variability. Moreover, there is generally a mismatch between the orientation of the histological sections and the often anisotropic coronal sections on in vivo MRI. To address these issues, we provide a detailed description of hippocampal anatomy using a postmortem dataset containing nine specimens of subjects with and without dementia, which underwent a 9.4 T MRI and histological processing. Postmortem MRI matched the typical orientation of in vivo images and segmentations were generated in MRI space, based on the registered annotated histological sections. We focus on the following topics: the order of appearance of subfields, the location of subfields relative to macroanatomical features, the location of subfields in the uncus and tail and the composition of the dark band, a hypointense layer visible in T2‐weighted MRI. Our main findings are that: (a) there is a consistent order of appearance of subfields in the hippocampal head, (b) the composition of subfields is not consistent in the anterior uncus, but more consistent in the posterior uncus, (c) the dark band consists only of the CA‐stratum lacunosum moleculare, not the strata moleculare of the dentate gyrus, (d) the subiculum/CA1 border is located at the middle of the width of the hippocampus in the body in coronal plane, but moves in a medial direction from anterior to posterior, and (e) the variable location and composition of subfields in the hippocampal tail can be brought back to a body‐like appearance when reslicing the MRI scan following the curvature of the tail. Our findings and this publicly available dataset will hopefully improve anatomical accuracy of future hippocampal subfield segmentation protocols.</p>

<p>Altered serotonin (5-HT) signaling is associated with multiple brain disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The presynaptic, high-affinity 5-HT transporter (SERT) tightly regulates 5-HT clearance after release from serotonergic neurons in the brain and enteric nervous systems, among other sites. Accumulating evidence suggests that SERT is dynamically regulated in distinct activity states as a result of environmental and intracellular stimuli, with regulation perturbed by disease-associated coding variants. Our lab identified a rare, hypermorphic SERT coding substitution, Gly56Ala, in subjects with ASD, finding that the Ala56 variant stabilizes a high-affinity outward-facing conformation (SERT<sup>∗</sup>) that leads to elevated 5-HT uptake in vitro and in vivo. Hyperactive SERT Ala56 appears to preclude further activity enhancements by p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and can be normalized by pharmacological p38α MAPK inhibition, consistent with SERT Ala56 mimicking, constitutively, a high-activity conformation entered into transiently by p38α MAPK activation. We hypothesize that changes in SERT-interacting proteins (SIPs) support the shift of SERT into the SERT<sup>∗</sup> state which may be captured by comparing the composition of SERT Ala56 protein complexes with those of wildtype (WT) SERT, defining specific interactions through comparisons of protein complexes recovered using preparations from SERT<sup>–/–</sup> (knockout; KO) mice. Using quantitative proteomic-based approaches, we identify a total of 459 SIPs, that demonstrate both SERT specificity and sensitivity to the Gly56Ala substitution, with a striking bias being a loss of SIP interactions with SERT Ala56 compared to WT SERT. Among this group are previously validated SIPs, such as flotillin-1 (FLOT1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), whose functions are believed to contribute to SERT microdomain localization and regulation. Interestingly, our studies nominate a number of novel SIPs implicated in ASD, including fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMR1) and SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 3 (SHANK3), of potential relevance to long-standing evidence of serotonergic contributions to ASD. Further investigation of these SIPs, and the broader networks they engage, may afford a greater understanding of ASD as well as other brain and peripheral disorders associated with perturbed 5-HT signaling.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00049">Emergence of Mixed Mode Oscillations in Random Networks of Diverse Excitable Neurons: The Role of Neighbors and Electrical Coupling</a></h4>

<p>In this paper, we focus on the emergence of diverse neuronal oscillations arising in a mixed population of neurons with different excitability properties. These properties produce mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) characterized by the combination of large amplitudes and alternate subthreshold or small amplitude oscillations. Considering the biophysically plausible, Izhikevich neuron model, we demonstrate that various MMOs, including MMBOs (mixed mode bursting oscillations) and synchronized tonic spiking appear in a randomly connected network of neurons, where a fraction of them is in a quiescent (silent) state and the rest in self-oscillatory (firing) states. We show that MMOs and other patterns of neural activity depend on the number of oscillatory neighbors of quiescent nodes and on electrical coupling strengths. Our results are verified by constructing a reduced-order network model and supported by systematic bifurcation diagrams as well as for a small-world network. Our results suggest that, for weak couplings, MMOs appear due to the de-synchronization of a large number of quiescent neurons in the networks. The quiescent neurons together with the firing neurons produce high frequency oscillations and bursting activity. The overarching goal is to uncover a favorable network architecture and suitable parameter spaces where Izhikevich model neurons generate diverse responses ranging from MMOs to tonic spiking.</p>

<p>Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver condition characterized by a significant accumulation of lipids in the liver without excessive alcohol consumption. Accumulating evidence suggests a significantly increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in NAFLD patients. However, it remains poorly understood whether and how NAFLD affects the outcome of hemorrhagic brain injury. Here, we examined the effects of diet-induce NAFLD on ICH injury and neuroinflammation in mice.</p><p>Methods: NAFLD was induced in C57BL/6 mice by feeding with a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks. Collagenase and autologous blood models were used to evaluate the effects of NAFLD on ICH injury and neuroinflammation.</p><p>Results: MCD diet for 4 weeks induces NAFLD and hyperlipidemia in mice. Mice receiving the MCD diet have aggravated neurological deficits and brain edema after ICH. The augmentation of ICH injury was accompanied by brain infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes and increased production of pro-inflammatory factors. Before ICH, MCD diet-induced mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes in the periphery. Notably, the detrimental effects of NAFLD on ICH injury was ablated in mice receiving antibody depletion of neutrophils and monocytes.</p><p>Conclusions: These results suggest that NAFLD exacerbates neuroinflammation and ICH injury.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00147">A Novel Major Output Target for Pheromone-Sensitive Projection Neurons in Male Moths</a></h4>

<p>Even though insects have comparably small brains, they achieve astoundingly complex behaviors. One example is flying moths tracking minute amounts of pheromones using olfactory circuits. The tracking distance can be up to 1 km, which makes it essential that male moths respond efficiently and reliably to very few pheromone molecules. The male-specific macroglomerular complex (MGC) in the moth antennal lobe contains circuitry dedicated to pheromone processing. Output neurons from this region project along three parallel pathways, the medial, mediolateral, and lateral tracts. The MGC-neurons of the lateral tract are least described and their functional significance is mainly unknown. We used mass staining, calcium imaging, and intracellular recording/staining to characterize the morphological and physiological properties of these neurons in the noctuid moth, Helicoverpa armigera. All lateral-tract MGC neurons targeted the column, a small region within the superior intermediate neuropil. We identified this region as a unique converging site for MGC lateral-tract neurons responsive to pheromones, as well as a dense congregating site for plant odor information since a substantial number of lateral-tract neurons from ordinary glomeruli (OG) also terminates in this region. The lateral-tract MGC-neurons responded with a shorter peak latency than the well-described neurons in the medial tract. Different from the medial-tract MGC neurons encoding odor quality important for species-specific signal identification, those in the lateral tract convey a more robust and rapid signal—potentially important for fast control of hard-wired behavior.</p>

The supplementary motor area is believed to guide action by “looking ahead” in time. Russo et al. formalize this idea and predict a basic property that neural activity must have to serve that purpose. That property is present, explains diverse features of activity, and distinguishes higher- from lower-level motor areas.

<p>Dysregulated expression of several <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variant mRNAs in the medial prefrontal cortex of male human heroin abusers was recaptured in heroin self‐administering male rats, suggesting potential roles of the <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variants in heroin addiction that could be mechanistically explored using the rat heroin self‐administration model.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Heroin, a mu agonist, acts through the mu opioid receptor. The mu opioid receptor gene, <i>OPRM1, </i> undergoes extensive alternative splicing, creating an array of splice variants that are conserved from rodent to humans. Increasing evidence suggests that these <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variants are pharmacologically important in mediating various actions of mu opioids, including analgesia, tolerance, physical dependence, rewarding behavior, as well as addiction. In the present study, we examine expression of the <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variant mRNAs in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), one of the major brain regions involved in decision‐making and drug‐seeking behaviors, of male human heroin abusers and male rats that developed stable heroin‐seeking behavior using an intravenous heroin self‐administration (SA) model. The results show similar expression profiles among multiple <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variants in both human control subjects and saline control rats, illustrating conservation of <i>OPRM1 </i> alternative splicing from rodent to humans. Moreover, the expressions of several <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variant mRNAs were dysregulated in the postmortem mPFCs from heroin abusers compared to the control subjects. Similar patterns were observed in the rat heroin SA model. These findings suggest potential roles of the <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variants in heroin addiction that could be mechanistically explored using the rat heroin SA model.</p>

<p>We examined the effects of zonisamide on transplanted human dopaminergic neurons in the rat striatum and found that zonisamide facilitates the survival of dopamine neurons, an effect that may be related to an increase in the expression of SLIT‐and NTRK‐like protein 6 in rat striatum.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transplantation of dopaminergic (DA) progenitors derived from pluripotent stem cells improves the behavior of Parkinson's disease model animals. However, the survival of DA progenitors is low, and the final yield of DA neurons is only approximately 0.3%–2% the number of transplanted cells. Zonisamide (ZNS) increases the number of survived DA neurons upon the transplantation of mouse‐induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell‐derived DA progenitors in the rat striatum. In this study, we induced DA progenitors from human iPS cells and transplanted them into the striatum of female rats with daily administration of ZNS. The number of survived DA neurons was evaluated 1 and 4 months after transplantation by immunohistochemistry, which revealed that the number of survived DA neurons was significantly increased with the administration of ZNS. To assess the mechanism of action of ZNS, we performed a gene expression analysis to compare the gene expression profiles in striatum treated with or without ZNS. The analysis revealed that the expression of SLIT‐and NTRK‐like protein 6 (SLITRK6) was upregulated in rat striatum treated with ZNS. In conclusion, ZNS promotes the survival of DA neurons after the transplantation of human‐iPS cell‐derived DA progenitors in the rat striatum. SLITRK6 is suggested to be involved in this supportive effect of ZNS by modulating the environment of the host brain.</p>

<p>In less than 6 months, the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus type 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has spread worldwide infecting nearly 6 million people and killing over 350,000. Initially thought to be restricted to the respiratory system, we now understand that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) also involves multiple other organs including the central and peripheral nervous system. The number of recognized neurologic manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is rapidly accumulating. These may result from a variety of mechanisms including virus‐induced hyper‐inflammatory and hypercoagulable states, direct virus infection of the CNS, and post‐infectious immune mediated processes. Example of COVID‐19 CNS disease include encephalopathy, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis and endothelialitis. In the peripheral nervous system COVID‐19 is associated with dysfunction of smell and taste, muscle injury, the Guillain‐Barre syndrome and its variants. Due to its worldwide distribution and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, COVID‐19 poses a global threat to the entire nervous system. While our understanding of SARS‐CoV‐2 neuropathogenesis is still incomplete and our knowledge is evolving rapidly, we hope that this review will provide a useful framework and help neurologists in understanding the many neurologic facets of COVID‐19.</p>

<p>The identification of progression in multiple sclerosis is typically retrospective. Given the profound burden of progressive multiple sclerosis, and the recent development of effective treatments for these patients, there is a need to establish measures capable of identifying progressive multiple sclerosis early in the disease course. Starting from recent pathological findings, this review assesses the state‐of‐the‐art of potential measures able to predict progressive multiple sclerosis. Future promising biomarkers, that might shed light on mechanisms of progression are also discussed. Finally, expansion of the concept of progressive multiple sclerosis, by including an assessment of cognition, patient‐reported outcomes and comorbidities, is considered.</p>

<p>by Yu Hu, Kai Wang, Mingyao Li</p>

The emergence of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology has made it possible to measure gene expression variations at cellular level. This breakthrough enables the investigation of a wider range of problems including analysis of splicing heterogeneity among individual cells. However, compared to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq data are much noisier due to high technical variability and low sequencing depth. Here we propose SCATS (Single-Cell Analysis of Transcript Splicing) for differential splicing analysis in scRNA-seq, which achieves high sensitivity at low coverage by accounting for technical noise. SCATS models scRNA-seq data either with or without Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). For non-UMI data, SCATS explicitly models technical noise by accounting for capture efficiency and amplification bias through the use of external spike-ins; for UMI data, SCATS models capture efficiency and further accounts for transcriptional burstiness. A key aspect of SCATS lies in its ability to group “exons” that originate from the same isoform(s). Grouping exons is essential in splicing analysis of scRNA-seq data as it naturally aggregates spliced reads across different exons, making it possible to detect splicing events even when sequencing depth is low. To evaluate the performance of SCATS, we analyzed both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets and compared with existing methods including Census and DEXSeq. We show that SCATS has well controlled type I error rate, and is more powerful than existing methods, especially when splicing difference is small. In contrast, Census suffers from severe type I error inflation, whereas DEXSeq is more conservative. When applied to mouse brain scRNA-seq datasets, SCATS identified more differential splicing events with subtle difference across cell types compared to Census and DEXSeq. With the increasing adoption of scRNA-seq, we believe SCATS will be well-suited for various splicing studies. The implementation of SCATS can be downloaded from https://github.com/huyustats/SCATS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4NVGgnWxTVw" width="1" />

Ventricular contraction is roughly proportional to the amount of calcium released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR) during systole. While it is rather straightforward to measure calcium levels and contractibility under different physiological conditions, the complexity of calcium handling during systole and diastole has made the prediction of its release at steady state impossible. Here we approach the problem analyzing the evolution of intracellular and extracellular calcium fluxes during a single beat which is away from homeostatic balance. Using an in-silico subcellular model of rabbit ventricular myocyte, we show that the high dimensional nonlinear problem of finding the steady state can be reduced to a two-variable general equilibrium condition where pre-systolic calcium level in the cytosol and in the SR must fulfill simultaneously two different equalities. This renders calcium homeostasis as a problem that can be studied in terms of its equilibrium structure, leading to precise predictions of steady state from single-beat measurements. We show how changes in ion channels modify the general equilibrium, as shocks would do in general equilibrium macroeconomic models. This allows us to predict when an enhanced entrance of calcium in the cell reduces its contractibility and explain why SERCA gene therapy, a change in calcium handling to treat heart failure, might fail to improve contraction even when it successfully increases SERCA expression.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mu2DBZQtspw" width="1" />

Group A <i>Streptococcus</i> (GAS) skin infections are caused by a diverse array of strain types and are highly prevalent in disadvantaged populations. The role of strain-specific immunity in preventing GAS infections is poorly understood, representing a critical knowledge gap in vaccine development. A recent GAS murine challenge study showed evidence that sterilising strain-specific and enduring immunity required two skin infections by the same GAS strain within three weeks. This mechanism of developing enduring immunity may be a significant impediment to the accumulation of immunity in populations. We used an agent-based mathematical model of GAS transmission to investigate the epidemiological consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity developing only after two infections with the same strain within a specified interval. Accounting for uncertainty when correlating murine timeframes to humans, we varied this maximum inter-infection interval from 3 to 420 weeks to assess its impact on prevalence and strain diversity, and considered additional scenarios where no maximum inter-infection interval was specified. Model outputs were compared with longitudinal GAS surveillance observations from northern Australia, a region with endemic infection. We also assessed the likely impact of a targeted strain-specific multivalent vaccine in this context. Our model produced patterns of transmission consistent with observations when the maximum inter-infection interval for developing enduring immunity was 19 weeks. Our vaccine analysis suggests that the leading multivalent GAS vaccine may have limited impact on the prevalence of GAS in populations in northern Australia if strain-specific immunity requires repeated episodes of infection. Our results suggest that observed GAS epidemiology from disease endemic settings is consistent with enduring strain-specific immunity being dependent on repeated infections with the same strain, and provide additional motivation for relevant human studies to confirm the human immune response to GAS skin infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47TFyc1oQ4k" width="1" />

Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular lesions predominantly developing in the central nervous system (CNS), with no effective treatments other than surgery. Loss-of-function mutation in CCM1/krev interaction trapped 1 (KRIT1), CCM2, or CCM3/programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) causes lesions that are characterized by abnormal vascular integrity. Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), a major regulator of endothelial cell (EC) junctional integrity is strongly disorganized in ECs lining the CCM lesions. We report here that microRNA-27a (miR-27a), a negative regulator of VE-cadherin, is elevated in ECs isolated from mouse brains developing early CCM lesions and in cultured ECs with CCM1 or CCM2 depletion. Furthermore, we show miR-27a acts downstream of kruppel-like factor (KLF)2 and KLF4, two known key transcription factors involved in CCM lesion development. Using CD5-2 (a target site blocker [TSB]) to prevent the miR-27a/VE-cadherin mRNA interaction, we present a potential therapy to increase VE-cadherin expression and thus rescue the abnormal vascular integrity. In CCM1- or CCM2-depleted ECs, CD5-2 reduces monolayer permeability, and in <i>Ccm1</i> heterozygous mice, it restores dermal vessel barrier function. In a neonatal mouse model of CCM disease, CD5-2 normalizes vasculature and reduces vascular leakage in the lesions, inhibits the development of large lesions, and significantly reduces the size of established lesions in the hindbrain. Furthermore, CD5-2 limits the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lesion area. Our work has established that VE-cadherin is a potential therapeutic target for normalization of the vasculature and highlights that targeting miR-27a/VE-cadherin interaction by CD5-2 is a potential novel therapy for the devastating disease, CCM.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/a7Bn3ZKf8Nc" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Cataglyphis </i> ants are known for their outstanding navigational abilities. They return to their inconspicuous nest after far‐reaching foraging trips using path integration, and whenever available, learn and memorize visual features of panoramic sceneries. To achieve this, the ants combine directional visual information from celestial cues and panoramic scenes with distance information from an intrinsic odometer. The largely vision‐based navigation in <i>Cataglyphis </i> requires sophisticated neuronal networks to process the broad repertoire of visual stimuli. Although <i>Cataglyphis </i> ants have been subjected to many neuroethological studies, little is known about the general neuronal organization of their central brain and the visual pathways beyond major circuits. Here, we provide a comprehensive, three‐dimensional neuronal map of synapse‐rich neuropils in the brain of <i>Cataglyphis nodus </i> including major connecting fiber systems. In addition, we examined neuronal tracts underlying the processing of visual information in more detail. This study revealed a total of 33 brain neuropils and 30 neuronal fiber tracts including six distinct tracts between the optic lobes and the cerebrum. We also discuss the importance of comparative studies on insect brain architecture for a profound understanding of neuronal networks and their function.</p>

<p>Neoplastic or dysplastic neuronal tissue in the brain stem and cerebellum can become epileptogenic in pediatric patients. However, it is unknown whether such tissue may transform intrinsic properties of the human cerebellum, making it capable of generating epileptic population activity. We noninvasively detected epileptiform signals unaveraged in a pediatric patient with epilepsy due to a tumor in the middle cerebellar peduncle. Analysis of generators of the signals revealed that the cerebellum ipsilateral and contralateral to the tumor was the dominant interictal spike generator and could initiate ictal activity, suggesting that human cerebellum may become capable of intrinsically generating epileptic activity.

<p>The modification of methyltransferase-like (METTL) enzymes plays important roles in various cellular responses by regulating microRNA expression. However, how m6A modification is involved in stress granule (SG) formation in the early stage of acute ischemic stroke by affecting the biogenesis processing of microRNAs remains unclear. Here, we established a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells to explore the potential mechanism between m6A modification and SG formation. The in vivo results showed that the level of infarction and apoptosis increased while SG formation decreased significantly within the ischemic cortex with improved reperfusion time after 2 h of ischemia. Consistent with the in vivo data, an inverse association between the apoptosis level and SG formation was observed in PC12 cells during the reperfusion period after 6 h of OGD stimulation. Both in vivo and in vitro results showed that the expression of METTL3 protein, m6A and miR-335 was significantly decreased with the reperfusion period. Overexpression of the METTL3 and METTL3 gene-knockdown in PC12 cells were achieved via plasmid transfection and CRISPR-Cas9 technology, respectively. Overexpression or knockdown of METTL3 in oxygen-glucose deprivation of PC12 cells resulted in functional maturation of miR-335, SG formation and apoptosis levels. In addition, we found that miR-335 enhanced SG formation through degradation of the mRNA of the eukaryotic translation termination factor (Erf1). In conclusion, we found that METTL3-mediated m6A methylation increases the maturation of miR-335, which promotes SG formation and reduces the apoptosis level of injury neurons and cells, and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for AIS.</p>

<p>Background: Hypothermia attenuates microglial activation and exerts a potential neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this in vitro study, a model of oxygen-glucose deprivation, followed by recovery (OGD/R), was used to investigate whether hypothermia exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis properties via enhanced ubiquitination and down-regulation of voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3) expression.</p><p>Methods: BV2 microglia were cultured under OGD for 4 h following reperfusion with or without hypothermia for 2, 4, or 8 h. M1 and M2 microglia markers [inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase (Arg)1] were detected using immunofluorescence. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL)-1β], and anti-inflammatory factor (IL-10) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was assayed by JC-1 staining using a flow cytometer. Expression of caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and VDAC3 were assessed using western blot analysis. The cellular locations and interactions of ubiquitin and VDAC3 were identified using double immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. Also, the level of the VDAC3 mRNA was determined using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).</p><p>Results: Hypothermia inhibited the OGD/R–induced microglia activation and differentiation into the M1 type with pro-inflammatory effect, whereas it promoted differentiation to the M2 type with anti-inflammatory effect. Hypothermia attenuated OGD/R-induced loss of Δψm, as well as the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. Compared to normothermia, hypothermia increased the level of ubiquitinated VDAC3 in the BV2 microglia at both 2 and 8 h of reperfusion. Furthermore, hypothermia did not attenuate VDAC3 mRNA expression in OGD/R-induced microglia.</p><p>Conclusions: Hypothermia treatment during reperfusion, attenuated OGD/R-induced inflammation, and apoptosis in BV2 microglia. This might be due to the promotion of VDAC3 ubiquitination, identifying VDAC3 as a new target of hypothermia.</p>

<p>Epileptogenesis is a common consequence of brain insults, however, the prevention or delay of the epileptogenic process remains an important unmet medical challenge. Overexpression of glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) is proposed as a pathological hallmark in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and we previously demonstrated in rodent epilepsy models that augmentation of glycine suppressed chronic seizures and altered acute seizure thresholds. In the present study we evaluated the effect of the GlyT1 inhibitor, sarcosine (aka N-methylglycine), on epileptogenesis and also investigated possible mechanisms. We developed a modified rapid kindling model of epileptogenesis in rats combined with seizure score monitoring to evaluate the antiepileptogenic effect of sarcosine. We used immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis for the evaluation of GlyT1 expression and epigenetic changes of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in the epileptogenic hippocampi of rats, and further evaluated expression changes in enzymes involved in the regulation of DNA methylation, ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1), DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), and DNMT3a. Our results demonstrated: (i) experimental evidence that sarcosine (3 g/kg, i.p. daily) suppressed kindling epileptogenesis in rats; (ii) the sarcosine-induced antiepileptogenic effect was accompanied by a suppressed hippocampal GlyT1 expression as well as a reduction of hippocampal 5mC levels and a corresponding increase in 5hmC; and (iii) sarcosine treatment caused differential expression changes of TET1 and DNMTs. Together, these findings suggest that sarcosine has unprecedented disease-modifying properties in a kindling model of epileptogenesis in rats, which was associated with altered hippocampal DNA methylation. Thus, manipulation of the glycine system is a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate the development of epilepsy.</p>

<p>Progressive functional deterioration and loss of neurons underlies neurological diseases and constitutes an important cause of disability and death worldwide. The causes of various types of neurological diseases often share several critical nerve-related cellular mechanisms and pathological features, particularly the neuroinflammatory response in the nervous system. A rapidly growing body of evidence indicates that various microRNAs play pivotal roles in these processes in neurological diseases and might be viable therapeutic targets. Among these microRNAs, microRNA-146a (miR-146a) stands out due to the rapid increase in recent literature on its mechanistic involvement in neurological diseases. In this review, we summarize and highlight the critical role of miR-146a in neurological diseases. MiR-146a polymorphisms are associated with the risk of neurological disease. Alterations in miR-146a expression levels are crucial events in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological diseases that are spatially and temporally diverse. Additionally, the target genes of miR-146a are involved in the regulation of pathophysiological processes in neurological diseases, particularly the neuroinflammatory response. In summary, miR-146a mainly plays a critical role in neuroinflammation during the progression of neurological diseases and might be a prospective biomarker and therapeutic target. Understanding the mechanisms by which miR-146a affects the neuroinflammatory response in different neurological injuries, different cell types, and even different stages of certain neurological diseases will pave the way for its use as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Although many scholars deem non-invasive measures of neurophysiology to have promise in assessing learning, these measures are currently not widely applied, neither in educational settings nor in training. How can non-invasive neurophysiology provide insight into learning and how should research on this topic move forward to ensure valid applications? The current article addresses these questions by discussing the mechanisms underlying neurophysiological changes during learning followed by a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis of non-invasive neurophysiology in learning and training. This type of analysis can provide a structured examination of factors relevant to the current state and future of a field. The findings of the SWOT analysis indicate that the field of neurophysiology in learning and training is developing rapidly. By leveraging the opportunities of neurophysiology in learning and training (while bearing in mind weaknesses, threats, and strengths) the field can move forward in promising directions. Suggestions for opportunities for future work are provided to ensure valid and effective application of non-invasive neurophysiology in a wide range of learning and training settings.</p>

<p>To summarize the distribution of glioma location within a patient population, registration of individual MR images to anatomical reference space is required. In this study, we quantified the accuracy of MR image registration to anatomical reference space with linear and non-linear transformations using estimated tumor targets of glioblastoma and lower-grade glioma, and anatomical landmarks at pre- and post-operative time-points using six commonly used registration packages (FSL, SPM5, DARTEL, ANTs, Elastix, and NiftyReg). Routine clinical pre- and post-operative, post-contrast T1-weighted images of 20 patients with glioblastoma and 20 with lower-grade glioma were collected. The 2009a Montreal Neurological Institute brain template was used as anatomical reference space. Tumors were manually segmented in the patient space and corresponding healthy tissue was delineated as a target volume in the anatomical reference space. Accuracy of the tumor alignment was quantified using the Dice score and the Hausdorff distance. To measure the accuracy of general brain alignment, anatomical landmarks were placed in patient and in anatomical reference space, and the landmark distance after registration was quantified. Lower-grade gliomas were registered more accurately than glioblastoma. Registration accuracy for pre- and post-operative MR images did not differ. SPM5 and DARTEL registered tumors most accurate, and FSL least accurate. Non-linear transformations resulted in more accurate general brain alignment than linear transformations, but tumor alignment was similar between linear and non-linear transformation. We conclude that linear transformation suffices to summarize glioma locations in anatomical reference space.</p>

<p>Aging is the major risk factor of the most common (∼95% of cases) sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Accumulating data indicate middle age as a critical period for the relevant pathological processes, however, the question of when AD starts to develop remains open. It has been reported only recently that in the early postnatal period—when brain development is completing—preconditions for a decrease in cognitive abilities and for accelerated aging can form. Here, we hypothesized that specific features of early postnatal brain development may be considered some of the prerequisites of AD development at an advanced age. To test this hypothesis, we used OXYS rats, which are a suitable model of sporadic AD. The duration of gestation, litter size, and weight at birth were lower in OXYS rats compared to control Wistar rats. The shortened duration of gestation may result in developmental retardation. Indeed, we noted decreased locomotor activity and increased anxiety in OXYS rats already at a young age: possible signs of altered brain development. We demonstrated retardation of the peak of postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of OXYS rats. Delayed neuronal maturation led to alterations of mossy-fiber formation: a shortened suprapyramidal bundle and longer infrapyramidal bundle, less pronounced fasciculation of granule cells’ axons, and smaller size and irregular shape of nuclei in the CA3 pyramidal layer. These changes were accompanied by altered astrocytic migration. The observed features of early development may be considered some of the risk factors of the AD-like pathology that manifests itself in OXYS rats late in life.</p>

<p>Dysfunction within large-scale brain networks as the basis for movement disorders is an accepted hypothesis. The treatment options for restoring network function are limited. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation are now being studied to modify the network. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is also a portable, cost-effective, and non-invasive way of network modulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation have been studied in Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, tremor, and ataxia. Transcranial pulsed current stimulation and transcranial random noise stimulation are not yet studied enough. The literature in the use of these techniques is intriguing, yet many unanswered questions remain. In this review, we highlight the studies using these four potential tES techniques and their electrophysiological basis and consider the therapeutic implication in the field of movement disorders. The objectives are to consolidate the current literature, demonstrate that these methods are feasible, and encourage the application of such techniques in the near future.</p>

<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Currently, there is no promising treatment that improves prognosis significantly. While a thorough investigation of the pathological process within the primary site of injury in the brain has been conducted by the research field, the focus was mainly on gray matter injury, which partly accounted for the failure of discovery of clinically efficacious treatments. It is not until recent years that white matter (WM) injury in the brain after subcortical ICH was examined. As WM tracts form networks between different regions, damage to fibers should impair brain connectivity, resulting in functional impairment. Although WM changes have been demonstrated in the brain after ICH, alterations distant from the initial injury site down in the spinal cord are unclear. This longitudinal study, for the first time, revealed prolonged morphological changes of the contralesional dorsal corticospinal tract (CST) in the spinal cord 5 weeks after experimental ICH in mice by confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, implying that the structural integrity of the CST was compromised extensively after ICH. Given the important role of CST in motor function, future translational studies targeting motor recovery should delineate the treatment effects on CST integrity.</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for the management of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, DBS is indicated as the disease progresses and motor complications derived from pharmacological therapy arise. Here, we evaluate the potential of DBS prior to levodopa (L-Dopa) in improving quality of life (QoL), challenging the state of the art for DBS therapy. We present data on clinical manifestation, decision finding during early indication to DBS, and trajectories after DBS. We further discuss current paradigms for DBS and hypothesize on possible mechanisms. Six patients, between 50 and 67 years old, presenting at least 5 years of PD symptoms, and without L-Dopa therapy initiation, received subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS implantation. In the six PD cases, indication for DBS was not driven by motor complications, as supported by current guidelines, but by relevant QoL impairment and patient’s reluctance to initiate L-Dopa treatment. All patients treated with STN-DBS prior to L-Dopa presented improvement in motor and non-motor symptoms and significant QoL improvement. All patients reduced the intake of dopamine agonists, and five are currently free from L-Dopa medication, with no reported adverse events. We introduce a multicenter observational study to investigate whether early DBS treatment may affect the natural course of PD. Early application of DBS instead of L-Dopa administration could have a pathophysiological basis and be prompted by a significant incline on QoL through disease progression; however, the clinical value of this proposed paradigm shift should be addressed in clinical trials aimed at modulating the natural course of PD.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to hypocoagulopathy associated with prolonged bleeding and hemorrhagic progression. Bloodletting puncture therapy at hand twelve Jing-well points (BL-HTWP) has been applied as a first aid measure in various emergent neurological diseases, but the detailed mechanisms of the modulation between the central nervous system and systemic circulation after acute TBI in rodents remain unclear. To investigate whether BL-HTWP stimulation modulates hypocoagulable state and exerts neuroprotective effect, experimental TBI model of mice was produced by the controlled cortical impactor (CCI), and treatment with BL-HTWP was immediately made after CCI. Then, the effects of BL-HTWP on the neurological function, cerebral perfusion state, coagulable state, and cerebrovascular histopathology post-acute TBI were determined, respectively. Results showed that BL-HTWP treatment attenuated cerebral hypoperfusion and improve neurological recovery post-acute TBI. Furthermore, BL-HTWP stimulation reversed acute TBI-induced hypocoagulable state, reduced vasogenic edema and cytotoxic edema by regulating multiple hallmarks of coagulopathy in TBI. Therefore, we conclude for the first time that hypocoagulopathic state occurs after acute experimental TBI, and the neuroprotective effect of BL-HTWP relies on, at least in part, the modulation of hypocoagulable state. BL-HTWP therapy may be a promising strategy for acute severe TBI in the future.</p>

<p>Conflict-control is a core function of cognitive control. Although numerous studies have considered cognitive control to be domain-general, the shared and distinct brain responses to different types of incongruence or conflict remain unclear. Using a hybrid flanker task, the present study explored the temporal dynamics of brain activation to three types of incongruence: flanker interference, rule-based response switch (rule-switch), and action-based response switch (response-alternation). The results showed that: (1) all three types of incongruence evoked larger N2 amplitudes than the congruent condition in the frontal region, with the N2 amplitudes and topographical distribution of the N2 effect differing between the different types of incongruence; and (2) in the P300 time window, the flanker interference condition yielded the most delayed P300 latency, whereas the rule-switch and response-alternation conditions yielded smaller P300 amplitudes with a longer interval from P300 peak to a keypress. These findings suggest that different types of incongruence are first monitored similarly by the cognitive control system and then resolved differently.</p>

<p>Language learning relies on both short-term and long-term memory. Phonological short-term memory (pSTM) is thought to play an important role in the learning of novel word forms. However, language learners may differ in their ability to maintain word representations in pSTM during interfering auditory input. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate how pSTM capacity in better and poorer pSTM groups is linked to language learning and the maintenance of pseudowords in pSTM. In particular, MEG was recorded while participants maintained pseudowords in pSTM by covert speech rehearsal, and while these brain representations were probed by presenting auditory pseudowords with first or third syllables matching or mismatching the rehearsed item. A control condition included identical stimuli but no rehearsal. Differences in response strength between matching and mismatching syllables were interpreted as the phonological mapping negativity (PMN). While PMN for the first syllable was found in both groups, it was observed for the third syllable only in the group with better pSTM. This suggests that individuals with better pSTM maintained representations of trisyllabic pseudowords more accurately during interference than individuals with poorer pSTM. Importantly, the group with better pSTM learned words faster in a paired-associate word learning task, linking the PMN findings to language learning.</p>

<p>Neuroimaging evidence suggests that the development of the hippocampus, a brain structure critical for memory function, contributes to the improvements of episodic memory between middle childhood to adulthood. However, investigations on age differences in hippocampal activation and functional connectivity and their contributions to the development of memory have yielded mixed results. Given the known structural and functional heterogeneity along the long axis of the hippocampus, we investigated age differences in the activation and functional connectivity in hippocampal subregions with a cross-sectional sample of 96 participants ages 8–25 years. We found that anterior and posterior hippocampus supported memory formation, and there was overall stability in memory-related hippocampal activation with age. Without taking account of memory outcome, direct contrast between subregions showed higher functional connectivity of anterior, compared to the posterior hippocampus, with regions in the inferior frontal and lateral temporal lobes, and higher functional connectivity of posterior, compared to the anterior hippocampus, with regions in the medial and superior frontal, inferior parietal, and occipital lobes. A direct contrast between the memory-related connectivity patterns of anterior and posterior hippocampus identified a region in the medial frontal cortex, with which anterior and posterior hippocampus was differentially functionally connected. Finally, we identified age differences in memory-related differential hippocampal functional connectivity with several frontal and visual/sensory cortices, underscoring the importance of examining age differences in the patterns of hippocampal connectivity. Moreover, the specific patterns of differential anterior and posterior functional connectivity indicate an increase in the functional specialization along the long axis of the hippocampus and a dynamic shift in hippocampal connectivity patterns that supports memory development.</p>

<p>Semantic verbal fluency is among the most employed tasks in cognitive aging research and substantial work is devoted to understanding the underlying mechanisms behind age-related differences at the neural and behavioral levels. The present investigation aimed to evaluate the role of moderating variables, such as age, sex, MMSE, and proxies of cognitive reserve (CR) on the hemodynamic response evoked by semantic verbal fluency in healthy young and healthy older adults. So far, no study has been conducted to this end. To elucidate the exclusive effect of the mentioned variables on brain activation during semantic fluency, finger tapping was included as a control task. Results showed that disregarding adjustments for age, older adults displayed important parietal activations during semantic fluency as well as during finger-tapping. Specifically, the anterior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) were areas activated in both tasks in the older group. Younger adults, only displayed parietal activations related to age and sex when these demographics were employed as predictors. Concerning proxies of CR in semantic fluency, the only vocabulary was an important moderator in both age groups. Higher vocabulary scores were associated with lesser activation in occipital areas. Education did not show significant correlations with brain activity during semantic fluency in any of the groups. However, both CR proxies were significantly correlated to brain activations of older adults during finger tapping. Specifically, vocabulary was associated with frontal regions, while education correlated with parietal lobe and cingulate gyrus. Finally, the effects of MMSE were mostly observed on brain activation of older adults in both tasks. These findings demonstrate that the effects of moderating variables on shaping brain activation are intricate and not exclusive of complex verbal tasks. Thus, before adjusting for “nuisance variables,” their importance needs to be established. This is especially true for samples including older adults for whom a motor task may be a demanding operation due to normal age-related processes of dedifferentiation.</p>

<p>Psychological stress is increasingly associated with alterations in performance and affect. Yet, the relationship between experimentally induced psychological stress and neural indices of performance monitoring and error processing, as well as response inhibition, are unclear. Using scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs), we tested the relationship between experimental stress, using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and the error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe), and N2 ERP components. A final sample of 71 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to go through the TSST (n = 36; 18 female) or a brief mindfulness relaxation exercise (n = 35; 16 female) immediately followed by a go/no-go task while electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected. Salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure confirmed increased physiological stress in the TSST group relative to control. Reaction times, accuracy, and post-error slowing did not differ by stress group. Two-group (TSST, control) by 2-trial type (correct, incorrect for ERN/Pe; go correct, no-go correct for N2) repeated measures ANOVAs for the ERN, Pe, and N2 showed the expected main effects of trial type; neither the ERN nor the N2 ERP components showed interactions with the stress manipulation. In contrast, the Pe component showed a significant Group by Trial interaction, with reduced Pe amplitude following the stress condition relative to control. Pe amplitude did not, however, correlate with cortisol reactivity. Findings suggest a reduction in Pe amplitude following experimental stress that may be associated with reduced error awareness or attention to errors following the TSST. Given the variability in the extant literature on the relationship between experimentally induced stress and neurophysiological reflections of performance monitoring, we provide another point of data and conclude that better understanding of moderating variables is needed followed by high-powered replication studies to get at the nuance that is not yet understood in the relationship between induced stress and performance monitoring/response inhibition processes.</p>

Aim of this work is to assess the capacity of bivariate Transfer Entropy (TE) to evaluate connectivity, using data generated from simple neural mass models of connected Regions of Interest (ROIs).</p><p>Approach: Signals simulating mean field potentials were generated assuming two, three or four ROIs, connected via excitatory or by-synaptic inhibitory links. We investigated whether the presence of a statistically significant connection can be detected and if connection strength can be quantified.</p><p>Main Results: Results suggest that TE can reliably estimate the strength of connectivity if neural populations work in their linear regions, and if the epoch lengths are longer than 10 s. In case of multivariate networks, some spurious connections can emerge (i.e., a statistically significant TE even in the absence of a true connection); however, quite a good correlation between TE and synaptic strength is still preserved. Moreover, TE appears more robust for distal regions (longer delays) compared with proximal regions (smaller delays): an approximate a priori knowledge on this delay can improve the procedure. Finally, non-linear phenomena affect the assessment of connectivity, since they may significantly reduce TE estimation: information transmission between two ROIs may be weak, due to non-linear phenomena, even if a strong causal connection is present.</p><p>Significance: Changes in functional connectivity during different tasks or brain conditions, might not always reflect a true change in the connecting network, but rather a change in information transmission. A limitation of the work is the use of bivariate TE. In perspective, the use of multivariate TE can improve estimation and reduce some of the problems encountered in the present study.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00020">Spatial Updating Depends on Gravity</a></h4>

<p>As we move through an environment the positions of surrounding objects relative to our body constantly change. Maintaining orientation requires spatial updating, the continuous monitoring of self-motion cues to update external locations. This ability critically depends on the integration of visual, proprioceptive, kinesthetic, and vestibular information. During weightlessness gravity no longer acts as an essential reference, creating a discrepancy between vestibular, visual and sensorimotor signals. Here, we explore the effects of repeated bouts of microgravity and hypergravity on spatial updating performance during parabolic flight. Ten healthy participants (four women, six men) took part in a parabolic flight campaign that comprised a total of 31 parabolas. Each parabola created about 20–25 s of 0 g, preceded and followed by about 20 s of hypergravity (1.8 g). Participants performed a visual-spatial updating task in seated position during 15 parabolas. The task included two updating conditions simulating virtual forward movements of different lengths (short and long), and a static condition with no movement that served as a control condition. Two trials were performed during each phase of the parabola, i.e., at 1 g before the start of the parabola, at 1.8 g during the acceleration phase of the parabola, and during 0 g. Our data demonstrate that 0 g and 1.8 g impaired pointing performance for long updating trials as indicated by increased variability of pointing errors compared to 1 g. In contrast, we found no support for any changes for short updating and static conditions, suggesting that a certain degree of task complexity is required to affect pointing errors. These findings are important for operational requirements during spaceflight because spatial updating is pivotal for navigation when vision is poor or unreliable and objects go out of sight, for example during extravehicular activities in space or the exploration of unfamiliar environments. Future studies should compare the effects on spatial updating during seated and free-floating conditions, and determine at which g-threshold decrements in spatial updating performance emerge.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting two-thirds of people with dementia in the world. To date, no disease-modifying treatments are available to stop or delay the progression of AD. This chronic neurodegenerative disease is dominated by a strong innate immune response, whereby microglia plays a central role as the main resident macrophage of the brain. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in microglial genes and associated with a delayed onset of AD, highlighting the important role of these cells on the onset and/or progression of the disease. These findings have increased the interest in targeting microglia-associated neuroinflammation as a potentially disease-modifying therapeutic approach for AD. In this review we provide an overview on the contribution of microglia to the pathophysiology of AD, focusing on the main regulatory pathways controlling microglial population dynamics during the neuroinflammatory response, such as the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), its ligands (the colony-stimulating factor 1 and interleukin 34) and the transcription factor PU.1. We also discuss the current therapeutic strategies targeting proliferation to modulate microglia-associated neuroinflammation and their potential impact on peripheral immune cell populations in the short and long-term. Understanding the effects of immunomodulatory approaches on microglia and other immune cell types might be critical for developing specific, effective, and safe therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Single neurons, as the basic unit of the brain, consist of a cell body and processes, including dendrites and axons. Even neurons of the same type show various subtle process characteristics to fit into the diverse neural circuits. Different cell types of neurons form complicated circuits in the brain. Therefore, detailed neuronal morphology is required to understand normal neuronal function and pathological mechanisms, such as those that occur in autism. Here, we developed a strategy to sparsely label the same type of neurons throughout the whole brain and tested its application in an autistic animal model—Shank3 knockout (KO) mice. To achieve this, we designed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that expresses Cre recombinase-dependent regular and membrane-targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under a human synapsin 1 promoter and verified it in several Cre transgenic mice. We could sparsely label the projection neurons in multiple brain areas by retro-ocular injection of the virus into CaMKIIα-Cre mice. Then, we analyzed the morphology of the projection neurons in Shank3 KO mice with this method. We found differential dendritic complexity and dendritic spine changes in projection neurons in Shank3 KO mice crossed with CaMKIIα-Cre mice compared with littermate control mice in the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus. By combining this method with various Cre mouse lines crossed with mouse models of disease, we can screen the morphological traits of distinct types of neurons throughout the whole brain that will help us to understand the exact role of the specific cell types of neurons not only in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) mouse models but also in other psychiatric disorder mouse models.</p>

<p>Successful completion of sensory decision-making requires focusing on relevant stimuli, adequate signal/noise ratio for stimulus discrimination, and stimulus valence evaluation. Different brain regions are postulated to play a role in these computations; however, evidence suggests that sensory and decision-making circuits are required to interact through a common neuronal pathway to elicit a context-adequate behavioral response. Recently, the basal forebrain (BF) region has emerged as a good candidate, since its heterogeneous projecting neurons innervate most of the cortical mantle and sensory processing circuits modulating different aspects of the sensory decision-making process. Moreover, evidence indicates that the BF plays an important role in attention and in fast modulation of neuronal activity that enhance visual and olfactory sensory perception. Here, we study in awake mice the involvement of BF in initiation and completion of trials in a reward-driven olfactory detection task. Using tetrode recordings, we find that BF neurons (including cholinergics) are recruited during sensory discrimination, reward, and interestingly slightly before trial initiation in successful discrimination trials. The precue neuronal activity was correlated with animal performance, indicating that this circuit could play an important role in adaptive context-dependent behavioral responses.</p>

<p>Gestational exposure to valproic acid (VPA) is known to cause behavioral deficits of sociability, matching similar alterations in human autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Available data are scarce on the neuromorphological changes in VPA-exposed animals. Here, we focused on alterations of the dopaminergic system, which is implicated in motivation and reward, with relevance to social cohesion. Whole brains from 7-day-old mice born to mothers given a single injection of VPA (400 mg/kg b.wt.) on E13.5 were immunostained against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). They were scanned using the iDISCO method with a laser light-sheet microscope, and the reconstructed images were analyzed in 3D for quantitative morphometry. A marked reduction of mesotelencephalic (MT) axonal fascicles together with a widening of the MT tract were observed in VPA treated mice, while other major brain tracts appeared anatomically intact. We also found a reduction in the abundance of dopaminergic ventral tegmental (VTA) neurons, accompanied by diminished tissue level of DA in ventrobasal telencephalic regions (including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), olfactory tubercle, BST, substantia innominata). Such a reduction of DA was not observed in the non-limbic caudate-putamen. Conversely, the abundance of TH+ cells in the substantia nigra (SN) was increased, presumably due to a compensatory mechanism or to an altered distribution of TH+ neurons occupying the SN and the VTA. The findings suggest that defasciculation of the MT tract and neuronal loss in VTA, followed by diminished dopaminergic input to the ventrobasal telencephalon at a critical time point of embryonic development (E13-E14) may hinder the patterning of certain brain centers underlying decision making and sociability.</p>

<p>Background: The imbalance between the production and clearance of alpha-synuclein and its consequent accumulation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD).

Patients with PD were further divided into two groups (SN + PD and SN − PD groups) according to whether dPVS was observed in the substantia nigra (SN). DAT uptake values and clinical scales were compared between the patients with PD and HCs and against dPVS scores. We also investigated the correlation between baseline dPVS scores and longitudinal DAT changes.</p><p>Results: Relative to the HCs, patients with PD had more dPVS in the SN and basal ganglia (BG). PD patients with dPVS in the SN region exhibited greater expression of tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid (P = 0.038) and a trend towards decreased DAT binding (P = 0.086) relative to those without SN dPVS. No correlations were found between dPVS scores and DAT uptake values or between dPVS scores and longitudinal DAT changes.</p><p>Conclusion: The dPVS in the SN of patients with PD may reflect the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the appearance of α-synuclein insoluble aggregates known as Lewy bodies. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by neuroinflammation mediated by cytokines and chemokines produced by the activated microglia. Several studies demonstrated that such an inflammatory process is an early event, and contributes to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions. α-synuclein fibrillization and aggregation activate microglia and contribute to disease onset and progression. Mutations in different genes exacerbate the inflammatory phenotype in the monogenic compared to sporadic forms of PD. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with selected radiopharmaceuticals allow in vivo imaging of molecular modifications in the brain of living subjects. Several publications showed a reduction of dopaminergic terminals and dopamine (DA) content in the basal ganglia, starting from the early stages of the disease. Moreover, non-dopaminergic neuronal pathways are also affected, as shown by in vivo studies with serotonergic and glutamatergic radiotracers. The role played by the immune system during illness progression could be investigated with PET ligands that target the microglia/macrophage Translocator protein (TSPO) receptor. These agents have been used in PD patients and rodent models, although often without attempting correlations with other molecular or functional parameters. For example, neurodegeneration and brain plasticity can be monitored using the metabolic marker 2-Deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroglucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG), while oxidative stress can be probed using the copper-labeled diacetyl-bis(N-methyl-thiosemicarbazone) ([Cu]-ATSM) radioligand, whose striatal-specific binding ratio in PD patients seems to correlate with a disease rating scale and motor scores. Also, structural and functional modifications during disease progression may be evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), using different parameters as iron content or cerebral volume. In this review article, we propose an overview of in vivo clinical and non-clinical imaging research on neuroinflammation as an emerging marker of early PD. We also discuss how multimodal-imaging approaches could provide more insights into the role of the inflammatory process and related events in PD development.</p>

Introduction<p>While Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is divided into severity stages, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains a solitary construct despite clinical and prognostic heterogeneity. This study aimed to characterize differences in genetic, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), neuroimaging, and neuropsychological markers across clinician-derived MCI stages.</p>Methods<p>Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project participants with MCI were categorized into 3 severity subtypes at screening based on neuropsychological assessment, functional assessment, and Clinical Dementia Rating interview, including mild (n = 18, 75 ± 8 years), moderate (n = 89 72 ± 7 years), and severe subtypes (n = 18, 78 ± 8 years). At enrollment, participants underwent neuropsychological testing, 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and optional fasting lumbar puncture to obtain CSF. Neuropsychological testing and MRI were repeated at 18-months, 3-years, and 5-years with a mean follow-up time of 3.3 years. Ordinary least square regressions examined cross-sectional associations between MCI severity and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 status, CSF biomarkers of amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau, total tau, and synaptic dysfunction (neurogranin), baseline neuroimaging biomarkers, and baseline neuropsychological performance. Longitudinal associations between baseline MCI severity and neuroimaging and neuropsychological trajectory were assessed using linear mixed effects models with random intercepts and slopes and a follow-up time interaction. Analyses adjusted for baseline age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and intracranial volume for MRI models.</p>Results<p>Stages differed at baseline on APOE-ε4 status (early &lt; middle = late; p-values &lt; 0.03) and CSF Aβ (early &gt; middle = late), phosphorylated and total tau (early = middle &lt; late; p-values &lt; 0.05), and neurogranin concentrations (early = middle &lt; late; p-values &lt; 0.05). MCI stage related to greater longitudinal cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, and inferior lateral ventricle dilation (early &lt; late; p-values &lt; 0.03).</p>Discussion<p>Clinician staging of MCI severity yielded longitudinal cognitive trajectory and structural neuroimaging differences in regions susceptible to AD neuropathology and neurodegeneration. As expected, participants with more severe MCI symptoms at study entry had greater cognitive decline and gray matter atrophy over time.

<p>Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of early intervention for MCI is to decrease the rate of conversion from MCI to AD. However, the efficacy of multiple interventions in MCI, and the optimal methods of delivery, remain controversial. We aimed to compare and rank the treatment methods for MCI in AD, in order to find an optimal intervention for MCI and a way to prevent or delay the occurrence of AD.</p><p>Methods: Pair-wise and network meta-analysis were conducted to integrate the treatment effectiveness through direct and indirect evidence. Four English databases and three Chinese databases were searched for international registers of eligible published, single or double blind, randomized controlled trials up to September 31st 2019. We included nine comparative interventions: pharmacological therapies which incorporated cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI), ginkgo, nimodipine, and Chinese medicine; non-pharmacological therapies comprising of acupuncture, music therapy, exercise therapy, and nutrition therapy; and a placebo group. The primary outcome was the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. The secondary outcome was the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog).</p><p>Results: Twenty-eight trials were eligible, including 6,863 participants. In the direct meta-analysis, as for the Mini-Mental State Examination scale, the ChEIs (MD: −0.38; 95% CI: −0.74, −0.01), Chinese medicine (MD: −0.31; 95% CI: −0.75, 0.13), exercise therapy (MD: −0.50; 95% CI: −0.65, −0.35), music therapy (MD: −1.71; 95% CI: −4.49, 1.07), were statistically more efficient than placebo. For AD Assessment Scalecognitive subscale outcome, ChEIs (MD: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.68), Acupuncture (MD: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.44), Chinese medicine (MD: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.73) and exercise (MD: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.73) were better than placebo. In the network meta-analysis, the MMSE outcome ranked music therapy (59%) as the best and Acupuncture (26%) as second. Nutrition and Ginkgo treatment had the lowest rank among all interventions. For ADAS-cog outcome, acupuncture (52) ranked the best.</p><p>Conclusion: Among the nine treatments studied, music therapy appears to be the best treatment for MCI, followed by acupuncture. Our study provides new insights into potential clinical treatments for MCI due to AD, and may aid the development of guidelines for MCI in AD.</p>

<p>by Philip Kleinert, Beth Martin, Martin Kircher</p>

Targeted sequencing of genomic regions is a cost- and time-efficient approach for screening patient cohorts. We present a fast and efficient workflow to analyze highly imbalanced, targeted next-generation sequencing data generated using molecular inversion probe (MIP) capture. Our Snakemake pipeline performs sample demultiplexing, overlap paired-end merging, alignment, MIP-arm trimming, variant calling, coverage analysis and report generation. Further, we support the analysis of probes specifically designed to capture certain structural variants and can assign sex using Y-chromosome-unique probes. In a user-friendly HTML report, we summarize all these results including covered, incomplete or missing regions, called variants and their predicted effects. We developed and tested our pipeline using the hemophilia A &amp; B MIP design from the “My Life, Our Future” initiative. HemoMIPs is available as an open-source tool on GitHub at: https://github.com/kircherlab/hemoMIPs<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hAGb_mEQjv8" width="1" />

<p>by Federico Sevlever, Juan Pablo Di Bella, Alejandra C. Ventura</p>

Negative cooperativity is a phenomenon in which the binding of a first ligand or substrate molecule decreases the rate of subsequent binding. This definition is not exclusive to ligand-receptor binding, it holds whenever two or more molecules undergo two successive binding events. Negative cooperativity turns the binding curve more graded and cannot be distinguished from two independent and different binding events based on equilibrium measurements only. The need of kinetic data for this purpose was already reported. Here, we study the binding response as a function of the amount of ligand, at different times, from very early times since ligand is added and until equilibrium is reached. Over those binding curves measured at different times, we compute the dynamic range: the fold change required in input to elicit a change from 10 to 90% of maximum output, finding that it evolves in time differently and controlled by different parameters in the two situations that are identical in equilibrium. Deciphering which is the microscopic model that leads to a given binding curve adds understanding on the molecular mechanisms at play, and thus, is a valuable tool. The methods developed in this article were tested both with simulated and experimental data, showing to be robust to noise and experimental constraints.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oqA0bKDI_Zg" width="1" />

<p>by Jan Domański, Mark S. P. Sansom, Phillip J. Stansfeld, Robert B. Best</p>

Transmembrane helix association is a fundamental step in the folding of helical membrane proteins. The prototypical example of this association is formation of the glycophorin dimer. While its structure and stability have been well-characterized experimentally, the detailed assembly mechanism is harder to obtain. Here, we use all-atom simulations within phospholipid membrane to study glycophorin association. We find that initial association results in the formation of a non-native intermediate, separated by a significant free energy barrier from the dimer with a native binding interface. We have used transition-path sampling to determine the association mechanism. We find that the mechanism of the initial bimolecular association to form the intermediate state can be mediated by many possible contacts, but seems to be particularly favoured by formation of non-native contacts between the C-termini of the two helices. On the other hand, the contacts which are key to determining progression from the intermediate to the native state are those which define the native binding interface, reminiscent of the role played by native contacts in determining folding of globular proteins. As a check on the simulations, we have computed association and dissociation rates from the transition-path sampling. We obtain results in reasonable accord with available experimental data, after correcting for differences in native state stability. Our results yield an atomistic description of the mechanism for a simple prototype of helical membrane protein folding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1Sn_ospOBpI" width="1" />

<p>by Abolfazl Ramezanpour, Alireza Mashaghi</p>

We study the time evolution of symptoms (signs) with some defects in the dynamics of a reaction network as a (microscopic) model for the progress of disease phenotypes. To this end, we take a large population of reaction networks and follow the stochastic dynamics of the system to see how the development of defects affects the macroscopic states of the signs probability distribution. We start from some plausible definitions for the healthy and disease states along with a dynamical model for the emergence of diseases by a reverse simulated annealing algorithm. The healthy state is defined as a state of maximum objective function, which here is the sum of mutual information between a subset of signal variables and the subset of assigned response variables. A disease phenotype is defined with two parameters controlling the rate of mutations in reactions and the rate of accepting mutations that reduce the objective function. The model can provide the time dependence of the sign probabilities given a disease phenotype. This allows us to obtain the accuracy of diagnosis as a function of time by using a probabilistic model of signs and diseases. The trade-off between the diagnosis accuracy (increasing in time) and the objective function (decreasing in time) can be used to suggest an optimal time for medical intervention. Our model would be useful in particular for a dynamical (history-based) diagnostic problem, to estimate the likelihood of a disease hypothesis given the temporal evolution of the signs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XR2oyGCJvwU" width="1" />

<p>by Zhenxing Wu, Kai Zhao</p>

Most sensory systems are remarkable in their temporal precision, reflected in such phrases as “a flash of light” or “a twig snap”. Yet taste is complicated by the transport processes of stimuli through the papilla matrix to reach taste receptors, processes that are poorly understood. We computationally modeled the surface of the human tongue as a microfiber porous medium and found that time-concentration profiles within the papilla zone rise with significant delay that well match experimental ratings of perceived taste intensity to a range of sweet and salty stimuli for both rapid pulses and longer sip-and-hold exposures. Diffusivity of these taste stimuli, determined mostly by molecular size, correlates greatly with time and slope to reach peak intensity: smaller molecular size may lead to quicker taste perception. Our study demonstrates the novelty of modeling the human tongue as a porous material to drastically simplify computational approaches and that peripheral transport processes may significantly affect the temporal profile of taste perception, at least to sweet and salty compounds.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KX7gG3hdNbw" width="1" />

<p>by Luke Sargent, Yating Liu, Wilson Leung, Nathan T. Mortimer, David Lopatto, Jeremy Goecks, Sarah C. R. Elgin</p>

Scientists are sequencing new genomes at an increasing rate with the goal of associating genome contents with phenotypic traits. After a new genome is sequenced and assembled, structural gene annotation is often the first step in analysis. Despite advances in computational gene prediction algorithms, most eukaryotic genomes still benefit from manual gene annotation. This requires access to good genome browsers to enable annotators to visualize and evaluate multiple lines of evidence (e.g., sequence similarity, RNA sequencing [RNA-Seq] results, gene predictions, repeats) and necessitates many volunteers to participate in the work. To address the technical barriers to creating genome browsers, the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; https://gep.wustl.edu/) has partnered with the Galaxy Project (https://galaxyproject.org) to develop G-OnRamp (http://g-onramp.org), a web-based platform for creating UCSC Genome Browser Assembly Hubs and JBrowse genome browsers. G-OnRamp also converts a JBrowse instance into an Apollo instance for collaborative genome annotations in research and educational settings. The genome browsers produced can be transferred to the CyVerse Data Store for long-term access. G-OnRamp enables researchers to easily visualize their experimental results, educators to create Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) centered on genome annotation, and students to participate in genomics research. In the process, students learn about genes/genomes and about how to utilize large datasets. Development of G-OnRamp was guided by extensive user feedback. Sixty-five researchers/educators from &gt;40 institutions participated through in-person workshops, which produced &gt;20 genome browsers now available for research and education. Genome browsers generated for four parasitoid wasp species have been used in a CURE engaging students at 15 colleges and universities. Our assessment results in the classroom demonstrate that the genome browsers produced by G-OnRamp are effective tools for engaging undergraduates in research and in enabling their contributions to the scientific literature in genomics. Expansion of such genomics research/education partnerships will be beneficial to researchers, faculty, and students alike.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZONxdZNiNI0" width="1" />

<p>by Dirke Imig, Nadine Pollak, Frank Allgöwer, Markus Rehm</p>

Apoptotic cell death can be initiated through the extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. While cell cycle progression promotes the responsiveness to intrinsic apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress or spindle poisons, this has not yet been studied conclusively for extrinsic apoptosis. Here, we combined fluorescence-based time-lapse monitoring of cell cycle progression and cell death execution by long-term time-lapse microscopy with sampling-based mathematical modeling to study cell cycle dependency of TRAIL-induced extrinsic apoptosis in NCI-H460/geminin cells. In particular, we investigated the interaction of cell death timing and progression of cell cycle states. We not only found that TRAIL prolongs cycle progression, but in reverse also that cell cycle progression affects the kinetics of TRAIL-induced apoptosis: Cells exposed to TRAIL in G<sub>1</sub> died significantly faster than cells stimulated in S/G<sub>2</sub>/M. The connection between cell cycle state and apoptosis progression was captured by developing a mathematical model, for which parameter estimation revealed that apoptosis progression decelerates in the second half of the cell cycle. Similar results were also obtained when studying HCT-116 cells. Our results therefore reject the null hypothesis of independence between cell cycle progression and extrinsic apoptosis and, supported by simulations and experiments of synchronized cell populations, suggest that unwanted escape from TRAIL-induced apoptosis can be reduced by enriching the fraction of cells in G<sub>1</sub> phase. Besides novel insight into the interrelation of cell cycle progression and extrinsic apoptosis signaling kinetics, our findings are therefore also relevant for optimizing future TRAIL-based treatment strategies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LkmNTZ3OmGA" width="1" />

<p>by Raphael Vallat, Vyoma D. Shah, Susan Redline, Peter Attia, Matthew P. Walker</p>

Why does poor-quality sleep lead to atherosclerosis? In a diverse sample of over 1,600 individuals, we describe a pathway wherein sleep fragmentation raises inflammatory-related white blood cell counts (neutrophils and monocytes), thereby increasing atherosclerosis severity, even when other common risk factors have been accounted for. Improving sleep quality may thus represent one preventive strategy for lowering inflammatory status and thus atherosclerosis risk, reinforcing public health policies focused on sleep health.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Jgmps9lVGhE" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early childhood is characterized by vast changes in behaviors supported by the hippocampus and an increased susceptibility of the hippocampus to environmental influences. Thus, it is an important time to investigate the development of the hippocampus. Existing research suggests subregions of the hippocampus (i.e., head, body, tail) have dissociable functions and that the relations between subregions and cognitive abilities vary across development. However, longitudinal research examining age‐related changes in subregions in humans, particularly during early childhood (i.e., 4–6 years), is limited. Using a large sample of 184 healthy 4‐ to 8‐year‐old children, the present study is the first to characterize developmental changes in hippocampal subregion volume from early‐ to mid‐childhood. Results reveal differential developmental trajectories in hippocampal head, body, and tail during this period. Specifically, head volume showed a quadratic pattern of change, and both body and tail showed linear increases, resulting in a pattern of cubic change for total hippocampal volume. Further, main effects of sex on hippocampal volume (males &gt; females) and hemispheric differences in developmental trajectories were observed. These findings provide an improved understanding of the development of the hippocampus and have important implications for research investigating a range of cognitive abilities and behaviors.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25799?af=R">Radiologically Isolated Syndrome: 10‐Year Risk Estimate of a Clinical Event</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We have previously identified male sex, younger age, and the presence of spinal cord lesions as independent factors that increase the 5‐year risk for evolution from radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) to multiple sclerosis. We investigate here risk factors for the development of a clinical event using a 10‐year, multi‐national, retrospectively‐identified RIS dataset.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>RIS subjects were identified according to 2009 RIS criteria and longitudinally followed as part of a worldwide cohort study. We analyzed data from 21 individual databases from 5 different countries. Associations between clinical and MRI characteristics, and the risk of developing a first clinical event were determined using multivariate Cox regression models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Additional follow‐up data was available in 277/451 RIS subjects (86% female). Mean age at RIS diagnosis was 37.2 y (range:11–74 y) with a median clinical follow‐up of 6.7 years. The cumulative probability of a first clinical event at 10 years was 51.2%. Age, positive CSF, infratentorial lesions on MRI, and spinal cord lesions, were baseline independent predictors associated with a subsequent clinical event. The presence of gadolinium enhancing lesions during follow‐up was also associated with the risk of a seminal event. Reason for MRI and gadolinium enhancing lesions at baseline did not influence the risk of a subsequent clinical event.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Approximately half of individuals with RIS experience a first clinical event within 10 years of the index MRI. The identification of independent predictors of risk for symptom onset may guide education and clinical management of individuals with RIS.</p>

<p>There is an unmet need to identify biomarkers sensitive to change in rare, slowly progressive neuromuscular diseases. Quantitative MRI of muscle may offer this opportunity, is non‐invasive and can be carried out almost independent of patient‐cooperation and disease severity.</p>
<p>Muscle fat content correlates with muscle function in neuromuscular diseases, and changes in fat content precede changes in function, which suggests that muscle MRI is a strong biomarker candidate to predict prognosis and treatment efficacy. In this paper, we review the evidence suggesting that muscle MRI may be an important biomarker for diagnosis and to monitor change in disease severity.</p>

<p>We screened 662 subjects comprising 462 essential tremor, ET (285 sporadic, 125 with family history and 52 probands from well‐characterized ET pedigrees and 200 controls and identified pathogenic <i>NOTCH2NLC </i> GGC repeat expansions in four sporadic ET patients. Two patients were followed up for over a decade: one with 90 repeats remained an ET phenotype that did not evolve after forty years, while another patient with 107 repeats developed motor symptoms and cognitive impairment after 8 to 10舁years. Neuroimaging in this patient revealed severe leukoencephalopathy; diffusion‐weighted imaging hyperintensity in the corticomedullary junction and skin biopsy revealed intranuclear inclusions suggestive of intranuclear inclusion body disease (NIID). No GGC repeats above 60舁units were detected in familial ET cases and controls, though four ET patients carried 47–53 “intermediate” repeats. <i>NOTCH2NLC </i> GGC repeat expansions can be associated with sporadic ET. Carriers presenting with a pure ET phenotype may or may not convert to NIID up to four decades after initial tremor onset.</p>

Objectives<p>Previous research has provided evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can reduce severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the exact mechanism of this effect is still unknown. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has demonstrated low levels of brain metabolites in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in individuals with ASD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of anodal tDCS on social functioning of individuals with ASD, as measured by the social subscale of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), through correlations between pretreatment and posttreatment concentrations of brain metabolites in the areas of interest (DLPFC, ACC, amygdala, and locus coeruleus) and scores on the ATEC social subscale.</p>Methods<p>Ten participants with ASD were administered 1 mA anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC for 20 min over five consecutive days. Measures of the ATEC social subscale and the concentrations of brain metabolites were performed before and immediately after the treatment.</p>Results<p>The results showed a significant decrease between pretreatment and immediately posttreatment in the ATEC social subscale scores, significant increases in N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and myoinositol (mI)/Cr concentrations, and a decrease in choline (Cho)/Cr concentrations in the left DLPFC and locus coeruleus after tDCS treatment. Significant associations between decreased ATEC social subscale scores and changed concentrations in NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and mI/Cr in the locus coeruleus were positive.</p>Conclusion<p>Findings suggest that beneficial effects of tDCS in ASD may be due to changes in neuronal and glia cell activity and synaptogenesis in the brain network of individuals with ASD. Further studies with larger sample sizes and control groups are warranted.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00556">LRRK2-Related Parkinson’s Disease Due to Altered Endolysosomal Biology With Variable Lewy Body Pathology: A Hypothesis</a></h4>

<p>Mutations in the gene encoding for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with both familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a large protein comprised of a GTPase and a kinase domain. All pathogenic variants converge on enhancing LRRK2 kinase substrate phosphorylation, and distinct LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are currently in various stages of clinical trials. Although the precise pathophysiological functions of LRRK2 remain largely unknown, PD-associated mutants have been shown to alter various intracellular vesicular trafficking pathways, especially those related to endolysosomal protein degradation events. In addition, biochemical studies have identified a subset of Rab proteins, small GTPases required for all vesicular trafficking steps, as substrate proteins for the LRRK2 kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the impact of such phosphorylation on neurodegenerative mechanisms underlying LRRK2-related PD, especially with respect to deregulated Rab-mediated endolysosomal membrane trafficking and protein degradation events. Surprisingly, a significant proportion of PD patients due to LRRK2 mutations display neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the absence of any apparent α-synuclein-containing Lewy body neuropathology. These findings suggest that endolysosomal alterations mediated by pathogenic LRRK2 per se are not sufficient to cause α-synuclein aggregation. Here, we will review current knowledge about the link between pathogenic LRRK2, Rab protein phosphorylation and endolysosomal trafficking alterations, and we will propose a testable working model whereby LRRK2-related PD may present with variable LB pathology.</p>

Objective<p>During presurgical evaluation for focal epilepsy patients, the evidence supporting the use of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) for delineating the epileptogenic zone (EZ) increased over the past decade. This study aims to develop and validate an integrated automatic detection, classification and imaging pipeline of HFOs with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) to narrow the gap between HFOs quantitative analysis and clinical application.</p>Methods<p>The proposed pipeline includes stages of channel inclusion, candidate HFOs detection and automatic labeling with four trained convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers and HFOs sorting based on occurrence rate and imaging. We first evaluated the initial detector using an open simulated dataset. After that, we validated our full algorithm in a 20-patient cohort against three assumptions based on previous studies. Classified HFOs results were compared with seizure onset zone (SOZ) channels for their concordance. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) were calculated representing the prediction ability of the labeled HFOs outputs for SOZ.</p>Results<p>The initial detector demonstrated satisfactory performance on the simulated dataset. The four CNN classifiers converged quickly during training, and the accuracies on the validation dataset were above 95%. The localization value of HFOs was significantly improved by HFOs classification. The AUC values of the 20 testing patients increased after HFO classification, indicating a satisfactory prediction value of the proposed algorithm for EZ identification.</p>Conclusion<p>Our detector can provide robust HFOs analysis results revealing EZ at the individual level, which may ultimately push forward the transitioning of HFOs analysis into a meaningful part of the presurgical evaluation and surgical planning.</p>

<p>The fruit fly compound eye is a premier experimental system for modeling human neurodegenerative diseases. The disruption of the retinal geometry has been historically assessed using time-consuming and poorly reliable techniques such as histology or pseudopupil manual counting. Recent semiautomated quantification approaches rely either on manual region-of-interest delimitation or engineered features to estimate the extent of degeneration. This work presents a fully automated classification pipeline of bright-field images based on orientated gradient descriptors and machine learning techniques. An initial region-of-interest extraction is performed, applying morphological kernels and Euclidean distance-to-centroid thresholding. Image classification algorithms are trained on these regions (support vector machine, decision trees, random forest, and convolutional neural network), and their performance is evaluated on independent, unseen datasets. The combinations of oriented gradient + gaussian kernel Support Vector Machine [0.97 accuracy and 0.98 area under the curve (AUC)] and fine-tuned pre-trained convolutional neural network (0.98 accuracy and 0.99 AUC) yielded the best results overall. The proposed method provides a robust quantification framework that can be generalized to address the loss of regularity in biological patterns similar to the Drosophila eye surface and speeds up the processing of large sample batches.</p>

Background<p>We aimed to construct and validate a nomogram model based on the combination of radiomic features and satellite sign number for predicting intracerebral hematoma expansion.</p>Methods<p>A total of 129 patients from two institutions were enrolled in this study. The preprocessed initial CT images were used for radiomic feature extraction. The ANOVA-Kruskal–Wallis test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were applied to identify candidate radiomic features and construct the Radscore. A nomogram model was developed by integrating the Radscore with a satellite sign number. The discrimination performance of the proposed model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the predictive accuracy was assessed via a calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival analysis were performed to evaluate the clinical value of the model.</p>Results<p>Four optimal features were ultimately selected and contributed to the Radscore construction. A positive correlation was observed between the satellite sign number and Radscore (Pearson’s r: 0.451). The nomogram model showed the best performance with high area under the curves in both training cohort (0.881, sensitivity: 0.973; specificity: 0.787) and external validation cohort (0.857, sensitivity: 0.950; specificity: 0.766). The calibration curve, DCA, and KM analysis indicated the high accuracy and clinical usefulness of the nomogram model for hematoma expansion prediction.</p>Conclusion<p>A nomogram model of integrated radiomic signature and satellite sign number based on noncontrast CT images could serve as a reliable and convenient measurement of hematoma expansion prediction.</p>

<p>Polyglutamine (polyQ) spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are the most prevalent subset of SCAs and share the aberrant expansion of Q-encoding CAG repeats within the coding sequences of disease-responsible genes as their common genetic cause. These polyQ SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17) are inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the progressive atrophy of the cerebellum and connected regions of the nervous system, which leads to loss of fine muscle movement coordination. Upon the expansion of polyQ repeats, the mutated proteins typically accumulate disproportionately in the neuronal nucleus, where they sequester various target molecules, including transcription factors and other nuclear proteins. However, it is not yet clearly understood how CAG repeat expansion takes place or how expanded polyQ proteins accumulate in the nucleus. In this article, we review the current knowledge on the molecular and cellular bases of nuclear proteotoxicity of polyQ proteins in SCAs and present our perspectives on the remaining issues surrounding these diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00325">Multimodal MRI Longitudinal Assessment of White and Gray Matter in Different SPG Types of Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis</a></h4>

<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous neurologic disorders. Hereby we describe a relatively large group of patients (pts) affected by HSP studied at baseline (31 pts) and at follow-up (mean period 28.9 ± 8.4 months; 23 pts) with multimodal advanced MRI: high-resolution T1 images for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). An age-matched healthy control (HC) group underwent the same neuroimaging protocol in a time schedule matched with the HSP patients. At baseline, VBM showed gray matter (GM) reduction in HSP in the right pre-frontal cortex and bilaterally in the thalami. MRS at baseline depicted in HSP patients compared to the HC group reduction of NAA/Cr ratio in the right pre-frontal region, increase of Cho/Cr ratio in the right pre-central regions, and increase of mI/Cr ratio on the left pre-central area. At cross-sectional follow-up analysis and longitudinal evaluation, no VBM and MRS statistically significant results were obtained. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis showed widespread DTI brain white matter (WM) alterations in patients compared to HC at baseline, which are characterized by reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) and increase of mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity, as confirmed on cross-analysis of the follow-up dataset. A longitudinal analysis with TBSS in HSP patients did not show significant variations, while upon applying region-based analysis we found increased FA and decreased MD and AD in specific brain WM fiber complex during follow-up. The changes were not correlated with the clinical presentation (pure vs complicated HSP), motor function, and motility indexes or history of specific treatments (botulinum toxin). In conclusion, the cross-sectional analysis of the multiparametric MRI data in our HSP patients confirmed the non-prominent involvement of the cortex in the primary motor regions but rather of other more associative areas. On the contrary, DTI demonstrated a widespread involvement of the brain WM, including the primary motor regions, which was confirmed at follow-up. The longitudinal analysis revealed an apparent inversion of tendency when considering the expected evolution of a neurodegenerative process: we detected an increase of FA and a decrease of MD and AD. These time-related modifications may suggest a repair attempt by the residual central WM fibers, which requires confirmation with a larger group of patients and with a longer time interval.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00194">Neurophysiological Correlates of Gait in the Human Basal Ganglia and the PPN Region in Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

<p>This study aimed to characterize the neurophysiological correlates of gait in the human pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) region and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) cohort. Though much is known about the PPN region through animal studies, there are limited physiological recordings from ambulatory humans. The PPN has recently garnered interest as a potential deep brain stimulation (DBS) target for improving gait and freezing of gait (FoG) in PD. We used bidirectional neurostimulators to record from the human PPN region and GPi in a small cohort of severely affected PD subjects with FoG despite optimized dopaminergic medications. Five subjects, with confirmed on-dopaminergic medication FoG, were implanted with bilateral GPi and bilateral PPN region DBS electrodes. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained during various gait tasks for 5 months postoperatively in both the off- and on-medication conditions (obtained during the no stimulation condition). The results revealed suppression of low beta power in the GPi and a 1–8 Hz modulation in the PPN region which correlated with human gait. The PPN feature correlated with walking speed. GPi beta desynchronization and PPN low-frequency synchronization were observed as subjects progressed from rest to ambulatory tasks. Our findings add to our understanding of the neurophysiology underpinning gait and will likely contribute to the development of novel therapies for abnormal gait in PD.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:Clinicaltrials.gov identifier; NCT02318927.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00157">Methylene Blue Prevents Retinal Damage Caused by Perinatal Asphyxia in the Rat</a></h4>

<p>Perinatal asphyxia (PA) is responsible for a large proportion of neonatal deaths and numerous neurological sequelae, including visual dysfunction and blindness. In PA, the retina is exposed to ischemia/reoxygenation, which results in nitric oxide (NO) overproduction and neurotoxicity. We hypothesized that methylene blue (MB), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, and free-radical scavenger currently used in the clinic, may block this pathway and prevent PA-induced retinal degeneration. Male rat pups were subjected to an experimental model of PA. Four groups were studied: normally delivered (CTL), normally delivered treated with 2 mg Kg-1 MB (MB), exposed to PA for 20 min at 37°C (PA), and exposed to PA and, then, treated with MB (PA-MB). Scotopic electroretinography performed 45 days after birth showed that PA animals had significant defects in the a- and b-waves and oscillatory potentials (OP). The same animals presented a significant increase in the thickness of the inner retina and a large number of TUNEL-positive cells. All these physiological and morphological parameters were significantly prevented by the treatment with MB. Gene expression analysis demonstrated significant increases in iNOS, MMP9, and VEGF in the eyes of PA animals, which were prevented by MB treatment. In conclusion, MB regulates key players of inflammation, matrix remodeling, gliosis, and angiogenesis in the eye and could be used as a treatment to prevent the deleterious visual consequences of PA. Given its safety profile and low cost, MB may be used clinically in places where alternative treatments may be unavailable.</p>

<p>Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (Hap1) was initially identified as a brain-enriched protein that binds to the Huntington’s disease protein, huntingtin. Unlike huntingtin that is ubiquitously expressed in the brain, Hap1 is enriched in the brain with the highest expression level in the hypothalamus. The selective enrichment of Hap1 in the hypothalamus suggests that Hap1 may play a specific role in hypothalamic function that can regulate metabolism and stress response. Here we report that Hap1 is colocalized and interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in mouse hypothalamic neurons. Genetic depletion of Hap1 reduced the expression level of GR in the hypothalamus. Dexamethasone, a GR agonist, treatment or fasting of mice induced stress, resulting in increased expression of Hap1 in the hypothalamus. However, when Hap1 was absent, these treatments promoted GR reduction in the hypothalamus. In cultured cells, loss of Hap1 shortened the half-life of GR. These findings suggest that Hap1 stabilizes GR in the cytoplasm and that Hap1 dysfunction or deficiency may alter animal’s stress response.</p>

<p>The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a single-pass transmembrane cell adhesion molecule (CAM). CAR is expressed in numerous mammalian tissues including the brain, heart, lung, and testes. In epithelial cells, CAR functions are typical of the quintessential roles of numerous CAMs. However, in the brain the multiple roles of CAR are poorly understood. To better understand the physiological role of CAR in the adult brain, characterizing its location is a primordial step to advance our knowledge of its functions. In addition, CAR is responsible for the attachment, internalization, and retrograde transport of canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vectors, which have found a niche in the mapping of neuronal circuits and gene transfer to treat and model neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to document the global location of CAR in the healthy, young adult mouse brain. Globally, we found that CAR is expressed by maturing and mature neurons in the brain parenchyma and located on the soma and on projections. While CAR occasionally colocalizes with glial fibrillary acidic protein, this overlap was restricted to areas that are associated with adult neurogenesis.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, other non-dopaminergic neuronal systems such as the serotonergic system are also involved. Serotonergic dysfunction is associated with non-motor symptoms and complications, including anxiety, depression, dementia, and sleep disturbances. This pathology reduces patient quality of life. Interaction between the serotonergic and other neurotransmitters systems such as dopamine, noradrenaline, glutamate, and GABA controls the activity of striatal neurons and are particularly interesting for understanding the pathophysiology of PD. Moreover, serotonergic dysfunction also causes motor symptoms. Interestingly, serotonergic neurons play an important role in the effects of L-DOPA in advanced PD stages. Serotonergic terminals can convert L-DOPA to dopamine, which mediates dopamine release as a “false” transmitter. The lack of any autoregulatory feedback control in serotonergic neurons to regulate L-DOPA-derived dopamine release contributes to the appearance of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). This mechanism may also be involved in the development of graft-induced dyskinesias (GID), possibly due to the inclusion of serotonin neurons in the grafted tissue. Consistent with this, the administration of serotonergic agonists suppressed LID. In this review article, we summarize the interactions between the serotonergic and other systems. We also discuss the role of the serotonergic system in LID and if therapeutic approaches specifically targeting this system may constitute an effective strategy in PD.</p>

Background<p>Recently, TDP-43 has been recognized as a common proteinopathy in the “oldest old” and a neuropathological comorbidity in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, since it has a low concentration in cerebrospinal fluid, the presence of TDP-43 in AD is rarely investigated in vivo.</p>Methods<p>Twenty-four patients with amyloid PET confirmed AD and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study.

There was no correlation between TDP-43 level and cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms or APOE genotype in patients with AD.</p>Conclusion<p>This study demonstrated increased TDP-43 accumulation in AD patients by examining plasma NDEs, which may provide a window into the effects of TDP-43 on AD progression.</p>

<p>Mobile phone use has rapidly increased worldwide, and pregnant women are passively or actively exposed to the associated electromagnetic radiation. Maternal cell phone exposure is related to behavioral difficulties in young offspring. However, whether prenatal mobile phone exposure can predispose the elderly offspring to cognitive impairment is unclear. The enriched environment (EE) has shown positive effects on cognition in an immature brain, but its impact on aging offspring after prenatal cell phone exposure is unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether prenatal exposure to mobile phone exerts long-term effects on cognition in elderly rat offspring and whether EE during adulthood can rescue cognitive impairment by altering the synaptic plasticity. Pregnant rats were subjected to prenatal short-term or long-term cell phone exposure and offspring rats were randomly assigned to standard or EE. Spatial learning and memory were investigated using Morris water maze (MWM) in elderly rat offspring. Hippocampal cellular morphology was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and synaptic ultrastructure was evaluated with transmission electron microscopy. Expression of synaptophysin (SYN), postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were detected by western blot. The results demonstrated that prenatal long-term but not short-term exposure to mobile phone lead to cognitive impairment, morphological changes in the hippocampal cells, reduced synaptic number, decreased SYN, PSD-95, and BDNF expression in elderly offspring, which were alleviated by postnatal EE housing. These findings suggest that prenatal long-term mobile phone exposure may pose life-long adverse effects on elderly offspring and impair cognition by disrupting the synaptic plasticity, which may be reversed by postnatal EE housing.</p>

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a class of disorders affecting brain development and function and are characterized by wide genetic and clinical variability. In this review, we discuss the multiple factors that influence the clinical presentation of NDDs, with particular attention to gene vulnerability, mutational load, and the two-hit model. Despite the complex architecture of mutational events associated with NDDs, the various proteins involved appear to converge on common pathways, such as synaptic plasticity/function, chromatin remodelers and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.

Molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses are increasingly popular to explore the genetic architecture of complex traits, but existing studies do not leverage shared regulatory patterns and suffer from a large multiplicity burden, which hampers the detection of weak signals such as <i>trans</i> associations. Here, we present a fully multivariate proteomic QTL (pQTL) analysis performed with our recently proposed Bayesian method LOCUS on data from two clinical cohorts, with plasma protein levels quantified by mass-spectrometry and aptamer-based assays. Our two-stage study identifies 136 pQTL associations in the first cohort, of which &gt;80% replicate in the second independent cohort and have significant enrichment with functional genomic elements and disease risk loci. Moreover, 78% of the pQTLs whose protein abundance was quantified by both proteomic techniques are confirmed across assays. Our thorough comparisons with standard univariate QTL mapping on (1) these data and (2) synthetic data emulating the real data show how LOCUS borrows strength across correlated protein levels and markers on a genome-wide scale to effectively increase statistical power. Notably, 15% of the pQTLs uncovered by LOCUS would be missed by the univariate approach, including several <i>trans</i> and pleiotropic hits with successful independent validation. Finally, the analysis of extensive clinical data from the two cohorts indicates that the genetically-driven proteins identified by LOCUS are enriched in associations with low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and might therefore act as endophenotypes for metabolic diseases. While considerations on the clinical role of the pQTLs are beyond the scope of our work, these findings generate useful hypotheses to be explored in future research; all results are accessible online from our searchable database. Thanks to its efficient variational Bayes implementation, LOCUS can analyse jointly thousands of traits and millions of markers. Its applicability goes beyond pQTL studies, opening new perspectives for large-scale genome-wide association and QTL analyses.

<p>We reconstructed the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i> adult hermaphrodite pharyngeal nervous system from serial section electron micrographs to generate a weighted pharyngeal connectome. We subjected the pharyngeal wiring diagram to a set of visual, graph theoretic, statistical, and fluorescent‐reporter analyses, revealing a shallow neural structure. Together, our study shows that most pharyngeal neurons exhibit sensory‐motor characteristics, similar to primitive nervous systems comprised of “ur‐neurons.”

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Detailed anatomical maps of individual organs and entire animals have served as invaluable entry points for ensuing dissection of their evolution, development, and function. The pharynx of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i> is a simple neuromuscular organ with a self‐contained, autonomously acting nervous system, composed of 20 neurons that fall into 14 anatomically distinct types. Using serial electron micrograph (EM) reconstruction, we re‐evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system, providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter‐ and motor neuron classes, we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most, if not all, pharyngeal neurons also classify as motor neurons. Together with the extensive cross‐connectivity among pharyngeal neurons, which is more widespread than previously realized, the sensory‐motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx. Compared with the somatic nervous system, pharyngeal neurons both physically associate with a larger fraction of their neighbors and create synapses with a greater proportion of their neighbors. We speculate that the overall architecture of the pharyngeal nervous system may be reminiscent of the architecture of ancestral, primitive nervous systems.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pharmaco‐refractory focal motor epileptic seizures pose a significant challenge. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a recently recognized therapeutic option for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. To identify the specific target for focal motor seizures, we evaluate the modulatory effects of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation because of the critical role of STN in cortico‐subcortical motor processing.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Seven patients with epilepsy with refractory seizures who underwent chronic stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) monitoring were studied in presurgical evaluation. Seizure onset zone was hypothesized to be partially involved in the motor areas in 6 patients. For each patient, one electrode was temporally implanted into the STN that was ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone. The cortical–subcortical seizure propagation was systemically evaluated. The simultaneously electrophysiological responses over distributed cortical areas to STN stimulation at varied frequencies were quantitatively assessed.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed the consistent downstream propagation of seizures from the motor cortex toward the ipsilateral STN and remarkable cortical responses on motor cortex to single‐pulse STN stimulation. Furthermore, we showed frequency‐dependent upstream modulatory effect of STN stimulation on motor cortex specifically. In contrast to the enhanced effects of low frequency stimulation, high‐frequency stimulation of the STN can significantly reduce interictal spikes, high‐frequency oscillations over motor cortex disclosing effective connections to the STN.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This result showed that the STN is not only engaged in as a propagation network of focal motor seizures but STN stimulation can profoundly modulate the epileptic activity of motor cortex in humans, suggesting a mechanism‐based alternative for patients suffering from refractory focal motor seizures.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hypoxic/ischemic insult, a leading cause of functional brain defects, has been extensively studied in both clinical and experimental animal research, including its etiology, neuropathogenesis, and pharmacological interventions. Transient sublethal hypoxia (TSH) is a common clinical occurrence in the perinatal period. However, its effect on early developing brains remains poorly understood. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of TSH on the dendrite and dendritic spine formation, neuronal and synaptic activity, and cognitive behavior of early postnatal Day 1 rat pups. While TSH showed no obvious effect on gross brain morphology, neuron cell density, or glial activation in the hippocampus, we found transient hypoxia did cause significant changes in neuronal structure and function. In brains exposed to TSH, hippocampal neurons developed shorter and thinner dendrites, with decreased dendritic spine density, and reduced strength in excitatory synaptic transmission. Moreover, TSH‐treated rats showed impaired cognitive performance in spatial learning and memory. Our findings demonstrate that TSH in newborn rats can cause significant impairments in synaptic formation and function, and long‐lasting brain functional deficits. Therefore, this study provides a useful animal model for the study of TSH on early developing brains and to explore potential pharmaceutical interventions for patients subjected to TSH insult.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are severe human disorders resulting from abnormal glucose metabolism, and all previously described GSDs segregate as autosomal recessive or X‐linked traits. In this study, we aimed to molecularly characterize the first family with a dominant GSD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We describe a dominant GSD family with 13 affected members presenting with adult‐onset muscle weakness, and we provide clinical, metabolic, histological, and ultrastructural data. We performed exome sequencing to uncover the causative gene, and functional experiments in the cell model and on recombinant proteins to investigate the pathogenic effect of the identified mutation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a heterozygous missense mutation in <i>PYGM </i> segregating with the disease in the family. <i>PYGM </i> codes for myophosphorylase, the enzyme catalyzing the initial step of glycogen breakdown. Enzymatic tests revealed that the <i>PYGM </i> mutation impairs the AMP‐independent myophosphorylase activity, whereas the AMP‐dependent activity was preserved. Further functional investigations demonstrated an altered conformation and aggregation of mutant myophosphorylase, and the concurrent accumulation of the intermediate filament desmin in the myofibers of the patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, this study describes the first example of a dominant glycogen storage disease in humans, and elucidates the underlying pathomechanisms by deciphering the sequence of events from the PYGM mutation to the accumulation of glycogen in the muscle fibers. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Similar to patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD), healthy subjects at risk for depression show hyperactivation of the amygdala as a response to negative emotional expressions. The medial prefrontal cortex is responsible for amygdala control. Analyzing a large cohort of healthy subjects, we aimed to delineate malfunction in amygdala regulation by the medial prefrontal cortex in subjects at increased risk for depression, i.e., with a family history of affective disorders or a personal history of childhood maltreatment. We included a total of 342 healthy subjects from the FOR2107 cohort (www.for2107.de). An emotional face-matching task was used to identify the medial prefrontal cortex and right amygdala. Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) was conducted and neural coupling parameters were obtained for healthy controls with and without particular risk factors for depression. We assigned a genetic risk if subjects had a first-degree relative with an affective disorder and an environmental risk if subjects experienced childhood maltreatment. We then compared amygdala inhibition during emotion processing between groups. Amygdala inhibition by the medial prefrontal cortex was present in subjects without those two risk factors, as indicated by negative model parameter estimates. Having a genetic risk (i.e., a family history) did not result in changes in amygdala inhibition compared to no risk subjects. In contrast, childhood maltreatment as environmental risk has led to a significant reduction of amygdala inhibition by the medial prefrontal cortex. We propose a mechanistic explanation for the amygdala hyperactivity in subjects with particular risk for depression, in particular childhood maltreatment, caused by a malfunctioned amygdala downregulation via the medial prefrontal cortex. As childhood maltreatment is a major environmentalrisk factor for depression, we emphasize the importance of this potential early biomarker.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive cognitive decline associated with global brain damage. Initially, intracellular paired helical filaments composed by hyperphosphorylated tau and extracellular deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) were postulated as the causing factors of the synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death, detected in AD patients. Therefore, the vast majority of clinical trials were focused on targeting Aβ and tau directly, but no effective treatment has been reported so far. Consequently, only palliative treatments are currently available for AD patients. Over recent years, several studies have suggested the involvement of the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R), a plasma membrane ionotropic ATP-gated receptor, in the AD brain pathology. In this line, altered expression levels and function of P2X7R were found both in AD patients and AD mouse models. Consequently, genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of P2X7R ameliorated the hallmarks and symptoms of different AD mouse models. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about the role of the P2X7R in AD.</p>

<p>Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) dysregulation has been implicated in nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration, one of the main pathological features of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The two isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, have both been suggested to play a detrimental role in neuronal death. To date, several studies have focused on the role of GSK-3β on PD pathogenesis, while the role of GSK-3α has been largely overlooked. Here, we report in situ observations that both GSK-3α and GSK-3β are dephosphorylated at a negatively acting regulatory serine, indicating kinase activation, selectively in nigral dopaminergic neurons following exposure of mice to 1-methyl-4-pheny-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). To identify whether GSK-3α and GSK-3β display functional redundancy in regulating parkinsonian dopaminergic cell death, we analysed dopaminergic neuron-specific Gsk3a null (Gsk3a<sup>ΔDat</sup>) and Gsk3b null (Gsk3b<sup>ΔDat</sup>) mice, respectively. We found that Gsk3b<sup>ΔDat</sup>, but not Gsk3a<sup>ΔDat</sup>, showed significant resistance to MPTP insult, revealing non-redundancy of GSK-3α and GSK-3β in PD pathogenesis. In addition, we tested the neuroprotective effect of tideglusib, the most clinically advanced inhibitor of GSK-3, in the MPTP model of PD. Administration of higher doses (200 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg) of tideglusib exhibited significant neuroprotection, whereas 50 mg/kg tideglusib failed to prevent dopaminergic neurodegeneration from MPTP toxicity. Administration of 200 mg/kg tideglusib improved motor symptoms of MPTP-treated mice. Together, these data demonstrate GSK-3β and not GSK-3α is critical for parkinsonian neurodegeneration. Our data support the view that GSK-3β acts as a potential therapeutic target in PD and tideglusib would be a candidate drug for PD neuroprotective therapy.</p>

<p>Tubulinopathies are a group of recently described diseases characterized by mutations in the tubulin genes. Mutations in TUBB4A produce diseases such as dystonia type 4 (DYT4) and hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC), which are clinically diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We propose the taiep rat as the first animal model for tubulinopathies. The spontaneous mutant suffers from a syndrome related to a central leukodystrophy and characterized by tremor, ataxia, immobility, epilepsy, and paralysis. The pathological signs presented by these rats and the morphological changes we found by our longitudinal MRI study are similar to those of patients with mutations in TUBB4A. The diffuse atrophy we found in brain, cerebellum and spinal cord is related to the changes detectable in many human tubulinopathies and in particular in H-ABC patients, where myelin degeneration at the level of putamen and cerebellum is a clinical trademark of the disease. We performed Tubb4a exon analysis to corroborate the genetic defect and formulated hypotheses about the effect of amino acid 302 change on protein physiology. Optical microscopy of taiep rat cerebella and spinal cord confirmed the optical density loss in white matter associated with myelin loss, despite the persistence of neural fibers.</p>

<p>Subcellular protein delivery is especially important in signal transduction and cell behavior, and is typically achieved by localization signals within the protein. However, protein delivery can also rely on localization of mRNAs that are translated at target sites. Although once considered heretical, RNA localization has proven to be highly conserved in eukaryotes. RNA localization and localized translation are especially relevant in polarized cells like neurons where neurites extend dozens to hundreds of centimeters away from the soma. Local translation confers dendrites and axons the capacity to respond to their environment in an acute manner without fully relying on somatic signals. The relevance of local protein synthesis in neuron development, maintenance and disease has not been fully acknowledged until recent years, partly due to the limited amount of locally produced proteins. For instance, in hippocampal neurons levels of newly synthesized somatic proteins can be more than 20–30 times greater than translation levels of neuritic proteins. Thus local translation events can be easily overlooked under the microscope. Here we describe an object-based analysis used to visualize and quantify local RNA translation sites in neurites. Newly synthesized proteins are tagged with puromycin and endogenous RNAs labeled with SYTO. After imaging, signals corresponding to neuritic RNAs and proteins are filtered with a Laplacian operator to enhance the edges. Resulting pixels are converted into objects and selected by automatic masking followed by signal smoothing. Objects corresponding to RNA or protein and colocalized objects (RNA and protein) are quantified along individual neurites. Colocalization between RNA and protein in neurites correspond to newly synthesized proteins arising from localized RNAs and represent localized translation sites. To test the validity of our analyses we have compared control neurons to Aβ<sub>1</sub><sub>–</sub><sub>42</sub>-treated neurons. Aβ is involved in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease and was previously reported to induce local translation in axons and dendrites which in turn contributes to the disease. We have observed that Aβ increases the synthesis of neuritic proteins as well as the fraction of translating RNAs in distal sites of the neurite, suggesting an induction of local protein synthesis. Our results thus confirm previous reports and validate our quantification method.</p>

<p>Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common type of focal epilepsy. It is frequently associated with abnormal MRI findings, which are caused by underlying cellular, structural, and chemical changes at the micro-scale. In the current study, it is investigated to which extent these alterations correspond to imaging features detected by high resolution magnetic resonance imaging in the intrahippocampal kainate mouse model of MTLE. Fixed hippocampal and whole-brain sections of mouse brain tissue from nine animals under physiological and chronically epileptic conditions were examined using structural and diffusion-weighted MRI. Microstructural details were investigated based on a direct comparison with immunohistochemical analyses of the same specimen. Within the hippocampal formation, diffusion streamlines could be visualized corresponding to dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells and granule cells, as well as mossy fibers and Schaffer collaterals. Statistically significant changes in diffusivities, fractional anisotropy, and diffusion orientations could be detected in tissue samples from chronically epileptic animals compared to healthy controls, corresponding to microstructural alterations (degeneration of pyramidal cells, dispersion of the granule cell layer, and sprouting of mossy fibers). The diffusion parameters were significantly correlated with histologically determined cell densities. These findings demonstrate that high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI can resolve subtle microstructural changes in epileptic hippocampal tissue corresponding to histopathological features in MTLE.</p>

<p>Sensory stimulation is an attractive paradigm for studying brain activity using various optical-, ultrasound- and MRI-based functional neuroimaging methods. Optoacoustics has been recently suggested as a powerful new tool for scalable mapping of multiple hemodynamic parameters with rich contrast and previously unachievable spatio-temporal resolution. Yet, its utility for studying the processing of peripheral inputs at the whole brain level has so far not been quantified. We employed volumetric multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (vMSOT) to non-invasively monitor the HbO, HbR, and HbT dynamics across the mouse somatosensory cortex evoked by electrical paw stimuli. We show that elevated contralateral activation is preserved in the HbO map (invisible to MRI) under isoflurane anesthesia. Brain activation is shown to be predominantly confined to the somatosensory cortex, with strongest activation in the hindpaw region of the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Furthermore, vMSOT detected the presence of an initial dip in the contralateral hindpaw region in the delta HbO channel. Sensorimotor cortical activity was identified over all other regions in HbT and HbO but not in HbR. Pearson’s correlation mapping enabled localizing the response to the sensorimotor cortex further highlighting the ability of vMSOT to bridge over imaging performance deficiencies of other functional neuroimaging modalities.</p>

<p>Early brain development from infancy through childhood is closely related to the development of cognition and behavior in later life. Human brain connectome is a novel framework for describing topological organization of the developing brain. Resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), with a natural scanning environment, low cost, and high portability, is considered as an emerging imaging technique and has shown valuable potential in exploring brain network architecture and its changes during the development. Here, we review the recent advances involving typical and atypical development of the brain connectome from neonates to children using resting-state fNIRS imaging. This review highlights that the combination of brain connectome and resting-state fNIRS imaging offers a promising framework for understanding human brain development.</p>

<p>Background: Stress-induced cellular changes in limbic brain structures contribute to the development of various psychopathologies. In vivo detection of these microstructural changes may help us to develop objective biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced neuroimaging technique that enables the non-invasive examination of white matter integrity and provides insights into the microstructure of pathways connecting brain areas.</p><p>Objective: Our aim was to examine the temporal dynamics of stress-induced structural changes with repeated in vivo DTI scans and correlate them with behavioral alterations.</p><p>Methods: Out of 32 young adult male rats, 16 were exposed to daily immobilization stress for 3 weeks. Four DTI measurements were done: one before the stress exposure (baseline), two scans during the stress (acute and chronic phases), and a last one 2 weeks after the end of the stress protocol (recovery). We used a 4.7T small-animal MRI system and examined 18 gray and white matter structures calculating the following parameters: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). T2-weighted images were used for volumetry. Cognitive performance and anxiety levels of the animals were assessed in the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, open field, and elevated plus maze tests.</p><p>Results: Reduced FA and increased MD and RD values were found in the corpus callosum and external capsule of stressed rats. Stress increased RD in the anterior commissure and reduced MD and RD in the amygdala. We observed time-dependent changes in several DTI parameters as the rats matured, but we found no evidence of stress-induced volumetric alterations in the brains. Stressed rats displayed cognitive impairments and we found numerous correlations between the cognitive performance of the animals and between various DTI metrics of the inferior colliculus, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and amygdala.</p><p>Conclusions: Our data provide further support to the translational value of DTI studies and suggest that chronic stress exposure results in similar white matter microstructural alterations that have been documented in stress-related psychiatric disorders. These DTI findings imply microstructural abnormalities in the brain, which may underlie the cognitive deficits that are often present in stress-related mental disorders.</p>

<p>Restricted interests (RIs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are clinically impairing interests of unusual focus or intensity. They are a subtype of restricted and repetitive behaviors which are one of two diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Despite the near ubiquity of RIs in ASD, the neural basis for their development is not well understood. However, recent cognitive neuroscience findings from nonclinical samples and from individuals with ASD shed light on neural mechanisms that may explain the emergence of RIs. We propose the nexus model of RIs in ASD, a novel conceptualization of this symptom domain that suggests that RIs may reflect a co-opting of brain systems that typically serve to integrate complex attention, memory, semantic, and social communication functions during development. The nexus model of RIs hypothesizes that when social communicative development is compromised, brain functions typically located within the lateral surface of cortex may expand into social processing brain systems and alter cortical representations of various cognitive functions during development. These changes, in turn, promote the development of RIs as an alternative process mediated by these brain networks. The nexus model of RIs makes testable predictions about reciprocal relations between the impaired development of social communication and the emergence of RIs in ASD and suggests novel avenues for treatment development.</p>

<p>Despite its impact on everyday functioning, spatial perspective-taking has rarely been investigated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and previous findings are surprisingly sparse and inconsistent. In the present study, we aimed to investigate spatial perspective-taking abilities in children and adolescents with ASD without intellectual disabilities, comparing them with a group of typically developing (TD) peers. Our objectives were: (i) to test similarities and differences between these groups in a spatial perspective-taking task; and (ii) to see whether similar or different underlying processes (i.e., fine and gross motor skills, and visuospatial abilities) might account for the groups’ performance in the spatial perspective-taking task. A group of children with ASD (N = 36) was compared with a TD group (N = 39), aged from 8 to 16 years. Participants were administered tasks assessing spatial perspective-taking, fine and gross motor skills, visuo-constructive abilities, visuospatial working memory, visual imagery, and mental rotation. Our results revealed that the ASD group had more difficulty with the spatial perspective-taking task than the TD group. The two groups also had some shared and some different processes that predicted their perspective-taking performance: a significant predictive effect of fine motor skills and visuospatial working memory emerged for both groups, while gross motor skills (i.e., walking heel-to-toe) and visuospatial imagery only revealed a role in the TD group. These findings suggest that different abilities might account for the two groups’ performance in the spatial perspective-taking task. Gross motor skills and complex visuospatial abilities seem to be more important in sustaining spatial perspective-taking ability in typical development than in the event of ASD. Some of the clinical and educational implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

<p>Background: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in both hemispheres have a central integrative function for motor control and behavior. Understanding the hemispheric difference between DLPFC and ipsilateral motor cortex connection in the resting-state will provide fundamental knowledge to explain the different roles DLPFC plays in motor behavior.</p><p>Purpose: The current study tested the interactions between the ipsilateral DLPFC and the primary motor cortex (M1) in each hemisphere at rest.

The conditioning stimulus (CS) was applied to the DLPFC and the test stimulus (TS) was applied to M1. Interstimulus intervals (ISIs) between CS and TS were 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 ms. The result was expressed as a percentage of the mean peak-to-peak amplitude of the unconditioned test pulse.</p><p>Results: There was stronger inhibitory effect for the left compared to the right hemisphere at ISIs of 2 (p = 0.045), 10 (p = 0.006), 15 (p = 0.029) and 20 (p = 0.024) ms. There was no significant inhibition or facilitation at any ISI in the right hemisphere.</p><p>Conclusions: The two hemispheres have distinct DLPFC and M1 cortico-cortical connectivity at rest.

<p>Eye-to-eye contact is a spontaneous behavior between interacting partners that occurs naturally during social interactions. However, individuals differ with respect to eye gaze behaviors such as frequency of eye-to-eye contacts, and these variations may reflect underlying differences in social behavior in the population. While the use of eye signaling to indicate a shared object of attention in joint attention tasks has been well-studied, the effects of the natural variation in establishing eye contact during joint attention have not been isolated. Here, we investigate this question using a novel two-person joint attention task. Participants were not instructed regarding the use of eye contacts; thus all mutual eye contact events between interacting partners that occurred during the joint attention task were spontaneous and varied with respect to frequency. We predicted that joint attention systems would be modulated by differences in the social behavior across participant pairs, which could be measured by the frequency of eye contact behavior. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning and eye-tracking to measure the neural signals associated with joint attention in interacting dyads and to record the number of eye contact events between them. Participants engaged in a social joint attention task in which real partners used eye gaze to direct each other’s attention to specific targets. Findings were compared to a non-social joint attention task in which an LED cue directed both partners’ attention to the same target. The social joint attention condition showed greater activity in right temporoparietal junction than the non-social condition, replicating prior joint attention results. Eye-contact frequency modulated the joint attention activity, revealing bilateral activity in social and high level visual areas associated with partners who made more eye contact. Additionally, when the number of mutual eye contact events was used to classify each pair as either “high eye contact” or “low eye contact” dyads, cross-brain coherence analysis revealed greater coherence between high eye contact dyads than low eye contact dyads in these same areas. Together, findings suggest that variation in social behavior as measured by eye contact modulates activity in a subunit of the network associated with joint attention.</p>

<p>cAMP is a positive regulator tightly involved in certain types of synaptic plasticity and related memory functions. However, its spatiotemporal roles at the synaptic and neural circuit levels remain elusive. Using a combination of a cAMP optogenetics approach and voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging with electrophysiological recording, we define a novel capacity of postsynaptic cAMP in enabling dentate gyrus long-term potentiation (LTP) and depolarization in acutely prepared murine hippocampal slices. To manipulate cAMP levels at medial perforant path to granule neuron (MPP-DG) synapses by light, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice expressing photoactivatable adenylyl cyclase (PAC) in DG granule neurons. Using these Tg(CMV-Camk2a-RFP/bPAC)3Koka mice, we recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from MPP-DG synapses and found that photoactivation of PAC during tetanic stimulation enabled synaptic potentiation that persisted for at least 30 min. This form of LTP was induced without the need for GABA receptor blockade that is typically required for inducing DG plasticity. The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) remained unchanged, indicating the cAMP-dependent LTP was likely postsynaptic. By employing fast fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye (VSD: di-4-ANEPPS) and fluorescence imaging, we found that photoactivation of the PAC actuator enhanced the intensity and extent of dentate gyrus depolarization triggered following tetanic stimulation. These results demonstrate that the elevation of cAMP in granule neurons is capable of rapidly enhancing synaptic strength and neuronal depolarization. The powerful actions of cAMP are consistent with this second messenger having a critical role in the regulation of synaptic function.</p>

<p>Stroke is one of the major devastating diseases with no effective medical therapeutics. Because of the high rate of disability and mortality among stroke patients, new treatments are urgently required to decrease brain damage following a stroke. In recent years, the inflammasome is a novel breakthrough point that plays an important role in the stroke, and the inhibition of inflammasome may be an effective method for stroke treatment. Briefly, inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that causes activation of caspase-1 and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory factors including interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1β. Among them, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most typical inflammasome, which can detect cell damage and mediate inflammatory response to tissue damage in ischemic stroke. The NLRP3 inflammasome has become a key mediator of post-ischemic inflammation, leading to a cascade of inflammatory reactions and cell death eventually. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome is an ideal therapeutic target due to its important role in the inflammatory response after ischemic stroke. In this mini review article, we will summarize the structure, assembly, and regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome, the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in ischemic stroke, and several treatments targeting NLRP3 inflammasome in ischemic stroke. The further understanding of the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome in patients with ischemic stroke will provide novel targets for the treatment of cerebral ischemic stroke patients.</p>

<p>Inflammatory processes occurring in the perinatal period may affect different brain regions, resulting in neurologic sequelae. Injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at different neurodevelopmental stages produces long-term consequences in several brain structures, but there is scarce evidence regarding alterations in the cerebellum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term consequences on the cerebellum of a systemic inflammatory process induced by neonatal LPS injection. For this, neonatal rats were randomly assigned to three different groups: naïve, sham, and LPS. Saline (sham group) or LPS solution (1 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected on alternate postnatal days (PN) PN1, PN3, PN5, and PN7. Spontaneous activity was evaluated with the open field test in adulthood. The cerebellum was evaluated for different parameters: microglial and Purkinje cell densities, oxidative stress levels, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mRNA expression. Our results show that administration of LPS did not result in altered spontaneous activity in adult animals. Our data also indicate increased oxidative stress in the cerebellum, as evidenced by an increase in superoxide fluorescence by dihydroethidium (DHE) indicator. Stereological analyses indicated increased microglial density in the cerebellum that was not accompanied by Purkinje cell loss or altered TNF-α expression in adult animals. Interestingly, Purkinje cells ectopically positioned in the granular and molecular layers of the cerebellum were observed in animals of the LPS group. Our data suggest that neonatal LPS exposure causes persistent cellular and molecular changes to the cerebellum, indicating the susceptibility of this region to systemic inflammatory insults in infancy. Further investigation of the consequences of these changes and the development of strategies to avoid those should be subject of future studies.</p>

<p>The mammalian neurovascular unit (NVU) is comprised of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. The NVU is the nexus between the cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS). The central component of the NVU is the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which consists of a monolayer of tightly connected endothelial cells covered by pericytes and further surrounded by astrocytic endfeet. In addition to preventing the diffusion of toxic species into the CNS, the BBB endothelium serves as a dynamic regulatory system facilitating the transport of molecules from the bloodstream to the brain and vis versa. The structural integrity and transport functions of the BBB are maintained, in part, by an orchestra of membrane receptors and transporters including members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we provide an overview of GPCRs known to regulate mammalian BBB structure and function and discuss how dysregulation of these pathways plays a role in various neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Insects that transmit many of the world’s deadliest animal diseases, for instance trypanosomosis, find their suitable hosts and avoid non-preferred hosts mostly through olfactory cues. The waterbuck repellent blend (WRB) comprising geranylacetone, guaiacol, pentanoic acid, and δ-octalactone derived from waterbuck skin odor is a repellent to some savannah-adapted tsetse flies and reduces trap catches of riverine species. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with detection and coding of the repellent odors remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that WRB inhibited blood feeding in both Glossina pallidipes Austen, 1903 and Glossina fuscipes fuscipes Newstead, 1910. Using the DREAM (Deorphanization of Receptors based on Expression Alterations in odorant receptor mRNA levels) technique, combined with ortholog comparison and molecular docking, we predicted the putative odorant receptors (ORs) for the WRB in G. f. fuscipes, a non-model insect. We show that exposure of G. f. fuscipes in vivo to WRB odorant resulted in up- and downregulation of mRNA transcript of several ORs. The WRB component with strong feeding inhibition altered mRNA transcript differently as compared to an attractant odor, showing these two odors of opposing valence already segregate at the cellular and molecular levels. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the predicted ligand–OR binding pockets consisted mostly of hydrophobic residues with a few hydrogen bonds but a stable interaction. Finally, our electrophysiological response showed the olfactory sensory neurons of G. f. fuscipes tuned to the tsetse repellent components in different sensitivity and selectivity.</p>

Background<p>Multiparity – grand multiparity (i.e., five or more childbirths) in particular – has been reported to have an association with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia or related cognitive decline in women. However, the pathological links underlying this relationship are still unknown. This study was conducted to examine the relationships of multiparity with cerebral amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, brain atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs).</p>Methods<p>In this study, total of 237 older women with 148 cognitively normal and 89 mild cognitive impairment from the Korean Brain Aging Study for Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease (KBASE) were included. Participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments in addition to <sup>11</sup>C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The associations of parity with Aβ deposition, hippocampal volume, cortical volume, WMH volume and mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score were examined.</p>Results<p>Participants with grand multiparity showed significantly reduced adjusted hippocampal volume, spatial pattern of atrophy for recognition of AD volume and spatial pattern of atrophy for recognition of brain aging volume even after controlling for potential confounders. Furthermore, MMSE score was also significantly lower in this group. In contrast, grand multiparity did not show any association with global Aβ retention, Aβ positivity rate, or WMH volume, regardless of covariates.</p>Conclusion<p>Our findings suggest that grand multiparity contributes to cognitive decline or increased dementia risk in older women by aggravating amyloid-independent hippocampal or cortical atrophy.</p>
