                <p>The release of neurotransmitters (NTs) at central synapses is dependent on a cascade of protein interactions, specific to the presynaptic compartment. Among those dedicated molecules, the cytosolic complexins play an incompletely defined role as synaptic transmission regulators. Complexins are multidomain proteins that bind soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complexes, conferring both inhibitory and stimulatory functions. Using systematic mutagenesis and comparing reconstituted in vitro membrane fusion assays with electrophysiology in cultured neurons from mice of either sex, we deciphered the function of the N-terminus of complexin (Cpx) II. The N-terminus (amino acid 1&ndash;27) starts with a region enriched in hydrophobic amino acids (1&ndash;12), which binds lipids. Mutants maintaining this hydrophobic character retained the stimulatory function of Cpx, whereas exchanges introducing charged residues perturbed both spontaneous and evoked exocytosis. Mutants in the more distal region of the N-terminal domain (amino acid 11&ndash;18) showed a spectrum of effects. On the one hand, mutation of residue A12 increased spontaneous release without affecting evoked release. On the other hand, replacing D15 with amino acids of different shapes or hydrophobic properties (but not charge) not only increased spontaneous release but also impaired evoked release. Most surprising, this substitution reduced the size of the readily releasable pool, a novel function for Cpx at mammalian synapses. Thus, the exact amino acid composition of the Cpx N-terminus fine-tunes the degree of spontaneous and evoked NT release.</p>

                <p>Metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (mGlu8) is a heterogeneously expressed and poorly understood glutamate receptor with potential pharmacological significance. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical inhibitory modulator of the thalamocortical&ndash;corticothalamic (TC&ndash;CT) network and plays a crucial role in information processing throughout the brain, is implicated in a variety of psychiatric conditions, and is also a site of significant mGlu8 expression. Using both male and female mice, we determined via fluorescent in situ hybridization that parvalbumin-expressing cells in the TRN core and shell matrices (identified by <I>spp1+</I> and <I>ecel1+</I> expression, respectively), as well as the cortical layers involved in CT signaling, express <I>grm8</I> mRNA. We then assayed the physiological and behavioral impacts of perturbing <I>grm8</I> signaling in the TC circuit through conditional (adeno-associated virus-CRE mediated) and cell-type-specific constitutive deletion strategies. We show that constitutive parvalbumin <I>grm8</I> knock-out (PV<I><sup>grm8</sup></I> knock-out) mice exhibited (1) increased spontaneous excitatory drive onto dorsal thalamus relay cells and (2) impaired sensorimotor gating, measured via paired-pulse inhibition, but observed no differences in locomotion and thigmotaxis in repeated bouts of open field test (OFT). Conversely, we observed hyperlocomotive phenotypes and anxiolytic effects of AAV-mediated conditional knockdown of <I>grm8</I> in the TRN (TRN<I><sup>grm8</sup></I> knockdown) in repeated OFT. Our findings underscore a role for mGlu8 in regulating excitatory neurotransmission as well as anxiety-related locomotor behavior and sensorimotor gating, revealing potential therapeutic applications for various neuropsychiatric disorders and guiding future research endeavors into mGlu8 signaling and TRN function.</p>

                <p>Aberrant increase of arachidonic acid (ARA) has long been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the underlying causal mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we revealed a link between ARA mobilization and microglial dysfunction in A&beta; pathology. Lipidomic analysis of primary microglia from App<sup>NL-GF</sup> mice showed a marked increase in free ARA and lysophospholipids (LPLs) along with a decrease in ARA-containing phospholipids, suggesting increased ARA release from phospholipids (PLs). To manipulate ARA-containing PLs in microglia, we genetically deleted lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (<I>Lpcat3</I>), the main enzyme catalyzing the incorporation of ARA into PLs. Loss of microglial <I>Lpcat3</I> reduced the levels of ARA-containing PLs, free ARA and LPLs, leading to a compensatory increase in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-containing PLs in both male and female <I>App</I><sup>NL-GF</sup> mice. Notably, the reduction of ARA in microglia significantly ameliorated oxidative stress and inflammatory responses while enhancing the phagocytosis of A&beta; plaques and promoting the compaction of A&beta; deposits. Mechanistically, scRNA seq suggested that LPCAT3 deficiency facilitates phagocytosis by facilitating de novo lipid synthesis while protecting microglia from oxidative damage. Collectively, our study reveals a novel mechanistic link between ARA mobilization and microglial dysfunction in AD. Lowering brain ARA levels through pharmacological or dietary interventions may be a potential therapeutic strategy to slow down AD progression.</p>

                <p>Engaging the retrieval state (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B49">Tulving, 1983</cross-ref>) impacts processing and behavior (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B34">Long and Kuhl, 2019</cross-ref>, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">2021</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Smith et al., 2022</cross-ref>), but the extent to which top-down factors&mdash;explicit instructions and goals&mdash;versus bottom-up factors&mdash;stimulus properties such as repetition and similarity&mdash;jointly or independently induce the retrieval state is unclear. Identifying the impact of bottom-up and top-down factors on retrieval state engagement is critical for understanding how control of task-relevant versus task-irrelevant brain states influence cognition. We conducted between-subjects recognition memory tasks on male and female human participants in which we varied test phase goals. We recorded scalp electroencephalography and used an independently validated mnemonic state classifier (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Long, 2023</cross-ref>) to measure retrieval state engagement as a function of top-down task goals (recognize old vs detect new items) and bottom-up stimulus repetition (hits vs correct rejections (CRs)). We find that whereas the retrieval state is engaged for hits regardless of top-down goals, the retrieval state is only engaged during CRs when the top-down goal is to recognize old items. Furthermore, retrieval state engagement is greater for low compared to high confidence hits when the task goal is to recognize old items. Together, these results suggest that top-down demands to recognize old items induce the retrieval state independent from bottom-up factors, potentially reflecting the recruitment of internal attention to enable access of a stored representation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/31/e0535222024?rss=1">RIM and RIM-Binding Protein Localize Synaptic CaV2 Channels to Differentially Regulate Transmission in Neuronal Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>At chemical synapses, voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) translate electrical signals into a trigger for synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion. VGCCs and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains they elicit must be located precisely to primed SVs to evoke rapid transmitter release. Localization is mediated by Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM) and RIM-binding proteins, which interact and bind to the C terminus of the CaV2 VGCC &alpha;-subunit. We studied this machinery at the mixed cholinergic/GABAergic neuromuscular junction of <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> hermaphrodites. <I>rimb-1</I> mutants had mild synaptic defects, through loosening the anchoring of UNC-2/CaV2 and delaying the onset of SV fusion. UNC-10/RIM deletion much more severely affected transmission. Although postsynaptic depolarization was reduced, <I>rimb-1</I> mutants had increased cholinergic (but reduced GABAergic) transmission, to compensate for the delayed release. This did not occur when the excitation&ndash;inhibition (E&ndash;I) balance was altered by removing GABA transmission. Further analyses of GABA defective mutants and GABA<SUB>A</SUB> or GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptor deletions, as well as cholinergic rescue of RIMB-1, emphasized that GABA neurons may be more affected than cholinergic neurons. Thus, RIMB-1 function differentially affects excitation&ndash;inhibition balance in the different motor neurons, and RIMB-1 thus may differentially regulate transmission within circuits. Untethering the UNC-2/CaV2 channel by removing its C-terminal PDZ ligand exacerbated the <I>rimb-1</I> defects, and similar phenotypes resulted from acute degradation of the CaV2 &beta;-subunit CCB-1. Therefore, untethering of the CaV2 complex is as severe as its elimination, yet it does not abolish transmission, likely due to compensation by CaV1. Thus, robustness and flexibility of synaptic transmission emerge from VGCC regulation.</p>

                <p>During navigation, the neocortex actively integrates learned spatial context with current sensory experience to guide behaviors. However, the relative encoding of spatial and sensorimotor information among cortical cells, and whether hippocampal feedback continues to modify these properties after learning, remains poorly understood. Thus, two-photon microscopy of male and female Thy1-GCaMP6s mice was used to longitudinally image neurons spanning superficial retrosplenial cortex and layers II&ndash;Va of primary and secondary motor cortices before and after bilateral dorsal hippocampal lesions. During behavior on a familiar cued treadmill, the locations of two obstacles were interchanged to decouple place-tuning from cue-tuning among position-correlated cells with fields at those locations. Subpopulations of place and cue cells each formed interareal gradients such that higher-level cortical regions exhibited higher fractions of place cells, whereas lower-level regions exhibited higher fractions of cue cells. Position-correlated cells in the motor cortex also formed translaminar gradients; more superficial cells were more likely to exhibit fields and were more sparsely and precisely tuned than deeper cells. After dorsal hippocampal lesions, a neural representation of the learned environment persisted, but retrosplenial cortex exhibited significantly increased cue-tuning, and, in motor cortices, both position-correlated cell recruitment and population activity at the unstable obstacle locations became more homogeneously elevated across laminae. Altogether, these results support that the hippocampus continues to modulate cortical responses in familiar environments, and the relative impact of descending feedback obeys hierarchical interareal and interlaminar gradients opposite to the flow of ascending sensory inputs.</p>

                <p>Neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) and intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt) that express the glucagon gene (<I>Gcg</I>) give rise to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)-immunopositive axons in the spinal cord and many subcortical brain regions. Central GLP1 receptor signaling contributes to motivated behavior and stress responses in rats and mice, in which hindbrain GLP1 neurons are activated to express c-Fos in a metabolic state-dependent manner. The present study examined whether GLP1 inputs to distinct brain regions arise from distinct subsets of <I>Gcg</I>-expressing neurons, and mapped the distribution of axon collaterals arising from projection-defined GLP1 neural populations. Using our Gcg-Cre knock-in rat model, Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) tracing was conducted in adult male and female rats to compare axonal projections of IRt versus cNTS GLP1 neurons. Overlapping projections were observed in all brain regions that receive GLP1 input, with the caveat that cNTS injections produced Cre-dependent labeling of some IRt neurons, and vice versa. In additional experiments, specific diencephalic or limbic forebrain nuclei were microinjected with Cre-dependent retrograde AAVs (AAVrg) that expressed reporters to fully label the axon collaterals of transduced GLP1 neurons. AAVrg injected into each forebrain site labeled <I>Gcg</I>-expressing neurons in both the cNTS and IRt. The collective axon collaterals of labeled neurons entered the spinal cord and every brain region previously reported to contain GLP1-positive axons. These results indicate that the axons of GLP1 neural populations that innervate the thalamic paraventricular nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and/or bed nucleus of the stria terminalis collectively innervate all central regions that receive GLP1 axonal input.</p>

                <p>The ventrolateral medulla (VLM) is a crucial region in the brain for visceral and somatic control, serving as a significant source of synaptic input to the spinal cord. Experimental studies have shown that gene expression in individual VLM neurons is predictive of their function. However, the molecular and cellular organization of the VLM has remained uncertain. This study aimed to create a comprehensive dataset of VLM cells using single-cell RNA sequencing in male and female mice. The dataset was enriched with targeted sequencing of spinally-projecting and adrenergic/noradrenergic VLM neurons. Based on differentially expressed genes, the resulting dataset of 114,805 VLM cells identifies 23 subtypes of neurons, excluding those in the inferior olive, and five subtypes of astrocytes. Spinally-projecting neurons were found to be abundant in seven subtypes of neurons, which were validated through in situ hybridization. These subtypes included adrenergic/noradrenergic neurons, serotonergic neurons, and neurons expressing gene markers associated with premotor neurons in the ventromedial medulla. Further analysis of adrenergic/noradrenergic neurons and serotonergic neurons identified nine and six subtypes, respectively, within each class of monoaminergic neurons. Marker genes that identify the neural network responsible for breathing were concentrated in two subtypes of neurons, delineated from each other by markers for excitatory and inhibitory neurons. These datasets are available for public download and for analysis with a user-friendly interface. Collectively, this study provides a fine-scale molecular identification of cells in the VLM, forming the foundation for a better understanding of the VLM's role in vital functions and motor control.</p>

                <p>Although hyperactivity is associated with a wide variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, the early embryonic origins of locomotion have hindered investigation of pathogenesis of these debilitating behaviors. The earliest motor output in vertebrate animals is generated by clusters of early-born motor neurons (MNs) that occupy distinct regions of the spinal cord, innervating stereotyped muscle groups. Gap junction electrical synapses drive early spontaneous behavior in zebrafish, prior to the emergence of chemical neurotransmitter networks. We use a genetic model of hyperactivity to gain critical insight into the consequences of errors in motor circuit formation and function, finding that Fragile X syndrome model mutant zebrafish are hyperexcitable from the earliest phases of spontaneous behavior, show altered sensitivity to blockade of electrical gap junctions, and have increased expression of the gap junction protein Connexin 34/35. We further show that this hyperexcitable behavior can be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of electrical synapses. We also use functional imaging to examine MN and interneuron (IN) activity in early embryogenesis, finding genetic disruption of electrical gap junctions uncouples activity between <I>mnx1</I><sup>+</sup> MNs and INs. Taken together, our work highlights the importance of electrical synapses in motor development and suggests that the origins of hyperactivity in neurodevelopmental disorders may be established during the initial formation of locomotive circuits.</p>

                <p><I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), encoded by <I>GRIN</I> genes, are ionotropic glutamate receptors playing a critical role in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and synapse development. Genome sequence analyses have identified variants in <I>GRIN</I> genes in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying disease mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we have created and evaluated a transgenic mouse line carrying a missense variant <I>Grin2b<sup>L825V</sup></I>, corresponding to a de novo <I>GRIN2B</I> variant encoding GluN2B(L825V) found in a patient with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We used HEK293T cells expressing recombinant receptors and primary hippocampal neurons prepared from heterozygous <I>Grin2b<sup>L825V/+</sup></I> (L825V/+) and wild-type (WT) <I>Grin2b<sup>+/+</sup></I> (+/+) male and female mice to assess the functional impact of the variant. Whole-cell NMDAR currents were reduced in neurons from L825V/+ compared with +/+ mice. The peak amplitude of NMDAR-mediated evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDAR-eEPSCs) was unchanged, but NMDAR-eEPSCs in L825V/+ neurons had faster deactivation compared with +/+ neurons and were less sensitive to a GluN2B-selective antagonist ifenprodil. Together, these results suggest a decreased functional contribution of GluN2B subunits to synaptic NMDAR currents in hippocampal neurons from L825V/+ mice. The analysis of the GluN2B(L825V) subunit surface expression and synaptic localization revealed no differences compared with WT GluN2B. Behavioral testing of mice of both sexes demonstrated hypoactivity, anxiety, and impaired sensorimotor gating in the L825V/+ strain, particularly affecting males, as well as cognitive symptoms. The heterozygous L825V/+ mouse offers a clinically relevant model of <I>GRIN2B</I>-related ID/ASD, and our results suggest synaptic-level functional changes that may contribute to neurodevelopmental pathology.</p>

                <p>Complex auditory scenes pose a challenge to attentive listening, rendering listeners slower and more uncertain in their perceptual decisions. How can we explain such behaviors from the dynamics of cortical networks that pertain to the control of listening behavior? We here follow up on the hypothesis that human adaptive perception in challenging listening situations is supported by modular reconfiguration of auditory&ndash;control networks in a sample of <I>N</I> = 40 participants (13 males) who underwent resting-state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Individual titration of a spatial selective auditory attention task maintained an average accuracy of ~70% but yielded considerable interindividual differences in listeners&rsquo; response speed and reported confidence in their own perceptual decisions. Whole-brain network modularity increased from rest to task by reconfiguring auditory, cinguloopercular, and dorsal attention networks. Specifically, interconnectivity between the auditory network and cinguloopercular network decreased during the task relative to the resting state. Additionally, interconnectivity between the dorsal attention network and cinguloopercular network increased. These interconnectivity dynamics were predictive of individual differences in response confidence, the degree of which was more pronounced after incorrect judgments. Our findings uncover the behavioral relevance of functional cross talk between auditory and attentional-control networks during metacognitive assessment of one's own perception in challenging listening situations and suggest two functionally dissociable cortical networked systems that shape the considerable metacognitive differences between individuals in adaptive listening behavior.</p>

                Background Road traffic accidents are a severe health concern in Ethiopia. This study aims to examine the primary contributing variables of road traffic accidents in Ethiopia, North Gondar Zone, under 24 administrative wereda’s. Methods This study utilized secondary data collected from both the werda-level and North Gondar central-level offices within the study areas. The sector police typically submit reports to the zonal-level offices annually. Information regarding crashes, fatalities, and injuries during the study period was extracted from these police reports. The research focused on analyzing the frequency and severity of traffic accidents attributed to various factors of drivers, vehicles, road conditions, pedestrians, and environmental influences. Results In a sample of 603 aggregate road traffic accidents, the data reveals that the majority of damage results are attributed to young drivers, accounting for 58% of the cases, with junior grade level drivers contributing 29.4%. Driving without a license was a significant factor, representing 87%, while accidents involving recruited driver stood at 63.2%. Vehicles with small to articulated trucks contributing to 39%. Mechanical failures were prevalent, with an unknown diagnosis rate of 48.3%. Vehicles in service for 2-5 years accounted for 29.4%. Road surface conditions were 46%, while rural roads saw a higher percentage at 51.2%. Weather conditions played a role also influential, as dry asphalt and gravel roads under main access ownership were linked to of accident, with 91.2% occurring during visible daylight hours between 8:00-12:00 and 15:00-17:00. The victims were predominantly farmers at 49.6%, followed by students at 23%. Conclusions To reduce road traffic accidents in the study area, it is essential to manage causative factors such as driver and road users, vehicles, roads, pedestrians, and environmental behaviors. The study suggests the development of a successful, up-to-date traffic accident database system regionally within respective offices.

                Blast-related craniofacial and ocular injuries have traditionally been associated with battlefields. In civilian populations, these injuries were infrequent, primarily arising from accidental explosions or terrorism incidents. Explosions can inflict severe damage to the neurological, ocular, and auditory systems through blast waves, high-velocity foreign bodies, and thermal radiation. The pathophysiology of blast-related craniofacial injuries is specific and complex, with severe cases often involving both penetrating and blunt trauma, leading to high mortality and morbidity rates. These injuries necessitate multidisciplinary management and can be defined as intracranial polytrauma. Recently, Niger has seen a surge in blast injuries, predominantly due to the increase in clandestine artisanal gold mining. Managing these injuries in resource-limited settings poses significant challenge. Comprehensive national data on these injuries are sparse due to high pre-hospital mortality rates and their infrequent occurrence, resulting in limited experience among our local physicians in their management. We present a rare case involving an artisanal gold miner with a history of smoking and previous concussions from explosion exposures. The patient was transferred to our hospital following severe craniofacial and ocular injuries caused by an accidental dynamite explosion at a mining site. On admission, the patient presented altered consciousness, agitation, unstable vital signs, multiple craniofacial wounds, including a large frontal wound with brain substance extrusion, diffuse facial burns, left globe rupture, and rhinorrhagia. After resuscitation and stabilization, brain imaging revealed multiple complex craniofacial fractures with foreign bodies. The patient underwent multidisciplinary surgical management. However, the postoperative course was complicated by post-concussive syndrome, and infection of the surgical wounds, necessitating surgical revision. Following the second surgery, the postoperative course was uneventful, although the patient experienced reduced visual acuity. This case highlights the management challenges in Niger and underscores the urgent need for clinical studies and training for gold miners to enhance safety practices in their activities.

                <p>by Nan Wu, Isabel Valera, Fabian Sinz, Alexander Ecker, Thomas Euler, Yongrong Qiu</p>

Neural population responses in sensory systems are driven by external physical stimuli. This stimulus-response relationship is typically characterized by receptive fields, which have been estimated by <i>neural system identification</i> approaches. Such models usually require a large amount of training data, yet, the recording time for animal experiments is limited, giving rise to epistemic uncertainty for the learned neural transfer functions. While deep neural network models have demonstrated excellent power on neural prediction, they usually do not provide the uncertainty of the resulting neural representations and derived statistics, such as most exciting inputs (MEIs), from <i>in silico</i> experiments. Here, we present a Bayesian system identification approach to predict neural responses to visual stimuli, and explore whether explicitly modeling network weight variability can be beneficial for identifying neural response properties. To this end, we use variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution of each model weight given the training data. Tests with different neural datasets demonstrate that this method can achieve higher or comparable performance on neural prediction, with a much higher data efficiency compared to Monte Carlo dropout methods and traditional models using point estimates of the model parameters. At the same time, our variational method provides us with an effectively infinite ensemble, avoiding the idiosyncrasy of any single model, to generate MEIs. It allows to estimate the uncertainty of stimulus-response function, which we have found to be negatively correlated with the predictive performance at model level and may serve to evaluate models. Furthermore, our approach enables us to identify response properties with credible intervals and to determine whether the inferred features are meaningful by performing statistical tests on MEIs. Finally, <i>in silico</i> experiments show that our model generates stimuli driving neuronal activity significantly better than traditional models in the limited-data regime.

Like other tropical and subtropical regions, influenza viruses can circulate year-round in Hong Kong. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in influenza activity. The objective of this study was to retrospectively forecast influenza activity during the year 2020 and assess the impact of COVID-19 public health social measures (PHSMs) on influenza activity and hospital admissions in Hong Kong. Using weekly surveillance data on influenza virus activity in Hong Kong from 2010 to 2019, we developed a statistical modeling framework to forecast influenza virus activity and associated hospital admissions. We conducted short-term forecasts (1–4 weeks ahead) and medium-term forecasts (1–13 weeks ahead) for the year 2020, assuming no PHSMs were implemented against COVID-19. We estimated the reduction in transmissibility, peak magnitude, attack rates, and influenza-associated hospitalization rate resulting from these PHSMs. For short-term forecasts, mean ambient ozone concentration and school holidays were found to contribute to better prediction performance, while absolute humidity and ozone concentration improved the accuracy of medium-term forecasts. We observed a maximum reduction of 44.6% (95% CI: 38.6% - 51.9%) in transmissibility, 75.5% (95% CI: 73.0% - 77.6%) in attack rate, 41.5% (95% CI: 13.9% - 55.7%) in peak magnitude, and 63.1% (95% CI: 59.3% - 66.3%) in cumulative influenza-associated hospitalizations during the winter-spring period of the 2019/2020 season in Hong Kong. The implementation of PHSMs to control COVID-19 had a substantial impact on influenza transmission and associated burden in Hong Kong. Incorporating information on factors influencing influenza transmission improved the accuracy of our predictions.

                <p>by Wilfredo Blanco, Joel Tabak, Richard Bertram</p>

The pulsatile activity of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons (GnRH neurons) is a key factor in the regulation of reproductive hormones. This pulsatility is orchestrated by a network of neurons that release the neurotransmitters kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (KNDy neurons), and produce episodic bursts of activity driving the GnRH neurons. We show in this computational study that the features of coordinated KNDy neuron activity can be explained by a neural network in which connectivity among neurons is modular. That is, a network structure consisting of clusters of highly-connected neurons with sparse coupling among the clusters. This modular structure, with distinct parameters for intracluster and intercluster coupling, also yields predictions for the differential effects on synchronization of changes in the coupling strength within clusters versus between clusters.

                <p>by Jonas Verhellen, Kosio Beshkov, Sebastian Amundsen, Torbjørn V. Ness, Gaute T. Einevoll</p>

The human brain operates at multiple levels, from molecules to circuits, and understanding these complex processes requires integrated research efforts. Simulating biophysically-detailed neuron models is a computationally expensive but effective method for studying local neural circuits. Recent innovations have shown that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can accurately predict the behavior of these detailed models in terms of spikes, electrical potentials, and optical readouts. While these methods have the potential to accelerate large network simulations by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional differential equation based modelling, they currently only predict voltage outputs for the soma or a select few neuron compartments. Our novel approach, based on enhanced state-of-the-art architectures for multitask learning (MTL), allows for the simultaneous prediction of membrane potentials in each compartment of a neuron model, at a speed of up to two orders of magnitude faster than classical simulation methods. By predicting all membrane potentials together, our approach not only allows for comparison of model output with a wider range of experimental recordings (patch-electrode, voltage-sensitive dye imaging), it also provides the first stepping stone towards predicting local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals from ANN-based simulations. While LFP and EEG are an important downstream application, the main focus of this paper lies in predicting dendritic voltages within each compartment to capture the entire electrophysiology of a biophysically-detailed neuron model. It further presents a challenging benchmark for MTL architectures due to the large amount of data involved, the presence of correlations between neighbouring compartments, and the non-Gaussian distribution of membrane potentials.

                <p>by Kaleeckal G. Harikumar, Peishen Zhao, Brian P. Cary, Xiaomeng Xu, Aditya J. Desai, Maoqing Dong, Jesse I. Mobbs, Chirine Toufaily, Sebastian G. B. Furness, Arthur Christopoulos, Matthew J. Belousoff, Denise Wootten, Patrick M. Sexton, Laurence J. Miller</p>

Development of optimal therapeutics for disease states that can be associated with increased membrane cholesterol requires better molecular understanding of lipid modulation of the drug target. Type 1 cholecystokinin receptor (CCK1R) agonist actions are affected by increased membrane cholesterol, enhancing ligand binding and reducing calcium signaling, while agonist actions of the closely related CCK2R are not. In this work, we identified a set of chimeric human CCK1R/CCK2R mutations that exchange the cholesterol sensitivity of these 2 receptors, providing powerful tools when expressed in CHO and HEK-293 model cell lines to explore mechanisms. Static, low energy, high-resolution structures of the mutant CCK1R constructs, stabilized in complex with G protein, were not substantially different, suggesting that alterations to receptor dynamics were key to altered function. We reveal that cholesterol-dependent dynamic changes in the conformation of the helical bundle of CCK receptors affects both ligand binding at the extracellular surface and G protein coupling at the cytosolic surface, as well as their interrelationships involved in stimulus-response coupling. This provides an ideal setting for potential allosteric modulators to correct the negative impact of membrane cholesterol on CCK1R.

                Background Preserving the structural integrity of the alveolar ridge is paramount in ensuring the success of dental implant procedures and optimizing both aesthetic and physiological outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of autologous dental grafting and explore intriguing results achieved through the utilization of allogeneic dental grafts obtained from a familial participant within the study’s framework. Methods Eleven patients necessitating bilateral dental extractions were enrolled in the study. Ten patients underwent autologous dental grafting on one side, while the contralateral side remained untreated. In the eleventh case, one side received autogenous dental grafting, while the other side was augmented with an allogeneic graft sourced from the patient’s son. Outcomes were monitored over a four-month period. Results Autogenous dental grafting led to a significant enhancement in bone density values and a reduction in osseous absorption rates(P<0.05) when compared to untreated sites among the ten patients who underwent the procedure. However, notable advancements were observed in patient 11 who received an allogeneic dental graft from a familial donor, suggesting potential superiority over autologous grafting in promoting bone regeneration. These findings underscore the promising prospects of employing allogeneic dental grafts sourced from family members to achieve optimal outcomes in alveolar ridge preservation. Conclusions The study underscores the significance of utilizing autologous dental grafts for preserving alveolar ridge dimensions. Importantly, the noteworthy improvement observed in patient outcomes resulting from the use of allogeneic dental grafts compared to autologous grafts raises several inquiries, particularly concerning the potential relationship between the patient and the donor. Trial registration The study is registered as a BRAZILIAN CLINICAL TEST RECORD (ReBEC): U1111-1305-2793 on 28-05-2024 ( https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-65qchvs).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-273/v2?src=rss">Development and application of a learning enjoyment scale for pedagogical activities [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The impact of learning enjoyment on motivation, enthusiasm, and overall learning experiences is significant. Previous studies, lacking an unbiased tool for measuring enjoyment and confronting various influencing factors, produced conflicting results regarding enjoyment levels in different instructional methods. Hence, we developed a learning enjoyment scale for evaluating both active and passive educational activities. We applied the developed scale to 112 first-year medical and dental students to assess their enjoyment during didactic physiology lectures and explored possible associated factors. Within this data note, we present students’ responses to the developed LES. The LES encompasses six dimensions: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, concentration, and enjoyment. Students provided ratings for each dimension on a five-point Likert scale, spanning from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The cumulative scores across the six dimensions range from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 30. These total scores can be categorized as excellent (> 24), acceptable (18-24), or low (< 18). The second section of the dataset examines specific factors influencing overall enjoyment, such as teacher proficiency, topic difficulty, active student participation, objectives fulfillment, low stress levels, and self-perceived acquisition of skills. In addition to objective measurement of students’ enjoyment level, the LES can be utilized for quantitative cross-comparisons between different teaching activities. By employing this dataset, we will undertake an analysis to determine the internal consistency of the Learning Enjoyment Scale (LES), with the anticipation that the outcomes will be published in another venue.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92822">Structural and dynamic changes in P-Rex1 upon activation by PIP3 and inhibition by IP4</a></h4>

              
                PIP<sub>3</sub>-dependent Rac exchanger 1 (P-Rex1) is abundantly expressed in neutrophils and plays central roles in chemotaxis and cancer metastasis by serving as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac. The enzyme is synergistically activated by PIP<sub>3</sub> and heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits, but mechanistic details remain poorly understood. While investigating the regulation of P-Rex1 by PIP<sub>3</sub>, we discovered that Ins(1,3,4,5)P<sub>4</sub> (IP<sub>4</sub>) inhibits P-Rex1 activity and induces large decreases in backbone dynamics in diverse regions of the protein. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of the P-Rex1·IP<sub>4</sub> complex revealed a conformation wherein the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain occludes the active site of the Dbl homology (DH) domain. This configuration is stabilized by interactions between the first DEP domain (DEP1) and the DH domain and between the PH domain and a 4-helix bundle (4HB) subdomain that extends from the C-terminal domain of P-Rex1. Disruption of the DH–DEP1 interface in a DH/PH-DEP1 fragment enhanced activity and led to a more extended conformation in solution, whereas mutations that constrain the occluded conformation led to decreased GEF activity. Variants of full-length P-Rex1 in which the DH–DEP1 and PH–4HB interfaces were disturbed exhibited enhanced activity during chemokine-induced cell migration, confirming that the observed structure represents the autoinhibited state in living cells. Interactions with PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing liposomes led to disruption of these interfaces and increased dynamics protein-wide. Our results further suggest that inositol phosphates such as IP<sub>4</sub> help to inhibit basal P-Rex1 activity in neutrophils, similar to their inhibitory effects on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92168">Amphibian mast cells serve as barriers to chytrid fungus infections</a></h4>

              
                Global amphibian declines are compounded by deadly disease outbreaks caused by the chytrid fungus, <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (<i>Bd</i>). Much has been learned about the roles of amphibian skin-produced antimicrobial components and microbiomes in controlling <i>Bd</i>, yet almost nothing is known about the roles of skin-resident immune cells in anti-<i>Bd</i> defenses. Mammalian mast cells reside within and serve as key immune sentinels in barrier tissues like skin. Accordingly, we investigated the roles of <i>Xenopus laevis</i> frog mast cells during <i>Bd</i> infections. Our findings indicate that enrichment of <i>X. laevis</i> skin mast cells confers anti-<i>Bd</i> protection and ameliorates the inflammation-associated skin damage caused by <i>Bd</i> infection. This includes a significant reduction in infiltration of <i>Bd</i>-infected skin by neutrophils, promoting mucin content within cutaneous mucus glands, and preventing <i>Bd</i>-mediated changes to skin microbiomes. Mammalian mast cells are known for their production of the pleiotropic interleukin-4 (IL4) cytokine and our findings suggest that the <i>X. laevis</i> IL4 plays a key role in manifesting the effects seen following cutaneous mast cell enrichment. Together, this work underscores the importance of amphibian skin-resident immune cells in anti-<i>Bd</i> defenses and illuminates a novel avenue for investigating amphibian host–chytrid pathogen interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91540">A kidney-hypothalamus axis promotes compensatory glucose production in response to glycosuria</a></h4>

              
                The kidneys facilitate energy conservation through reabsorption of nutrients including glucose. Almost all the filtered blood glucose is reabsorbed by the kidneys. Loss of glucose in urine (glycosuria) is offset by an increase in endogenous glucose production to maintain normal energy supply in the body. How the body senses this glucose loss and consequently enhances glucose production is unclear. Using renal <i>Slc2a2</i> (also known as <i>Glut2</i>) knockout mice, we demonstrate that elevated glycosuria activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which in turn drives endogenous glucose production. This phenotype was attenuated by selective afferent renal denervation, indicating the involvement of the afferent nerves in promoting the compensatory increase in glucose production. In addition, through plasma proteomics analyses we observed that acute phase proteins - which are usually involved in the body’s defense mechanisms against a threat – were the top candidates which were either upregulated or downregulated in renal <i>Slc2a2</i> KO mice. Overall, afferent renal nerves contribute to promoting endogenous glucose production in response to elevated glycosuria and loss of glucose in urine is sensed as a biological threat in mice. These findings may be useful in improving the efficiency of drugs like SGLT2 inhibitors that are intended to treat hyperglycemia by enhancing glycosuria but are met with a compensatory increase in endogenous glucose production.

">Feature specific neuronal oscillations in cortical layers</a></h4>

              
                The particular role of cortical oscillations has been a long-debated topic that resulted in a variety of theoretical frameworks. Oscillatory activity in the [alpha] band has been associated with sensory processing, attention as well as other cognitive functions, while [gamma] band oscillations is thought to be related to stimulus feature processing. Current theoretical frameworks rely on the separation of the cortical architecture into layers. Recently, methodological advancements have allowed to test layer specific frameworks on the role of oscillations in cortical computations in healthy human participants. Using EEG fMRI, we have investigated for the first time both, stimulus feature specificity (line orientation) and the relationship between the laminar BOLD activity and [alpha] and {gamma} band oscillations. We find {gamma} oscillations to be positively correlated with feature specific signals in superficial layers as predicted by the literature, but we found a deep layer contribution as well. Furthermore we found a layer (and frequency) dissociation within the  band for general, feature unspecific, processes and a feature related process. The power of the -band correlated negatively with feature unspecific neural activity in all cortical layers. We further found that high frequency  oscillations were specifically related to stimulus feature specific BOLD signal in deep and superficial layers. More interestingly, we also observed a general modulation effect for negative BOLD signal deflections in line with the inhibitory role of  during visual attention in superficial layers. Those findings support the association of {gamma} band oscillations with visual feature processing and further point towards the involvement of multiple  oscillations in more general and feature related processes.

">Overwriting an instinct: visual cortex instructs learning to suppress fear responses</a></h4>

              
                Fast instinctive responses to environmental stimuli can be crucial for survival, but are not always optimal. Based on prior experience, animals can thus adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions. However, the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We show that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway involving the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning: instead, the learnt behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over fear responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses through a novel corticofugal pathway.

">A subset of brain regions within adult functional connectivity networks demonstrate high reliability across early development</a></h4>

              
                The human cerebral cortex contains groups of areas that support sensory, motor, cognitive, and affective functions, often categorized as functional networks. These areas show stronger internal and weaker external functional connectivity (FC) and exhibit similar FC profiles within rather than between networks. Previous studies have demonstrated the development of these networks from nascent forms present before birth to their mature, adult-like topography in childhood. However, analyses often still use definitions based on adult functional networks. We aim to assess how this might lead to the misidentification of functional networks and explore potential consequences and solutions. Our findings suggest that even though adult networks provide only a marginally better than-chance description of the infant FC organization, misidentification was largely driven by specific areas. By restricting functional networks to areas showing adult-like network clustering, we observed consistent within-network FC both within and across scans and throughout development. Additionally, these areas were spatially closer to locations with low variability in network identity among adults. Our analysis aids in understanding the potential consequences of using adult networks "as is" and provides guidance for future research on selecting and utilizing functional network models based on the research question and scenario.

">A distinct circuit for biasing visual perceptual decisions and modulating superior colliculus activity through the mouse posterior striatum</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia play a key role in visual perceptual decisions. Despite being the primary target in the basal ganglia for inputs from the visual cortex, the posterior striatum's (PS) involvement in visual perceptual behavior remains unknown in rodents. We reveal that the PS direct pathway is largely segregated from the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) direct pathway, the other major striatal target for visual cortex. We investigated the role of the PS in visual perceptual decisions by optogenetically stimulating striatal medium spiny neurons in the direct pathway (D1-MSNs) of mice performing a visual change-detection task. PS D1-MSN activation robustly biased visual decisions in a manner dependent on visual context, timing, and reward expectation. We examined the effects of PS and DMS direct pathway activation on neuronal activity in the superior colliculus (SC), a major output target of the basal ganglia. Activation of either direct pathway rapidly modulated SC neurons, but mostly targeted different SC neurons and had opposite effects. These results demonstrate that the PS in rodents provides an important route for controlling visual decisions, in parallel with the better known DMS, but with distinct anatomical and functional properties.

">Motor sequence learning-induced corticospinal plasticity is biased towards sensorimotor mu rhythm peak phases</a></h4>

              
                Motor cortical (M1) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) increases corticospinal output and improves motor learning when delivered during sensorimotor mu rhythm trough but not peak phases, suggesting that mechanisms supporting motor learning may be most active during mu trough phases. If so, learning-related corticospinal plasticity should be most evident during mu trough phases. Healthy adults were assigned to either a sequence or control group. Participants in the sequence group practiced the implicit serial reaction time task (SRTT), which contained an embedded, repeating 12-item sequence. Participants in the control group practiced a version of the SRTT that contained no sequence. We measured mu phase-independent and phase-dependent MEP amplitudes using EEG-informed single-pulse TMS before, immediately, and 30 minutes after the SRTT in both groups. All participants performed a retention test one hour after SRTT acquisition. In both groups, mu phase-independent MEP amplitudes increased following SRTT acquisition, but the pattern of mu phase-dependent MEP amplitude increases after SRTT acquisition differed between groups. MEP amplitude changes from baseline to 30 minutes after SRTT acquisition more strongly differed across phases in the control relative to the sequence group, with the control group showing smaller increases in peak- than trough-specific MEPs. Contrary to our original hypothesis, results revealed that sequence learning recruits peak- rather than trough-specific neurophysiological mechanisms. Overall, these findings suggest that mu peak phases may provide protected time windows for motor memory consolidation and demonstrate the presence of a mu phase-dependent motor learning mechanism in the human brain.

">Coding of egocentric distance in the macaque ventral intraparietal area</a></h4>

              
                The encoding of three-dimensional visual spatial information is of ultimate importance in everyday life, in particular for successful navigation toward targets or threat avoidance. Eye-movements challenge this spatial encoding: 2-3 times per second, they shift the image of the outside world across the retina. The macaque ventral intraparietal area (VIP) stands out from other areas of the dorsal "where" pathway of the primate visual cortical system: many neurons encode visual information irrespective of horizontal and vertical eye position. But does this gaze invariance of spatial encoding at the single neuron level also apply to egocentric distance? Here, concurrent with recordings from area VIP, monkeys fixated a central target at one of three distances (vergence), while a visual stimulus was shown at one of seven distances (disparity). Most neurons' activity was modulated independently by both disparity and eye vergence, demonstrating a different type of invariance than for visual directions. By using population activity, we were able to decode egocentric distance of a stimulus which demonstrates that egocentric distances are nonetheless represented within the neuronal population. Our results provide further strong evidence for a role of area VIP in 3D space encoding.

">Dynorphin modulates motivation through a pallido-amygdala cholinergic circuit</a></h4>

              
                The endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin and its receptor kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) have been implicated in divergent behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that dynorphin released from nucleus accumbens dynorphinergic neurons exerts powerful modulation over a ventral pallidum (VP) disinhibitory circuit, thereby controlling cholinergic transmission to the amygdala and motivational drive in mice. On one hand, dynorphin acts postsynaptically via KORs on local GABAergic neurons in the VP to promote disinhibition of cholinergic neurons, which release acetylcholine into the amygdala to invigorate reward-seeking behaviors. On the other hand, dynorphin also acts presynaptically via KORs on dynorphinergic terminals to limit its own release. Such autoinhibition keeps cholinergic neurons from prolonged activation and release of acetylcholine, and prevents perseverant reward seeking. Our study reveals how dynorphin exquisitely modulate motivation through cholinergic system, and provides an explanation for why these neuromodulators are involved in motivational disorders, including depression and addiction.

">Structural disconnections caused by white matter hyperintensities in post-stroke spatial neglect</a></h4>

              
                White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a common feature of cerebral small vessel disease, affect a wide range of cognitive dysfunctions, including spatial neglect. The latter is a disorder of spatial attention and exploration typically after right hemisphere brain damage. To explore the impact of WMH on neglect-related structural disconnections, the present study investigated the indirectly quantified structural disconnectome induced by either stroke lesion alone, WMH alone, or their combination. Further, we compared different measures of structural disconnections - voxel-wise, pairwise, tract-wise, and parcel-wise - to identify neural correlates and predict acute neglect severity. We observed that WMH-derived disconnections alone were not associated to neglect behavior. However, when combined with disconnections derived from individual stroke lesions, pre-stroke WMH contributed to post-stroke neglect severity by affecting right frontal and subcortical substrates, like the middle frontal gyrus, basal ganglia, thalamus, and the fronto-pontine tract. Predictive modeling demonstrated that voxel-wise disconnection data outperformed other measures of structural disconnection, explaining 42% of the total variance. Compared to using stroke lesion anatomy, prediction performance can be improved by either estimating stroke-based structural disconnections or delineating the combined anatomy of stroke lesion and WMH. We conclude that pre-stroke alterations in the white matter microstructure due to WMH contribute to post-stroke deficits in spatial attention, likely by impairing the integrity of human attention networks.

                This study introduces a revised version of the computational auditory signal processing and perception (CASP) model (Jepsen et al., 2008), which has undergone substantial updates and refinements aimed at enhancing its accuracy and usability across various applications. A primary motivation for the revision was the integration of a more realistic non-linear inner hair cell (IHC) model to address the limitations of its more simplistic predecessor. Demonstrating backwards compatibility, the revised model exhibited similar predictive power to previous CASP implementations across conditions of intensity discrimination, simultaneous and forward masking, and modulation detection, effectively accounting for data from normal-hearing listeners. Additionally, improved decision-making strategies and a streamlined model configuration further enhance the model's usability and accessibility. Overall, the revised CASP offers a more accurate and intuitive framework for simulating auditory processing and perception across diverse conditions and tasks. The revised model may be a useful tool in studying the influence of the ear's nonlinear response properties on internal representations, particularly concerning the effects of sensorineural hearing loss on auditory perception.

">Contributions of genetic variation in astrocytes to cell and molecular mechanisms of risk and resilience to late onset Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Reactive astrocytes are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and several AD genetic risk variants are associated with genes highly expressed in astrocytes. However, the contribution of genetic risk within astrocytes to cellular processes relevant to the pathogenesis of AD remains ill-defined. Here we present a resource for studying AD genetic risk in astrocytes using a large collection of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from deeply phenotyped individuals with a range of neuropathological and cognitive outcomes. IPSC lines from forty-four individuals were differentiated into astrocytes followed by unbiased molecular profiling using RNA sequencing and tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the utility of this resource in examining gene- and pathway-level associations with clinical and neuropathological traits, as well as in analyzing genetic risk and resilience factors through parallel analyses of iPSC-astrocytes and brain tissue from the same individuals. Our analyses reveal that genes and pathways altered in iPSC-derived astrocytes from AD individuals are concordantly dysregulated in AD brain tissue. This includes increased prefoldin proteins, extracellular matrix factors, COPI-mediated trafficking components and reduced proteins involved in cellular respiration and fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, iPSC-derived astrocytes from individuals resilient to high AD neuropathology show elevated basal levels of interferon response proteins and increased secretion of interferon gamma. Correspondingly, higher polygenic risk scores for AD are associated with lower levels of interferon response proteins. This study establishes an experimental system that integrates genetic information with a heterogeneous set of iPSCs to identify genetic contributions to molecular pathways affecting AD risk and resilience.

                The salience assignment is pivotal for both natural and artificial intelligence. Pioneering studies established that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons process behaviorally relevant salient information. However, the neural circuit mechanism underlying salience assignment remains poorly understood. Here we show that the acetylcholine (ACh) level in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) dynamically represented behavioral salience. Distinct neuronal subpopulations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), D1- and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs), antagonistically and specifically promote and suppress ACh release in the BLA, but not the cortex and hippocampus. These striatal D1 and D2 MSNs regulate BLA ACh by disinhibiting and inhibiting cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain subregion substantia innominata (SI), respectively. Optogenetic manipulations of the pathway from striatal D1 and D2 MSNs to the SI opposingly affect associative learning. Our findings uncover an unconventional role of striatal MSNs in salience assignment via regulating the salience-representing amygdalar ACh activity.

">Cholecystokinin modulates age-dependent Thalamocortical Neuroplasticity</a></h4>

              
                The thalamocortical pathway exhibits neuroplasticity not only during the critical period but also in adulthood. Here, we aimed to investigate the modulation of age-dependent thalamocortical plasticity by cholecystokinin (CCK). Our findings revealed the expression of CCK in thalamocortical neurons, and high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the thalamocortical pathway elicited the release of CCK in auditory cortex (ACx), as evidenced by CCK sensor. HFS of the medial geniculate body (MGB) induced thalamocortical long-term potentiation (LTP) in wildtype young adult mice. However, knockdown of Cck expression in MGB neurons or blockade of the CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) in ACx effectively abolished HFS-induced LTP. Notably, this LTP could not be elicited in both juvenile mice (week 3) and mice over 18 months old, due to the absence of CCKBR in juvenile mice and the inability of CCK to be released in aged mice. Remarkably, the administration of exogenous CCK into the auditory cortex of the aged mice restored this LTP, accompanied by a significant improvement in frequency discrimination. These findings suggest the potential of CCK as a therapeutic intervention for addressing neurodegenerative deficits associated with thalamocortical neuroplasticity.

">Enhanced and idiosyncratic neural representations of personally typical scenes</a></h4>

              
                Previous research shows that the typicality of visual scenes (i.e., if they are good examples of a category) determines how easily they can be perceived and represented in the brain. However, the unique visual diets individuals are exposed to across their lifetimes should sculpt very personal notions of typicality. Here, we thus investigated whether scenes that are more typical to individual observers are more accurately perceived and represented in the brain. We used drawings to enable participants to describe typical scenes (e.g., a kitchen) and converted these drawings into 3D renders. These renders were used as stimuli in a scene categorization task, during which we recorded EEG. In line with previous findings, categorization was most accurate for renders resembling the typical scene drawings of individual participants. Our EEG analyses reveal two critical insights on how these individual differences emerge on the neural level: First, personally typical scenes yielded enhanced neural representations from around 200 ms after onset. Second, personally typical scenes were represented in idiosyncratic ways, with reduced dependence on high-level visual features. We interpret these findings in a predictive processing framework, where individual differences in internal models of scene categories formed through experience shape visual analysis in idiosyncratic ways.

">Brain-responsive music enables non-invasive, targeted and unobtrusive neurostimulation</a></h4>

              
                Objective: We are developing a new closed-loop brain stimulation method by embedding, within music, auditory elements that respond to the listeners brain activity. Here we show that this brain-responsive music has systematic and targeted effects on neural oscillations implicated in a variety of neurological and mental health disorders. Approach: We recorded magnetoencephalogram (MEG) or electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from participants as they listened to music synthesized by commercial audio software. Brain signals were bandpass filtered, phase-shifted and used to control the timbre and/or timing of notes within the music. Main results: Listening to brain-responsive music induced peaks and troughs in spectral power at frequencies that depended systematically on the phase-shift applied to the brain signal. Phase-dependent modulation was greatest at the centre frequency of the filter. As a result, by calibrating these parameters we could achieve selective enhancement or suppression of either theta (5 Hz) or alpha (10 Hz) oscillations. Moreover, by chosing different sensor locations we could target power modulation to either frontal or temporal cortex. The phase-dependent power modulation observed with brain-responsive music was significantly attenuated when participants listened to identical music as a conventional, open-loop stimulus. Finally, we demonstrate that brain activity could be modulated by more complex compositions combining a variety of brain-responsive musical elements controlled by a wireless, wearable EEG headband suitable for home use. Significance: Brain-responsive music provides an unobtrusive and targeted method of modulating neural oscillations in the listeners brain, and may enable both creative and therapeutic applications of Brain Computer Interface technologies.

">How different immersive environments affect intracortical brain computer interfaces</a></h4>

              
                As brain-computer interface (BCI) research advances, many new applications are being developed. Tasks can be performed in different environments, and whether a BCI user can switch environments seamlessly will influence the ultimate utility of a clinical device. Here we investigate the importance of the immersiveness of the virtual environment used to train BCI decoders on the resulting decoder and its generalizability between environments. Two participants who had intracortical electrodes implanted in their precentral gyrus used a BCI to control a virtual arm, either viewed immersively through virtual reality goggles or at a distance on a flat television monitor. Each participant performed better with a decoder trained and tested in the environment they had used the most prior to the study, one for each environment type. The neural tuning to the desired movement was minimally influenced by the immersiveness of the environment. Finally, in further testing with one of the participants, we found that decoders trained in one environment generalized well to the other environment, but the order in which the environments were experienced within a session mattered. Overall, experience with an environment was more influential on performance than the immersiveness of the environment, but BCI performance generalized well after accounting for experience.

">Visual Congruency Modulates Music Reward through Sensorimotor Integration</a></h4>

              
                There is emerging evidence that a performer's body movements may enhance the music-induced pleasure of audiences. However, the neural mechanism underlying such modulation remains largely unexplored. This study utilized psychophysiological and electroencephalographic data collected from listeners as they watched and listened to manipulated vocal (Mandarin lyrics) and violin performances of Japanese and Chinese pop music. All participants were unfamiliar with the violin or Mandarin. The auditory and visual elements of the stimuli were either congruent (original recording) or incongruent (drawn from unrelated music videos). We found that congruent visual movements, as opposed to incongruent ones, increased both subjective pleasure ratings and skin conductance responses but only during vocal performances. Then, we examined the coherence between the music signal and sensorimotor Mu-band oscillatory neural activity and found that congruent visual movements enhanced Mu entrainment exclusively to vocal music signal. Further, mediation analysis demonstrated that neural entrainment to vocal music significantly mediated the visual modulation of music-induced pleasure. In conclusion, our study provides novel evidence on how congruent visual movements can heighten music-induced pleasure through enhanced sensorimotor integration.

">Unsupervised learning as a computational principle works in visual learning of natural scenes, but not of artificial stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The question of whether we learn exposed visual features remains a subject of controversy. A prevalent computational model suggests that visual features frequently exposed to observers in natural environments are likely to be learned. However, this unsupervised learning model appears to be contradicted by the significant body of experimental results with human participants that indicates visual perceptual learning (VPL) of visible task-irrelevant features does not occur with frequent exposure. Here, we demonstrate a resolution to this controversy with a new finding: Exposure to a dominant global orientation as task-irrelevant leads to VPL of the orientation, particularly when the orientation is derived from natural scene images, whereas VPL did not occur with artificial images even with matched distributions of local orientations and spatial frequencies to natural scene images. Further investigation revealed that this disparity arises from the presence of higher-order statistics derived from natural scene images: global structures such as correlations between different local orientation and spatial frequency channels. Moreover, behavioral and neuroimaging results indicate that the dominant orientation from these higher-order statistics undergoes less attentional suppression than that from artificial images, which may facilitate VPL. Our results contribute to resolving the controversy by affirming the validity of unsupervised learning models for natural scenes but not for artificial stimuli. They challenge the assumption that VPL occurring in everyday life can be predicted by laws governing VPL for conventionally used artificial stimuli.

">Capillary connections between sensory circumventricular organs and adjacent parenchyma enable local volume transmission</a></h4>

              
                Among contributors to diffusible signaling are portal systems which join two capillary beds through connecting veins (Dorland 2020). Portal systems allow diffusible signals to be transported in high concentrations directly from one capillary bed to the other without dilution in the systemic circulation. Two portal systems have been identified in the brain. The first was discovered almost a century ago and connects the median eminence to the anterior pituitary gland (Popa & Fielding 1930). The second was discovered a few years ago, and links the suprachiasmatic nucleus to the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, a sensory circumventricular organ (CVO) (Yao et al. 2021). Sensory CVOs bear neuronal receptors for sensing signals in the fluid milieu (McKinley et al. 2003). They line the surface of brain ventricles and bear fenestrated capillaries, thereby lacking blood brain barriers. It is not known whether the other sensory CVOs, namely the subfornical organ (SFO), and area postrema (AP) form portal neurovascular connections with nearby parenchymal tissue. This has been difficult to establish as the structures lie at the midline and protrude into the ventricular space. To preserve the integrity of the vasculature of CVOs and their adjacent neuropil, we combined iDISCO clearing and light-sheet microscopy to acquire volumetric images of blood vessels. The results indicate that there is a portal pathway linking the capillary vessels of the SFO and the posterior septal nuclei, namely the septofimbrial nucleus and the triangular nucleus of the septum. Unlike the latter arrangement, the AP and the nucleus of the solitary tract share their capillary beds. Taken together, the results reveal that all three sensory circumventricular organs bear specialized capillary connections to adjacent neuropil, providing a direct route for diffusible signals to travel from their source to their targets.

">Muscarinic receptor activation preferentially inhibits rebound in vulnerable dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic subpopulations of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) differentially degenerate in Parkinson's disease and are characterized by unique electrophysiological properties. The vulnerable population expresses a T-type calcium channel-mediated afterdepolarization (ADP) and shows rebound activity upon release from inhibition, whereas the resilient population does not have an ADP and is slower to fire after hyperpolarization. This rebound activity can trigger dopamine release in the striatum, an important component of basal ganglia function. Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology on ex vivo slices from adult mice of both sexes, we find that muscarinic activation with the non-selective muscarinic agonist Oxotremorine inhibits rebound activity more strongly in vulnerable vs resilient SNc neurons. Here, we show that this effect depends on the direct activation of muscarinic receptors on the SNc dopaminergic neurons. Through a series of pharmacological and transgenic knock-out experiments, we tested whether the muscarinic inhibition of rebound was mediated through the canonical rebound-related ion channels: T-type calcium channels, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (HCN), and A-type potassium channels. We find that muscarinic receptor activation inhibits HCN-mediated current (Ih) in vulnerable SNc neurons, but that Ih activity is not necessary for the muscarinic inhibition of rebound activity. Similarly, we find that Oxotremorine inhibits rebound activity independently of T-type calcium channels and A-type potassium channels. Together these findings reveal new principles governing acetylcholine and dopamine interactions, showing that muscarinic receptors directly affect SNc rebound activity in the midbrain at the somatodendritic level and differentially modify information processing in distinct SNc subpopulations.

">It's the Sound not the Pulse: Peripheral Magnetic Stimulation Reduces Central Sensitization through Auditory Modulatory Effects</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) is a non-pharmacological, non-invasive analgesic modality with limited side effects. However, there is a paucity of controlled studies demonstrating its efficacy compared to existing pain management tools. Here, in an initial sample of 100 healthy participants (age 18-40), we compared the analgesic efficacy of two rPMS stimulation protocols--continuous theta burst stimulation (ctbPMS) and intermittent TBS (itbPMS)--against transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), a peripheral stimulation technique that is commonly used for pain management. We also included a sham rPMS protocol where participants heard the sound of rPMS stimulation while the coil was placed over their arm, but received no peripheral stimulation. We hypothesized that itbPMS and ctbPMS--but not sham--would reduce pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and secondary hyperalgesia evoked by a phasic heat pain (PHP) paradigm on the volar forearm with similar efficacy to TENS. Neither rPMS nor TENS reduced reported pain intensity or unpleasantness (p>0.25). However, ctbPMS and itbPMS significantly reduced the area of secondary hyperalgesia, whereas TENS did not (F3,96= 4.828, p= 0.004). Unexpectedly, sham rPMS, which involved auditory but no peripheral nerve stimulation, also significantly reduced secondary hyperalgesia compared to TENS. We performed a second study (n=32) to investigate auditory contributions to rPMS analgesia. Masking the rPMS stimulation sound with pink noise eliminated its analgesic effect on secondary hyperalgesia (p=0.5). This is the first study to show that the analgesic properties of rPMS in acute experimental pain may be largely attributed to its auditory component rather than peripheral nerve stimulation.

">Dynamic network features of functional and structural brain networks support visual working memory in aging adults</a></h4>

              
                In this work, we investigated the relationship between structural connectivity and the dynamics of functional connectivity and how this relationship changes with age to benefit cognitive functions. Visual working memory (VWM) is an important brain function that allows us to maintain a mental representation of the world around us, but its capacity and precision peaks by around 20 years old and decreases steadily throughout the rest of our lives. This research examined the functional brain network dynamics associated with VWM throughout the lifespan and found that Default Mode Network and Fronto-Parietal Network states were more well represented in individuals with better VWM. Furthermore, transitions between the Visual/Somatomotor Network state and the Attention Network state were more well-represented in older adults, and a network control theory simulation demonstrated that structural connectivity differences supporting this transition were associated with better VWM, especially in middle-aged individuals. The structural connectivity of regions from all states was important for supporting this transition in younger adults, while regions within the Visual/Somatomotor and Attention Network states were more important in older adults. These findings demonstrate that structural connectivity supports flexible, functional dynamics that allow for better VWM with age and may lead to important interventions to uphold healthy VWM throughout the lifespan.

                The mu-opioid receptor (MOP) is crucial for both the therapeutic and addictive effects of opioids. Using a multimodal experimental approach, here we combined awake functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging with behavioral and molecular assessments, to examine opioid-induced changes in brain activation and functional connectivity (FC). Morphine, fentanyl, and methadone induce significant dose- and time-dependent reorganization of brain perfusion, oscillations and FC in awake mice. Notably, opioids induce a transient, region-specific hyperperfusion, followed by a consistent MOP-specific dysconnectivity marked by decreased FC of the somatosensory cortex to hippocampal and thalamic regions, alongside increased subcortical and intra-cortical FC. These FC changes temporally correlate with generalized brain MOP activation and analgesia, but not with hypermobility and respiratory depression, suggesting a reorganization of inter-regional FC as a key opioid effect.

                Spreading depolarizations (SDs) have been identified in various brain pathologies. SDs increase the cerebral energy demand and, concomitantly, oxygen consumption, which indicates enhanced synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, SDs are considered particularly detrimental during reduced supply of oxygen and glucose. However, measurements of intracellular neuronal ATP ([ATP]i), ultimately reporting the balance of ATP synthesis and consumption during SDs, have not yet been conducted. In this study, we investigated neuronal ATP homeostasis during SDs using 2-photon imaging in acute brain slices from adult mice, expressing the ATP sensor ATeam1.03YEMK in neurons. SDs were induced by application of potassium chloride or by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and were detected by recording the local field potential, extracellular potassium, as well as the intrinsic optical signal. We found that, in the presence of oxygen and glucose, SDs were accompanied by a substantial but transient drop in neuronal [ATP]i. OGD, which prior to SD was accompanied by a slight reduction in [ATP]i only, led to an even larger, terminal drop in [ATP]i during SDs. Subsequently, we investigated whether neurons could still regenerate ATP if oxygen and glucose were promptly resupplied following SD detection. The data show that ATP depletion was essentially reversible in most cells. Our findings indicate that SDs are accompanied by a substantial increase in ATP consumption beyond production. This, under conditions that mimic reduced blood supply, leads to a breakdown of [ATP]i. Therefore, our findings support therapeutic strategies targeting SDs after cerebral ischemia.

">CIB2 function is distinct from Whirlin in the development of cochlear stereocilia staircase pattern</a></h4>

              
                Variations in genes coding for calcium and integrin binding protein 2 (CIB2) and whirlin cause deafness both in humans and mice. We previously reported that CIB2 binds to whirlin, and is essential for normal staircase architecture of auditory hair cells stereocilia. Here, we refine the interacting domains between these proteins and provide evidence that both proteins have distinct role in the development and organization of stereocilia bundles required for auditory transduction. Using a series of CIB2 and whirlin deletion constructs and nanoscale pulldown (NanoSPD) assays, we localized the regions of CIB2 that are critical for interaction with whirlin. AlphaFold 2 multimer, independently identified the same interacting regions between CIB2 and whirlin proteins, providing a detailed structural model of the interaction between the CIB2 EF2 domain and whirlin HHD2 domain. Next, we investigated genetic interaction between murine Cib2 and Whrn using genetic approaches. Hearing in mice double heterozygous for functionally null alleles (Cib2KO/+;Whrnwi/+) was similar to age-matched wild type mice, indicating that partial deficiency for both Cib2 and Whrn does not impair hearing. Double homozygous mutant mice (Cib2KO/KO;Whrnwi/wi) had profound hearing loss and cochlear stereocilia exhibited a predominant phenotype seen in single Whrnwi/wi mutants. Furthermore, over-expression of Whrn in Cib2KO/KO mice did not rescue the stereocilia morphology. These data suggest that, CIB2 is multifunctional, with key independent functions in development and/or maintenance of stereocilia staircase pattern in auditory hair cells.

">Subjective salience ratings are a reliable proxy for physiological measures of arousal</a></h4>

              
                Pain is an inherently salient multidimensional experience that warns us of bodily threat and promotes escape behaviours. Stimuli of any sensory modalities can be salient depending on stimulus features and context. This poses a challenge in delineating pain-specific processes in the brain, rather than salience-driven activity. It is thus essential to salience match control (innocuous) stimuli and noxious stimuli, in order to remove salience effects, and identify pain-specific activity. Previous studies have salience-matched either through subjective salience ratings or the skin conductance response (SCR), the latter of which serves as a physiological measure of arousal. Though an objective measure that overcomes the nebulous construct of salience, SCR cannot be used to salience-match in real-time (i.e., during an experiment) and assumes an association between salience and physiological arousal elicited by painful and non-painful stimuli, but this has not been explicitly tested. To determine whether salience and physiological arousal are associated, sixteen healthy adults experienced 30 heat pain and 30 non-painful electric stimuli of varying intensities. Stimuli were subjectively matched for salience and physiologically matched for arousal using SCR. A linear mixed model found no differences in SCR between salience-matched heat and electric stimuli. A mediation analysis showed that salience fully mediated the relationship between stimulus intensity and SCR (proportion mediated=84%). In conclusion, salience and physiological arousal are associated, and subjective salience ratings are a suitable for salience-matching pain with non-painful stimuli. Future work can thus use subjective salience ratings to delineate pain-specific processes.

">Effects of unconscious tactile stimuli on autonomic nervous activity and afferent signal processing</a></h4>

              
                Autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a mechanism that regulates our internal environment. In recent years, the interest in how tactile stimuli presented directly to the body affect ANS function and cortical processing in humans has been renewed. However, it is not yet clear how subtle tactile stimuli below the level of consciousness affect human heart rate and cortical processing. To examine this, subthreshold electrical stimuli were presented to the left forearm of 43 participants during an image-viewing task, and electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected. The changes in the R-wave interval of the ECG immediately after the subthreshold electrical presentation and heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), the afferent signal processing of cardiac activity, were measured. The results showed that heart rate decelerated immediately after the presentation of subthreshold electrical stimuli. The HEP during stimulus presentation was amplified for participants with greater heart rate acceleration immediately after this deceleration. The magnitude of these effects depended on the type of the subthreshold tactile stimuli. The results suggest that even with subthreshold stimulation, the changes in autonomic activity associated with orienting response and related afferent signal processing differ depending on the clarity of the tactile stimuli.

">Event-marked Windowed Communication: Inferring activity propagation from neural time series</a></h4>

              
                Tracking signal propagation in nervous systems is crucial to our understanding of brain function and information processing. Current methods for inferring neural communication track patterns of sustained co-activation over time, making them unsuitable to detect discrete instances of signal transmission. Here, we propose Event-marked Windowed Communication (EWC), a new analytical framework to infer functional interactions arising from discrete signalling events between neural elements, in otherwise continuous time series data. In contrast to conventional measures of functional connectivity, our method utilises an event-based subsampling of neural time series, which allows it to capture the statistical analogue of activity propagation. We test EWC on simulations of neural dynamics and show that it is capable of retrieving ground truth motifs of directional signalling, over a range of model configurations. Critically, we demonstrate that EWC's subsampling approach affords profound reductions in computation times, compared to established network inference methods such as transfer entropy. Lastly, we showcase the utility of EWC to infer whole-brain functional networks from MEG recordings. Networks computed using EWC and transfer entropy were highly correlated (median r=0.821 across subjects), but EWC inference was approximately 6.5 times faster per epoch. In summary, our work presents a new method to infer signalling from time series of neural activity at low computational costs. Our framework is flexible and can be applied to activity time series captured by diverse functional neuroimaging modalities, opening up new avenues for the study of neural communication.

">Sleep homeostasis in lizards and the role of cortex</a></h4>

              
                Although their phenotypes are diverse, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) are the two primary components of electrophysiological sleep (e-sleep) in mammals and birds. Slow waves in the cortex not only characterize SWS but are also used as biological markers for sleep homeostasis, given their rebound after sleep deprivation (SD). Recently, it has been reported that the Australian dragon Pogona vitticeps exhibits two-stage sleep pattern in the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), which includes a homologue of the mammalian claustrum (CLA). It remains unclear whether reptilian e-sleep, which has been characterized by activity outside the cortex, compensates for sleep loss, as observed in mammals. We here report a significant rebound in the local field potential (LFP) after 7 hours of SD, during both SWS and REMS. Meanwhile, the cycle and mean bout length of SWS/REMS remained unaffected. We further investigated a possible role of the cortex in e-sleep regulation and homeostasis in Pogona and found that, although a corticotomy had no obvious effect on the LFP features investigated, it abolished LFP power rebound in the CLA/DVR after SD. These findings suggest that e-sleep homeostasis is a common feature in amniotes, and that cortex is involved in regulating activity rebounds in reptiles and mammals.

">Cortical Acetylcholine Response to Deep Brain Stimulation of the Basal Forebrain</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS), the direct electrical stimulation of neuronal tissue in the basal forebrain to enhance release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, is under consideration as a method to improve executive function in patients with dementia. While some small studies indicate a positive response in the clinical setting, the relationship between DBS and acetylcholine pharmacokinetics is incompletely understood. Objective: We examined the cortical acetylcholine response to different stimulation parameters of the basal forebrain. Methods: 2-photon imaging was combined with deep brain stimulation. Stimulating electrodes were implanted in the subpallidal basal forebrain, and the ipsilateral somatosensory cortex was imaged. Acetylcholine activity was determined using the GRABACh-3.0 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor sensor, and blood vessels were imaged with Texas red. Results: Experiments manipulating pulse train frequency demonstrated that integrated acetylcholine induced fluorescence was insensitive to frequency, and that peak levels were achieved with frequencies from 60 to 130 Hz. Altering pulse train length indicated that longer stimulation resulted in higher peaks and more activation with sublinear summation. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil increased the peak response to 10s of stimulation at 60Hz, and the integrated response increased 57% with the 2 mg/kg dose, and 126% with the 4 mg/kg dose. Acetylcholine levels returned to baseline with a time constant of 14 to 18 seconds in all experiments. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that acetylcholine receptor activation is insensitive to frequency between 60 and 130 Hz. High peak responses are achieved with up to 900 pulses. Donepezil increases total acetylcholine receptor activation associated with DBS but did not change temporal kinetics. The long time constants observed in the cerebral cortex add to the evidence supporting volume in addition to synaptic transmission.

">Senescent cell clearance ameliorates temporal lobe epilepsy and associated spatial memory deficits in mice</a></h4>

              
                Current therapies for the epilepsies only treat the symptoms, but do not prevent epileptogenesis (the process in which epilepsy develops). Many cellular responses during epileptogenesis are also common hallmarks of cellular senescence, which halts proliferation of damaged cells. Clearing senescent cells (SCs) restores function in several age-associated and neurodegenerative disease models. It is unknown whether SC accumulation contributes to epileptogenesis and associated cognitive impairments. To address this question, we used a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and characterized the senescence phenotype throughout epileptogenesis. SCs accumulated 2 weeks after SE and were predominantly microglia. We ablated SCs and reduced (and in some cases prevented) the emergence of spontaneous seizures and normalized cognitive function in mice. Suggesting that this is a translationally-relevant target we also found SC accumulation in resected hippocampi from patients with TLE. These findings indicate that SC ablation after an epileptogenic insult is a potential anti-epileptogenic therapy.

	<p>Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), occurring after blood supply restoration, contributes significantly to stroke-related deaths. This study explored the combined impact and mechanisms of astragaloside IV (AS-IV), hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), and their combination in mitigating IRI. Male Sprague&amp;amp;ndash;Dawley (SD) rats were randomized to the Sham, MCAO, MCAO+AS-IV, MCAO+HSYA, and MCAO+AS-IV+HSYA groups. Neurological deficits and cerebral infarction were examined after restoring the blood supply to the brain. Pathomorphological changes in the cerebral cortex were observed via HE staining. IL-1&amp;amp;beta; and IL-18 were quantified using ELISA. The expression of NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B and GSDMD in the ischemic cerebrum was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of NLRP3, ASC, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, Caspase-1, and GSDMD in the ischemic cerebrum were evaluated using Western blot. The MCAO+AS-IV, MCAO+HSYA, and MCAO+AS-IV+HSYA groups exhibited notably better neurological function and cerebral infarction compared with the MCAO group. The combined treatment demonstrated superior brain tissue injury alleviation. Reductions in NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, GSDMD positive cells, and NLRP3/ASC/IL-1&amp;amp;beta;/Caspase-1/GSDMD protein expression in the ischemic brain were significantly more pronounced with the combined therapy, indicating a synergistic effect in countering cerebral IRI via the NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B/NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway inhibition of cell pyroptosis-induced injury.</p>

	<p>This study analyzed China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study data to explore the HbA1c&amp;amp;ndash;depression link, including depressive trajectories, while considering the mitigating impact of healthy lifestyles. Cross-lagged panel models and group-based trajectory modeling were performed to investigate the temporal relationship between HbA1c levels and depressive symptoms, as well as the depressive trajectories. Structural equation models were used to assess the mediating effects of healthy lifestyles. The mean age of the participants was 57.66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.04 years, with 53.68% being female. Analyzing 8826 participants across three waves, we observed a significant prediction of subsequent depressive symptoms by the preceding HbA1c levels (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.296; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Four distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms were distinguished: stable low, stable moderate, increasing, and stable high. Elevated HbA1c levels were associated with a higher risk of developing stable high (OR 1.12 and 95% CI 1.02&amp;amp;ndash;1.23), increasing (OR 1.21 and 95% CI 1.11&amp;amp;ndash;1.32), and stable moderate depressive symptoms (OR 1.07 and 95% CI 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;1.13). Engaging in two healthy life behaviors reduced stable high and increasing depressive pattern risks by 32% and 30%, respectively. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle lessened 7.2% of the impact of high HbA1c levels on the subsequent depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating adequate sleep and light physical activities, which might reduce the adverse impact of elevated HbA1c levels on depressive symptoms.</p>

	<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was suggested as a potential target for intervention to mitigate brain injury. However, its neuro-protective effect in post-resuscitation care has not been proven. We investigated the time-course of changes in IL-6 and its association with other markers (systemic inflammation and myocardial and neuronal injury), according to the injury severity of the cardiac arrest. This retrospective study analyzed IL-6 and other markers at baseline and 24, 48, and 72 h after the return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was the association of IL-6 with injury severity as assessed using the revised Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome for Therapeutic Hypothermia scoring system (low, moderate, and high severity). Of 111 patients, 22 (19.8%), 61 (55.0%), and 28 (25.2%) had low-, moderate-, and high-severity scores, respectively. IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the low-severity group than in the moderate- and high-severity groups at baseline and at 24 h and 72 h (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005). While IL-6 was not independently associated with neuronal injury markers in the low-severity group, it was demonstrated to be associated with it in the moderate-severity (&amp;amp;beta; [95% CI] = 4.3 [0.1&amp;amp;ndash;8.6], R2 = 0.11) and high-severity (&amp;amp;beta; [95% CI] = 7.9 [3.4&amp;amp;ndash;12.5], R2 = 0.14) groups. IL-6 exhibits distinct patterns across severity and shows differential associations with systemic inflammation or neuronal injury.</p>

	<p>This study explores the potential of using a Siamese Network as a biomarker for assessing the effectiveness of Dolphin-Assisted Therapy (DAT) in children with Spastic Cerebral Palsy (SCP). The problem statement revolves around the need for objective measures to evaluate the impact of DAT on patients with SCP, considering the subjective nature of traditional assessment methods. The methodology involves training a Siamese network, a type of neural network designed to compare similarities between inputs, using data collected from SCP patients undergoing DAT sessions. The study employed Event-Related Potential (ERP) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyses to examine cerebral activity and brain rhythms, proposing the use of SNN to compare electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of children with cerebral palsy before and after Dolphin-Assisted Therapy. Testing on samples from four children yielded a high average similarity index of 0.9150, indicating consistent similarity metrics before and after therapy. The network is trained to learn patterns and similarities between pre- and post-therapy evaluations, in order to identify biomarkers indicative of therapy effectiveness. Notably, the Siamese Network&amp;amp;rsquo;s architecture ensures that comparisons are made within the same feature space, allowing for more accurate assessments. The results of the study demonstrate promising findings, indicating different patterns in the output of the Siamese Network that correlate with improvements in symptoms of SCP post-DAT. Confirming these observations will require large, longitudinal studies but such findings would suggest that the Siamese Network could have utility as a biomarker in monitoring treatment responses for children with SCP who undergo DAT and offer them more objective as well as quantifiable manners of assessing therapeutic interventions. Great discrepancies in neuronal voltage perturbations, 7.9825 dB on average at the specific samples compared to the whole dataset (6.2838 dB), imply a noted deviation from resting activity. These findings indicate that Dolphin-Assisted Therapy activates particular brain regions specifically during the intervention.</p>

	<p>Reports suggest possible risks of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including heart failure, associated with non-ergot dopamine agonist (DA) use in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). The objectives of our review were to evaluate the risk of heart failure and other adverse cardiovascular reactions in PD patients who received a non-ergot DA compared with other anti-PD pharmacological interventions, placebo, or no intervention. Studies were identified via searches of six bibliographic databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS) were eligible for study inclusion. Random-effect meta-analyses were performed to estimate adverse cardiovascular reaction risks. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. In total, forty-four studies (thirty-six RCTs and eight NRS) satisfied our inclusion criteria. A single RCT found no significant difference in the risk of heart failure with ropinirole compared with bromocriptine (odds ratio (OR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 2.04; low certainty). Conversely, three case&amp;amp;ndash;control studies reported a risk of heart failure with non-ergot DA treatment. The quality of evidence for the risk of heart failure was judged as low or very low. Findings suggest that non-ergot DA use may be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including heart failure. Studies are needed to better understand cardiovascular risks associated with PD treatment.</p>

	<p>Identifying the patients who are likely to be non-responders to a certain treatment may allow clinicians to provide alternative strategies and avoid frustration and unrealistic expectations for the patients and their families. A retrospective study on 145 children treated with visual hemisphere-specific stimulation examined the specific profiles (reading, writing, metaphonology, memory, callosal functions) of non-responders, and identified predictors of response to intervention (reading, reading and writing) through linear regression models. The effects of additional variables such as rapid automatized naming (RAN) and Visual Search were investigated in a subsample of 48 participants. Subgroups related to gender and dyslexia subtype were considered in the analyses. The results highlight an Intervention Differential Effect (IDE) not depending on regression to the mean and mathematical coupling effects. The characteristics of non-responders for reading seem to correspond children with mild reading and severe writing impairments; non-responders for reading and writing are those with impaired callosal transfer. Predictors of overall response to intervention were pre-test reading and writing scores; phoneme blending, accuracy in visual search and speed in rapid automatized naming contributed to explaining response variance. Specific predictors for female vs. male participants and dyslexia subtypes were identified.</p>

	<p>Background: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness due to autoantibodies targeting neuromuscular junction proteins. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an immunosuppressive therapy, has shown potential for managing MG with fewer side effects compared to other treatments. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of MMF in MG patients in a real-life multicenter setting. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on generalized MG patients, refractory to azathioprine (AZA) and treated with MMF alone or with steroids, at three Italian centers from January 2011 to February 2024. Patients were assessed using the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) classification, MG composite score (MGCS), and MG activity of daily living (MGADL) scores at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Statistical analyses included the Spearman correlation, the Friedman test, and ANOVA. Results: Thirty-two patients were enrolled (13 males, mean age 66.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.5 years). Significant improvements in MGADL and MGCS scores were observed at 6 and 12 months (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), with continued improvement over 24 months. Side effects were reported in 12% of patients. MMF showed a faster onset of symptom control compared to azathioprine, with a significant improvement noted within 6 months. Conclusions: A recent study found that MMF and AZA were equally effective in improving patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life, but because AZA had more serious adverse events than MMF, lower doses of AZA were therefore recommended to reduce the adverse events while maintaining efficacy. Conversely, results showed that MMF is effective and well-tolerated in the long-term management of MG, providing faster symptom control and a favorable safety profile. Future prospective studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and explore sex differences in response to MMF treatment.</p>

	<p>Decision-making is a cognitive process involving working memory, executive function, and attention. However, the connectivity of large-scale brain networks during decision-making is not well understood. This is because gaining access to large-scale brain networks in humans is still a novel process. Here, we used SEEG (stereoelectroencephalography) to record neural activity from the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and frontoparietal network (FN) in ten humans while they performed a gambling task in the form of the card game, &amp;amp;ldquo;War&amp;amp;rdquo;. By observing these networks during a decision-making period, we related the activity of and connectivity between these networks. In particular, we found that gamma band activity was directly related to a participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to bet logically, deciding what betting amount would result in the highest monetary gain or lowest monetary loss throughout a session of the game. We also found connectivity between the DAN and the relation to a participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance. Specifically, participants with higher connectivity between and within these networks had higher earnings. Our preliminary findings suggest that connectivity and activity between these networks are essential during decision-making.</p>

	<p>Electrophysiological methods of research are widely used in neurobiology. To assess the bioelectrical activity of the brain in small laboratory animals, electrocorticography (ECoG) is most often used, which allows the recording of signals directly from the cerebral cortex. To date, a number of methodological approaches to the manufacture and implantation of ECoG electrodes have been proposed, the complexity of which is determined by experimental tasks and logistical capabilities. Existing methods for analyzing bioelectrical signals are used to assess the functional state of the nervous system in test animals, as well as to identify correlates of pathological changes or pharmacological effects. The review presents current areas of applications of ECoG in neuropharmacological studies in small laboratory animals. Traditionally, this method is actively used to study the antiepileptic activity of new molecules. However, the possibility of using ECoG to assess the neuroprotective activity of drugs in models of traumatic, vascular, metabolic, or neurodegenerative CNS damage remains clearly underestimated. Despite the fact that ECoG has a number of disadvantages and methodological difficulties, the recorded data can be a useful addition to traditional molecular and behavioral research methods. An analysis of the works in recent years indicates a growing interest in the method as a tool for assessing the pharmacological activity of psychoactive drugs, especially in combination with classification and prediction algorithms.</p>

                <p>As rapid responders to their environments, microglia engage in functions that are mirrored by their cellular morphology. Microglia are classically thought to exhibit a ramified morphology under homeostatic conditions which switches to an ameboid form during inflammatory conditions. However, microglia display a wide spectrum of morphologies outside of this dichotomy, including rod-like, ramified, ameboid, and hypertrophic states, which have been observed across brain regions, neurodevelopmental timepoints, and various pathological contexts. We applied dimensionality reduction and clustering to consider contributions of multiple morphology measures together to define a spectrum of microglial morphological states in a mouse dataset that we used to demonstrate the utility of our toolset. Using ImageJ, we first developed a semiautomated approach to characterize 27 morphology features from hundreds to thousands of individual microglial cells in a brain region-specific manner. Within this pool of features, we defined distinct sets of highly correlated features that describe different aspects of morphology, including branch length, branching complexity, territory span, and circularity. When considered together, these sets of features drove different morphological clusters. Our tools captured morphological states similarly and robustly when applied to independent datasets and using different immunofluorescent markers for microglia. We have compiled our morphology analysis pipeline into an accessible, easy-to-use, and fully open-source ImageJ macro and R package that the neuroscience community can expand upon and directly apply to their own analyses. Outcomes from this work will supply the field with new tools to systematically evaluate the heterogeneity of microglia morphological states across various experimental models and research questions.</p>

                <p>Brain activity implies the orchestrated functioning of interconnected brain regions. Typical in vitro models aim to mimic the brain using single human pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal networks. However, the field is constantly evolving to model brain functions more accurately through the use of new paradigms, e.g., brain-on-a-chip models with compartmentalized structures and integrated sensors. These methods create novel data requiring more complex analysis approaches. The previously introduced circular tripartite network concept models the connectivity between spatially diverse neuronal structures. The model consists of a microfluidic device allowing axonal connectivity between separated neuronal networks with an embedded microelectrode array to record both local and global electrophysiological activity patterns in the closed circuitry. The existing tools are suboptimal for the analysis of the data produced with this model. Here, we introduce advanced tools for synchronization and functional connectivity assessment. We used our custom-designed analysis to assess the interrelations between the kainic acid (KA)-exposed proximal compartment and its nonexposed distal neighbors before and after KA. Novel multilevel circuitry bursting patterns were detected and analyzed in parallel with the inter- and intracompartmental functional connectivity. The effect of KA on the proximal compartment was captured, and the spread of this effect to the nonexposed distal compartments was revealed. KA induced divergent changes in bursting behaviors, which may be explained by distinct baseline activity and varied intra- and intercompartmental connectivity strengths. The circular tripartite network concept combined with our developed analysis advances importantly both face and construct validity in modeling human epilepsy in vitro.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0112-24.2024?rss=1">Oscillatory Neural Correlates of Police Firearms Decision-Making in Virtual Reality</a></h4>

              
                <p>We investigated the neural signatures of expert decision-making in the context of police training in a virtual reality&ndash;based shoot/don&rsquo;t shoot scenario. Police officers can use stopping force against a perpetrator, which may require using a firearm and each decision made by an officer to discharge their firearm or not has substantial implications. Therefore, it is important to understand the cognitive and underlying neurophysiological processes that lead to such a decision. We used virtual reality&ndash;based simulations to elicit ecologically valid behavior from authorized firearms officers (AFOs) in the UK and matched novices in a shoot/don't shoot task and recorded electroencephalography concurrently. We found that AFOs had consistently faster response times than novices, suggesting our task was sensitive to their expertise. To investigate differences in decision-making processes under varying levels of threat and expertise, we analyzed electrophysiological signals originating from the anterior cingulate cortex. In line with similar response inhibition tasks, we found greater increases in preresponse theta power when participants inhibited the response to shoot when under no threat as compared with shooting. Most importantly, we showed that when preparing against threat, theta power increase was greater for experts than novices, suggesting that differences in performance between experts and novices are due to their greater orientation toward threat. Additionally, shorter beta rebounds suggest that experts were "ready for action" sooner. More generally, we demonstrate that the investigation of expert decision-making should incorporate naturalistic stimuli and an appropriate control group to enhance validity.</p>

                <p>Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neurons (MNs) offers an unprecedented approach to modeling movement disorders such as dystonia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, achieving survival poses a significant challenge when culturing induced MNs, especially when aiming to reach late maturation stages. Utilizing hiPSC-derived motor neurons and primary mouse astrocytes, we assembled two types of coculture systems: direct coculturing of neurons with astrocytes and indirect coculture using culture inserts that physically separate neurons and astrocytes. Both systems significantly enhance neuron survival. Compared with these two systems, no significant differences in neurodevelopment, maturation, and survival within 3&nbsp;weeks, allowing to prepare neurons at maturation stages. Using the indirect coculture system, we obtained highly pure MNs at the late mature stage from hiPSCs. Transcriptomic studies of hiPSC-derived MNs showed a typical neurodevelopmental switch in gene expression from the early immature stage to late maturation stages. Mature genes associated with neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis are highly enriched in MNs at late stages, demonstrating that these neurons achieve maturation. This study introduces a novel tool for the preparation of highly pure hiPSC-derived neurons, enabling the determination of neurological disease pathogenesis in neurons at late disease onset stages through biochemical approaches, which typically necessitate highly pure neurons. This advancement is particularly significant in modeling age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

                Background Scientific publishing is a critical part of scientific enquiry; individual excellence is often measured by the number of publications, and the journals in which these publications appeared count enormously. Open Science practices, such as open access, open review, random gatekeeping and shared governance, are implemented in various journals and publishing platforms, providing alternative ways of publishing. But how are these practices trusted? Methods We have created a theoretical framework for trust in the context of academic publishing and investigated to what extent Dutch researchers find these ways of publishing trustworthy. We have performed a survey to compare the trustworthiness of novel and classical ways of publishing and conducted multiple interviews to figure out why scientists find certain publishing practices more attractive than others. Results In the academic publishing system, we have identified various interdependent relationships between stakeholders in which there is a certain level of uncertainty; therefore, we can assume that trust plays a relevant role here. Based on the literature review and interview results, trustworthiness turned out to be one of the most important factors in choosing journals to read relevant scientific discoveries and to publish papers. The survey results suggest that some aspects of open publishing, such as open access, open peer review and shared governance are well-known and widely accepted and trusted amongst the participants, while others, like participatory peer review or random gatekeeping, were less known. In these cases, many researchers formulated concerns about the competence of the randomly assigned gatekeeper and the reviewers coming from the wider community. Conclusions Our results highlight a shift in social norms within the Dutch scientific community, formulating critical voices towards the profit-oriented nature of classical scientific publishing and highlighting the importance of open access to scientific results, supporting open peer review and publishers with shared governance.

                Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a widespread malignancy globally, yet effective therapeutic approaches for advanced, metastatic, and chemo-resistant cases remain limited. In this study, we knocked out CRC cell line HCT 116 for two autophagy genes (ATG5 and ATG7), then we conducted a transcriptomic analysis on those isogenic cell lines. which revealed an upregulation of Krϋppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) expression, that was biologically validated. Methods In this study, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing on HCT 116 followed with transcriptomics analysis on HCT 116 KO cells for ATG5 and ATG7. Various bioinformatics analyses were performed to investigate the KLF3/8 with autophagy and affected functional pathways, and immune genes related to the different types. Validation of expression in different cell lines were done using qPCR and Western blot. Results To further investigate the role of autophagy genes in CRC, we utilized publicly available data and web-based tools. Our analysis showed a marked correlation between KLF3/KLF8 and the expression of autophagy genes in CRC, denoting that its upregulation is likely to be a compensatory mechanism. We also examined the co-expression of autophagy genes and KLF3/KLF8 with multiple markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and significant positive correlations were observed. Moreover, KLF8 expression was upregulated at the mRNA level in the metastatic cell lines LoVo and SK-CO-1, compared to HCT 116. Interestingly, KLF3/KLF8 expression was high in MSS molecular subtype of CRC as shown in HCT 116 cell line knocked in with MLH gene as well as they were negatively correlated with crucial immune-infiltrating cells such as CD8+ cells, indicating their potential as a negative biomarker for response to immunotherapy. Conclusion Our study proposes that a synergistic approach involving the inhibition of KLF8 and autophagy holds a potential therapeutic target for effectively tackling metastatic CRC cells, especially in cases characterized by deficient mismatch repair (MMR).

                Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 2 (TGM2) is a Ca2+ dependent enzyme that catalyzes transglutaminase cross-linking modifications. TGM2 is involved in various diseases, either in a protective or contributory manner, making it a crucial protein to study and determine its therapeutic potential. Identifying high-performing TGM2 antibodies would facilitate these investigations. Here we have characterized seventeen TGM2 commercial antibodies for western blot and sixteen for immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. The implemented standardized experimental protocol is based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines against their isogenic parental controls. This study is part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Urban slums are hotspots of infectious diseases like COVID-19 as was seen in the waves of 2020 and 2021. One of the primary reasons why slums are disproportionately affected is their location in inaccessible and uninhabitable zones, crowded and poorly ventilated living spaces, unsanitary conditions and common facilities (water taps, common toilets, etc.). Staying at home during pandemics is hardly an option for slum dwellers as it often means giving up work and even basic necessities. Methodology This paper aims to understand the habitat vulnerabilities of slums in the two Indian megacities of Pune and Surat which were the worst hit during both waves. The study is done at the level of wards, which is the smallest administrative boundary, taking the habitat vulnerability (congestion and access to basic services). To identify the explanatory variables which increase the vulnerability of slums to infectious diseases, literature study is done on the triggering factors which affect habitat vulnerability derived from common characteristics and definitions of slum. Results The aim of the research is to categorize the slums into 3 levels of risk zones and map them subsequently. Conclusion This study will help in formulating a model to prioritize the allocation of sparse resources in developing countries to tackle the habitat vulnerabilities of the slum dwellers especially during health emergencies of contagious diseases like COVID-19.

Melanoma showcases a complex interplay of genetic alterations and intra- and inter-cellular morphological changes during metastatic transformation. While pivotal, the role of specific mutations in dictating these changes still needs to be fully elucidated. Telomerase promoter mutations (TERTp mutations) significantly influence melanoma’s progression, invasiveness, and resistance to various emerging treatments, including chemical inhibitors, telomerase inhibitors, targeted therapy, and immunotherapies. We aim to understand the morphological and phenotypic implications of the two dominant monoallelic TERTp mutations, C228T and C250T, enriched in melanoma metastasis. We developed isogenic clonal cell lines containing the TERTp mutations and utilized dual-color expression reporters steered by the endogenous Telomerase promoter, giving us allelic resolution. This approach allowed us to monitor morpholomic variations induced by these mutations. TERTp mutation-bearing cells exhibited significant morpholome differences from their wild-type counterparts, with increased allele expression patterns, augmented wound-healing rates, and unique spatiotemporal dynamics. Notably, the C250T mutation exerted more pronounced changes in the morpholome than C228T, suggesting a differential role in metastatic potential. Our findings underscore the distinct influence of TERTp mutations on melanoma’s cellular architecture and behavior. The C250T mutation may offer a unique morpholomic and systems-driven advantage for metastasis. These insights provide a foundational understanding of how a non-coding mutation in melanoma metastasis affects the system, manifesting in cellular morpholome.

                <p>by Riho Yamamoto, Hinata Miki, Ayaka Itani, Norio Takeshita</p>

The importance of fungi in ecological systems and pathogenicity hinges on their ability to search for nutrients, substrates, and hosts. Despite this, the question of whether fungal hyphae exhibit chemotropism toward them remains largely unresolved and requires close examination at the cellular level. Here, we designed a microfluidic device to assess hyphal chemotropism of <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> in response to carbon and nitrogen sources, as well as pH. Within this device, hyphae could determine their growth direction in a two-layer flow with distinct compositions that were adjacent but non-mixing. Under conditions with and without a carbon source, hyphae changed growth direction to remain in the presence of a carbon source, but it was still difficult to distinguish between differences in growth and chemotropism. Although nitrogen sources such as ammonia and nitrate are important for growth, the hyphae indicated negative chemotropism to avoid them depending on the specific transporters. This fungus grows equally well at the colony level in the pH range of 4 to 9, but the hyphae exhibited chemotropism to acidic pH. The proton pump PmaA is vital for the chemotropism to acid pH, while the master regulatory for pH adaptation PacC is not involved, suggesting that chemotropism and adaptive growth via gene expression regulation are distinct regulatory mechanisms. Despite various plasma membrane transporters are distributed across membranes except at the hyphal tip, the control of growth direction occurs at the tip. Finally, we explored the mechanisms linking these two phenomena, tip growth and chemotropism.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological condition that causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an irresistible urge to move them, typically during periods of rest. The genetic basis and pathophysiology of RLS are incompletely understood. We sought to identify additional novel genetic risk factors associated with RLS susceptibility.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide association meta-analysis of RLS cases (<i>n</i> = 9,851) and controls (<i>n</i> = 38,957) in 3 population-based biobanks (All of Us, Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, and CARTaGENE).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genome-wide association analysis identified 9 independent risk loci, of which 8 had been previously reported, and 1 was a novel risk locus (<i>LMX1B</i>, rs35196838, OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.09–1.19, <i>p</i> value = 2.2 × 10<sup>−9</sup>). Furthermore, a transcriptome-wide association study also identified <i>GLO1</i> and a previously unreported gene, <i>ELFN1</i>. A genetic correlation analysis revealed significant common variant overlaps between RLS and neuroticism (<i>r</i>
<sub>g</sub> = 0.40, se = 0.08, <i>p</i> value = 5.4 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), depression (<i>r</i>
<sub>g</sub> = 0.35, se = 0.06, <i>p</i> value = 2.17 × 10<sup>−8</sup>), and intelligence (<i>r</i>
<sub>g</sub> = −0.20, se = 0.06, <i>p</i> value = 4.0 × 10<sup>−4</sup>).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study expands the understanding of the genetic architecture of RLS, and highlights the contributions of common variants to this prevalent neurological disorder. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We aimed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD), and to understand the genotype/phenotype correlation of structural variants (SVs) in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Since the discovery of 3D genome architectures and topologically associating domains (TADs), new pathomechanisms have been postulated for SVs, regardless of gene dosage changes. ADLD is a rare genetic disease associated with duplications (classical ADLD) or noncoding deletions (atypical ADLD) in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>High-throughput chromosome conformation capture, RNA sequencing, histopathological analyses of postmortem brain tissues, and clinical and neuroradiological investigations were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We collected data from &gt;20 families worldwide carrying SVs in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus and reported strong clinical variability, even among patients carrying duplications of the entire <i>LMNB1</i> gene, ranging from classical and atypical ADLD to asymptomatic carriers. We showed that patients with classic ADLD always carried intra-TAD duplications, resulting in a simple gene dose gain. Atypical ADLD was caused by <i>LMNB1</i> forebrain-specific misexpression due to inter-TAD deletions or duplications. The inter-TAD duplication, which extends centromerically and crosses the 2 TAD boundaries, did not cause ADLD. Our results provide evidence that astrocytes are key players in ADLD pathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study sheds light on the 3D genome and TAD structural changes associated with SVs in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus, and shows that a duplication encompassing <i>LMNB1</i> is not sufficient per se to diagnose ADLD, thereby strongly affecting genetic counseling. Our study supports breaking TADs as an emerging pathogenic mechanism that should be considered when studying brain diseases. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<p>Carnosine prevents the sickness state and memory block induced by an immune challenge in the invertebrate model, <i>Lymnaea stagnalis</i>.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Carnosine is a naturally occurring endogenous dipeptide with well-recognized anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects at the central nervous system level. To date, very few studies have been focused on the ability of carnosine to rescue and/or enhance memory. Here, we used a well-known invertebrate model system, the pond snail <i>Lymnaea stagnalis</i>, and a well-studied associative learning procedure, operant conditioning of aerial respiration, to investigate the ability of carnosine to enhance long-term memory (LTM) formation and reverse memory obstruction caused by an immune challenge (i.e., lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection). Exposing snails to 1 mM carnosine for 1 h before training in addition to enhancing memory formation resulted in a significant upregulation of the expression levels of key neuroplasticity genes (i.e., glutamate ionotropic receptor <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate [NMDA]-type subunit 1—LymGRIN1, and the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein 1—LymCREB1) in snails' central ring ganglia. Moreover, pre-exposure to 1 mM carnosine before an LPS injection reversed the memory deficit brought about by inflammation, by preventing the upregulation of key targets for immune and stress response (i.e., Toll-like receptor 4—LymTLR4, molluscan defense molecule—LymMDM, heat shock protein 70—LymHSP70). Our data are thus consistent with the hypothesis that carnosine can have positive benefits on cognitive ability and be able to reverse memory aversive states induced by neuroinflammation.</p>

                Background Sustainable modular dwelling design for rural areas should focus on creating healthy and economically accessible spaces, sensitive to local needs and integrating environmental, functional, sociological and technological aspects. Flexibility is essential to reduce the initial investment and allow future transformations, optimizing the recovery and reuse of materials. These houses must be adaptable, safe and have basic services, satisfying the needs and stages of families’ development. In Ecuador, poverty and energy inefficiency worsen the quality of life in rural areas. This project in the Cebadas parish proposes modular dwelling that applies bioclimatic and sustainable criteria, using local materials to improve habitability and promote the social and economic development of the community. Method The research approach is qualitative-quantitative. Qualitative, since it is necessary to identify the qualities of the sector, bibliographic exploration of guidelines and sustainable strategies. Quantitative, to evaluate the degree of affectation through a diagnosis of the study site and to provide efficient solutions that respond to the context and social reality. Results The spaces presented in the proposal respond to the spatial need for growth and expansion of the users of the sector, through 6 basic guidelines that this type of dwelling should have: Environment, Visual, Form, Function, Bioclimatic and Materials. Conclusions The flexible modular dwelling project for rural environments addresses complex housing needs, highlighting the flexibility and adaptability of an expandable module. It includes income generation with a duplex apartment, fosters communal and cultural life with public and commercial spaces, promotes tourism and rural development with landscape design and crops. In addition, it ensures sustainability through bioclimatic strategies and responsible use of resources.

                Here, Rafnsdottir et al. demonstrate that under normothermia SMYD5 represses SP1 and other genes participating in the mild hypothermia response by H3K36me3 histone modification. Under mild hypothermia, SMYD5 is degraded via proteasomal degradation, and the repression caused by SMYD5 is lifted. SMYD5 also regulates 37 other genes in the same way.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92406">Divergent folding-mediated epistasis among unstable membrane protein variants</a></h4>

              
                Many membrane proteins are prone to misfolding, which compromises their functional expression at the plasma membrane. This is particularly true for the mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor GPCRs (GnRHR). We recently demonstrated that evolutionary GnRHR modifications appear to have coincided with adaptive changes in cotranslational folding efficiency. Though protein stability is known to shape evolution, it is unclear how cotranslational folding constraints modulate the synergistic, epistatic interactions between mutations. We therefore compared the pairwise interactions formed by mutations that disrupt the membrane topology (V276T) or tertiary structure (W107A) of GnRHR. Using deep mutational scanning, we evaluated how the plasma membrane expression of these variants is modified by hundreds of secondary mutations. An analysis of 251 mutants in three genetic backgrounds reveals that V276T and W107A form distinct epistatic interactions that depend on both the severity and the mechanism of destabilization. V276T forms predominantly negative epistatic interactions with destabilizing mutations in soluble loops. In contrast, W107A forms positive interactions with mutations in both loops and transmembrane domains that reflect the diminishing impacts of the destabilizing mutations in variants that are already unstable. These findings reveal how epistasis is remodeled by conformational defects in membrane proteins and in unstable proteins more generally.

                Fertilization occurs before the completion of oocyte meiosis in the majority of animal species and sperm contents move long distances within the zygotes of mouse and <i>C. elegans</i>. If incorporated into the meiotic spindle, paternal chromosomes could be expelled into a polar body resulting in lethal monosomy. Through live imaging of fertilization in <i>C. elegans</i>, we found that the microtubule disassembling enzymes, katanin and kinesin-13 limit long-range movement of sperm contents and that maternal ataxin-2 maintains paternal DNA and paternal mitochondria as a cohesive unit that moves together. Depletion of katanin or double depletion of kinesin-13 and ataxin-2 resulted in the capture of the sperm contents by the meiotic spindle. Thus limiting movement of sperm contents and maintaining cohesion of sperm contents within the zygote both contribute to preventing premature interaction between maternal and paternal genomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91890">Serotonergic amplification of odor-evoked neural responses maps onto flexible behavioral outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral responses to many odorants are not fixed but are flexible, varying based on organismal needs. How such variations arise and the role of various neuromodulators in achieving flexible neural-to-behavioral mapping is not fully understood. In this study, we examined how serotonin modulates the neural and behavioral responses to odorants in locusts (<i>Schistocerca americana</i>). Our results indicated that serotonin can increase or decrease appetitive behavior in an odor-specific manner. On the other hand, in the antennal lobe, serotonergic modulation enhanced odor-evoked response strength but left the temporal features or the combinatorial response profiles unperturbed. This result suggests that serotonin allows for sensitive and robust recognition of odorants. Nevertheless, the uniform neural response amplification appeared to be at odds with the observed stimulus-specific behavioral modulation. We show that a simple linear model with neural ensembles segregated based on behavioral relevance is sufficient to explain the serotonin-mediated flexible mapping between neural and behavioral responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88591">MotorNet, a Python toolbox for controlling differentiable biomechanical effectors with artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a powerful class of computational models for unravelling neural mechanisms of brain function. However, for neural control of movement, they currently must be integrated with software simulating biomechanical effectors, leading to limiting impracticalities: (1) researchers must rely on two different platforms and (2) biomechanical effectors are not generally differentiable, constraining researchers to reinforcement learning algorithms despite the existence and potential biological relevance of faster training methods. To address these limitations, we developed MotorNet, an open-source Python toolbox for creating arbitrarily complex, differentiable, and biomechanically realistic effectors that can be trained on user-defined motor tasks using ANNs. MotorNet is designed to meet several goals: ease of installation, ease of use, a high-level user-friendly application programming interface, and a modular architecture to allow for flexibility in model building. MotorNet requires no dependencies outside Python, making it easy to get started with. For instance, it allows training ANNs on typically used motor control models such as a two joint, six muscle, planar arm within minutes on a typical desktop computer. MotorNet is built on PyTorch and therefore can implement any network architecture that is possible using the PyTorch framework. Consequently, it will immediately benefit from advances in artificial intelligence through PyTorch updates. Finally, it is open source, enabling users to create and share their own improvements, such as new effector and network architectures or custom task designs. MotorNet’s focus on higher-order model and task design will alleviate overhead cost to initiate computational projects for new researchers by providing a standalone, ready-to-go framework, and speed up efforts of established computational teams by enabling a focus on concepts and ideas over implementation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91554">A robust method for measuring aminoacylation through tRNA-Seq</a></h4>

              
                Current methods to quantify the fraction of aminoacylated tRNAs, also known as the tRNA charge, are limited by issues with either low throughput, precision, and/or accuracy. Here, we present an optimized charge transfer RNA sequencing (tRNA-Seq) method that combines previous developments with newly described approaches to establish a protocol for precise and accurate tRNA charge measurements. We verify that this protocol provides robust quantification of tRNA aminoacylation and we provide an end-to-end method that scales to hundreds of samples including software for data processing. Additionally, we show that this method supports measurements of relative tRNA expression levels and can be used to infer tRNA modifications through reverse transcription misincorporations, thereby supporting multipurpose applications in tRNA biology.

	<p>Objective: In this study, we investigated the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and exercise on cognition in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Methods: A literature search was performed using the Cochrane Library, Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science. The time interval used for database construction was up to February 2024; the collected trials were subsequently screened, and the data were extracted. Results: We identified 12 studies with 208 pwMS treated with noninvasive brain stimulation. Seven of the twelve studies concluded that NIBS was effective in improving reaction time, attention and processing speed. Additionally, 26 articles investigated the effect of various types of exercise on cognition among 708 pwMS. Twelve studies used aerobic exercise only, three studies used resistance only, one used yoga, and ten studies used mixed forms of exercise, such as Pilates, resistance and Frenkel coordination. Aerobic exercise was effective in improving at least one cognitive domain in ten studies. Resistance exercise was found to improve cognition in three studies. Yoga failed to show any improvement in one study. Conclusions: NIBS might be an effective intervention for cognition improvement among pwMS. Aerobic exercise and combined forms of exercise are the most frequently investigated and applied and found to be effective. Further studies are needed, especially for resistance, balance and stretching exercises.</p>

	<p>The ability to screen for agents that can promote the development and/or maintenance of neuronal networks creates opportunities for the discovery of novel agents for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Over the past 10 years, advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have paved the way for the improved implementation of live-cell imaging systems for drug discovery. These instruments have revolutionized our ability to quickly and accurately acquire large standardized datasets when studying complex cellular phenomena in real-time. This is particularly useful in the field of neuroscience because real-time analysis can allow efficient monitoring of the development, maturation, and conservation of neuronal networks by measuring neurite length. Unfortunately, due to the relative infancy of this type of analysis, standard practices for data acquisition and processing are lacking, and there is no standardized format for reporting the vast quantities of data generated by live-cell imaging systems. This paper reviews the current state of live-cell imaging instruments, with a focus on the most commonly used equipment (IncuCyte systems). We provide an in-depth analysis of the experimental conditions reported in publications utilizing these systems, particularly with regard to studying neurite outgrowth. This analysis sheds light on trends and patterns that will enhance the use of live-cell imaging instruments in CNS drug discovery.</p>

	<p>Substance use disorders (SUDs) are complex biopsychosocial diseases that cause neurocognitive deficits and neurological impairments by altering the gene expression in reward-related brain areas. Repeated drug use gives rise to alterations in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the expression of microRNAs in several brain areas that may be associated with the development of psychotic symptoms. The first section of this review discusses how substance use contributes to the development of psychotic symptoms via epigenetic alterations. Then, we present more evidence about the link between SUDs and brain epigenetic alterations. The next section presents associations between paternal and maternal exposure to substances and epigenetic alterations in the brains of offspring and the role of maternal diet in preventing substance-induced neurological impairments. Then, we introduce potential therapeutic agents/approaches such as methyl-rich diets to modify epigenetic alterations for alleviating psychotic symptoms or depression in SUDs. Next, we discuss how substance use&amp;amp;ndash;gut microbiome interactions contribute to the development of neurological impairments through epigenetic alterations and how gut microbiome-derived metabolites may become new therapeutics for normalizing epigenetic aberrations. Finally, we address possible challenges and future perspectives for alleviating psychotic symptoms and depression in patients with SUDs by modulating diets, the epigenome, and gut microbiome.</p>

	<p>Long-duration bedrest impairs upright postural and locomotor control, prompting the need for assessment tools to predict the effects of deconditioning on post-bedrest outcome measures. We developed a tilt board mounted vertically with a horizontal air-bearing sled as a potential supine assessment tool for a future bedrest study. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the association between supine proprioceptive assessments on the tilt board and upright functional mobility. Seventeen healthy participants completed variations of a supine tilt board task and an upright functional mobility task (FMT), which is an established obstacle avoidance course. During the supine tasks, participants lay on the air-bearing sled with axial loading toward the tilt board. Participants tilted the board to capture virtual targets on an overhead monitor during 30 s trials. The tasks included two dynamic tasks (i.e., double-leg stance matching mediolateral tilt targets over &amp;amp;plusmn;3&amp;amp;deg; or &amp;amp;plusmn;9&amp;amp;deg; ranges) and two static tasks (i.e., single-leg stance maintaining a central target position). The performances during the dynamic tasks were significantly correlated with the FMT time to completion. The dominant-leg static task performance showed a moderate trend with the FMT time to completion. The results indicate that supine proprioceptive assessments may be associated with upright ambulation performance, and thus, support the proposed application in bedrest studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0019-24.2024?rss=1">Pharmacological Elevation of Catecholamine Levels Improves Perceptual Decisions, But Not Metacognitive Insight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perceptual decisions are often accompanied by a feeling of decision confidence. Where the parietal cortex is known for its crucial role in shaping such perceptual decisions, metacognitive evaluations are thought to additionally rely on the (pre)frontal cortex. Because of this supposed neural differentiation between these processes, perceptual and metacognitive decisions may be divergently affected by changes in internal (e.g., attention, arousal) and external (e.g., task and environmental demands) factors. Although intriguing, causal evidence for this hypothesis remains scarce. Here, we investigated the causal effect of two neuromodulatory systems on behavioral and neural measures of perceptual and metacognitive decision-making. Specifically, we pharmacologically elevated levels of catecholamines (with atomoxetine) and acetylcholine (with donepezil) in healthy adult human participants performing a visual discrimination task in which we gauged decision confidence, while electroencephalography was measured. Where cholinergic effects were not robust, catecholaminergic enhancement improved perceptual sensitivity, while at the same time leaving metacognitive sensitivity unaffected. Neurally, catecholaminergic elevation did not affect sensory representations of task-relevant visual stimuli but instead enhanced well-known decision signals measured over the centroparietal cortex, reflecting the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Crucially, catecholaminergic enhancement concurrently impoverished neural markers measured over the frontal cortex linked to the formation of metacognitive evaluations. Enhanced catecholaminergic neuromodulation thus improves perceptual but not metacognitive decision-making.</p>

                <p>Early-life stressors can affect reproductive development and change responses to adult stress. We tested if resource scarcity in the form of limited bedding and nesting (LBN) from postnatal days (PND) 4 to 11 delayed sexual maturation in male and female mice and/or altered the response to an acute, layered, psychosocial stress (ALPS) in adulthood. Contrary to the hypotheses, age and mass at puberty were unaffected by the present application of LBN. Under basal conditions and after ALPS, corticosterone concentrations in males, diestrous females, and proestrous females reared in standard (STD) or LBN environments were similar. ALPS disrupts the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in most mice when applied on the morning of proestrus; this effect was not changed by resource scarcity. In this study, the paucity of effects in the offspring may relate to a milder response of CBA dams to the paradigm. While LBN dams exited the nest more often and their offspring were smaller than STD-reared offspring on PND11, dam corticosterone concentrations were similar on PND11. To test if ALPS disrupts the LH surge by blunting the increase in excitatory GABAergic input to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons on the afternoon of proestrus, we conducted whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. The frequency of GABAergic postsynaptic currents in GnRH neurons was not altered by LBN, ALPS, or their interaction. It remains possible that ALPS acts at afferents of GnRH neurons, changes response of GnRH neurons to input, and/or alters pituitary responsiveness to GnRH and that a more pronounced resource scarcity would affect the parameters studied.</p>

                <p>Midbrain dopamine neurons receive convergent synaptic input from multiple brain areas, which perturbs rhythmic pacemaking to produce the complex firing patterns observed in vivo. This study investigated the impact of single and multiple inhibitory inputs on ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron firing in mice of both sexes using novel experimental measurements and modeling. We first measured unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents produced by single axons using both minimal electrical stimulation and minimal optical stimulation of rostromedial tegmental nucleus and ventral pallidum afferents. We next determined the phase resetting curve, the reversal potential for GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), and the average interspike membrane potential trajectory during pacemaking. We combined these data in a phase oscillator model of a VTA dopamine neuron, simulating the effects of unitary inhibitory postsynaptic conductances (uIPSGs) on spike timing and rate. The effect of a uIPSG on spike timing was predicted to vary according to its timing within the interspike interval or phase. Simulations were performed to predict the pause duration resulting from the synchronous arrival of multiple uIPSGs and the changes in firing rate and regularity produced by asynchronous uIPSGs. The model data suggest that asynchronous inhibition is more effective than synchronous inhibition, because it tends to hold the neuron at membrane potentials well positive to the IPSC reversal potential. Our results indicate that small fluctuations in the inhibitory synaptic input arriving from the many afferents to each dopamine neuron are sufficient to produce highly variable firing patterns, including pauses that have been implicated in reinforcement.</p>

                Background Software defects can have catastrophic consequences. Therefore, fixing these defects is crucial for the evolution of software. Software Defect Prediction (SDP) enables developers to investigate unscramble faults in the inaugural parts of the software progression mechanism. However, SDP faces many challenges, including the high magnitude of attributes in the datasets, which can degrade the prognostic performance of a defect forecasting model. Feature selection (FS), a compelling instrument for overcoming high dimensionality, selects only the relevant and best features while carefully discarding others. Over the years, several meta-heuristic algorithms such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) have been used to develop defect prediction models. However, these models suffer from several drawbacks, such as high cost, local optima trap, lower convergence rate, and higher parameter tuning. To overcome the above shortcomings, this study aims to develop an innovative FS technique, namely, the Chernobyl Optimization Algorithm (FSCOA), to unwrap the most informative features that can produce a precise prediction model while minimizing errors. Methods The proposed FSCOA approach mimicked the process of nuclear radiation while attacking humans after an explosion. The proposed FSCOA approach was combined with four widely used classifiers, namely Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Quantitative Discriminant Analysis (QDA), to determine the finest attributes from the SDP datasets. Furthermore, the accuracy of the recommended FSCOA method is correlated with existing FS techniques, such as FSDE, FSPSO, FSACO, and FSGA. The statistical merit of the proposed measure was verified using Friedman and Holm tests. Results The experimental findings showed that the proposed FSCOA approach yielded the best accuracy in most cases and achieved an average rank of 1.75, followed by the other studied FS approaches. Furthermore, the Holm test showed that the p-value was lower than or equivalent to the value of α/(A-i), except for the FSCOA and FSGA and FSCOA and FSACO models. Conclusion The experimental findings showed that the prospective FSCOA procedure eclipsed alternative FS techniques with higher accuracy in almost all cases while selecting optimal features.

                Background Prediabetes, a reversible condition before the onset of diabetes, is a significant concern in healthcare globally. The global prediabetes epidemic has emerged and has considerably impacted health expenditures. Various risk factors play important roles in the progression of prediabetes to diabetes. Intensive lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can significantly reduce the risk of diabetes progression. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors of prediabetes state of Medan in August 2023. Methods The sample consisted of 89 participants. This was an analytical cross-sectional study in the community that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The determination of prediabetes is based on the results of blood tests, namely, the examination of fasting blood sugar levels (FBGL), 2-hour postprandial oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C). Other examinations included lipid profiling (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides). Data processing was performed using SPSS via univariate and bivariate analyses (chi-square test). Results Of the 89 participants, the prevalence of prediabetes based on HbA1c, FBGL and 2-hours OGTT levels was 28.1%, 50.6%, and 28.1%, respectively. 82% of the participants were female, and 53.9% were overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI). The risk factors related to the prevalence of prediabetes were HbA1c level, impaired FBGL, and impaired 2-hours OGTT. Other risk factors such as age, sex, daily exercise, diet, BMI, waist-hip ratio, acanthosis nigricans, lipid profile, and blood pressure did not correlate significantly with the risk factors (p>0.05). Conclusion This study found that the prevalence of prediabetes was 67.4% in Medan, 82% of the participants were female, and more than 50% of participants were overweight or obese. HbA1c, FBGL, and 2-hour postprandial OGTT were the most important risk factors for prediabetes.

                Background Gingival recession is a concern in aesthetic and functional perspective. The tunneling technique (TT) is one of the effective root coverage treatments in some gingival recession defects and is associated with favorable outcomes. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and connective tissue graft (CTG) in gingival recession treatment with TT. Methods This systematic review used the PRISMA method and electronic bibliographic searches were conducted on seven databases (Google Scholar, Wiley, Pubmed, Sage, Ovid Technologies, Quintessence Publishing, Springer) from December 2018 to January 2023. The search focused on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that reported TT outcomes in the treatment of Miller class I and II recession with a minimum of six months follow-up. Results Three out of 399 studies met the inclusion criteria. The three selected studies presented PRF and CTG use in multiple gingival recessions to evaluate tissue condition and clinical parameters before and after the surgical procedure. The clinical parameters evaluated were probing pocket depth (PPD), recession width (RW), width of keratinized gingiva (WKG), and vertical depth of recession (VDR). TT with PRF and TT with CTG is effective in treating gingival recession. PRF is well accepted by patients with a less invasive procedure compared to the CTG procedure. However, TT with CTG showed better results in all parameters at follow-up. Conclusions TT with PRF can be used as an alternative to treat some gingival recession defects. However, TT with CTG produced better clinical results in recession closure.

                Background Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the global spread had created several challenges for the general public and the healthcare workers across the world, the primary aim of this study was to assess the psychological stress, sleep quality, and health-related quality of life (QoL) of individuals with multiple health issues during home quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study was conducted between 28th March to 30th April 2020. We recruited 50 individuals who have a history of chronic health issues, and 50 individuals with no health issues for this cross-sectional study. Three questionnaires were used to evaluate the mental health [depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21)], sleep quality [Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)], and QoL [short form of health-related questionnaire (SF-36)] of the participants. Statistical analysis was carried out with Student’s t-test, using SPSS software v16. Results Baseline demographic characteristics were homogenous for both groups of participants. Intergroup analysis revealed statistically significant differences in mental health (p<0.001), sleep quality (p<0.001), and QoL (p<0.001) between the two groups. The results showed high levels of depression, anxiety and stress; poor sleep quality and low health-related QoL in Group A as compared to Group B. Conclusion Our findings indicate that individuals with chronic health issues exhibit higher mental health problems, lower quality of sleep and have a lower health-related QoL. More research is required and also government should plan on taking care of those patients.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012310">Detecting and quantifying heterogeneity in susceptibility using contact tracing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Beth M. Tuschhoff, David A. Kennedy</p>

The presence of heterogeneity in susceptibility, differences between hosts in their likelihood of becoming infected, can fundamentally alter disease dynamics and public health responses, for example, by changing the final epidemic size, the duration of an epidemic, and even the vaccination threshold required to achieve herd immunity. Yet, heterogeneity in susceptibility is notoriously difficult to detect and measure, especially early in an epidemic. Here we develop a method that can be used to detect and estimate heterogeneity in susceptibility given contact by using contact tracing data, which is typically collected early in the course of an outbreak. This approach provides the capability, given sufficient data, to estimate and account for the effects of this heterogeneity before they become apparent during an epidemic. It additionally provides the capability to analyze the wealth of contact tracing data available for previous epidemics and estimate heterogeneity in susceptibility for disease systems in which it has never been estimated previously. The premise of our approach is that highly susceptible individuals become infected more often than less susceptible individuals, and so individuals not infected after appearing in contact networks should be less susceptible than average. This change in susceptibility can be detected and quantified when individuals show up in a second contact network after not being infected in the first. To develop our method, we simulated contact tracing data from artificial populations with known levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility according to underlying discrete or continuous distributions of susceptibilities. We analyzed this data to determine the parameter space under which we are able to detect heterogeneity and the accuracy with which we are able to estimate it. We found that our power to detect heterogeneity increases with larger sample sizes, greater heterogeneity, and intermediate fractions of contacts becoming infected in the discrete case or greater fractions of contacts becoming infected in the continuous case. We also found that we are able to reliably estimate heterogeneity and disease dynamics. Ultimately, this means that contact tracing data alone is sufficient to detect and quantify heterogeneity in susceptibility.

                <p>by Diogo Melo, Luisa F. Pallares, Julien F. Ayroles</p>

Finding communities in gene co-expression networks is a common first step toward extracting biological insight from these complex datasets. Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules, that is, groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist, using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky, as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored. Here, we ask: can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks, and how modular are these communities? For this, we use a recently developed community detection method, the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model (SBM), that does not assume that assortative modules exist. Instead, the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes. Using RNA-seq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of, we show that (a) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods, that (b) several of those gene groups are not modular, and that (c) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities. These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks.

                <p>by Vivienne Leech, Fiona N. Kenny, Stefania Marcotti, Tanya J. Shaw, Brian M. Stramer, Angelika Manhart</p>

Collective alignment of cell populations is a commonly observed phenomena in biology. An important example are aligning fibroblasts in healthy or scar tissue. In this work we derive and simulate a mechanistic agent-based model of the collective behaviour of actively moving and interacting cells, with a focus on understanding collective alignment. The derivation strategy is based on energy minimisation. The model ingredients are motivated by data on the behaviour of different populations of aligning fibroblasts and include: Self-propulsion, overlap avoidance, deformability, cell-cell junctions and cytoskeletal forces. We find that there is an optimal ratio of self-propulsion speed and overlap avoidance that maximises collective alignment. Further we find that deformability aids alignment, and that cell-cell junctions by themselves hinder alignment. However, if cytoskeletal forces are transmitted via cell-cell junctions we observe strong collective alignment over large spatial scales.

                <p>by Matthieu Bouguéon, Vincent Legagneux, Octave Hazard, Jérémy Bomo, Anne Siegel, Jérôme Feret, Nathalie Théret</p>

Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the source of extracellular matrix (ECM) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches. Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed, and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Here, we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion. We used the Kappa graph rewriting language, for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion. HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with (TGF<i>β</i>1) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen, the main component of the ECM. Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion. While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps, reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs (iHSCs) are required to sustain fibrosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the model’s sensitivity to (TGF<i>β</i>1) parameters, suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of (TGF<i>β</i>1) production associated with the inflammatory response differ. Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, we validated the predicted ECM dynamics. Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression. Overall, our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. Moreover, our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.

                <p>by Chengxin Zhang, Lydia Freddolino</p>

Despite the increasing number of 3D RNA structures in the Protein Data Bank, the majority of experimental RNA structures lack thorough functional annotations. As the significance of the functional roles played by noncoding RNAs becomes increasingly apparent, comprehensive annotation of RNA function is becoming a pressing concern. In response to this need, we have developed FURNA (Functions of RNAs), the first database for experimental RNA structures that aims to provide a comprehensive repository of high-quality functional annotations. These include Gene Ontology terms, Enzyme Commission numbers, ligand-binding sites, RNA families, protein-binding motifs, and cross-references to related databases. FURNA is available at https://seq2fun.dcmb.med.umich.edu/furna/ to enable quick discovery of RNA functions from their structures and sequences.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intellectual disability is often the outcome of neurodevelopmental disorders and is characterized by significant impairments in intellectual and adaptive functioning. X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a subset of these disorders caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome, affecting about 2 out of 1,000 males. In syndromic form, it leads to a broad range of cognitive, behavioral, ocular, and physical disabilities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Employing exome or genome sequencing, here we identified 4 missense variants (c.475C &gt; G; p.H159D, c.1373C &gt; A; p.T458N, and c.1585G &gt; A; p.E529K, c.953C &gt; T; p.S318L) and a putative truncating variant (c.1413_1414del; p.Y471*) in the <i>SRPK3</i> gene in 9 XLID patients from 5 unrelated families. To validate <i>SRPK3</i> as a novel XLID gene, we established a knockout (KO) model of the <i>SRPK3</i> orthologue in zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 8 patients ascertained postnatally shared common clinical features including intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, abnormal eye movement, and ataxia. A ninth case, ascertained prenatally, had a complex structural brain phenotype. Together, these data indicate a pathological role of <i>SRPK3</i> in neurodevelopmental disorders. In post-fertilization day 5 larvae (free swimming stage), KO zebrafish exhibited severe deficits in eye movement and swim bladder inflation, mimicking uncontrolled ocular movement and physical clumsiness observed in human patients. In adult KO zebrafish, cerebellar agenesis and behavioral abnormalities were observed, recapitulating human phenotypes of cerebellar atrophy and intellectual disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, these results suggest a crucial role of <i>SRPK3</i> in the pathogenesis of syndromic X-linked intellectual disability and provide new insights into brain development, cognitive and ocular dysfunction in both humans and zebrafish. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96602">Drosophila HCN mediates gustatory homeostasis by preserving sensillar transepithelial potential in sweet environments</a></h4>

              
                Establishing transepithelial ion disparities is crucial for sensory functions in animals. In insect sensory organs called sensilla, a transepithelial potential, known as the sensillum potential (SP), arises through active ion transport across accessory cells, sensitizing receptor neurons such as mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. Because multiple receptor neurons are often co-housed in a sensillum and share SP, niche-prevalent overstimulation of single sensory neurons can compromise neighboring receptors by depleting SP. However, how such potential depletion is prevented to maintain sensory homeostasis remains unknown. Here, we find that the <i>Ih-</i>encoded hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel bolsters the activity of bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (bGRNs), albeit acting in sweet-sensing GRNs (sGRNs). For this task, HCN maintains SP despite prolonged sGRN stimulation induced by the diet mimicking their sweet feeding niche, such as overripe fruit. We present evidence that <i>Ih</i>-dependent demarcation of sGRN excitability is implemented to throttle SP consumption, which may have facilitated adaptation to a sweetness-dominated environment. Thus, HCN expressed in sGRNs serves as a key component of a simple yet versatile peripheral coding that regulates bitterness for optimal food intake in two contrasting ways: sweet-resilient preservation of bitter aversion and the previously reported sweet-dependent suppression of bitter taste.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96979">A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen identifies calreticulin as a selective repressor of ATF6α</a></h4>

              
                Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is one of three endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane stress sensors that mediate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Despite its crucial role in long-term ER stress adaptation, regulation of ATF6 alpha (α) signalling remains poorly understood, possibly because its activation involves ER-to-Golgi and nuclear trafficking. Here, we generated an ATF6α/Inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) dual UPR reporter CHO-K1 cell line and performed an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis screen to systematically profile genetic factors that specifically contribute to ATF6α signalling in the presence and absence of ER stress. The screen identified both anticipated and new candidate genes that regulate ATF6α activation. Among these, calreticulin (CRT), a key ER luminal chaperone, selectively repressed ATF6α signalling: Cells lacking CRT constitutively activated a BiP::sfGFP ATF6α-dependent reporter, had higher BiP levels and an increased rate of trafficking and processing of ATF6α. Purified CRT interacted with the luminal domain of ATF6α <i>in vitro</i> and the two proteins co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. CRT depletion exposed a negative feedback loop implicating ATF6α in repressing IRE1 activity basally and overexpression of CRT reversed this repression. Our findings indicate that CRT, beyond its known role as a chaperone, also serves as an ER repressor of ATF6α to selectively regulate one arm of the UPR.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91483">Cerebellar nuclei cells produce distinct pathogenic spike signatures in mouse models of ataxia, dystonia, and tremor</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum contributes to a diverse array of motor conditions, including ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. The neural substrates that encode this diversity are unclear. Here, we tested whether the neural spike activity of cerebellar output neurons is distinct between movement disorders with different impairments, generalizable across movement disorders with similar impairments, and capable of causing distinct movement impairments. Using in vivo awake recordings as input data, we trained a supervised classifier model to differentiate the spike parameters between mouse models for ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. The classifier model correctly assigned mouse phenotypes based on single-neuron signatures. Spike signatures were shared across etiologically distinct but phenotypically similar disease models. Mimicking these pathophysiological spike signatures with optogenetics induced the predicted motor impairments in otherwise healthy mice. These data show that distinct spike signatures promote the behavioral presentation of cerebellar diseases.

	<p>Transcranial electrical brain stimulation techniques like transcranial direct current (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current (tACS) have emerged as potential tools for treating neurological diseases by modulating cortical excitability. These techniques deliver small electric currents to the brain non-invasively through electrodes on the scalp. tDCS uses constant direct current which weakly alters the membrane voltage of cortical neurons, while tACS utilizes alternating current to target and enhance cortical oscillations, though the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood more specifically. To elucidate how tACS perturbs endogenous network dynamics, we simulated spiking neuron network models. We identified distinct roles of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing phases in driving network activity towards and away from the strong nonlinearity provided by pyramidal neurons. Exploring resonance effects, we found matching tACS frequency to the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s endogenous resonance frequency creates greater entrainment. Based on this, we developed an algorithm to determine the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s endogenous frequency, phase, and amplitude, then deliver optimized tACS to entrain network oscillations. Together, these computational results provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tACS on network dynamics and could inform future closed-loop tACS systems that dynamically tune stimulation parameters to ongoing brain activity.</p>

	<p>The classification of a pre-processed fMRI dataset using functional connectivity (FC)-based features is considered a challenging task because of the set of high-dimensional FC features and the small dataset size. To tackle this specific set of FC high-dimensional features and a small-sized dataset, we propose here a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)-based dataset augmenter to first train the cGAN on computed connectivity features of NYU dataset and use the trained cGAN to generate synthetic connectivity features per category. After obtaining a sufficient number of connectivity features per category, a Multi-Head attention mechanism is used as a head for the classification. We name our proposed approach &amp;amp;ldquo;ASD-GANNet&amp;amp;rdquo;, which is end-to-end and does not require hand-crafted features, as the Multi-Head attention mechanism focuses on the features that are more relevant. Moreover, we compare our results with the six available state-of-the-art techniques from the literature. Our proposed approach results using the &amp;amp;ldquo;NYU&amp;amp;rdquo; site as a training set for generating a cGAN-based synthetic dataset are promising. We achieve an overall 10-fold cross-validation-based accuracy of 82%, sensitivity of 82%, and specificity of 81%, outperforming available state-of-the art approaches. A sitewise comparison of our proposed approach also outperforms the available state-of-the-art, as out of the 17 sites, our proposed approach has better results in the 10 sites.</p>

	<p>Background: This longitudinal study aimed to evaluate whether prior engagement in a physical exercise program correlated with enhanced perceptions of quality-of-life components among older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Methods: The cohort comprised elderly individuals (aged &amp;amp;ge; 65 years) who had previously partaken in a 12-week randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of a mixed aerobic&amp;amp;ndash;anaerobic, moderate-intensity exercise program. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; health-related quality of life was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey-12 item (SF-12) at the beginning of the initial trial and, again, one year later during the COVID-19 lockdown. In the exercise group, 44 participants were included, while the control group consisted of 49 participants, with computer-based, double-blind randomization conducted in Cagliari, Italy. The differences in scores for each SF-12 item between the two groups from T0 to T1 were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed on average by age (exercise group vs. control group 72.20 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.78 vs. 72.91 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.77; F = 0.513, p = 0.476). A decrease from T0 to T1 towards a better score on the SF-12 was observed in the exercise group compared to the control group in item 1 (F = 67.463, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001); in item 5 (F = 4.319, p = 0.041); item 8 (F = 4.269, p = 0.041); item 9 (F = 10.761, p = 0.001); item 10 (F = 170.433, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); and item 11 (F = 4.075, p = 0.046). Conclusions: The results suggest that participation in a moderate physical exercise program one year prior may have equipped older adults with better coping mechanisms to navigate the stress and isolation imposed by the COVID-19 lockdown, as reflected by their enhanced scores on quality-of-life components pertaining to mental well-being. Exercise may confer a protective effect against the adverse psychological impacts of stressful events like the pandemic, even among older adults with chronic conditions. This study underscores the potential benefits of exercise interventions for promoting quality of life and preventing mood disorders in the elderly population.</p>

	<p>Rare side effects of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are known as neurological immune-related adverse events (n-irAEs). Typically, n-irAEs affect the peripheral nervous system, primarily presenting as myositis, polyradiculoneuropathy, or cranial neuropathy. Less commonly, they impact the central nervous system, resulting in encephalitis, meningitis, or myelitis. High-grade n-irAEs managing and recognizing remains challenging, considering the risk of mortality and long-term disability. To date, strong scientific data are lacking to support the management of high-grade clinical forms. We performed a systematic literature search, selecting all articles describing high-grade steroid-resistance n-irAEs. and we reported them in a practical review. Specifically, current recommendations advise stopping ICI use and beginning corticosteroid treatment. Our findings highlighted that in steroid-resistant n-irAEs, it should be recommended to quickly escalate to plasma exchange (PLEX) and/or intravenously immunoglobulins (IVIg), usually in association with other immunosuppressants. Furthermore, newer evidence supports the use of drugs that may specifically block inflammation without reducing the anti-tumour effect of ICIs. In this practical review, we provide new evidence regarding the therapeutic approach of high-grade n-irAEs, particularly in steroid-resistant cases. We would also stress the importance of informing the scientific community of the discrepancy between current guidelines and clinical evidence in these rare forms of pathology.</p>

	<p>The cerebellum, a major feature of the hindbrain, lies posterior to the pons and medulla and inferior to the posterior part of the cerebrum. It lies beneath the tentorium cerebelli in the posterior cranial fossa and consists of two lateral hemispheres connected by the vermis. The cerebellum is primarily supplied by three arteries originating from the vertebrobasilar system: the superior cerebellar artery (SCA), the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). However, variations of the cerebellar arteries may occur, such as duplication of the SCA, SCA creating a common trunk with the posterior cerebral artery, triplication of the AICA, and agenesis of PICA, amongst others. Knowledge of the arterial anatomy of the cerebellum is crucial, as inadequate blood supply to this region can result in diminished motor functioning, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients. The present study demonstrated the importance of adequate anatomical knowledge of the arteries supplying the cerebellum. The PubMed and Embase databases were searched to gather articles on the anatomical characteristics and variations of the arterial supply of the cerebellum. It is the most comprehensive and up-to-date review available in the literature. The possible variations of these vessels may be clinically silent or present with clinical symptoms such as neurovascular compression syndromes of the cranial nerves and aneurysms. With a comprehensive understanding of the cerebellar arterial system, physicians can enhance their diagnostic and treatment capabilities, ultimately leading to more effective management of cerebellar vascular-related issues and other neurological deficits.</p>

	<p>Revascularization surgery for the symptomatic hemisphere with hemodynamic impairment is effective for Moyamoya vasculopathy patients. However, careful patient selection is crucial and ideally supported by advanced quantitative hemodynamic imaging. Recently, blood oxygenation level-dependent cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD-CVR) and quantitative magnetic resonance angiography with non-invasive optimal vessel analysis (qMRA-NOVA) have gained prominence in assessing these patients. This study aims to present the results of BOLD-CVR and qMRA-NOVA imaging along with the changes in cerebral hemodynamics and flow status following flow augmentation with superficial temporal artery&amp;amp;ndash;middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass in our Moyamoya vasculopathy patient cohort. Symptomatic patients with Moyamoya vasculopathy treated at the Clinical Neuroscience Center of the University Hospital Zurich who underwent hemodynamic and flow imaging (BOLD-CVR and qMRA-NOVA) before and after bypass were included in the analysis. Reduced hemispheric volume flow rates, as well as impaired BOLD-CVR, were measured in all 12 patients with Moyamoya vasculopathy before STA-MCA bypass surgery. Following the surgical procedure, post-operative BOLD-CVR demonstrated a non-significant increase in BOLD-CVR values within the revascularized, symptomatic middle cerebral artery territory and cerebral hemisphere. The results of the statistical tests should be viewed as indicative due to the small sample size. Additionally, post-operative qMRA-NOVA revealed a significant improvement in the hemispheric volume flow rate of the affected hemisphere due to the additional bypass flow rate. Our findings affirm the presence of hemodynamic and flow impairments in the symptomatic hemisphere of the Moyamoya vasculopathy patients. Bypass surgery proves effective in improving both BOLD-CVR impairment and the hemispheric volume flow rate in our patient cohort.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Intramedullary metastases to the conus medullaris spinalis (IMCM) pose a rare problem in neurosurgical oncology and are usually encountered as a complicated clinical scenario in the setting of advanced systemic malignancy with poor overall survival. Despite the progress in interdisciplinary oncological care, their management remains complicated. Research Question: We performed a PRISMA-guided literature search to achieve a pooled analysis of all previously reported IMCM cases that contained detailed clinical data on this problem to investigate the currently employed management options and respective outcomes. We obtained a clinical vignette and performed a comprehensive narrative review of IMCM management. Materials and Methods: The PubMed/MEDLINE/Google Scholar, Cochrane and Embase databases were systematically searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All relevant publications retrieved were subjected to full-text analysis in detail and pertinent information was extracted. Results: The most common systemic primary tumor site as the origin of IMCM was the lung, followed by the breast. Overall, the pooled median survival was 6 months (range 0.5&amp;amp;ndash;36 months). Patients who received both surgery and radiation therapy had the longest overall survival (OS) (mean 9.9 months) and those who received no oncological treatment (neither surgery nor adjuvant therapy) had the shortest OS (mean 3.6 months). In cases where surgical resection was performed as part of the treatment plan for metastases, those with partial tumor resection had a more favorable neurological outcome than patients who underwent aggressive gross total resection. Conclusions: Based on the results of our analysis, we find that diligent microsurgical resection (subtotal or total) followed by radiation therapy appears as an effective and suitable treatment in select patients with IMCM. When surgery is not feasible as part of the treatment algorithm, radiation therapy alone (conventional or radiosurgery) also appears to be a suitable treatment option that confers a benefit to the patient.</p>

	<p>Upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction is an important feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) for the diagnosis and understanding of pathogenesis. The identification of UMN signs forms the basis of ALS diagnosis, although may be difficult to discern, especially in the setting of severe muscle weakness. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques have yielded objective physiological biomarkers of UMN dysfunction in ALS, enabling the interrogation of cortical and subcortical neuronal networks with diagnostic, pathophysiological, and prognostic implications. Transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques have provided pertinent pathogenic insights and yielded novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Cortical hyperexcitability, as heralded by a reduction in short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and an increase in short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF), has been associated with lower motor neuron degeneration, patterns of disease evolution, as well as the development of specific ALS clinical features including the split hand phenomenon. Reduction in SICI has also emerged as a potential diagnostic aid in ALS. More recently, physiological distinct inhibitory and facilitatory cortical interneuronal circuits have been identified, which have been shown to contribute to ALS pathogenesis. The triple stimulation technique (TST) was shown to enhance the diagnostic utility of conventional TMS measures in detecting UMN dysfunction. Resting-state EEG is a novel neurophysiological technique developed for directly interrogating cortical neuronal networks in ALS, that have yielded potentially useful physiological biomarkers of UMN dysfunction. The present review discusses physiological biomarkers of UMN dysfunction in ALS, encompassing conventional and novel TMS techniques developed to interrogate the functional integrity of the corticomotoneuronal system, focusing on pathogenic, diagnostic, and prognostic utility.</p>

	<p>Motor impairment is a common issue in stroke patients, often affecting the upper limbs. To this standpoint, robotic neurorehabilitation has shown to be highly effective for motor function recovery. Notably, Machine learning (ML) may be a powerful technique able to identify the optimal kind and intensity of rehabilitation treatments to maximize the outcomes. This retrospective observational research aims to assess the efficacy of robotic devices in facilitating the functional rehabilitation of upper limbs in stroke patients through ML models. Specifically, clinical scales, such as the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (A-D) (FMA), the Frenchay Arm Test (FAT), and the Barthel Index (BI), were used to assess the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; condition before and after robotic therapy. The values of these scales were predicted based on the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; clinical and demographic data obtained before the treatment. The findings showed that ML models have high accuracy in predicting the FMA, FAT, and BI, with R-squared (R2) values of 0.79, 0.57, and 0.74, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that integrating ML into robotic therapy may have the capacity to establish a personalized and streamlined clinical practice, leading to significant improvements in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life and the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.</p>

	<p>Flexible pulse-by-pulse regulation of sensorimotor synchronization is crucial for voluntarily showing rhythmic behaviors synchronously with external cueing; however, the underpinning neurophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a key role by coordinating both proactive and reactive motor outcomes based on contextual mental imagery. To test our hypothesis, a missing-oddball task in finger-tapping paradigms was conducted in 33 healthy young volunteers. The dynamic properties of the dACC were evaluated by event-related deep-brain activity (ER-DBA), supported by event-related potential (ERP) analysis and behavioral evaluation based on signal detection theory. We found that ER-DBA activation/deactivation reflected a strategic choice of motor control modality in accordance with mental imagery. Reverse ERP traces, as omission responses, confirmed that the imagery was contextual. We found that mental imagery was updated only by environmental changes via perceptual evidence and response-based abductive reasoning. Moreover, stable on-pulse tapping was achievable by maintaining proactive control while creating an imagery of syncopated rhythms from simple beat trains, whereas accuracy was degraded with frequent erroneous tapping for missing pulses. We conclude that the dACC voluntarily regulates rhythmic sensorimotor synchronization by utilizing contextual mental imagery based on experience and by creating novel rhythms.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the commonest primary brain cancers. They are characterized by a pattern of aggressive growth and diffuse infiltration of the host brain that severely limits the efficacy of conventional treatments and patient outcomes, which remain generally poor. Recent work has described a suite of mechanisms via which HGGs interact, predominantly bidirectionally, with various cell types in the host brain including neurons, glial cells, immune cells, and vascular elements to drive tumor growth and invasion. These insights have the potential to inspire novel approaches to HGG therapy that are critically needed. This review explores HGG–host brain interactions and considers whether and how they might be exploited for therapeutic gain.

	<p>Background: Neural efficiency refers to the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to function with reduced resource expenditure while maintaining high performance levels. Previous research has demonstrated that table tennis athletes have greater neural efficiency at the conscious level. However, it is unknown whether they exhibit greater neural efficiency at the unconscious level. Therefore, this study aims to investigate unconscious perceptual processing and neural efficiency in elite table tennis athletes through tasks involving the judgment of spin serves. Methods: Fifty healthy, right-handed individuals participated in this study, including 25 elite table tennis athletes and 25 control participants without professional training experience. To evaluate the unconscious perceptual characteristics of both groups, we used a combination of masked priming paradigm and event-related potential techniques. Results: The behavioral results reveal that, compared to the control group, the table tennis athletes displayed reduced reaction times (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and increased priming effects (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) under unconscious conditions. The electrophysiological findings indicated that both groups elicited N1, N2, and P2 components. Notably, compared to the control group, the table tennis athletes exhibited significantly lower amplitude responses at the occipital lobe electrodes PO3, POz, PO4, O1, Oz, and O2 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: These results further support the neural efficiency hypothesis, indicating that prolonged professional training enhances athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; capacities for specialized unconscious cognitive processing.</p>

	<p>The main goal of the current work was to assess the age sensitivity of a novel battery of cool and hot Executive Function (EF) tasks developed for the middle childhood period: the Executive Brain Battery (EBB). To this end, we carried out a first study in which the EBB was administered to six age groups ranging from 6 to 11. Additionally, in a second study, we compared children at the end of middle childhood (age 11 years) and adult performance in the EBB. Results showed that tasks included in the EBB were suitable for all age groups, with more age-related changes being found in cool than hot EF tasks. Moreover, at the end of middle childhood, children reach an adult-like performance in most of these cool and hot tasks. The present findings extend previous research suggesting that cool and hot EFs exhibit different patterns of age-related growth in middle childhood. Additionally, the EEB could become a useful tool for research on EFs during middle childhood that could be adapted for a wide range of populations.</p>

	<p>Patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) often suffer from cognitive dysfunction (CD), affecting their quality of life and daily functioning. Current treatments, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, have limited efficacy and notable side effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive technique that modulates cortical activity, shows promise in improving cognitive function with minimal side effects and low cost, and could potentially serve as a valuable adjunct to existing therapies. This systematic review aims to evaluate the literature on the effectiveness of tDCS for CD in SUD patients to inform clinical practice and future research. Following PRISMA guidelines, the review includes studies that used tDCS for SUD-related CD. The criteria for inclusion encompassed participants aged 18 and older with a diagnosis of SUD, the use of tDCS (either conventional or high-definition), control groups receiving sham stimulation or no intervention, and cognitive outcome measures for substance-related cognitive function using validated tools. Databases searched were Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO, with specific keywords. Twenty-two studies met the criteria, suggesting tDCS can improve cognitive functions in SUD patients, though results varied. Effectiveness may depend on the brain area targeted, stimulation parameters, task requirements, and individual differences. tDCS shows potential in treating SUD-related CD, but further research is needed to optimize stimulation protocols and address study variability. Future studies should use functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the brain mechanisms by which tDCS improves cognitive function in SUDs and focus on larger, long-term trials to confirm efficacy and refine tDCS treatment parameters.</p>

The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0228-24.2024?rss=1">Reading Reshapes Stimulus Selectivity in the Visual Word Form Area</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reading depends on a brain region known as the "visual word form area" (VWFA) in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex. This region's function is debated because its stimulus selectivity is not absolute, it is modulated by a variety of task demands, and it is inconsistently localized. We used fMRI to characterize the combination of sensory and cognitive factors that activate word-responsive regions that we precisely localized in 16 adult humans (4 male). We then presented three types of character strings: English words, pseudowords, and unfamiliar characters with matched visual features. Participants performed three different tasks while viewing those stimuli: detecting real words, detecting color in the characters, and detecting color in the fixation mark. There were three primary findings about the VWFA's response: (1) It preferred letter strings over unfamiliar characters even when the stimuli were ignored during the fixation task. (2) Compared with those baseline responses, engaging in the word reading task enhanced the response to words but suppressed the response to unfamiliar characters. (3) Attending to the stimuli to judge their color had little effect on the response magnitudes. Thus, the VWFA is uniquely modulated by a cognitive signal that is specific to voluntary linguistic processing and is not additive. Functional connectivity analyses revealed that communication between the VWFA and a left frontal language area increased when the participant engaged in the linguistic task. We conclude that the VWFA is inherently selective for familiar orthography, but it falls under control of the language network when the task demands it.</p>

                <p>Motion-induced anxiety and agoraphobia are more frequent symptoms in patients with vestibular migraine (VM) than migraine without vertigo. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a therapeutic target for migraine and VM, but the link between motion hypersensitivity, anxiety, and CGRP is relatively unexplored, especially in preclinical mouse models. To further examine this link, we tested the effects of systemic CGRP and off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) on elevated plus maze (EPM) and rotarod performance in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Rotarod ability was assessed using two different dowel diameters: mouse dowel (<I>r</I> = 1.5&nbsp;cm) versus rat dowel (<I>r</I> = 3.5&nbsp;cm). EPM results indicate that CGRP alone or OVAR alone did not increase anxiety indices. However, the combination of CGRP and OVAR did elicit anxiety-like behavior. On the rotarod, CGRP reduced performance in both sexes on a mouse dowel but had no effect on a rat dowel, whereas OVAR had a significant effect on the rat dowel. These results suggest that only the combination of CGRP with vestibular stimulation induces anxiety-like behavior and that CGRP affects the dynamic balance function in mice depending on the type of challenge presented. These findings suggest that anxiety-like behaviors can be teased out from imbalance behaviors in a mouse model of "migraine." Future studies are aimed to determine if CGRP receptor antagonists that have been effective treating migraineurs and mouse "migraine" models may also reduce the anxiety observed in migraine.</p>

                Background Endodontic treatment is the most common method for resolving pulpal and periapical pathology. However, various studies have reported that almost 11%–13% of all teeth that undergo extraction after endodontic treatment show the presence of cracks, craze lines, and vertical root fractures. Teeth with inadequate post endodontic restoration are more prone to fracture and coronal leakage, resulting in the diffusion of oral fluids, bacteria, bacterial products, and possibly root canal treatment failure. Furthermore, studies have advocated the use of endodontically treated teeth with restorative materials that have a similar or higher elastic modulus than the tooth for providing stiffness against forces that cause root fracture. Intraorifice barriers made of restorative materials that can bond to radicular dentin could thus be used to reinforce the radicular dentin while also preventing coronal microleakage. Although the sealing ability of intraorifice barriers has been widely compared in the literature, there have been few studies on the strengthening effect of the materials used in the study as intraorifice barriers when placed into the root canal. As a result, the current in vitro study aims to assess the effect of various materials as intraorifice barriers (Cention N, Resin modified glass ionomer cement, and short fiber reinforced flowable composite) on the force required fracture teeth after root canal treatment. Methods This in vitro study will be done on extracted human mandibular premolars with single root canal where after doing root canal treatment 2-3 mm obturating material would be replaced by intra orifice barriers (Cention N, resin modified glass ionomer cement [RMGIC], and short fiber reinforced flowable composite). The force required to fracture teeth will be calculated using universal testing machine.

                Background: The protein interaction between the viral surface S-glycoprotein and the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) is key to the virulent nature of SARS-CoV-2. The potential role that effective drug repurposing strategies may have to help stem the impact of future outbreaks has been brought to light in the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This study outlines a comprehensive approach towards in-silico drug discovery which aims to identify hit agents that can be suitably translated into a clinical setting. Methods: We use two different computational platforms to analyze the viral S-glycoprotein in its bound conformational state to the ACE2 receptor. We employed a comprehensive screening approach to shortlist compounds capable of binding to the viral target interface and corroborated these findings using both Schrödinger’s Glide and AutoDock Vina. Molecular dynamic simulation studies further verified the stability of the interaction at the viral-host protein interface. Results: Lymecycline, pentagalloylglucose, polydatin, and hexoprenaline were identified as prime candidates for further studies given the robust and stable nature of their interaction at the viral-host interface and relevance for clinical testing. These agents were shown in a 100-nanosecond simulation trajectory to favorably disrupt key binding interactions at the viral-host interface and may potentially inhibit viral entry into host cells. In all hit molecules it was observed that inhibiting the interaction with the following key viral binding residues: Lys17, Gly496, Tyr 505, and key host residues: His34, Asp38, Lys353, played a critical role toward the inhibition of the viral-host protein interaction. Conclusions: Our study is unique in its comprehensive approach to identify agents that can bind to the S-glycoprotein-ACE2 interface using multiple computational platforms. Among the hit compounds shortlisted in this study, both lymecycline and hexoprenaline may be considered as candidates for preliminarily clinical studies to assess their therapeutic potential in the management of COVID-19 infections.

                Background Systemic hypertension is a global non-communicable disease that creates an essential need for alternate forms of lifestyle modifications, including exercise, to lower elevated blood pressure. Mat Pilates, a feasible form of mind-body coordinated exercise, may provide benefits with limited resources. Objective This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of Mat Pilates on resting blood pressure and health-related quality of life in individuals with systemic hypertension. Methods A two-arm, single-blinded, block randomized controlled trial will be recruited with120 participants into control and experimental groups (1:1 ratio). Mat Pilates will be administered to the experimental group and standard care to the control group for 12 weeks. Resting and central blood pressure, health-related quality of life, and echocardiographic parameters will be measured before and after the trial. We hypothesized that Pilates may not be beneficial in lowering resting blood pressure in hypertensive patients. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will test the within- and between-group effects of Mat Pilates on various outcomes. Ethics and Dissemination The trial was approved by the Institutional Research Committee, Manipal College of Health Professions, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Kasturba Medical College, and Kasturba Hospital Institutional Ethics Committee, Manipal. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. All stakeholders and committees will communicate key findings regarding the implementation of mind-body association exercises as a measure of lifestyle modification in individuals with systemic hypertension.

                Background Dietary supplements (DS) use among Lebanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased widely due to the country’s economic and financial situation. This study was conducted (1) to estimate the prevalence of DS use among persons with T2DM amid the escalating economic crisis in Lebanon; (2) to explore the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of DS use; and (3) to determine any significant association between socio-economic and socio-demographic factors and the use of DS modality Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the worst episode of the economic crisis between October and April 2022 on 460 adult patients with T2DM of both sexes. Patients were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire. Results Almost 4 out of 10 patients with T2DM in our study were found to be using DS, where 27.6% take multivitamins frequently. One-third of the participants agreed that nutritional supplements are necessary to control diabetes symptoms and complications. Around 41.1% of the participants complained about hypoglycemia and used DS to control their blood sugar levels (56.4%), while the rest used it to improve their health (35.5%) and control their diet (2.2%). The predictors of DS usage were the patient’s level of education [OR=3.9, CI=1.5-10, p=0.003), self-monitoring of blood sugars (OR=4.9, CI=1.68-14.6; p=0.004) and reading the nutrition label [OR=59.3, CI=6.3-55.8, p=0.000]. Conclusion This study estimated the prevalence of DS use and abuse, among persons with diabetes type II and found three significant predictors of DS use among patients with T2DM. Public health experts should encourage healthy discussions and awareness with their patients to comprehend their views regarding DS use.

                Background Blastoid mantle cell lymphoma (B-MCL) is a rare aggressive lymphoma. It is characterized by blastoid morphology with high proliferation and inconsistent immunohistochemistry (IHC), making it a diagnostic challenge for the pathologist. Methods This is a retrospective analytical cohort study. We reviewed biopsy confirmed cases of B-MCL diagnosed over a period of 10 years (January 2012 to December 2022). The clinical presentation, histopathological and IHC findings, treatment received, and survival outcomes were studied. Randomly selected cases of classic MCL (n=12), diagnosed during the same period served as controls. Results A total of 12 cases were studied. Four cases were transformed from previously diagnosed MCL; 8 cases arose de novo. Mean age was 61.17 years and the male: female ratio was 5:1. Half of the cases showed extra nodal extension and 81.8% had bone marrow involvement. Gastrointestinal tract was the most common site of extra nodal involvement. Histopathological examination showed diffuse involvement of the lymph node with medium sized cells. On immunohistochemistry, one of the cases showed loss of CD5 expression while the other had aberrant CD10 expression. Mean Ki-67 index was 58.09% in the cases and 16.33% in controls and was statistically significant (p=0.005). The median overall survival (OS) for cases was 2 years vs 8 years in controls. The p53 over expression (>30% nuclear positivity) was seen in 66.6% cases (4/6). Conclusion There are several factors that contribute to the aggressiveness of B-MCL, and new treatment approaches might be required to improve patient outcomes.

                <p>by Eric Tatara, Qinyun Lin, Jonathan Ozik, Marynia Kolak, Nicholson Collier, Dylan Halpern, Luc Anselin, Harel Dahari, Basmattee Boodram, John Schneider</p>

Access to treatment and medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is essential in reducing opioid use and associated behavioral risks, such as syringe sharing among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Syringe sharing among PWID carries high risk of transmission of serious infections such as hepatitis C and HIV. MOUD resources, such as methadone provider clinics, however, are often unavailable to PWID due to barriers like long travel distance to the nearest methadone provider and the required frequency of clinic visits. The goal of this study is to examine the uncertainty in the effects of travel distance in initiating and continuing methadone treatment and how these interact with different spatial distributions of methadone providers to impact co-injection (syringe sharing) risks. A baseline scenario of spatial access was established using the existing locations of methadone providers in a geographical area of metropolitan Chicago, Illinois, USA. Next, different counterfactual scenarios redistributed the locations of methadone providers in this geographic area according to the densities of both the general adult population and according to the PWID population per zip code. We define different reasonable methadone access assumptions as the combinations of short, medium, and long travel distance preferences combined with three urban/suburban travel distance preference. Our modeling results show that when there is a low travel distance preference for accessing methadone providers, distributing providers near areas that have the greatest need (defined by density of PWID) is best at reducing syringe sharing behaviors. However, this strategy also decreases access across suburban locales, posing even greater difficulty in regions with fewer transit options and providers. As such, without an adequate number of providers to give equitable coverage across the region, spatial distribution cannot be optimized to provide equitable access to all PWID. Our study has important implications for increasing interest in methadone as a resurgent treatment for MOUD in the United States and for guiding policy toward improving access to MOUD among PWID.

Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) is a valuable experimental tool to study the immune state in health and following immune challenges such as infectious diseases, (auto)immune diseases, and cancer. Several tools have been developed to reconstruct B cell and T cell receptor sequences from AIRR-seq data and infer B and T cell clonal relationships. However, currently available tools offer limited parallelization across samples, scalability or portability to high-performance computing infrastructures. To address this need, we developed nf-core/airrflow, an end-to-end bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq processing workflow which integrates the Immcantation Framework following BCR and TCR sequencing data analysis best practices. The Immcantation Framework is a comprehensive toolset, which allows the processing of bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq data from raw read processing to clonal inference. nf-core/airrflow is written in Nextflow and is part of the nf-core project, which collects community contributed and curated Nextflow workflows for a wide variety of analysis tasks. We assessed the performance of nf-core/airrflow on simulated sequencing data with sequencing errors and show example results with real datasets. To demonstrate the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to the high-throughput processing of large AIRR-seq datasets, we validated and extended previously reported findings of convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing 97 COVID-19 infected individuals and 99 healthy controls, including a mixture of bulk and single-cell sequencing datasets. Using this dataset, we extended the convergence findings to 20 additional subjects, highlighting the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to validate findings in small in-house cohorts with reanalysis of large publicly available AIRR datasets.

                Introduction Amid changing social dynamics, the world of higher education faces, among other challenges, the growing impact on the mental health of students. In this scenario, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) highlights the important role of autonomy support as it generates positive effects on students' motivation and well-being. Methods The present study tests the predictive capacity of the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support in a higher education institution, in relation to the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, autonomous motivation and depressive symptoms. A sample composed of 356 Spanish university students of which 237 were male (66.57%) from different grades and courses, aged between 17 and 57 years (M = 20.83; SD = 3.44), from middle socioeconomic strata, was used, and selected through purposive sampling. Results After the analysis of structural equations, the results showed that the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support positively predicted the satisfaction of basic psychological needs and this the autonomous motivation; but negatively depressive symptoms. Conclusions The model describes the possible importance of promoting the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support in higher education as a protective factor for well-being and mental health. These findings highlight the importance of motivational strategies that higher education teachers must implement to promote student motivation and well-being.

                Background Renal blood flow (RBF) is regulated by an autonomic nervous system and is reduced in older adults. Massage has been previously found to increase blood flow. Objective This two-armed double-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the immediate effects of Thai foot massage (TFM) on RBF, psychological stress, and heart rate variability (HRV) in older adult persons. Material and Methods The 26 healthy older adult volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to the TFM group (13 persons) and the control group (13 persons). The TFM group received a 15-minute Thai foot massage, and the control group received a 15-minute bed rest. Primary outcomes – RBF parameters [peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), resistive index (RI), volumetric arterial blood flow (VF)] and secondary outcomes – HRV parameters [standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), and low frequency per high frequency (LF/HF)] were measured after each intervention. Results Results showed that the VF significantly increased after TFM (P < 0.05) but not in control. Meanwhile, the stress index significantly reduced after TFM (P < 0.05). SDNN and RMSSD, the proxies of parasympathetic activity, also significantly increased in the TFM group (p < 0.05). Only RMSSD was significantly enhanced in the control group. No side effects were observed. Conclusion The TFM could increase RBF and alleviate psychological stress through parasympathetic activity actuation. Therefore, this intervention might improve RBF and relieve stress in the older population. Further study should be carried out on a larger population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-830/v3?src=rss">UKB.COVID19: an R package for UK Biobank COVID-19 data processing and analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic with a rapidly developing global health and economic crisis. Variations in the disease have been observed and have been associated with the genomic sequence of either the human host or the pathogen. Worldwide scientists scrambled initially to recruit patient cohorts to try and identify risk factors. A resource that presented itself early on was the UK Biobank (UKBB), which is investigating the respective contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to the development of disease. To enable COVID-19 studies, UKBB is now receiving COVID-19 test data for their participants every two weeks. In addition, UKBB is delivering more frequent updates of death and hospital inpatient data (including critical care admissions) on the UKBB Data Portal. This frequently changing dataset requires a tool that can rapidly process and analyse up-to-date data. We developed an R package specifically for the UKBB COVID-19 data, which summarises COVID-19 test results, performs association tests between COVID-19 susceptibility/severity and potential risk factors such as age, sex, blood type, comorbidities and generates input files for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By applying the R package to data released in April 2021, we found that age, body mass index, socioeconomic status and smoking are positively associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. Males are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than females. People staying in aged care homes have a higher chance of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. By performing GWAS, we replicated the 3p21.31 genetic finding for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The ability to iteratively perform such analyses is highly relevant since the UKBB data is updated frequently. As a caveat, users must arrange their own access to the UKBB data to use the R package.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-837/v1?src=rss">Analysis of the dynamics of transition from non-colonization to colonization and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in hemodialysis patients using Markov models. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hemodialysis patients are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to severe infections with high mortality rates. However, little is known about transition from non-colonization to colonization or bacteremia over time. The aim was to analyze the behavior of S. aureus colonization, identifying the probability of transition from non-colonized to colonized state or bacteremia, and the influence of some covariates. Methods The study was conducted in a dialysis unit associated with a high complexity hospital in Medellín between October 2017 and October 2019. An initial measurement was taken to evaluate S. aureus colonization, and follow-up measurements were performed 2 and 6 months later. Bacteremia evolution was monitored for 12 months. A two-state recurrent continuous-time Markov model was constructed to model transition dynamics from non-colonization to S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients. Subsequently, the model was applied to a third state of bacteremia. Results Of 178 patients on hemodialysis, 30.3% were colonized by S. aureus. Transition intensity from non-colonization to colonization was three times higher (0.21; CI: 0.14-0.29) than from colonization to non-colonization (0.07; CI: 0.05-0.11). The colonization risk increased in patients with previous infections (HR: 2.28; CI: 0.78-6.68), hospitalization (HR: 1.29; CI: 0.56-2.99) and antibiotics consumption (HR: 1.17; CI: 0.53-2.58). Mean non-colonized state duration was 10.9 months, while in the colonized state was 5.2 months. In the 3-state model, it was found that patients colonized were more likely to develop S. aureus infection (13.9%). Conclusion A more likely transition from non-colonization to colonization was found, which increases with factors such as previous infection. In addition, the development of bacteremia was more likely in colonized than in non-colonized patients. These results underline the importance of surveillance and proper management of S. aureus colonization to prevent serious complications, such as bacteremia, and improve prognosis in this vulnerable population.
