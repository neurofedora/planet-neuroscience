              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00664">Video-based Analysis Reveals Atypical Social Gaze in People with Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a quantitative and comprehensive analysis of social gaze in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Diverging from traditional first-person camera perspectives based on eye-tracking technologies, this study utilizes a third-person perspective database from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd Edition (ADOS-2) interview videos, encompassing ASD participants and neurotypical individuals as a reference group. Employing computational models, we extracted and processed gaze-related features from the videos of both participants and examiners. The experimental samples were divided into three groups based on the presence of social gaze abnormalities and ASD diagnosis. This study quantitatively analyzed four gaze features: gaze engagement, gaze variance, gaze density map, and gaze diversion frequency. Furthermore, we developed a classifier trained on these features to identify gaze abnormalities in ASD participants. Together, we demonstrated the effectiveness of analyzing social gaze in people with ASD in naturalistic settings, showcasing the potential of third-person video perspectives in enhancing ASD diagnosis through gaze analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01280">Real-Time Machine Learning Strategies for a New Kind of Neuroscience Experiments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function and dysfunctions of neural systems are tied to the temporal evolution of neural states. The current limitations in showing their causal role stem largely from the absence of tools capable of probing the brain's internal state in real-time. This gap restricts the scope of experiments vital for advancing both fundamental and clinical neuroscience. Recent advances in real-time machine learning technologies, particularly in analyzing neural time series as nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems, are beginning to bridge this gap. These technologies enable immediate interpretation of and interaction with neural systems, offering new insights into neural computation. However, several significant challenges remain. Issues such as slow convergence rates, high-dimensional data complexities, structured noise, non-identifiability, and a general lack of inductive biases tailored for neural dynamics are key hurdles. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for the full realization of real-time neural data analysis for the causal investigation of neural computation and advanced perturbation based brain machine interfaces. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive perspective on the current state of the field, focusing on these persistent issues and outlining potential paths forward. We emphasize the importance of large-scale integrative neuroscience initiatives and the role of meta-learning in overcoming these challenges. These approaches represent promising research directions that could redefine the landscape of neuroscience experiments and brain-machine interfaces, facilitating breakthroughs in understanding brain function, and treatment of neurological disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01368">Quantum panprotopsychism and the structure and subject-summing combination problem</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we have shown that an ontology of quantum mechanics in terms of states and events with internal phenomenal aspects, that is, a form of panprotopsychism, is well suited to explaining the phenomenal aspects of consciousness. We have proved there that the palette and grain combination problems of panpsychism and panprotopsychism arise from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics about supervenience that are inappropriate at the quantum level, where an exponential number of emergent properties and states arise. In this article, we address what is probably the first and most important combination problem of panpsychism: the subject-summing problem originally posed by William James. We begin by identifying the physical counterparts of the subjects of experience within the quantum panprotopsychic approach presented in that article. To achieve this, we turn to the notion of subject of experience inspired by the idea of prehension proposed by Whitehead and show that this notion can be adapted to the quantum ontology of objects and events. Due to the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics and its causal openness, this ontology also seems to be suitable for the analysis of the remaining aspects of the structure combination problem, which shows how the structuration of consciousness could have evolved from primitive animals to humans. The analysis imposes conditions on possible implementations of quantum cognition mechanisms in the brain and suggests new problems and strategies to address them. In particular, with regard to the structuring of experiences in animals with different degrees of evolutionary development.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01638">Deep multivariate autoencoder for capturing complexity in Brain Structure and Behaviour Relationships</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: <div><p>Diffusion MRI is a powerful tool that serves as a bridge between brain microstructure and cognition. Recent advancements in cognitive neuroscience have highlighted the persistent challenge of understanding how individual differences in brain structure influence behavior, especially in healthy people. While traditional linear models like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) have been fundamental in this analysis, they face limitations, particularly with high-dimensional data analysis outside the training sample. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach using deep learninga multivariate autoencoder model-to explore the complex non-linear relationships between brain microstructure and cognitive functions. The model's architecture involves separate encoder modules for brain structure and cognitive data, with a shared decoder, facilitating the analysis of multivariate patterns across these domains. Both encoders were trained simultaneously, before the decoder, to ensure a good latent representation that captures the phenomenon. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, our study centres on the insula's role in cognitive processes. Through rigorous validation, including 5 sample analyses for out-of-sample analysis, our results demonstrate that the multivariate autoencoder model outperforms traditional methods in capturing and generalizing correlations between brain and behavior beyond the training sample. These findings underscore the potential of deep learning models to enhance our understanding of brain-behavior relationships in cognitive neuroscience, offering more accurate and comprehensive insights despite the complexities inherent in neuroimaging studies.</p></div>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01767">Anti-seizure medication load is not correlated with early termination of seizure spread</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are the mainstay of treatment for epilepsy, yet their effect on seizure spread is not fully understood. Higher ASM doses have been associated with shorter and less severe seizures. Our objective was to test if this effect was due to limiting seizure spread through early termination of otherwise unchanged seizures.
  We retrospectively examined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in 15 subjects that underwent ASM tapering during pre-surgical monitoring. We estimated ASM plasma concentrations based on pharmaco-kinetic modelling. In each subject, we identified seizures that followed the same onset and initial spread patterns, but some seizures terminated early (truncated seizures), and other seizures continued to spread (continuing seizures). We compared ASM concentrations at the times of truncated seizures and continuing seizures.
  We found no substantial difference between ASM concentrations when truncated vs. continuing seizures occurred (Mean difference = 4%, sd = 29%, p=0.6).
  Our results indicate that ASM did not appear to halt established seizures in this cohort. Further research is needed to understand how ASM may modulate seizure duration and severity.

                arXiv:2409.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the mysteries of the human brain is a long-term research topic in neuroscience. With the help of deep learning, decoding visual information from human brain activity fMRI has achieved promising performance. However, these decoding models require centralized storage of fMRI data to conduct training, leading to potential privacy security issues. In this paper, we focus on privacy preservation in multi-individual brain visual decoding. To this end, we introduce a novel framework called FedMinds, which utilizes federated learning to protect individuals' privacy during model training. In addition, we deploy individual adapters for each subject, thus allowing personalized visual decoding. We conduct experiments on the authoritative NSD datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves high-precision visual decoding along with privacy protection.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02065">Anatomical Connections of Primate Mediodorsal and Motor Thalamic Nuclei with the Cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-sensory thalamic nuclei interact with the cortex through thalamocortical and cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops. Reciprocal connections between the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and the prefrontal cortex are particularly important in cognition, while the reciprocal connections of the ventromedial (VM), ventral anterior (VA), and ventrolateral (VL) thalamus with the prefrontal and motor cortex are necessary for sensorimotor information processing. However, limited and often oversimplified understanding of the connectivity of the MD, VA, and VL nuclei in primates have hampered development of accurate models that explain their contribution to cognitive and sensorimotor functions. The current prevalent view suggests that the MD connects with the prefrontal cortex, while the VA and VL primarily connect with the premotor and motor cortices. However, past studies have also reported diverse connections that enable these nuclei to integrate information across a multitude of brain systems. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the anatomical connectivity of the primate MD, VA, and VL with the cortex. By synthesizing recent findings, we aim to offer a valuable resource for students, newcomers to the field, and experts developing new theories or models of thalamic function. Our review highlights the complexity of these connections and underscores the need for further research to fully understand the diverse roles of these thalamic nuclei in primates.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00003">Cognitive Networks and Performance Drive fMRI-Based State Classification Using DNN Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.00003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) models have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains, yet their application in cognitive neuroscience is limited due to their lack of interpretability. In this study we employ two structurally different and complementary DNN-based models, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM), to classify individual cognitive states from fMRI BOLD data, with a focus on understanding the cognitive underpinnings of the classification decisions. We show that despite the architectural differences, both models consistently produce a robust relationship between prediction accuracy and individual cognitive performance, such that low performance leads to poor prediction accuracy. To achieve model explainability, we used permutation techniques to calculate feature importance, allowing us to identify the most critical brain regions influencing model predictions. Across models, we found the dominance of visual networks, suggesting that task-driven state differences are primarily encoded in visual processing. Attention and control networks also showed relatively high importance, however, default mode and temporal-parietal networks demonstrated negligible contribution in differentiating cognitive states. Additionally, we observed individual trait-based effects and subtle model-specific differences, such that 1D-CNN showed slightly better overall performance, while BiLSTM showed better sensitivity for individual behavior; these initial findings require further research and robustness testing to be fully established. Our work underscores the importance of explainable DNN models in uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive state transitions, providing a foundation for future work in this domain.

                arXiv:2409.00412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perceptions and actions, thoughts and memories result from coordinated activity in hundreds or even thousands of neurons in the brain. It is an old dream of the physics community to provide a statistical mechanics description for these and other emergent phenomena of life. These aspirations appear in a new light because of developments in our ability to measure the electrical activity of the brain, sampling thousands of individual neurons simultaneously over hours or days. We review the progress that has been made in bringing theory and experiment together, focusing on maximum entropy methods and a phenomenological renormalization group. These approaches have uncovered new, quantitatively reproducible collective behaviors in networks of real neurons, and provide examples of rich parameter--free predictions that agree in detail with experiment.

Abstract: GABAergic interneurons can be subdivided into three subclasses: parvalbumin positive (PV), somatostatin positive (SOM) and serotonin positive neurons. With principal cells (PCs) they form complex networks. We examine PCs and PV responses in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and barrel cortex (S1) upon PV photostimulation in vivo. In layer 5, the PV response is paradoxical: photoexcitation reduces their activity. This is not the case in ALM layer 2/3. We combine analytical calculations and numerical simulations to investigate how these results constrain the architecture. Two-population models cannot account for the results. Networks with three inhibitory populations and V1-like architecture account for the data in ALM layer 2/3. Our data in layer 5 can be accounted for if SOM neurons receive inputs only from PCs and PV neurons. In both four-population models, the paradoxical effect implies not too strong recurrent excitation. It is not evidence for stabilization by inhibition.

                arXiv:2404.17128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How intelligence emerges from living beings has been a fundamental question in neuroscience. However, it remains largely unanswered due to the complex neuronal dynamics and intricate connections between neurons in real neural systems. To address this challenge, we leveraged the largest available adult Drosophila connectome data set, and constructed a comprehensive computational framework based on simplified neuronal activation mechanisms to simulate the observed activation behavior within the connectome. The results revealed that even with rudimentary neuronal activation mechanisms, models grounded in real neural network structures can generate activation patterns strikingly similar to those observed in the actual brain. A significant discovery was the consistency of activation patterns across various neuronal dynamic models. This consistency, achieved with the same network structure, underscores the pivotal role of network topology in neural information processing. These results challenge the prevailing view that solely relies on neuron count or complex individual neuron dynamics. Further analysis demonstrated a near-complete separation of the visual and olfactory systems at the network level. Moreover, we found that the network distance, rather than spatial distance, is the primary determinant of activation patterns. Additionally, our experiments revealed that a reconnect rate of at least 0.1% was sufficient to disrupt the previously observed activation patterns. We also observed synergistic effects between the brain hemispheres: Even with unilateral input stimuli, visual-related neurons in both hemispheres were activated, highlighting the importance of interhemispheric communication. These findings emphasize the crucial role of network structure in neural activation and offer novel insights into the fundamental principles governing brain functionality.

Abstract: Understanding cognitive processes in the brain demands sophisticated models capable of replicating neural dynamics at large scales. We present a physiologically inspired speech recognition architecture, compatible and scalable with deep learning frameworks, and demonstrate that end-to-end gradient descent training leads to the emergence of neural oscillations in the central spiking neural network. Significant cross-frequency couplings, indicative of these oscillations, are measured within and across network layers during speech processing, whereas no such interactions are observed when handling background noise inputs. Furthermore, our findings highlight the crucial inhibitory role of feedback mechanisms, such as spike frequency adaptation and recurrent connections, in regulating and synchronising neural activity to improve recognition performance. Overall, on top of developing our understanding of synchronisation phenomena notably observed in the human auditory pathway, our architecture exhibits dynamic and efficient information processing, with relevance to neuromorphic technology.

Abstract: Scale invariance profoundly influences the dynamics and structure of complex systems, spanning from critical phenomena to network architecture. Here, we propose a precise definition of scale-invariant networks by leveraging the concept of a constant entropy loss rate across scales in a renormalization-group coarse-graining setting. This framework enables us to differentiate between scale-free and scale-invariant networks, revealing distinct characteristics within each class. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive inventory of genuinely scale-invariant networks, both natural and artificially constructed, demonstrating, e.g., that the human connectome exhibits notable features of scale invariance. Our findings open new avenues for exploring the scale-invariant structural properties crucial in biological and socio-technological systems.

                arXiv:2409.01762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invasive cortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can significantly improve the life quality of motor-impaired patients. Nonetheless, externally mounted pedestals pose an infection risk, which calls for fully implanted systems. Such systems, however, must meet strict latency and energy constraints while providing reliable decoding performance. While recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) are ideally suited for ultra-low-power, low-latency processing on neuromorphic hardware, it is unclear whether they meet the above requirements. To address this question, we trained RSNNs to decode finger velocity from cortical spike trains (CSTs) of two macaque monkeys. First, we found that a large RSNN model outperformed existing feedforward spiking neural networks (SNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in terms of their decoding accuracy. We next developed a tiny RSNN with a smaller memory footprint, low firing rates, and sparse connectivity. Despite its reduced computational requirements, the resulting model performed substantially better than existing SNN and ANN decoders. Our results thus demonstrate that RSNNs offer competitive CST decoding performance under tight resource constraints and are promising candidates for fully implanted ultra-low-power BMIs with the potential to revolutionize patient care.

                arXiv:2409.01969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory to analyze how structure in connectivity shapes the high-dimensional, internally generated activity of nonlinear recurrent neural networks. Using two complementary methods -- a path-integral calculation of fluctuations around the saddle point, and a recently introduced two-site cavity approach -- we derive analytic expressions that characterize important features of collective activity, including its dimensionality and temporal correlations. To model structure in the coupling matrices of real neural circuits, such as synaptic connectomes obtained through electron microscopy, we introduce the random-mode model, which parameterizes a coupling matrix using random input and output modes and a specified spectrum. This model enables systematic study of the effects of low-dimensional structure in connectivity on neural activity. These effects manifest in features of collective activity, that we calculate, and can be undetectable when analyzing only single-neuron activities. We derive a relation between the effective rank of the coupling matrix and the dimension of activity. By extending the random-mode model, we compare the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low-dimensional connectivity. We also investigate the impact of structured overlaps between input and output modes, a feature of biological coupling matrices. Our theory provides tools to relate neural-network architecture and collective dynamics in artificial and biological systems.

Abstract: This study focuses on EEG-based BMI for detecting voluntary keystrokes, aiming to develop a reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) to simulate and anticipate keystrokes, especially for individuals with motor impairments. The methodology includes extensive segmentation, event alignment, ERP plot analysis, and signal analysis. Different deep learning models are trained to classify EEG data into three categories -- `resting state' (0), `d' key press (1), and `l' key press (2). Real-time keypress simulation based on neural activity is enabled through integration with a tkinter-based graphical user interface. Feature engineering utilized ERP windows, and the SVC model achieved 90.42% accuracy in event classification. Additionally, deep learning models -- MLP (89% accuracy), Catboost (87.39% accuracy), KNN (72.59%), Gaussian Naive Bayes (79.21%), Logistic Regression (90.81% accuracy), and a novel Bi-Directional LSTM-GRU hybrid model (89% accuracy) -- were developed for BCI keyboard simulation. Finally, a GUI was created to predict and simulate keystrokes using the trained MLP model.

                arXiv:2409.00021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophic interference, the loss of previously learned information when learning new information, remains a major challenge in machine learning. Since living organisms do not seem to suffer from this problem, researchers have taken inspiration from biology to improve memory retention in artificial intelligence systems. However, previous attempts to use bio-inspired mechanisms have typically resulted in systems that rely on task boundary information during training and/or explicit task identification during inference, information that is not available in real-world scenarios. Here, we show that neuro-inspired mechanisms such as synaptic consolidation and metaplasticity can mitigate catastrophic interference in a spiking neural network, using only synapse-local information, with no need for task awareness, and with a fixed memory size that does not need to be increased when training on new tasks. Our model, TACOS, combines neuromodulation with complex synaptic dynamics to enable new learning while protecting previous information. We evaluate TACOS on sequential image recognition tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing catastrophic interference. Our results show that TACOS outperforms existing regularization techniques in domain-incremental learning scenarios. We also report the results of an ablation study to elucidate the contribution of each neuro-inspired mechanism separately.

Abstract: Recent deep neural networks (DNNs), such as diffusion models [1], have faced high computational demands. Thus, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted lots of attention as energy-efficient neural networks. However, conventional spiking neurons, such as leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, cannot accurately represent complex non-linear activation functions, such as Swish [2]. To approximate activation functions with spiking neurons, few spikes (FS) neurons were proposed [3], but the approximation performance was limited due to the lack of training methods considering the neurons. Thus, we propose tendency-based parameter initialization (TBPI) to enhance the approximation of activation function with FS neurons, exploiting temporal dependencies initializing the training parameters.

                arXiv:2409.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized search heuristics (RHSs) are generally believed to be robust to noise. However, almost all mathematical analyses on how RSHs cope with a noisy access to the objective function assume that each solution is re-evaluated whenever it is compared to others. This is unfortunate, both because it wastes computational resources and because it requires the user to foresee that noise is present (as in a noise-free setting, one would never re-evaluate solutions).
  In this work, we show the need for re-evaluations could be overestimated, and in fact, detrimental. For the classic benchmark problem of how the $(1+1)$ evolutionary algorithm optimizes the LeadingOnes benchmark, we show that without re-evaluations up to constant noise rates can be tolerated, much more than the $O(n^{-2} \log n)$ noise rates that can be tolerated when re-evaluating solutions.
  This first runtime analysis of an evolutionary algorithm solving a single-objective noisy problem without re-evaluations could indicate that such algorithms cope with noise much better than previously thought, and without the need to foresee the presence of noise.

Abstract: In the present paper, I describe a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture which, can be used in wide range of supervised learning classification tasks. It is assumed, that all participating signals (the classified object description, correct class label and SNN decision) have spiking nature. The distinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical network structures corresponding to different classes and significantly distinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing populations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature is a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. The plasticity rules are local and do not use the backpropagation principle. Besides that, as in my previous studies, I was guided by the requirement that the all neuron/plasticity models should be easily implemented on modern neurochips. I illustrate the high performance of my network on the MNIST benchmark.

Abstract: Artificial swarm systems have been extensively studied and used in computer science, robotics, engineering and other technological fields, primarily as a platform for implementing robust distributed systems to achieve pre-defined objectives. However, such swarm systems, especially heterogeneous ones, can also be utilized as an ideal platform for creating *open-ended evolutionary dynamics* that do not converge toward pre-defined goals but keep exploring diverse possibilities and generating novel outputs indefinitely. In this article, we review Swarm Chemistry and its variants as concrete sample cases to illustrate beneficial characteristics of heterogeneous swarm systems, including the cardinality leap of design spaces, multiscale structures/behaviors and their diversity, and robust self-organization, self-repair and ecological interactions of emergent patterns, all of which serve as the driving forces for open-ended evolutionary processes. Applications to science, engineering, and art/entertainment as well as the directions of further research are also discussed.

Abstract: Human intelligence emerged through the process of natural selection and evolution on Earth. We investigate what it would take to re-create this process in silico. While past work has often focused on low-level processes (such as simulating physics or chemistry), we instead take a more targeted approach, aiming to evolve agents that can accumulate open-ended culture and technologies across generations. Towards this, we present JaxLife: an artificial life simulator in which embodied agents, parameterized by deep neural networks, must learn to survive in an expressive world containing programmable systems. First, we describe the environment and show that it can facilitate meaningful Turing-complete computation. We then analyze the evolved emergent agents' behavior, such as rudimentary communication protocols, agriculture, and tool use. Finally, we investigate how complexity scales with the amount of compute used. We believe JaxLife takes a step towards studying evolved behavior in more open-ended simulations.

                arXiv:2409.01446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In landscape-aware algorithm selection problem, the effectiveness of feature-based predictive models strongly depends on the representativeness of training data for practical applications. In this work, we investigate the potential of randomly generated functions (RGF) for the model training, which cover a much more diverse set of optimization problem classes compared to the widely-used black-box optimization benchmarking (BBOB) suite. Correspondingly, we focus on automated algorithm configuration (AAC), that is, selecting the best suited algorithm and fine-tuning its hyperparameters based on the landscape features of problem instances. Precisely, we analyze the performance of dense neural network (NN) models in handling the multi-output mixed regression and classification tasks using different training data sets, such as RGF and many-affine BBOB (MA-BBOB) functions. Based on our results on the BBOB functions in 5d and 20d, near optimal configurations can be identified using the proposed approach, which can most of the time outperform the off-the-shelf default configuration considered by practitioners with limited knowledge about AAC. Furthermore, the predicted configurations are competitive against the single best solver in many cases. Overall, configurations with better performance can be best identified by using NN models trained on a combination of RGF and MA-BBOB functions.

                arXiv:2407.14202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduced the Scorpion Hunting Strategy (SHS), a novel population-based, nature-inspired optimisation algorithm. This algorithm draws inspiration from the hunting strategy of scorpions, which identify, locate, and capture their prey using the alpha and beta vibration operators. These operators control the SHS algorithm's exploitation and exploration abilities. To formulate an optimisation method, we mathematically simulate these dynamic events and behaviors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the SHS algorithm by employing 20 benchmark functions (including 10 conventional and 10 CEC2020 functions), using both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Through a comparative analysis with 12 state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms, we demonstrate that the proposed SHS algorithm yields exceptionally promising results. These findings are further supported by statistically significant results obtained through the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Additionally, the ranking of SHS, as determined by the average rank derived from the Friedman test, positions it at the forefront when compared to other algorithms. Going beyond theoretical validation, we showcase the practical utility of the SHS algorithm by applying it to six distinct real-world optimisation tasks. These applications illustrate the algorithm's potential in addressing complex optimisation challenges. In summary, this work not only introduces the innovative SHS algorithm but also substantiates its effectiveness and versatility through rigorous benchmarking and real-world problem-solving scenarios.

Abstract: Despite the abundance of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR), its heterogeneity restricts the utilization of medical data in building predictive models. To address this challenge, we propose Universal Healthcare Predictive Framework (UniHPF), which requires no medical domain knowledge and minimal pre-processing for multiple prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that UniHPF is capable of building large-scale EHR models that can process any form of medical data from distinct EHR systems. We believe that our findings can provide helpful insights for further research on the multi-source learning of EHRs.

Abstract: In this paper, we comprehensively study the inductive biases of two major approaches to augmenting Transformers with a recurrent mechanism: (1) the approach of incorporating a depth-wise recurrence similar to Universal Transformers; and (2) the approach of incorporating a chunk-wise temporal recurrence like Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Furthermore, we propose and investigate novel ways to extend and combine the above methods - for example, we propose a global mean-based dynamic halting mechanism for Universal Transformers and an augmentation of Temporal Latent Bottleneck with elements from Universal Transformer. We compare the models and probe their inductive biases in several diagnostic tasks, such as Long Range Arena (LRA), flip-flop language modeling, ListOps, and Logical Inference.

                arXiv:2407.09950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is the technology-driven process of identifying and categorizing human emotions from various data sources, such as facial expressions, voice patterns, body motion, and physiological signals, such as EEG. These physiological indicators, though rich in data, present challenges due to their complexity and variability, necessitating sophisticated feature selection and extraction methods. NGN, an unsupervised learning algorithm, effectively adapts to input spaces without predefined grid structures, improving feature extraction from physiological data. Furthermore, the incorporation of fuzzy logic enables the handling of fuzzy data by introducing reasoning that mimics human decision-making. The combination of PSO with XGBoost aids in optimizing model performance through efficient hyperparameter tuning and decision process optimization. This study explores the integration of Neural-Gas Network (NGN), XGBoost, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and fuzzy logic to enhance emotion recognition using physiological signals. Our research addresses three critical questions concerning the improvement of XGBoost with PSO and fuzzy logic, NGN's effectiveness in feature selection, and the performance comparison of the PSO-fuzzy XGBoost classifier with standard benchmarks. Acquired results indicate that our methodologies enhance the accuracy of emotion recognition systems and outperform other feature selection techniques using the majority of classifiers, offering significant implications for both theoretical advancement and practical application in emotion recognition technology.

                arXiv:2407.14073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant research attention in the last decade due to their potential to drive resource-constrained edge devices. Though existing SNN accelerators offer high efficiency in processing sparse spikes with dense weights, opportunities are less explored in SNNs with sparse weights, i.e., dual-sparsity. In this work, we study the acceleration of dual-sparse SNNs, focusing on their core operation, sparse-matrix-sparse-matrix multiplication (spMspM). We observe that naively running a dual-sparse SNN on existing spMspM accelerators designed for dual-sparse Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibits sub-optimal efficiency. The main challenge is that processing timesteps, a natural property of SNNs, introduces an extra loop to ANN spMspM, leading to longer latency and more memory traffic. To address the problem, we propose a fully temporal-parallel (FTP) dataflow, which minimizes both data movement across timesteps and the end-to-end latency of dual-sparse SNNs. To maximize the efficiency of FTP dataflow, we propose an FTP-friendly spike compression mechanism that efficiently compresses single-bit spikes and ensures contiguous memory access. We further propose an FTP-friendly inner-join circuit that can lower the cost of the expensive prefix-sum circuits with almost no throughput penalty. All the above techniques for FTP dataflow are encapsulated in LoAS, a Low-latency inference Accelerator for dual-sparse SNNs. With FTP dataflow, compression, and inner-join, running dual-sparse SNN workloads on LoAS demonstrates significant speedup (up to $8.51\times$) and energy reduction (up to $3.68\times$) compared to running it on prior dual-sparse accelerators.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from animal navigation strategies, we introduce a novel computational model for navigation and mapping, rooted in biologically inspired principles. Animals exhibit remarkable navigation abilities by efficiently using memory, imagination, and strategic decision-making to navigate complex and aliased environments. Building on these insights, we integrate traditional cognitive mapping approaches with an Active Inference Framework (AIF) to learn an environment structure in a few steps. Through the incorporation of topological mapping for long-term memory and AIF for navigation planning and structure learning, our model can dynamically apprehend environmental structures and expand its internal map with predicted beliefs during exploration. Comparative experiments with the Clone-Structured Graph (CSCG) model highlight our model's ability to rapidly learn environmental structures in a single episode, with minimal navigation overlap. this is achieved without prior knowledge of the dimensions of the environment or the type of observations, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in navigating ambiguous environments.

                <p>Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons provide direct input into several brain regions, including the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which is important for image-forming vision, and the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), which is associated with nonimage-forming vision. Through both activity- and morphogen-dependent mechanisms, retinal inputs play important roles in the development of dLGN, including the refinement of retinal projections, morphological development of thalamocortical relay cells (TRCs), timing of corticogeniculate innervation, and recruitment and distribution of inhibitory interneurons. In contrast, little is known about the role of retinal inputs in the development of vLGN. Grossly, vLGN is divided into two domains, the retinorecipient external vLGN (vLGNe) and nonretinorecipient internal vLGN (vLGNi). Studies previously found that vLGNe consists of transcriptionally distinct GABAergic subtypes distributed into at least four adjacent laminae. At present, it remains unclear whether retinal inputs influence the development of these cell-type&ndash;specific neuronal laminae in vLGNe. Here, we elucidated the developmental timeline for these laminae in the mouse vLGNe, and results indicate that these laminae are specified at or before birth. We observed that mutant mice without retinal inputs have a normal laminar distribution of GABAergic cells at birth; however, after the first week of postnatal development, these mutants exhibited a dramatic disruption in the laminar organization of inhibitory neurons and clear boundaries between vLGNe and vLGNi. Overall, our results show that while the formation of cell-type&ndash;specific layers in mouse vLGNe does not depend on RGC inputs, retinal signals are critical for their maintenance.</p>

                Background White spot lesions (WSLs) are frequently linked with low microhardness and mineral content changes. several strategies have been employed to deal with these problems. This investigation aimed to analyze the microhardness and mineral content changes after remineralization with bioactive glass (BAG) and casein phospho-peptide-amorphous calcium phosphate with fluoride (CPP-ACPF). Methods Twenty sound maxillary first premolars extracted were used to obtain a total of one hundred enamel samples. forty enamel slabs were split into four experimental groups (n = 10 each): Group I, BAG; Group II, BAG+CPP-ACPF; Group III, CPP-ACPF varnish; and Group IV, artificial saliva (negative control). To create artificial WSLs, all samples were preserved in a prepared demineralizing agent for 72 h before treatment with remineralizing agents. Vickers microhardness test was performed. Additionally, 60 enamel samples were selected for analysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and assigned to six experimental groups; the first four groups were similar to that used in the microhardness test along with Group V: WSLs, and Group VI: baseline. The statistical analyses employed in this study included Tukey’s HSD (p<0.05), one-way ANOVA, and Shapiro-Wilk. Result Regarding surface microhardness, the BAG+CPP-ACPF group showed the most favorable recovery, which was better than the outcomes of the BAG and CPP-ACPF groups. A statistically significant change (p <0.05) was not observed between them. Similarly, for mineral content change, the BAG+CPP-ACPF group demonstrated the greatest result, The BAG group came next, and the CPP-ACPF group came last. Conclusion The BAG+CPP-ACPF group might be regarded as the best course of treatment for enhancing both the surface microhardness and mineral content (Ca, P), while the control group (Artificial saliva) showed the least satisfactory results in comparison. After demineralization, mineral content and microhardness decreased in all samples. Therefore, BAG+CPP-ACPF significantly improved the surface microhardness and mineral content.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1003/v1?src=rss">The effects of new product quality choices and customer behavior on the in-house refurbishing model versus the outsourcing model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Refurbishing encompasses the process of collecting used products, refurbishing them into new ones, and offering them to consumers. Within this framework, manufacturers can opt for either in-house refurbishing, managed internally, or outsource these operations to third parties and retailers. Methods Our study also takes into account the limited supply of remanufacturable products and incorporates customer behavior distinctions, differentiating between high-end and low-end customers in our models. The primary aim of this research is to formulate and analyze models for in-house refurbishing, refurbishing outsourcing to third parties, and refurbishing outsourcing to retailers. We seek to identify optimal solutions, conduct a comprehensive analysis, and implement strategies to maximize benefits. Additionally, we compare the in-house refurbishing model with the outsourcing refurbishing model. Leveraging multivariable function optimization techniques alongside the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker method, we endeavor to ascertain the optimal strategy, thereby facilitating a nuanced and methodical examination of the intricate dynamics governing profitability and sustainability within the refurbishing sector. Results Our study has applied rigorous mathematical modeling and optimization methodologies to identify optimal configurations for each model, aiming to enhance profitability across diverse parameters, including product quantities, quality selections, and pricing strategies. Conclusions Our analysis underscores that the in-house refurbishing approach tends to yield superior profits for profit-oriented enterprises, whereas outsourcing refurbishing to retailers is conducive to meeting environmental sustainability goals. Furthermore, our investigation has considered pivotal factors such as the constrained availability of remanufacturable products and consumer behavior, with a particular emphasis on discerning preferences among high-end and low-end clientele. We also perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of parameter variations on optimal outcomes. Our findings yield three distinct refurbishing models: the in-house refurbishing model, suitable for profit-driven companies under specific production cost parameters, and the outsourcing refurbishing to retailers model, tailored for environmentally-conscious companies, contingent upon particular production cost parameters.

Revealing the relationship between neural network structure and function is one central theme of neuroscience. In the context of working memory (WM), anatomical data suggested that the topological structure of microcircuits within WM gradient network may differ, and the impact of such structural heterogeneity on WM activity remains unknown. Here, we proposed a spiking neural network model that can replicate the fundamental characteristics of WM: delay-period neural activity involves association cortex but not sensory cortex. First, experimentally observed receptor expression gradient along the WM gradient network is reproduced by our network model. Second, by analyzing the correlation between different local structures and duration of WM activity, we demonstrated that small-worldness, excitation-inhibition balance, and cycle structures play crucial roles in sustaining WM-related activity. To elucidate the relationship between the structure and functionality of neural networks, structural circuit gradients in brain should also be subject to further measurement. Finally, combining anatomical data, we simulated the duration of WM activity across different brain regions, its maintenance relies on the interaction between local and distributed networks. Overall, network structural gradient and interaction between local and distributed networks are of great significance for WM.

                <p>by Zhichao Zhu, Yang Qi, Wenlian Lu, Jianfeng Feng</p>

Neural activity in the cortex exhibits a wide range of firing variability and rich correlation structures. Studies on neural coding indicate that correlated neural variability can influence the quality of neural codes, either beneficially or adversely. However, the mechanisms by which correlated neural variability is transformed and processed across neural populations to achieve meaningful computation remain largely unclear. Here we propose a theory of covariance computation with spiking neurons which offers a unifying perspective on neural representation and computation with correlated noise. We employ a recently proposed computational framework known as the moment neural network to resolve the nonlinear coupling of correlated neural variability with a task-driven approach to constructing neural network models for performing covariance-based perceptual tasks. In particular, we demonstrate how perceptual information initially encoded entirely within the covariance of upstream neurons’ spiking activity can be passed, in a near-lossless manner, to the mean firing rate of downstream neurons, which in turn can be used to inform inference. The proposed theory of covariance computation addresses an important question of how the brain extracts perceptual information from noisy sensory stimuli to generate a stable perceptual whole and indicates a more direct role that correlated variability plays in cortical information processing.

                <p>by Laura Collesano, Marta Łuksza, Michael Lässig</p>

Molecules of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) present short protein fragments on the cell surface, an important step in T cell immune recognition. MHC-I molecules process peptides from intracellular proteins; MHC-II molecules act in antigen-presenting cells and present peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Here we show that the sequence-dependent energy landscapes of MHC-peptide binding encode class-specific nonlinearities (epistasis). MHC-I has a smooth landscape with global epistasis; the binding energy is a simple deformation of an underlying linear trait. This form of epistasis enhances the discrimination between strong-binding peptides. In contrast, MHC-II has a rugged landscape with idiosyncratic epistasis: binding depends on detailed amino acid combinations at multiple positions of the peptide sequence. The form of epistasis affects the learning of energy landscapes from training data. For MHC-I, a low-complexity problem, we derive a simple matrix model of binding energies that outperforms current models trained by machine learning. For MHC-II, higher complexity prevents learning by simple regression methods. Epistasis also affects the energy and fitness effects of mutations in antigen-derived peptides (epitopes). In MHC-I, large-effect mutations occur predominantly in anchor positions of strong-binding epitopes. In MHC-II, large effects depend on the background epitope sequence but are broadly distributed over the epitope, generating a bigger target for escape mutations due to loss of presentation. Together, our analysis shows how an energy landscape of protein-protein binding constrains the target of escape mutations from T cell immunity, linking the complexity of the molecular interactions to the dynamics of adaptive immune response.

                <p>by Yujin Goto, Keiichi Kitajo</p>

Understanding the mechanism by which the brain achieves relatively consistent information processing contrary to its inherent inconsistency in activity is one of the major challenges in neuroscience. Recently, it has been reported that the consistency of neural responses to stimuli that are presented repeatedly is enhanced implicitly in an unsupervised way, and results in improved perceptual consistency. Here, we propose the term "selective consistency" to describe this input-dependent consistency and hypothesize that it will be acquired in a self-organizing manner by plasticity within the neural system. To test this, we investigated whether a reservoir-based plastic model could acquire selective consistency to repeated stimuli. We used white noise sequences randomly generated in each trial and referenced white noise sequences presented multiple times. The results showed that the plastic network was capable of acquiring selective consistency rapidly, with as little as five exposures to stimuli, even for white noise. The acquisition of selective consistency could occur independently of performance optimization, as the network’s time-series prediction accuracy for referenced stimuli did not improve with repeated exposure and optimization. Furthermore, the network could only achieve selective consistency when in the region between order and chaos. These findings suggest that the neural system can acquire selective consistency in a self-organizing manner and that this may serve as a mechanism for certain types of learning.

Spatially nonlinear stimulus integration by retinal ganglion cells lies at the heart of various computations performed by the retina. It arises from the nonlinear transmission of signals that ganglion cells receive from bipolar cells, which thereby constitute functional subunits within a ganglion cell’s receptive field. Inferring these subunits from recorded ganglion cell activity promises a new avenue for studying the functional architecture of the retina. This calls for efficient methods, which leave sufficient experimental time to leverage the acquired knowledge for further investigating identified subunits. Here, we combine concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography and introduce super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) as a technique to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits. Simulations demonstrate that this approach can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations, and application in recordings of primate parasol ganglion cells validates the experimental feasibility. STR can potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within only a few tens of minutes of recording time, making it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings.

                <p>by Yanpeng Yang, Yanyi Zheng, Quan Zou, Jian Li, Hailin Feng</p>

The off-target activities within the CRISPR-Cas9 system remains a formidable barrier to its broader application and development. Recent advancements have highlighted the potential of deep learning models in predicting these off-target effects, yet they encounter significant hurdles including imbalances within datasets and the intricacies associated with encoding schemes and model architectures. To surmount these challenges, our study innovatively introduces an Efficiency and Specificity-Based (ESB) class rebalancing strategy, specifically devised for datasets featuring mismatches-only off-target instances, marking a pioneering approach in this realm. Furthermore, through a meticulous evaluation of various One-hot encoding schemes alongside numerous hybrid neural network models, we discern that encoding and models of moderate complexity ideally balance performance and efficiency. On this foundation, we advance a novel hybrid model, the CRISPR-MCA, which capitalizes on multi-feature extraction to enhance predictive accuracy. The empirical results affirm that the ESB class rebalancing strategy surpasses five conventional methods in addressing extreme dataset imbalances, demonstrating superior efficacy and broader applicability across diverse models. Notably, the CRISPR-MCA model excels in off-target effect prediction across four distinct mismatches-only datasets and significantly outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art models in datasets comprising both mismatches and indels. In summation, the CRISPR-MCA model, coupled with the ESB rebalancing strategy, offers profound insights and a robust framework for future explorations in this field.

                <p>by Kath Nicholls, Paul D. W. Kirk, Chris Wallace</p>

Clustering is widely used in bioinformatics and many other fields, with applications from exploratory analysis to prediction. Many types of data have associated uncertainty or measurement error, but this is rarely used to inform the clustering. We present Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPMUnc), an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm which makes use of the uncertainty associated with data points. We show that DPMUnc out-performs existing methods on simulated data. We cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS summary statistics, which have uncertainty linked with the sample size of the study. DPMUnc separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. We additionally consider how DPMUnc can be used to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarised using gene signatures. We first introduce a novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different to the one where it was discovered, which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual. We summarise three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures. We find association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc, with clustering structure replicated across the datasets. The significance of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we demonstrate that when data has associated uncertainty, this uncertainty should be used to inform clustering and we present a method which does this, DPMUnc. Secondly, we present a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined. We show the value of this procedure by summarising gene expression data from patients with immune-mediated diseases using relevant gene signatures, and clustering these patients using DPMUnc.

                <p>by Anis Ur Rahman, Gleb Tikhonov, Jari Oksanen, Tuomas Rossi, Otso Ovaskainen</p>

Joint species distribution modelling (JSDM) is a widely used statistical method that analyzes combined patterns of all species in a community, linking empirical data to ecological theory and enhancing community-wide prediction tasks. However, fitting JSDMs to large datasets is often computationally demanding and time-consuming. Recent studies have introduced new statistical and machine learning techniques to provide more scalable fitting algorithms, but extending these to complex JSDM structures that account for spatial dependencies or multi-level sampling designs remains challenging. In this study, we aim to enhance JSDM scalability by leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) resources for an existing fitting method. Our work focuses on the Hmsc R-package, a widely used JSDM framework that supports the integration of various dataset types into a single comprehensive model. We developed a GPU-compatible implementation of its model-fitting algorithm using Python and the TensorFlow library. Despite these changes, our enhanced framework retains the original user interface of the Hmsc R-package. We evaluated the performance of the proposed implementation across various model configurations and dataset sizes. Our results show a significant increase in model fitting speed for most models compared to the baseline Hmsc R-package. For the largest datasets, we achieved speed-ups of over 1000 times, demonstrating the substantial potential of GPU porting for previously CPU-bound JSDM software. This advancement opens promising opportunities for better utilizing the rapidly accumulating new biodiversity data resources for inference and prediction.

                <p>by Annika Schmidt, Marion Forano, Arne Sachtler, Davide Calzolari, Bernhard M. Weber, David W. Franklin, Alin Albu-Schäffer</p>

Activities like ball bouncing and trampoline jumping showcase the human ability to intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that the system prefers intrinsically. This human sensitivity to resonance has been experimentally supported for interactions with simple linear systems but remains a challenge to validate in more complex scenarios where nonlinear dynamics cannot be predicted analytically. However, it has been found that many nonlinear systems exhibit periodic orbits similar to the eigenmodes of linear systems. These nonlinear normal modes (NNM) are computable with a recently developed numerical <i>mode tool</i>. The goal was to compare the motions that humans excite in nonlinear systems with the predicted NNM of the energy-conservative systems. In a user study consisting of three experiment parts, participants commanded differently configured virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick. The task was to alternately hit two targets, which were either aligned with the NNM (Experiments 1 and 2) or purposefully arranged offset (Experiment 3). In all tested experiment variations, participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems. Even for increased task accuracy (Experiment 2) and targets located away from the NNM (Experiment 3), participants could successfully accomplish the task, likely by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task. Consequently, our experiments extend the existing research on human resonance sensitivity with data-based evidence to nonlinear systems. Our findings emphasize the human capabilities to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions, including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness.

Cell shape remodeling is a principal driver of epithelial tissue morphogenesis. While progress continues to be made in our understanding of the pathways that control the apical (top) geometry of epithelial cells, we know comparatively little about those that control cell basal (bottom) geometry. To examine this, we used the <i>Drosophila</i> ommatidium, which is the basic visual unit of the compound eye. The ommatidium is shaped as a hexagonal prism, and generating this 3D structure requires ommatidial cells to adopt specific apical and basal polygonal geometries. Using this model system, we find that generating cell type–specific basal geometries starts with patterning of the basal extracellular matrix, whereby Laminin accumulates at discrete locations across the basal surface of the retina. We find the Dystroglycan receptor complex (DGC) is required for this patterning by promoting localized Laminin accumulation at the basal surface of cells. Moreover, our results reveal that localized accumulation of Laminin and the DGC are required for directing Integrin adhesion. This induces cell basal geometry remodeling by anchoring the basal surface of cells to the extracellular matrix at specific, Laminin-rich locations. We propose that patterning of a basal extracellular matrix by generating discrete Laminin domains can direct Integrin adhesion to induce cell shape remodeling in epithelial morphogenesis.

53BP1 is a well-established DNA damage repair factor that has recently emerged to critically regulate gene expression for tumor suppression and neural development. However, its precise function and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we showed that phosphorylation of 53BP1 at serine 25 by ATM is required for neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in cortical brain organoids. Dynamic phosphorylation of 53BP1-serine 25 controls 53BP1 target genes governing neuronal differentiation and function, cellular response to stress, and apoptosis. Mechanistically, ATM and RNF168 govern 53BP1’s binding to gene loci to directly affect gene regulation, especially at genes for neuronal differentiation and maturation. 53BP1 serine 25 phosphorylation effectively impedes its binding to bivalent or H3K27me3-occupied promoters, especially at genes regulating H3K4 methylation, neuronal functions, and cell proliferation. Beyond 53BP1, ATM-dependent phosphorylation displays wide-ranging effects, regulating factors in neuronal differentiation, cytoskeleton, p53 regulation, as well as key signaling pathways such as ATM, BDNF, and WNT during cortical organoid differentiation. Together, our data suggest that the interplay between 53BP1 and ATM orchestrates essential genetic programs for cell morphogenesis, tissue organization, and developmental pathways crucial for human cortical development.

<i>Vibrio coralliilyticus</i> is a pathogen of coral and shellfish, leading to devastating economic and ecological consequences worldwide. Although rising ocean temperatures correlate with increased <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i> pathogenicity, the specific molecular mechanisms and determinants contributing to virulence remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically analyzed the type VI secretion system (T6SS), a contact-dependent toxin delivery apparatus, in <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i>. We identified 2 omnipresent T6SSs that are activated at temperatures in which <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i> becomes virulent; T6SS1 is an antibacterial system mediating interbacterial competition, whereas T6SS2 mediates anti-eukaryotic toxicity and contributes to mortality during infection of an aquatic model organism, <i>Artemia salina</i>. Using comparative proteomics, we identified the T6SS1 and T6SS2 toxin arsenals of 3 <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i> strains with distinct disease etiologies. Remarkably, T6SS2 secretes at least 9 novel anti-eukaryotic toxins comprising core and accessory repertoires. We propose that T6SSs differently contribute to <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i>’s virulence: T6SS2 plays a direct role by targeting the host, while T6SS1 plays an indirect role by eliminating competitors.

     alt="Impact of Electric Field Magnitude in the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex on Changes in Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation: A Randomized Crossover Study"/>
<p>After anodal and sham transcranial direct current stimulation on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC), changes in resting-state functional activity (fALFF) and L-DLPFC connectivity were assessed. fALFF changes were observed, alongside significant correlations between electric field magnitude and L-DLPFC connectivity, reaffirming tDCS effects in both proximal and distant cortical areas.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study investigated whether the electric field magnitude (E-field) delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) changes resting-state brain activity and the L-DLPFC resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), given the variability in tDCS response and lack of understanding of how rsFC changes. Twenty-one healthy participants received either 2 mA anodal or sham tDCS targeting the L-DLPFC for 10 min. Brain imaging was conducted before and after stimulation. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), reflecting resting brain activity, and the L-DLPFC rsFC were analyzed to investigate the main effect of tDCS, main effect of time, and interaction effects. The E-field was estimated by modeling tDCS-induced individual electric fields and correlated with fALFF and L-DLPFC rsFC. Anodal tDCS increased fALFF in the left rostral middle frontal area and decreased fALFF in the midline frontal area (FWE <i>p</i> &lt; 0.050), whereas sham induced no changes. Overall rsFC decreased after sham (positive and negative connectivity, <i>p</i> = 0.001 and 0.020, respectively), with modest and nonsignificant changes after anodal tDCS (<i>p</i> = 0.063 and 0.069, respectively). No significant differences in local rsFC were observed among the conditions. Correlations were observed between the E-field and rsFC changes in the L-DLPFC (<i>r</i> = 0.385, <i>p</i> = 0.115), left inferior parietal area (<i>r</i> = 0.495, <i>p</i> = 0.037), and right lateral visual area (<i>r</i> = 0.683, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Single-session tDCS induced resting brain activity changes and may help maintain overall rsFC. The E-field in the L-DLPFC is associated with rsFC changes in both proximal and distally connected brain regions to the L-DLPFC.</p>

                <p>The no-reflow phenomenon is a potential contributor to poor outcome despite successful thrombectomy. There are multiple proposed imaging-based definitions of no-reflow leading to wide variations in reported prevalence. We investigated the agreement between existing imaging definitions and compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients identified as having no-reflow.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed an external validation of 4 existing published definitions of no-reflow in thrombectomy patients with extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale 2c to 3 (eTICI2c-3) angiographic reperfusion who underwent 24-hour perfusion imaging from 2 international randomized controlled trials (EXTEND-IA TNK part-1 and 2) and a multicenter prospective observational study. Receiver-operating-characteristic and Bayesian-information-criterion (BIC) analyses were performed with the outcome variable being dependent-or-dead at 90-days (modified Rankin Score [mRS] ≥3).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 131 patients analyzed, the prevalence of no-reflow significantly varied between definitions (0.8–22.1%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). There was poor agreement between definitions (kappa 5/6 comparisons &lt;0.212). Among patients with no-reflow according to at least 1 definition, there were significant differences between definitions in the intralesional interside differences in cerebral blood flow (CBF) (<i>p</i> = 0.006), cerebral blood volume (CBV) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and mean-transit-time (MTT) (<i>p</i> = 0.005). No-reflow defined by 3 definitions was associated with mRS ≥3 at 90 days. The definition of &gt;15% CBV or CBF asymmetry was the only definition that improved model fit on BIC analysis (ΔBIC = −8.105) and demonstrated an association between no-reflow and clinical outcome among patients with eTICI3 reperfusion.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Existing imaging definitions of no-reflow varied significantly in prevalence and post-treatment perfusion imaging profile, potentially explaining the variable prevalence of no-reflow reported in literature. The definition of &gt;15% CBV or CBF asymmetry best discriminated for functional outcome at 90 days, including patients with eTICI3 reperfusion. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                We describe the evolution of a bioinformatics national capacity from scattered professionals into a collaborative organisation, and advancements in the adoption of the bioinformatics infrastructure philosophy by the national community. The Romanian Society of Bioinformatics (RSBI), a national professional society, was founded in 2019 to accelerate the development of Romanian bioinformatics. Incrementally, RSBI expanded its role to include: i) developing a community and engaging the public and stakeholders, ii) a national training approach, including through increased interactions with European training resources, and iii) advocating national participation in European bioinformatics infrastructures. In a next step RSBI led the development of the national bioinformatics infrastructure, the Romanian Bioinformatics Cluster (CRB) with the mission to act as an ELIXIR National Node. In this paper we report both the successful projects in training, public engagement, and policy projects, as well as initiatives related to data federation that, while not successful, can serve as valuable learning experiences for future implementations. We explain CRB’s structure and the role such an entity can play in the national bioinformatics infrastructure for data, tools, and training. Finally, we offer insights into the evolving role of the bioinformatics professional society and the synergies and interactions with the National ELIXIR Node

                Background The consultancy industry, valued at £18.6 billion, faces evolving challenges and opportunities in the post-COVID era. Consultancy and bid writing firms play a critical role in helping businesses secure contracts and funding, particularly through the preparation of Pre-Qualification Questionnaires (PQQs) and Invitations to Tender (ITTs). Despite the importance of bid writing, there is limited literature on how it can be leveraged for lead generation and business growth. Methods A mixed-methods approach was employed in this study, combining qualitative and quantitative research. Secondary research involved the review of existing literature and data from government databases, internal company records, and published reports. Primary research included surveys and semi-structured interviews with professionals from the Facilities Management and Logistics sectors. A case study of a UK-based bid-writing consultancy was also used to support the analysis. Results The findings highlighted significant knowledge gaps in bid writing among businesses, with only 12.5% of survey respondents expressing confidence in their bid-writing abilities. Despite this, 83.1% showed interest in receiving bid-writing training. The study also revealed that expertise, relationships, and past work are prioritized by businesses when selecting consultancy firms. Additionally, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in business operations was identified as a key factor for enhancing efficiency and maintaining competitiveness. Conclusions There is a clear opportunity for consultancy and bid-writing firms to address the knowledge gaps in bid writing by offering targeted training programs. Effective networking and a robust social media presence are essential for generating new business leads and maintaining client relationships. Furthermore, integrating AI technologies into business operations can provide consultancy firms with a competitive edge. This study provides actionable insights for consultancy and bid-writing firms to enhance their lead generation strategies and improve their market positioning.

                Background This study investigates the factors influencing rural women’s participation in credit programs in Gubalafto Wereda. Understanding these determinants is crucial for improving program effectiveness and supporting women’s economic empowerment in the region. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of 364 rural women from four kebeles, selected through stratified random sampling based on agro-ecological characteristics. Data were collected via interviews and analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, and logit regression models to determine the significance of various factors affecting participation. Results Descriptive statistics revealed key associations between participation and factors such as household size, income level, educational status, perception of group collateral, skill training, and distance from lending offices. Chi-square tests showed significant relationships, while t-tests identified differences between participants and non-participants. Logit regression analysis indicated that household size, income level, educational status, group collateral, skill training, and proximity to lending offices significantly influenced credit participation at the 1% level (p<0.01). Experience with income-generating activities and perception of interest rates were significant at the 5% level (p<0.05). Market access was significant at the 10% level (p<0.10). Positive factors included household size and income level, while age, distance from lending offices, and perception of interest rates had negative effects. Conclusion The study highlights that specific factors significantly impact rural women’s participation in credit programs. To enhance program effectiveness, stakeholders should address these determinants and develop robust institutional frameworks with effective monitoring and evaluation systems.

                Several metabolites have been shown to have independent and at times unexpected biological effects outside of their metabolic pathways. These include succinate, lactate, fumarate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate. 2-Hydroxybutyrate (2HB) is a byproduct of endogenous cysteine synthesis, produced during periods of cellular stress. 2HB rises acutely after exercise; it also rises during infection and is also chronically increased in a number of metabolic disorders. We show here that 2HB inhibits branched-chain aminotransferase enzymes, which in turn triggers a SIRT4-dependent shift in the compartmental abundance of protein ADP-ribosylation. The 2HB-induced decrease in nuclear protein ADP-ribosylation leads to a C/EBPβ-mediated transcriptional response in the branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway. This response to 2HB exposure leads to an improved oxidative capacity in vitro. We found that repeated injection with 2HB can replicate the improvement to oxidative capacity that occurs following exercise training. Together, we show that 2-HB regulates fundamental aspects of skeletal muscle metabolism.

">Temporal proteomic and PTMomic atlas of cerebral organoid development</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral organoids (CBOs) are generated from pluripotent stem cells that undergo neuroectoderm specification and neuronal differentiation in three dimensions. The developing neurons in CBOs migrate and self-organize into cerebral cortex-like layers, mimicking human brain development. CBOs develop according to intrinsic signaling mechanisms and offer unique insights into mechanisms of early human brain development. This process requires coordinated spatiotemporal regulation of protein expression and function, where the latter can be achieved by post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins. Despite the importance of proteins in brain development and function, profiling of protein abundance and the involvement of PTMs in CBO development remain underexplored. To gain insight into protein and PTM abundance in CBOs, we performed a high-resolution temporal analysis of CBOs up to day 200 using proteomics, PTMomics and metabolomics. We quantified more than 9,300 proteins and various neurodevelopmentally relevant PTMs (including phosphorylation, lysine acetylation, sialylated N-glycosylation, and cysteine modifications). We demonstrate that protein abundance and dynamic PTMs show significant temporal changes during CBO development related to neuronal differentiation and energy metabolism, whereas calcium signaling is mainly regulated by dynamic PTMs. We further show that synaptic protein content correlated with neurotransmitter levels, and we detected astroglia beyond day 100. Lastly, comparative analysis showed proteomic similarities between CBOs and human fetal brain tissue, supporting the physiological relevance of CBOs. Overall, our study presents a temporal atlas of protein and PTM abundance in CBOs and provides a valuable resource for studying neurodevelopment in neural organoids.

">Predictive Coding of Reward in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental objective of the brain is to anticipate future outcomes. This process requires learning the states of the world as well as the transitional relationships between those states. The hippocampal cognitive map is believed to be one such internal model. However, evidence for predictive coding and reward sensitivity in the hippocampal neuronal representation suggests that its role extends beyond purely spatial representation. In fact, it raises the question of what kind of spatial representation is most useful for learning and maximizing future rewards? Here, we track the evolution of reward representation over weeks as mice learn to solve a cognitively demanding reward-based task. Our findings reveal a highly organized restructuring of hippocampal reward representations during the learning process. Specifically, we found multiple lines of evidence, both at the population and single-cell levels, that hippocampal representation becomes predictive of reward over weeks. Namely, both population-level information about reward and the percentage of reward-tuned neurons decrease over time. At the same time, the representation of the animals' choice and reward approach period (the period between choice and reward) increased over time. By tracking individual reward cells across sessions, we found that neurons initially tuned for reward shifted their tuning towards choice and reward approach periods, indicating that reward cells backpropagate their tuning to anticipate reward with experience. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of hippocampal representations, highlighting their critical role in learning through the prediction of future outcomes.

">Attention defines the context for implicit sensorimotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Movement errors are used to continuously recalibrate the sensorimotor map, a process known as sensorimotor adaptation. Here we examined how attention influences this automatic and obligatory learning process. Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which the visual feedback that provided information about the movement outcome was either attended or unattended. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of adaptation. We next used a dual-task methodology to examine the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Here, again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused or divided attention conditions. Interestingly, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: Attended stimuli serve as cues that define the context for learning. The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. Together, these results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.

">Cholinergic signaling differentially regulates song premotor circuits to stabilize songs in songbirds</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic modulation plays an important role in motor skill learning, including vocal learning. In songbirds, song premotor nucleus RA simultaneously receives inputs from song nuclei HVC and LMAN, and then its projection neurons (RAPNs) generate song motor control output. Using electrophysiological and pharmacological methods, we found that cholinergic signaling can enhance song stability by reducing HVC-RAPN excitatory synaptic transmission in adult male zebra finches, mediated by mAChRs. Although nAChRs are not effective overall, cholinergic signaling can also decrease LMAN-RAPN excitatory synaptic transmission induced by electrical stimulation via nAChRs, suggesting the potential role of cholinergic regulation in song behavior through LMAN-RA pathway. On the contrary, in adult female zebra finches, only LMAN-RAPN synaptic transmission was reduced by cholinergic signaling via mAChRs. The role of differential cholinergic regulation of song premotor circuits in songbirds' singing provides insights into the neural processes of motor skill learning.

">Revealing the co-existence of written and spoken language coding neural populations in the left-ventral occipitotemporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Reading relies on the ability to map written symbols with speech sounds. The left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (left-vOT) plays a crucial role in this process. Through the automatization of the mapping ability, this specific part of the ventral visual pathway (a.k.a., the Visual Word Form Area) progressively becomes specialized in written word recognition. Yet, despite its key role in reading, the area also responds to speech. This observation raises questions about the actual nature of neural representations encoded in the left-vOT and, therefore, the underlying mechanism of the cross-modal responses. Here, we addressed this issue by applying fine-grained analyses of within- and cross-modal repetition suppression effects (RSEs) and Multi-Voxel Pattern Analyses in fMRI and sEEG experiments. Convergent evidence across analysis methods and protocols showed significant RSEs and successful decoding in both within-modal visual and auditory conditions suggesting that subpopulations of neurons within the left-vOT distinctly encode written and spoken language inputs. This functional organization of neural populations enables the area to respond to speech input directly and indirectly, i.e., after speech sounds are converted to orthographic representations. The finding opens further discussions on how the human brain may be prepared and adapted for an acquisition of a complex ability such as reading.

">The sodium leak channel NALCN is regulated by neuronal SNARE complex proteins</a></h4>

              
                The sodium leak channel NALCN is vital for the regulation of electrical activity in neurons and other excitable cells, and mutations in the channel or its auxiliary proteins lead to severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we show that the neuronal SNARE complex proteins syntaxin and SNAP25, which enable synaptic transmission in the nervous system, inhibit the activity of the NALCN channel complex in both heterologous systems and primary neurons. The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signalling directly, and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction may offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein-containing complexes.

                Following ischemic stroke, Ccl5 mRNA expression increased, while miR-324-5p expression decreased in the peri-infract cortex of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice. However, the roles of CCL5 and miR-324-5p in stroke remain unclear. Here, we show that inhibiting CCL5 using antibodies or miR-324-5p not only reduced infarct area and preserved neurological function in MCAO mice but also attenuated astrocyte and microglia activation, protected dendritic structures, and maintained spine density. In an astrocyte-neuron co-culture system after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), knockdown astrocytic CCL5 expression by antibody or miR-324-5p decreased neuronal apoptosis and preserved dendritic architecture. Importantly, the suppression of CCL5 enhanced the activation of the ERK/CREB pathway both in vivo and in vitro. Consistent with these findings, the application of Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist, reduced infarct size, decreased neuronal apoptosis, and upregulated the ERK/CREB pathway in neurons treated with OGD. In conclusion, targeting the CCL5 pathway via miR-324-5p represents a promising therapeutic strategy for alleviating ischemic stroke damage through modulation of neuronal CCR5/ERK/CREB pathway.

">Adolescent development of anxiety-related behavior and shifts in behavioral responsiveness to estradiol in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Early pubertal onset during adolescence is consistently linked with increased risk of anxiety and depression in girls. Although estradiol tends to have anxiolytic effects in adulthood, whether sensitivity to estradiol's anxiolytic actions increases during adolescence is not clear. Using a rodent model, the current study tested the hypothesis that a shift in sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of estradiol occurs during adolescence. To test this hypothesis, prepubertal and adult C57BL/6 female mice were ovariectomized, implanted with vehicle- or estradiol-filled silastic capsules, and behavioral tested one week later in the open field and elevated zero maze. Our hypothesis predicted that estradiol would decrease anxiety-related behavior to a greater extent in adults than in adolescent females, however, our results did not support this hypothesis. In the open field, estradiol implants significantly decreased anxiety-like behavior in adolescent females (relative to vehicle) and had little to no effect on the behavior of adults. These data suggest that adolescence is associated with a downward shift in sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of estradiol on behavior in the open field. In contrast, although estradiol treatment did not influence anxiety-like responses in the elevated zero maze in early adolescent or adult females, adolescent females displayed significantly higher levels of anxiety-like behavior than adults. These findings demonstrate that substantial changes in anxiety-related behavior occur during adolescence, including a context-dependent shift in behavioral responsiveness to estradiol.

">Pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic input to the lateral habenula modulates consumption of palatable diet components in male Wistar rats</a></h4>

              
                The lateral habenula (LHb), a small epithalamic nucleus, modifies downstream midbrain dopamine neuron output to regulate negative state and aversion. Furthermore, specific glutamatergic input, from, among others, lateral hypothalamus and central amygdala to LHb modulates consumption of (palatable) diet components. However, it is currently unclear if blockade of all glutamatergic input to the LHb is sufficient to alter eating behavior. Here, we used a pharmacological approach to inhibit all glutamatergic input to the LHb by bilateral infusion of either an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist (CNQX) or an NMDA receptor antagonist (AP5) in the LHb of male Wistars rats. We then measured consumption of various palatable diets a control diet, a free-choice high-fat diet (fcHFD), a free-choice high-sugar diet (fcHSD), and a free-choice high-fat high-sugar diet (fcHFHSD)] at various timepoints up to 24h following infusion. Rats consumed their respective diets for 14 days before infusion of vehicle, CNQX or AP5, performed in counter-balanced random order. Infusion of CNQX or AP5 did not acutely (i.e. 1, 3, or 6h following infusion) affect consumption of a fcHFHSD component. Infusion of AP5 decreased fat intake at later time points (i.e. 10 or 24h following infusion) in fcHFHSD- and fcHFD-fed, but not fcHSD-fed, rats. Combined infusion of CNQX and AP5 decreased sucrose water consumption at 24h following infusion in fcHFHSD-fed rats. Collectively, these observations indicate that blocking glutamatergic transmission in the LHb does not have a major impact on acute consumption of a palatable free-choice diet components. Nonetheless, more subtle long-term effects were observed, suggesting a modulatory role of LHb in eating behavior in the current experimental set-up.

">A gut-brain-gut interoceptive circuit loop gates sugar ingestion in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The communication between the brain and digestive tract is critical for optimising nutrient preference and food intake, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood 1-7. Here, we show that a gut-brain-gut circuit loop gates sugar ingestion in flies. We discovered that brain neurons regulating food ingestion, IN1 8 , receive excitatory input from enteric sensory neurons, which innervate the oesophagus and express the sugar receptor Gr43a. These enteric sensory neurons monitor the sugar content of food within the oesophagus during ingestion and send positive feedback signals to IN1s, stimulating the consumption of high-sugar foods. Connectome analyses reveal that IN1s form a core ingestion circuit. This interoceptive circuit receives synaptic input from enteric afferents and provides synaptic output to enteric motor neurons, which modulate the activity of muscles at the entry segments of the crop, a stomach-like food storage organ. While IN1s are persistently activated upon ingestion of sugar-rich foods, enteric motor neurons are continuously inhibited, causing the crop muscles to relax and enabling flies to consume large volumes of sugar. Our findings reveal a key interoceptive mechanism that underlies the rapid sensory monitoring and motor control of sugar ingestion within the digestive tract, optimising the diet of flies across varying metabolic states.

">The mitochondrial unfolded protein response promotes senescence in human microglia by increasing S-adenosylmethionine availability for polyamine synthesis.</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria have developed a specialized mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) to maintain proteostasis and promote recovery under stress conditions. Research in simple organisms has demonstrated that UPRmt activation in glial cells promotes proteostasis through beneficial non-cell-autonomous communication with neurons. However, the role of mitochondrial stress responses in the human brain remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we profiled the cell type-specific roles of the UPRmt using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal and glial cultures and brain organoids. We found that UPRmt activation induces metabolic rewiring in human microglia, resulting in a senescence phenotype mediated by S-adenosylmethionine availability for polyamine synthesis. Additionally, UPRmt disrupted microglial intercellular communication, leading to microglia-mediated dysfunction of phagocytic pathways and increased inflammatory signaling. Using microglia-brain-assembloids, we observed distinct contributions by microglia to brain senescence and neurodegenerative disease processes driven by mitochondrial stress responses. These findings underscore the profound impact of defects in mitochondrial proteostasis on intercellular networks during brain aging and disease.

">Generation of motor program diversity and variability through inhibitory circuit motifs in the Drosophila larval locomotor system</a></h4>

              
                How do neural networks generate and regulate diversity and variability in motor outputs with finite cellular components? Here we examine this problem by exploring the role that inhibitory neuron motifs play in generating mixtures of motor programs in the segmentally organised Drosophila larval locomotor system. We developed a computational model that is constrained by experimental calcium imaging data. The model comprises single-compartment cells with a single voltage-gated calcium current, which are interconnected by graded excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Local excitatory and inhibitory neurons form conditional oscillators in each hemisegment. Surrounding architecture reflects key aspects of inter- and intrasegmental connectivity motifs identified in the literature. The model generates metachronal waves of activity that recapitulate key features of fictive forwards and backwards locomotion, as well as bilaterally asymmetric activity in anterior regions that represents fictive head sweeps. The statistics of inputs to competing command-like motifs, coupled with inhibitory motifs that detect activity across multiple segments generate network states that promote diversity in motor outputs, while at the same time preventing maladaptive overlap in motor programs. Overall, the model generates testable predictions for connectomics and physiological studies while providing a platform for uncovering how inhibitory circuit motifs underpin generation of diversity and variability in motor systems.

">Does transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation alter pupil dilation? A living Bayesian meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has emerged as a promising technique to modulate autonomic functions, and pupil dilation has been recognized as a promising biomarker for tVNS-induced monoaminergic release. Nevertheless, studies on the effectiveness of various tVNS protocols have produced heterogeneous results on pupil dilatation to date. Here, we synthesize the existing evidence and compare conventional continuous and pulsed stimulation protocols using Bayesian meta-analysis. To maintain a living version, we developed a Shiny App with the possibility to incorporate newly published studies in the future. Based on a systematic review, we included 18 studies (N = 771) applying either continuous or pulsed stimulation protocols. Across studies, we found anecdotal evidence for the alternative hypothesis that tVNS increases pupil size (g = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.001, 0.29], BF01 = 2.5). Separating studies according to continuous vs. pulsed protocols revealed that results were driven by studies using pulsed taVNS (strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis: g = 0.34, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.53], BF10 = 14.15) while continuous tVNS provided strong evidence for the null hypothesis (g = 0.01, CI = [-0.15, 0.16], BF01= 20.7). In conclusion, our meta-analysis highlights differential effects of continuous and pulsed tVNS protocols on pupil dilation. These findings underscore the relevance of tVNS protocols in optimizing its use for specific applications that may require modulation of tonic vs. phasic monoaminergic responses.

">Histamine interferes with the early visual processing in mice</a></h4>

              
                Sensory processing is dynamically modulated by an animal's behavior and internal states. Growing evidence suggests that such modulation starts from early stages, even at the retina, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Combining pharmacological and chemogenetic tools with single-unit extracellular recordings in awake head-fixed mice, here we identified that the visual responses of retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus were both made weaker and slower by histaminergic projections from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus. The observed changes in the visual responses were, however, not directly linked with histaminergic modulation of pupil dynamics or locomotion behavior. Instead, our computational modelling analysis suggests neuronal circuit effects, such as gain modulation via the H1 receptors in the retina. As nocturnal animals, facilitation of visual processing at low histamine level will be ethologically beneficial for mice to respond faster to visual threats when animals are less active during daytime.

">Elucidating the Selection Mechanisms in Context-Dependent Computation through Low-Rank Neural Network Modeling</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals exhibit a remarkable ability to selectively filter out irrelevant information based on context. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this context-dependent selection process remain elusive. Recently, the issue of discriminating between two prevalent selection mechanisms--input modulation versus selection vector modulation--with neural activity data has been highlighted as one of the major challenges in the study of individual variability underlying context-dependent decision-making (CDM). Here, we investigated these selection mechanisms through low-rank neural network modeling of the CDM task. We first showed that only input modulation was allowed in rank-one neural networks and additional dimensions of network connectivity were required to endow neural networks with selection vector modulation. Through rigorous information flow analysis, we gained a mechanistic understanding of why additional dimensions are required for selection vector modulation and how additional dimensions specifically contribute to selection vector modulation. This new understanding then led to the identification of novel neural dynamical signatures for selection vector modulation at both single neuron and population levels readily testable in experiments. Together, our results provide a rigorous theoretical framework linking network connectivity, neural dynamics and selection mechanisms, paving the way towards elucidating the circuit mechanisms when studying individual variability in context-dependent computation.

">Multisensory approach in Mental Imagery: ALE meta-analyses comparing Motor, Visual and Auditory Imagery</a></h4>

              
                Mental Imagery is a topic of longstanding and widespread scientific interest. Individual studies have typically focused on a single modality (e.g. Motor, Visual, Auditory) of Mental Imagery. Relatively little work has considered directly comparing and contrasting the brain networks associated with these different modalities of Imagery. The present study integrates data from 439 neuroimaging experiments to identify both modality-specific and shared neural networks involved in Mental Imagery. Comparing the networks involved in Motor, Visual, and Auditory Imagery identified a pattern whereby each form of Imagery preferentially recruited "higher level" associative brain regions involved in the associated "real" experience. Results also indicate significant overlap in a left-lateralized network including the pre-supplementary motor area, ventral premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobule. This pattern of results supports the existence of a "core" network that supports the attentional, spatial, and decision-making demands of Mental Imagery. Together these results offer new insights into the brain networks underlying human imagination.

">An Efficient Direct Conversion Strategy to Generate Functional Astrocytes from Human Adult Fibroblasts</a></h4>

              
                Direct reprogramming approaches offer an attractive alternative to stem-cell-derived models, allowing the retention of epigenetic information and age-associated cellular phenotypes, and providing an expedited method to generate target cell types. Several groups have previously generated multiple neuronal subtypes, neural progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and other cell types directly from fibroblasts. However, while some groups have had success at the efficient conversion of embryonic fibroblasts to astrocytes, they have not yet achieved similar conversion efficiency for adult human fibroblasts. To generate astrocytes for the study of adult-stage disorders, we developed an improved direct conversion strategy employing a combination of small molecules to activate specific pathways that induce trans-differentiation of human adult fibroblasts to astrocytes. We demonstrate that this method produces mature GFAP+/S100{beta}+ cells at high efficiency (40-45%), comparable to previous studies utilizing embryonic fibroblasts. Further, Fibroblast-derived induced Astrocytes (FdiAs) are enriched for markers of astrocyte functionality, including ion-channel buffering, gap-junction communication, and glutamate uptake; and exhibit astrocyte-like calcium signaling and neuroinflammatory phenotypes. RNA-Seq analysis indicates a close correlation to human brain astrocytes and iPSC-derived astrocyte models. Fibroblast-derived induced astrocytes provide a useful tool in studying the adult brain and complement existing in vitro models of induced neurons (iNs), providing an additional platform to study adult-stage brain disorders.

">Refining Brain Stimulation Therapies: An Active Learning Approach to Personalization</a></h4>

              
                Brain stimulation holds promise for treating brain disorders, but personalizing therapy remains challenging. Effective treatment requires establishing a functional link between stimulation parameters and brain response, yet traditional methods like random sampling (RS) are inefficient and costly. To overcome this, we developed an active learning (AL) framework that identifies optimal relationships between stimulation parameters and brain response with fewer experiments. We validated this framework through three experiments: (1) in silico modeling with synthetic data from a Parkinson's disease model, (2) in silico modeling with real data from a non-human primate, and (3) in vivo modeling with a real-time rat optogenetic stimulation experiment. In each experiment, we compared AL models to RS models, using various query strategies and stimulation parameters (amplitude, frequency, pulse width). AL models consistently outperformed RS models, achieving lower error on unseen test data in silico (p<0.0056, N=1,000) and in vivo (p=0.0036, N=20). This approach represents a significant advancement in brain stimulation, potentially improving both research and clinical applications by making them more efficient and effective. Our findings suggest that AL can substantially reduce the cost and time required for developing personalized brain stimulation therapies, paving the way for more effective and accessible treatments for brain disorders.

">Motor decision-making under uncertainty and time pressure</a></h4>

              
                Purposeful movement often requires selection of a particular action from a range of alternatives, but how does the brain represent potential actions so that they can be compared for selection, and how are motor commands generated if movement is initiated before the final goal is identified? According to one hypothesis, the brain averages partially prepared motor plans to generate movement when there is goal uncertainty. This is consistent with the idea that motor decision making unfolds through competition between internal representations of alternative actions. An alternative hypothesis holds that only one movement, which is optimised for task performance, is prepared for execution at any time. Under this conception, decisions about the best motor goal given current information are completed upstream from neural circuits that perform motor planning. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we modified Alhussein and Smith (2021) experiment in which participants had to start reaching toward targets associated with opposite curl force-fields prior to knowing the correct target to reach. Crucially, we forced the participants to initiate movement immediately after target presentation (i.e. mean reaction times ~250ms) so that they had limited opportunity to deliberate between the available alternatives. We found that the reaching dynamics reflected only those learnt for the selected reach direction, rather than a combination of those for the alternative targets presented, irrespective of the time available to initiate movement. The data are consistent with the conclusion that reaching dynamics were specified downstream of action selection under the target uncertainty conditions of this study.

">Four SpsP neurons are an integrating sleep regulation hub in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is an essential and conserved behavior, yet the mechanisms underlying sleep regulation remain largely unknown. To address the neural mechanisms of sleep drive, here we carry out whole brain calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) imaging of Drosophila and show that the activity of the protocerebral bridge (PB), a part of the central complex, correlates with sleep drive. Through a neural activation screen followed by anatomical and functional connectivity assays, we further narrow down the key player of sleep regulation in the PB to a three-layer circuit composed of 4 SpsP neurons and their upstream and downstream synaptic partners: the 4 SpsP neurons act as an integrating hub by responding to ellipsoid body (EB) signals from EPG neurons, and by sending signals back to the EB through PEcG neurons. Moreover, sleep deprivation enriches the presynaptic active zones of SpsP neurons and strengthens the connections of the EPG-SpsP-PEcG circuit, indicating plasticity gating in the circuit in response to sleep drive change. As the SpsP neurons also receive input from the sensorimotor brain region and given their known role in navigation, these neurons potentially further integrate sleep drive with other sensorimotor cues. The data taken together indicate that the four SpsP neurons and their sleep regulatory circuit play an important and dynamic role in sleep regulation.

">FaPDA: Facial paralysis detection algorithm applied in mice</a></h4>

              
                Facial paralysis is characterized by an injury to the facial nerve, causing the loss of the functions of the structures that it innervates and changes in the central nervous system in the motor cortex. Therefore, it is important to use experimental models to further the neurophysiological study. Currently, the models have some limitations for the study of facial paralysis. Therefore, the development of an algorithm capable of automatically detecting facial paralysis and overcoming the existing limitations is proposed. C57/BL6 mice were used, which produced irreversible facial paralysis with permanent effects and reversible facial paralysis, where the effects of the paralysis disappear within the first 15 days after the nerve injury. Video recordings were made of the faces of paralyzed mice to develop the algorithm for detecting facial paralysis applied to mice, which allows us to detect the presence of reversible and irreversible facial paralysis automatically. At the same time, the algorithm was used to track facial movement during oral stimulation with sucrose and extracellular electrophysiological recordings in the anterolateral motor cortex. In the basal state, mice can make facial expressions associated with a pleasurable state, and the algorithm detects this movement; at the same time, the movement correlates with the activation in the cortical area. In the presence of facial paralysis, the algorithm can not detect movement. Therefore, it concludes that the condition exists, and the neuronal activity in the cortex is affected with respect to the evolution of facial paralysis. Therefore, the facial paralysis detection algorithm applied to mice allows deduce the presence of experimental facial paralysis, in the presence of oral stimulation or without it, at the same time that cortical electrophysiological recordings can be made for the neurophysiological study of facial paralysis.

">Neural population dynamics during sleep in a songbird vocal circuit resemble sharp wave ripple activity</a></h4>

              
                During vocal learning, juvenile songbirds use auditory feedback and trial-and-error motor learning to transition from acoustically simple, highly variable songs to complex and stereotypical adult songs. Similar to motor skill learning in mammals, vocal learning in songbirds requires a set of interconnected brain areas that make up an analogous basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP). Although neural activity in the AFP has been extensively investigated during awake singing, very little is known about its neural activity patterns during offline sleep periods. In this work, we used chronically implanted Neuropixels probes to investigate neural activity in the AFP during offline periods of natural sleep. We found that neurons in the pallial region LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) transitioned from sparse synchronous firing to asynchronous firing during sleep, which corresponded to slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, respectively. SWS periods were associated with increased spiking variability for LMAN neurons, but not for neurons in the striatal region Area X (proper name). Coinciding with the increased spiking variability, we observed that populations of LMAN neurons were co-activated at specific time points during sleep in bursting events that were characterized by a negative deflection in the local field potential (LFP) and a transient increase in gamma power. Overall, the LMAN population bursting events were highly reminiscent of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity observed in rodent hippocampus. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe strong cross-area field coherence between LMAN and Area X, although individual LMAN-Area X LFP pairs did show coherence > 0.5. These results provide the first description of cross-area dynamics within the AFP during sleep. Furthermore, the observation of SWR-like events during sleep in LMAN suggests that large-scale population events have diverse functions across vertebrates.

">Ongoing activation of visual cortex and superior colliculus in the rd10 mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                Efforts in vision restoration have been focused on a condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa, where photoreceptors in the retina degenerate while the rest of the visual pathway remain mostly intact. Retinal implants that replace the phototransduction process by stimulating retinal ganglion cells have shown promising but limited results in patients so far. Apart from technical limitations, cross-modal plasticity of visual areas might contribute to this problem. We therefore investigated if the primary visual cortex (V1) of the rd10 mouse model for retinal degeneration became more sensitive to auditory or tactile sensory inputs, potentially hindering retinal stimulation. After reaching complete blindness confirmed by the lack of optomotor responses, activity in visual cortex and superior colliculus (SC) was recorded using Neuropixels probes. While we could not find any significant differences in tactile or auditory responses compared to wildtype mice, the local field potential revealed distinct oscillatory events (0.5 to 6 Hz) in V1 and SC resembling previously observed aberrant activity in the retina of rd10 mice. Further absence of cross-modal plasticity was confirmed by a lacking increase in zif268 expression in V1 after tactile stimulation. We therefore propose that aberrant retinal activity is transmitted to higher visual areas where it prevents cross-modal changes.

">Idiosyncratic choice bias and feedback-induced bias differ in their long-term dynamics</a></h4>

              
                A well-known observation in repeated-choice experiments is that a tendency to prefer one response over the others emerges if the feedback consistently favors that response. Choice bias, a tendency to prefer one response over the others, however, is not restricted to biased-feedback settings and is also observed when the feedback is unbiased. In fact, participant-specific choice bias, known as idiosyncratic choice bias (ICB), is common even in symmetrical experimental settings in which feedback is completely absent. Here we ask whether feedback-induced bias and ICB share a common mechanism. Specifically, we ask whether ICBs reflect idiosyncrasies in choice-feedback associations prior to the measurement of the ICB. To address this question, we compare the long-term dynamics of ICBs with feedback-induced biases. We show that while feedback effectively induced choice preferences, its effect is transient and diminished within several weeks. By contrast, we show that ICBs remained stable for at least 22 months. These results indicate that different mechanisms underlie the idiosyncratic and feedback-induced biases.

">Biases in volumetric versus surface analyses in population receptive field mapping</a></h4>

              
                Population receptive field (pRF) mapping is a quantitative fMRI analysis method that links visual field positions with specific locations in the visual cortex. A common preprocessing step in pRF analyses involves projecting volumetric fMRI data onto the cortical surface, often leading to upsampling of the data. This process may introduce biases in the resulting pRF parameters. To investigate this, we present CON-pRF, a fully containerized pipeline for pRF mapping analysis that is designed to maximize reproducibility in pRF mapping studies. Using this pipeline, we compared pRF maps generated from original volumetric with those from upsampled surface data. Our results show substantial increases in pRF coverage in the central visual field of upsampled data sets. These effects were consistent across early visual cortex areas V1-3. Further analysis indicates that this bias is primarily driven by the non-linear relationship between cortical distance and visual field eccentricity, known as cortical magnification. Our results demonstrate that reproducible analysis pipelines enable the detection of potential biases introduced by varying processing steps, particularly when comparing across differently processed datasets.

">Is criticality a unified set-point of brain function?</a></h4>

              
                Brains face selective pressure to optimize computation, broadly defined. This optimization is achieved by myriad mechanisms and processes that influence the brain's computational state. These include development, plasticity, homeostasis, and more. Despite enormous variability over time and between individuals, do these diverse mechanisms converge on the same set-point? Is there a universal computational optimum around which the healthy brain tunes itself? The criticality hypothesis posits such a unified computational set-point. Criticality is a special dynamical brain state, defined by internally-generated multi-scale, marginally-stable dynamics which maximize many features of information processing. The first experimental support for this hypothesis emerged two decades ago, and evidence has accumulated at an accelerating pace, despite a contentious history. Here, we lay out the logic of criticality as a general computational end-point and systematically review experimental evidence for the hypothesis. We perform a meta-analysis of 143 datasets from manuscripts published between 2003 and 2024. To our surprise, we find that a long-standing controversy in the field is the product of a simple methodological choice that has no bearing on underlying dynamics. Our results suggest that a new generation of research can leverage the concept of criticality---as a unifying principle of brain function--to accelerate our understanding of behavior, cognition, and disease.

">Visual experience-dependent auditory and visual plasticity in the mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                A lack of early visual experience causes pronounced auditory and visual cross-modal changes. However, the visual cortical region-specific cross-modal organization down to the single neuron level remains unknown. Here we used two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice that were reared in darkness from birth to map auditory and visual responsiveness of single neurons. We targeted neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual cortical areas (HVAs) that resemble the ventral and dorsal stream regions. We found that lateral dorsal stream areas showed a pronounced increase in auditory response strength, even after accounting for tone-induced whisker movement. Strikingly, this was accompanied by a decreased visual drive, measured in number of recruited neurons and response strength, although these visual effects were more widespread across cortical regions. Together, these results provide a comprehensive functional map of auditory and visual cross-modal changes after a lack of early visual experience across the mouse visual cortex. Moreover, our results suggest that a lack of visual drive of dorsal stream regions might provide an opportunity for remaining senses to take over.

All [18F]AV-1451 PETs were intensity-standardized (reference: inferior cerebellum), z-transformed (control sample: 147 amyloid-negative subjects) and subsequently thresholded (z-score > 1.96) and converted to volume-maps. Based on these volume-maps, tau-changes over time were assessed in terms of 1) tau-speed (i.e. newly affected volume at follow-up), and 2) tau-level-rise (i.e. tau increase in previously affected volume). These two measures were entered as dependent variables in separate linear mixed effects models including four baseline risk factors (BMI, education, hypertension, neuropsychiatric symptom severity), baseline amyloid, tau-volume or tau burden, ApoE4 status, clinical stage, sex, and age as predictors. Next, we tested the interactive effects between baseline amyloid or tau burden with the four modifiable factors on either tau-speed or tau-level-rise, respectively. Results: Faster tau-speed was linked to higher BMI, female sex, ApoE4-status, and baseline tau-volume. The effect of baseline tau-volume on tau-speed was driven by greater global amyloid burden. In terms of tau-level-rise, we observed that lower hypertension and BMI were linked to a slower increase in tau burden. A load-dependent effect of baseline amyloid and tau burden was found. Higher amyloid and BMI as well as lower education and higher tau burden were linked to greater tau-level-rise. Conclusion: Education, BMI and hypertension differentially influence tau speed and level rise by its interaction with initial pathological burden. Timely modification of these factors may overall slow tau's progression.

">Connectivity between supplementary motor complex and primary motor cortex: a dual-coil paired-pulse TMS study</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, dual-coil paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) has garnered interest for its potential in elucidating neural circuit dynamics. In this study, the dual-coil ppTMS was utilized to assess the effective connectivity between the supplementary motor complex (SMC) and the primary motor cortex (M1) in humans. A robust facilitatory connection between the SMC and M1 was observed, manifested as a 19% increase in mean peak-to-peak motor-evoked potentials following preconditioning of SMC 7 ms prior to M1 stimulation. Importantly, the facilitatory influence of SMC only occurred when the preconditioning stimulation was administered 4 cm anterior to Cz but not when applied at 5-cm, 6-cm, or 7-cm distance. While previous work has focused on demonstrating important temporal dynamics for SMC-M1 plasticity, the present findings highlight a critical contribution of spatial specificity for modulation of SMC-M1 circuitry.

">Lower-Limb Muscle Synergies in Musician's Dystonia: A Case Study of a Drummer</a></h4>

              
                Musician's dystonia (MD) is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions specifically triggered by playing an instrument. This condition often leads to a loss of fine motor control, threatening the careers of affected musicians. While MD is commonly associated with the hands, it can also affect the lower limbs, particularly in drummers. Understanding the muscle coordination involved in MD is crucial for comprehending its neurological mechanisms, yet the muscle coordination of lower-limb dystonia has not been thoroughly explored. This study aimed to investigate the differences in lower-limb muscle synergies in a drummer with MD, utilizing Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to analyze coordinated muscle activity patterns during drumming tasks. A 36-year-old male professional drummer with lower-limb MD was instructed to play a drum set in time with a metronome set at 80 beats per minute. The task involved striking the bass drum pedal in time with the downbeat. Electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from ten muscles in the right lower limb. The data were analyzed using NMF to extract muscle synergies and compare the number of synergies, spatial modules, and temporal modules between the data with and without dystonia symptoms. The number of muscle synergies did not differ significantly between the data with and without symptoms. Notably, changes were observed in both the spatial and temporal modules of muscle synergies. Spatial modules revealed the appearance of dystonia-specific muscle synergy, which is considered related to compensatory movement. Temporal modules showed significant earlier overactivation in timing, which is considered the direct manifestation of dystonia symptoms. These findings indicate that lower-limb dystonia in drummers affects the spatial and temporal profiles of muscle synergies. This study underscores the importance of considering both spatial and temporal modules of muscle synergy in understanding and treating lower-limb dystonia in drummers. Further research is needed to validate these findings and apply muscle synergy analysis for the clinical assessment of lower-limb dystonia in drummers.

	<p>Altered sensory processing especially in the auditory system is considered a typical observation in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Auditory temporal processing is known to be impaired in ASD children. Although research suggests that auditory temporal processing abnormalities could be responsible for the core aspects of ASD, few studies have examined early time processing and their results have been conflicting. The present event-related potential (ERP) study investigated the early neural responses to duration and inter-stimulus interval (ISI) deviants in nonspeech contexts in children with ASD and a control group of typically developing (TD) children matched in terms of age and IQ. A passive auditory oddball paradigm was employed to elicit the mismatch negativity (MMN) for change detection considering both the duration and ISI-based stimulus. The MMN results showed that the ASD group had a relatively diminished amplitude and significant delayed latency in response to duration deviants. The findings are finally discussed in terms of hyper-hyposensitivity of auditory processing and the fact that the observed patterns may potentially act as risk factors for ASD development within the research domain criteria (RDoC) framework.</p>

                Background The number of overweight people (BMI 25–29.9kg.m-2) in the world is increasing, which increases the risk of health problems and psychological difficulties. To reduce these risks, it is imperative to address unhealthy habits including food and exercise. This qualitative study aimed to explore the needs, perceptions, and preferences of overweight individuals on tailored exercise programs that incorporate educational videos. Methodology Forty Individuals between the age of 18-30 years with a BMI of 25-29.9kg.m-2 were included in the study using Purposive sampling from October 2023 to November 2023. Semi-structured in-depth interview was conducted for 45-60 minutes approximately among both active and inactive overweight individuals by a researcher trained in qualitative research. These interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was performed using inductive and deductive approaches to identify the recurrent patterns, themes, and insights in the transcribed interviews. Results 8 themes and 44 subthemes emerged from the analysis, helping to shed light on the needs, perceptions, and preferences that overweight individuals experience when it comes to their preference for a customized exercise program provided through educational video. The participants wanted personalized regimens that catered to their requirements and levels of fitness. Conclusion In summary, the findings emphasize the value of educational videos that are easy to use, visually appealing, and supported by science. These videos should emphasize technique, varying levels of difficulty, and brief sessions.

                Introduction Cancer and cytotoxic chemotherapy used for its treatment predispose to severe and often fatal infections. Prompt diagnosis and timely antibiotic therapy are crucial, with delays in therapy initiation having high mortality. Complete blood count (CBC) is an inexpensive, standardized, and preliminary investigation for the management and follow-up of cancer patients with diagnostic and prognostic value. Method We studied the types of infections associated with various cancers treated with chemotherapy, their etiologies and susceptibility patterns, and the hematological profile of these patients as predictors of infection. Results A total of 21 patients (12 solid and 9 hematological malignancies) presented with 31 febrile episodes. White Blood cell count (2079 cells/cu. mm), percentage of neutrophils (52.9%), absolute neutrophil (137.5 cells/cu. mm), and platelet count (1,77,507 cells/cu. mm) were significantly lower in the 11 patients with febrile neutropenia. The absolute lymphocyte count (412.7 cells/cu. mm) was reduced with a strikingly low Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (6.07) in patients with neutropenia. Laboratory and radiological evidence were present in 14/15 episodes of hematological malignancies (p-0.218) whereas unexplained clinical sepsis was common in solid malignancies (p-0.0202). The majority of documented infections were bacterial, caused by gram-negative bacilli, often showing multi-drug resistance. Infectious etiologies were identified in 71.4% of the patients with febrile neutropenia for >5days. Bacterial infections developed within 2 days of neutropenia, whereas viral and fungal infections manifested in prolonged neutropenia. Multi-site infections and higher mortality rates were observed in patients with febrile neutropenia. (p<0.04) Conclusion Febrile neutropenia is a common complication among patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis is key to prompt intervention. Hematological parameters such as Total Leukocyte count, platelet count, NLR, and Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio are promising biomarkers in conjunction with morphological changes in neutrophils, thus proving that CBC and peripheral smears are simple, easily available, cost-effective, and highly dependable screening tools, especially in resource-poor settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-996/v1?src=rss">Analyzing the Relationship Between Organizational Politics, Emotional Intelligence, and Employee Behavior: A PLS-SEM Modeling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study explores the complex relationship between organizational politics, emotional intelligence and employee behavior in contemporary settings. Organizational politics, which is widespread in organizational settings, has a substantial impact on different aspects of employee behavior. Emotional Intelligence has become a vital factor in individuals' capacity to successfully traverse the complexities of an organization. This study consolidates current material to offer insights into the impact of organizational politics on employee behavior and the mediating role of emotional intelligence in this connection. Methods A survey was undertaken with a sample size of 500 employees hailing from several Information Technology (IT) and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) firms in the Dehradun (Uttarakhand) region. The study employed quantitative methodologies to investigate the correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics and Employee Behavior. The data were evaluated using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the hypothesized correlations and mediation effects. Results The study identified substantial correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics, and Employee Behavior. Emotional Intelligence was discovered to have a positive impact on Behavioral Dynamics. Perceived Organizational Politics had a substantial influence on both Emotional Intelligence and Behavioral Dynamics. Factors such as Need for Power, Relationship Conflict, Resource Constraints, Role Conflict, and Workforce Diversity were discovered to have an impact on Perceived Organizational Politics. Conclusions The results confirm strong connections between organizational politics, emotional intelligence, and employee behavior, highlighting the significance of these concepts in comprehending employee behavior in organizational environments. The study proposes that enhancing employees' emotional intelligence can alleviate the adverse effects of organizational politics, resulting in enhanced behavioral dynamics. The study also addresses the limits, outlines potential areas for further research, and highlights the managerial implications. It suggests that firms should prioritize the development of emotional intelligence to cultivate a favorable work environment.

                Background Dental radiology has significantly benefited from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) because of its compact size and low radiation exposure. Canal tracking is an important application of CBCT for determining the relationship between the inferior alveolar nerve and third molar. Usually, canal tacking is performed manually, which takes a lot of time. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to automate classification of the mandibular canal in relation to the third molar. Methods This retrospective study was conducted using 434 CBCT images. 3D slicer software was used to annotate and classify the data into lingual, buccal, and inferior categories. Two convolution neural network models, AlexNet and ResNet50, were developed to classify this relationship. The study included 262 images for training and 172 images for testing, with the model performance evaluated by sensitivity, precision, and F1 score. Results The performance of the two models was evaluated using a 3 × 3 confusion matrix, with the data categorized into 3 clases: lingual, buccal, and inferior. The mandibular canal and third molar have a close anatomical relationship, highlighting the need for precise imaging in dental and surgical settings. To accurately classify the mandibular canal in relation to the third molar, both AlexNet and ResNet50 demonstrated high accuracy, with F1 scores ranging from 0.64 to 0.92 for different classes, with accuracy of 81% and 83%, respectively, for accurately classifying the mandibular canal in relation to the third molar. Conclusion The present study developed and evaluated AI models to accurately classify and establish the relationship between the mandibular canal and third molars using CBCT images with a higher accuracy rate.

                Global climate change poses significant challenges to human health and nutrition, particularly affecting lactating individuals and their infants. This review examines the impact of climate change on lactation, focusing on physiological, socioeconomic, and public health implications. Rising temperatures and heat stress can reduce milk production and alter milk composition, while malnutrition and water scarcity exacerbate these effects. Vulnerable populations face heightened risks, emphasizing the need for targeted mitigation strategies. Recommendations include enhancing nutritional support, securing water supplies, reducing environmental toxin exposure, and integrating lactation considerations into climate policies. Employing a social-ecological lens, this review underscores the necessity of a holistic approach to support lactating individuals in a warming world. Future research should explore the complex interactions between climate stressors and lactation to develop effective public health interventions.

We used the 2017-2018 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) (PKPR71FL) to investigate the prevalence and interface of dementia and physical disability in Pakistan. Study design : A cross-sectional study design was used by analyzing the latest DHS conducted for Pakistan from 22 November 2017 to 30 April 2018. Methods : We used Gamma correlation to evaluate the effects of several demographic and socioeconomic factors on dementia and physical disability in 2,899 males and 2,284 females. Results : The prevalence of both forms of disabilities increased with advancing age with a higher preponderance among females. Being unmarried, not educated, having a smaller household, and poverty was associated with a greater disability. Having four or more children was associated with a higher disability in men but lower disability in women. The prevalence of disability was highest in Punjab and lowest in Balochistan. Conclusion : Altogether, we describe several factors associated with the burden of disability in Pakistan. Community-based interventions are recommended to reduce the disability of the elderly in Pakistan.

                Background Ovarian cancer management has not yet given a satisfactory result, and the recurrence rate is still high. One of the reasons for this is resistance to chemotherapy. Melatonin and cisplatin may be involved in the chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer. Methods A laboratory experiment was performed using melatonin and cisplatin in the SKOV3 cell, from September 2020 to November 2021 at the SCTE and Integrated Laboratory & Research Center Universitas Indonesia. Several variables were used, such as doxorubicin, melatonin, cisplatin, and combination of cisplatin and melatonin at several concentrations (1×, 3/4×, 1/2×, and 1/4×). A total of 24 samples were included and divided into 8 groups. The IC50 values of melatonin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin as well as cell viability was calculated via MTS assay. Subsequently, flow cytometry was performed to assess the effect of cisplatin and melatonin on the mechanisms of CTR1, p-glycoprotein, GSH, ERCC1, e-cadherin, and apoptosis. Analysis of variance and Bonferroni test were employed for the study. Results The IC50 values of melatonin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin were 1.841 mM, 117.5 mM, and 14.72 mM, respectively. The combination groups of cisplatin and melatonin reduced cell viability; decreased the CTR1 mean (19.73), Pgp (6.7), GSH (11.73), and ERCC1 (4.27) in the combination 1 (C1) group; and increased e-cadherin (32.2) and annexin V (53.57) also in the combination 1 (C1) group. Conclusions The combination of melatonin and cisplatin might have an impact on drug resistance via several mechanisms in ovarian cancer.

                Shewanella is an emerging human pathogen. It mostly causes skin and soft tissue infections. Osteosynthesis-associated infection involving Shewanella are rare and in most cases are secondary to direct contamination following open fractures in aquatic environments. Here, we present a rare case of hematogenous osteosynthesis-associated infection involving Shewanella algae affecting an 18-year-old patient who was operated on for 12th thoracic vertebrae and 4th lumbar vertebrae fractures occurring in an aquatic environment. We performed surgical debridement with subsequent double course parenteral antibiotherapy that was then adapted to bacteria sensitivities for three weeks. After a follow-up of six months, the patient had no signs of recurrent infection. The presence of infected dermabrasions and the concordance between germs isolated in operative samples and in blood cultures presumes that the contamination was hematogenous.

                Background This paper focuses upon prayer for sickness. What do individuals suffering from illness, their families and the wider community pray for? How do they deal with unanswered prayer? Do they pray for cure, to guide medical professionals or to cope with their sickness? What rationalisations do they proffer for unanswered prayer? Methods Based on a critical literature review and deploying secondary data from the Twenty First Century Evangelical research programme, the data suggest that prayers for guiding medical professionals and coping are more common than for cure, at least in Global North countries such as the UK and US. But why do those who believe in miracles not ask God for divine healing? Furthermore, unanswered prayer can conflict with Christian views of God as omnipotent and all loving. Results Respondents use a number of theodical rationalisations to resolve this conflict. Conclusions The results are discussed in relation to cognitive dissonance theory, learned helplessness, the need to conserve a relationship with the Divine, and desire to manage risk of disappointment and reduce consequent emotional pain.

                Sudden deafness is a common cause of emergency consultation in otology. Usually, despite investigations, no etiology is known. Intracochlear hemorrhage is a rare cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and may be associated with various labyrinthine disorders. In such cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the clef of the diagnosis. We report the case of a 70-year-old patient who was referred to our department for sudden hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. Otoscopic and neurological examinations were normal, and pure-tone audiometry revealed left profound sensorineural hearing loss. Videonystagmography (VNG) revealed left vestibular deficit. MRI demonstrated a high signal intensity inside the cochlea on unenhanced T1-weighted images, and no other abnormalities were found; in particular, no enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium. No etiology was identified. Vertigo disappeared rapidly with corticosteroid treatment and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but hearing did not improve. Intra-labyrinthine hemorrhage causing SSNHL is rare, and the hearing prognosis is poor.

                Background This study aimed to determine the relationships between hematological parameters- hemoglobin, Total Leucocyte Counts (TLC), platelet counts, Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC), Absolute Lymphocyte Counts (ALC), Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index (SII), Neutrophil Monocyte Ratio (NMR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and the severity of COVID 19 infections and their use in predicting severity of COVID-19 infections. Methods and Material This was a prospective, observational, single-center study of 573 symptomatic adult inpatients of COVID 19 admitted to our tertiary care center. Statistical analysis used The above-mentioned hematological parameter levels were noted and compared between the two categories of COVID-19 infection, namely non-severe and severe COVID-19 using logistic regression methods. Their cut-off values were detected using the ROC curve. Results The median TLC, ANC, NLR, SII, NMR, PLR were notably higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with non-severe COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that NMR (OR=1.029, p=0.006) and ALC (OR=0.999, p=0.002) were statistically significant independent predictors of COVID-19 severity Conclusions The hematological parameters mentioned, can be used for predicting severe COVID-19 infections at admission. ALC and NMR levels could be used as hematological markers to predict severity of COVID-19 in adult patients with their cut off values being < 1105 cells/cubic millimeter and > 10.434 respectively.

                Background The potential of Islamic crowdfunding to encourage the development of Islamic fintech globally, even in countries with non-Muslim majority populations, needs to be examined in a literature study on this issue. More extensive research is needed regarding the factors that most reliably predict the success of Islamic crowdfunding, such as compliance with Islamic crowdfunding laws, sustainability, and the potential of Islamic finance. This article describes a comprehensive and systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding papers published in the field of Islamic crowdfunding. This research aims to contribute to a better understanding of Islamic crowdfunding, provide useful information for practitioners, and stimulate further research in the field to increase the success of Islamic crowdfunding. Methods We conducted a review of selected papers to identify gaps and significant issues in Islamic crowdfunding, providing guidance for future researchers. This article review was based on 704 articles retrieved using the keyword “Islamic crowdfunding” from the Scopus database between 2013 and 2022. To minimize bias, we formulated 5 research questions to guide our analysis: RQ1: How do publication and citation rates vary annually? RQ2: How can we determine the most influential studies based on citation counts for each keyword? RQ3: What are the most common subject areas addressed in Islamic crowdfunding literature from 2013 to 2022? RQ4: What are the most frequently used keywords in Scopus documents? RQ5: How are Islamic values discussed in articles related to Islamic crowdfunding? Results The findings of this research demonstrate that Islamic crowdfunding, characterized by interdisciplinary scholarship, has emerged as an increasingly significant alternative for aiding society and the economy. It contributes to poverty alleviation and the development of specific sectors through channels such as crowdfunding for small and medium enterprises and social projects tailored to meet the diverse needs of Muslims. However, the challenge facing the future development of Sharia crowdfunding is that, despite its benefit of increasing community participation in projects aligned with religious values, it also carries the potential risk of investment losses and non-compliance with Sharia principles. Ways to address the current scarcity of Sharia fintech are also needed, ensuring its broader acceptance across all societal levels, and enhancing Muslims’ understanding of compliance with Islamic religious rules, particularly Fiqh law. Conclusion Urgently needed are specific fiqh regulatory guidelines to ensure that Sharia-compliant crowdfunding adheres to Islamic principles. Government support, particularly through legislation in countries where the majority of the population is Muslim, is crucial to enhance public participation and trust in Sharia crowdfunding.

                Background The study analyzes the impact of public health spending on malnutrition among Peruvians, using data from the National Household Survey, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Ministry of Economy and Finance from 2010. -2020. Previous studies have revealed the existing relationship of health spending with the reduction of malnutrition. Methods A quantitative approach is considered, with an explanatory type of research using panel data methodology considering the bidimensionality of the data, which allows quantifying this effect for the Peruvian case using the National Household Survey, data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, as well as information from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Transparency Portal of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the period 2010-2020. Results The results show that public expenditure on health has a negative relationship with malnutrition; the rural sector has a positive relationship with malnutrition given the limitations present for access to adequate food. Similarly, the unemployment rate shows a positive relationship with malnutrition, given that being unemployed leads to a higher cause of malnutrition in the population, and the gross domestic product has a negative relationship with malnutrition, given that greater economic growth produces an impact on reducing malnutrition, with the greatest impact being on the rural population and the gross domestic product. Conclusions In the analysis period 2010-2020 in Peru, based on the panel data analysis, the impact of public health expenditure on reducing malnutrition is observed in 10 departments, achieving a reduction in malnutrition; while in 14 departments, this indicator has not been reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-989/v1?src=rss">Predicting the Path of Insurgency: Data-Driven Strategies to Counter Boko Haram in Nigeria [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background While Boko Haram insurgency’s dangers are well documented, existing research lacks methods for effective monitoring and prediction, of their activities. This study addresses this gap by analyzing data from Nigerian Security Tracker website (https://www.cfr.org/nigeria/nigeria-security-tracker/p29483) from year 2011 to 2023 and geolocated information on Boko Haram activity. Methods The research employs a mixed-methods approach. It uses descriptive statistics to understand attack trends and time series models (ARIMA/SARIMA) to forecast future attacks. Additionally, control charts identify periods of heightened insurgency. Results The findings confirm the Northeast region, as the epicenter of Boko Haram activities. The average monthly attack rate was 18 incidents, leading to 682 deaths over 12 years. 2014 and 2015 witnessed the peak of the insurgency. The forecasting models suggest a potential decrease in attack frequency in the coming years, with an average of nine attacks per month. This predicted decline might be linked to intervention efforts. Control charts reveal periods where attacks surpassed expected levels, highlighting critical moments for intensified counter-insurgency measures. These periods include July 2012-May 2014 and June 2014-August 2015, with a period of regained control. Conclusion This research provides valuable insights for stakeholders working to fight against Boko Haram’s insurgency. It offers forecasting capabilities and identifies critical periods, potentially informing targeted interventions and improving overall counter-insurgency strategies.

                Background This study used ChatGPT for sentiment analysis to investigate the possible links between online sentiments and COVID-19 vaccination rates. It also examines Internet posts to understand the attitudes and reasons associated with vaccine-related opinions. Methods We collected 500,558 posts over 60 weeks from the Blind platform, mainly used by working individuals, and 854 relevant posts were analyzed. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant content, attitudes toward and reasons for vaccine opinions were studied through sentiment analysis. The study further correlated these categorized attitudes with the actual vaccination data. Results The proportions of posts expressing positive, negative, and neutral attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were 5%, 83%, and 12%, respectively. The total post count showed a positive correlation with the vaccination rate, indicating a high correlation between the number of negative posts about the vaccine and the vaccination rate. Negative attitudes were predominantly associated with societal distrust and perceived oppression. Conclusions This study demonstrates the interplay between public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines as expressed through social media and vaccination behavior. These correlations can serve as useful clues for devising effective vaccination strategies.

                Background Despite the demonstrated value of quantitative research in understanding and responding to public health events, analytics capability is not always prioritized or available in settings that would greatly benefit from it. In Liberia, there are no university degree-granting programs in biostatistics or mathematical modeling, promoting dependence on external technical assistance. To address the gap, a local NGO, Quantitative-Data for Decision-Making (Q4D), was founded to enhance capacity and opportunities for analyzing quantitative data among Liberians. Methods To understand the relevance, utility, and impact of the skills being taught at Q4D, a tracer study was undertaken with current and former students. Participants completed an online survey that evaluated how often and in what ways they are applying course skills, as well as any personal or professional advancement they have attributed to their learning of coding and/or biostatistics through the program. Results Among 43 participants, 81% reported a high level of confidence in independently applying skills learned through Q4D classes in their jobs and/or academic programs. Most participants (81%) responded that they were actively demonstrating the skills they acquired; 74% were teaching the skills to others. Among the 83% of employed participants who reported using the skills currently in their jobs, 56% rated the skills they learned as very or extremely useful in their current positions. Several students attributed salary increments, consultancy opportunities, and scholarships to the skills gained through the program. Conclusions Program skills are being applied by students employed in health-related sectors, suggesting that the training content is relevant and useful for addressing some of the workforce’s analysis needs. Moreover, skills built through the program have positively impacted students by preparing them with the skills required for additional employment and training opportunities to advance in-country health research capacity and reduce inequities.

                Background Current treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) mainly focused on treating symptoms. Exosome from Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell (Ad-MSC) have been shown to delay degenerative process. This study aimed to investigate the clinical, radiological and histological impact of combined intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic acid (HA) and exosome Ad-MSCs in-vivo using a larger animal model with low-grade OA. Methods Eighteen male Ovies aries sheep underwent total lateral meniscectomy and conventional radiography was performed to confirm low-grade OA after 6 weeks. The sheep were divided into three groups, Group 1 (G1; n=6) received thrice exosome injections, G2 (n=6) received twice HA injection, and G3 (n=6) received both treatments with a 1-week interval after 10 days of meniscectomy. Clinical evaluations were conducted using the Clinical Lameness Score (CLS), radiographic with X-ray using OA score by Innes et al, while macroscopic evaluation by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores. Results Lameness parameter scored lowest in G3 significantly (2.0±0.0 VS 2.7±0.52 VS 2.7±0.52; p=0.024) at the second month although the overall CLS score did not significantly differ at the 3rd month. The best improvement of conventional total OA radiographic score at the 3rd month compared to all groups (5.2±1.17 vs 6.3±0.82 vs 6.7±1.03; p=0.053). Macroscopic OARSI evaluation showed no difference (p=0.711). Conclusions Combined repeated exosome Ad-MSC and HA IA injection proven to delay OA progression, however longer duration of follow up is required to evaluate its long-term effect.

                The importance of urban health in achieving global and planetary health goals is increasingly recognized. Cities offer important opportunities to improve health while also presenting significant challenges. As our understanding of and evidence for the importance of determinants of health beyond health care have grown, the need for urban health policies and actions that transcend disciplinary and sectoral boundaries and involve multiple stakeholders in urban decision-making has become clearer. Current urban health practice builds on decades of conceptual and operational work. This paper traces the evolution of the urban health paradigm through research, policy and practice in recent decades. We suggest that, despite the proven utility of urban health as a paradigm and its conceptual and practical evolution for effective urban health governance, significant challenges remain, especially related to implementing the systems approaches needed to improve health amidst the complexity of urban dynamics.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A key question for understanding the function of the hippocampus in memory is how information is recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. This was investigated in a neuronal network model of the hippocampal system in which “What” and “Where” neuronal firing rate vectors were applied to separate neocortical modules, which then activated entorhinal cortex “What” and “Where” modules, then the dentate gyrus, then CA3, then CA1, then the entorhinal cortex, and then the backprojections to the neocortex. A rate model showed that the whole system could be trained to recall “Where” in the neocortex from “What” applied as a retrieval cue to the neocortex, and could in principle be trained up towards the theoretical capacity determined largely by the number of synapses onto any one neuron divided by the sparseness of the representation. The trained synaptic weights were then imported into an integrate-and-fire simulation of the same architecture, which showed that the time from presenting a retrieval cue to a neocortex module to recall the whole memory in the neocortex is approximately 100 ms. This is sufficiently fast for the backprojection synapses to be trained onto the still active neocortical neurons during storage of the episodic memory, and this is needed for recall to operate correctly to the neocortex. These simulations also showed that the long loop neocortex–hippocampus–neocortex that operates continuously in time may contribute to complete recall in the neocortex; but that this positive feedback long loop makes the whole dynamical system inherently liable to a pathological increase in neuronal activity. Important factors that contributed to stability included increased inhibition in CA3 and CA1 to keep the firing rates low; and temporal adaptation of the neuronal firing and of active synapses, which are proposed to make an important contribution to stabilizing runaway excitation in cortical circuits in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90851">Structure and dynamics of cholesterol-mediated aquaporin-0 arrays and implications for lipid rafts</a></h4>

              
                Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) tetramers form square arrays in lens membranes through a yet unknown mechanism, but lens membranes are enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Here, we determined electron crystallographic structures of AQP0 in sphingomyelin/cholesterol membranes and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish that the observed cholesterol positions represent those seen around an isolated AQP0 tetramer and that the AQP0 tetramer largely defines the location and orientation of most of its associated cholesterol molecules. At a high concentration, cholesterol increases the hydrophobic thickness of the annular lipid shell around AQP0 tetramers, which may thus cluster to mitigate the resulting hydrophobic mismatch. Moreover, neighboring AQP0 tetramers sandwich a cholesterol deep in the center of the membrane. MD simulations show that the association of two AQP0 tetramers is necessary to maintain the deep cholesterol in its position and that the deep cholesterol increases the force required to laterally detach two AQP0 tetramers, not only due to protein–protein contacts but also due to increased lipid–protein complementarity. Since each tetramer interacts with four such ‘glue’ cholesterols, avidity effects may stabilize larger arrays. The principles proposed to drive AQP0 array formation could also underlie protein clustering in lipid rafts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94245">CyAbrB2 is a nucleoid-associated protein in Synechocystis controlling hydrogenase expression during fermentation</a></h4>

              
                The <i>hox</i> operon in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, encoding bidirectional hydrogenase responsible for H<sub>2</sub> production, is transcriptionally upregulated under microoxic conditions. Although several regulators for <i>hox</i> transcription have been identified, their dynamics and higher-order DNA structure of <i>hox</i> region in microoxic conditions remain elusive. We focused on key regulators for the <i>hox</i> operon: cyAbrB2, a conserved regulator in cyanobacteria, and SigE, an alternative sigma factor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that cyAbrB2 binds to the <i>hox</i> promoter region under aerobic conditions, with its binding being flattened in microoxic conditions. Concurrently, SigE exhibited increased localization to the <i>hox</i> promoter under microoxic conditions. Genome-wide analysis revealed that cyAbrB2 binds broadly to AT-rich genome regions and represses gene expression. Moreover, we demonstrated the physical interactions of the <i>hox</i> promoter region with its distal genomic loci. Both the transition to microoxic conditions and the absence of cyAbrB2 influenced the chromosomal interaction. From these results, we propose that cyAbrB2 is a cyanobacterial nucleoid-associated protein (NAP), modulating chromosomal conformation, which blocks RNA polymerase from the <i>hox</i> promoter in aerobic conditions. We further infer that cyAbrB2, with altered localization pattern upon microoxic conditions, modifies chromosomal conformation in microoxic conditions, which allows SigE-containing RNA polymerase to access the <i>hox</i> promoter. The coordinated actions of this NAP and the alternative sigma factor are crucial for the proper <i>hox</i> expression in microoxic conditions. Our results highlight the impact of cyanobacterial chromosome conformation and NAPs on transcription, which have been insufficiently investigated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94485">Future movement plans interact in sequential arm movements</a></h4>

              
                Real-world actions often comprise a series of movements that cannot be entirely planned before initiation. When these actions are executed rapidly, the planning of multiple future movements needs to occur simultaneously with the ongoing action. How the brain solves this task remains unknown. Here, we address this question with a new sequential arm reaching paradigm that manipulates how many future reaches are available for planning while controlling execution of the ongoing reach. We show that participants plan at least two future reaches simultaneously with an ongoing reach. Further, the planning processes of the two future reaches are not independent of one another. Evidence that the planning processes interact is twofold. First, correcting for a visual perturbation of the ongoing reach target is slower when more future reaches are planned. Second, the curvature of the current reach is modified based on the next reach only when their planning processes temporally overlap. These interactions between future planning processes may enable smooth production of sequential actions by linking individual segments of a long sequence at the level of motor planning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96832">The Arthropoda-specific Tramtrack group BTB protein domains use previously unknown interface to form hexamers</a></h4>

              
                BTB (Bric-a-brack, Tramtrack and Broad Complex) is a diverse group of protein-protein interaction domains found within metazoan proteins. Transcription factors contain a dimerizing BTB subtype with a characteristic N-terminal extension. The Tramtrack group (TTK) is a distinct type of BTB domain, which can multimerize. Single-particle cryo-EM microscopy revealed that the TTK-type BTB domains assemble into a hexameric structure consisting of three canonical BTB dimers connected through a previously uncharacterized interface. We demonstrated that the TTK-type BTB domains are found only in Arthropods and have undergone lineage-specific expansion in modern insects. The <i>Drosophila</i> genome encodes 24 transcription factors with TTK-type BTB domains, whereas only four have non‑TTK‑type BTB domains. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the TTK-type BTB domains have an unusually broad potential for heteromeric associations presumably through dimer-dimer interaction interface. Thus, the TTK-type BTB domains are a structurally and functionally distinct group of protein domains specific to Arthropodan transcription factors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99263">Differential regulation of the proteome and phosphosproteome along the dorso-ventral axis of the early Drosophila embryo</a></h4>

              
                The initially homogeneous epithelium of the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo differentiates into regional subpopulations with different behaviours and physical properties that are needed for morphogenesis. The factors at top of the genetic hierarchy that control these behaviours are known, but many of their targets are not. To understand how proteins work together to mediate differential cellular activities, we studied in an unbiased manner the proteomes and phosphoproteomes of the three main cell populations along the dorso-ventral axis during gastrulation using mutant embryos that represent the different populations. We detected 6111 protein groups and 6259 phosphosites of which 3398 and 3433 respectively, were differentially regulated. The changes in phosphosite abundance did not correlate with changes in host protein abundance, showing phosphorylation to be a regulatory step during gastrulation. Hierarchical clustering of protein groups and phosphosites identified clusters that contain known fate determinants such as Doc1, Sog, Snail and Twist. The recovery of the appropriate known marker proteins in each of the different mutants we used validated the approach, but also revealed that two mutations that both interfere with the dorsal fate pathway, <i>Toll<sup>10B</sup></i> and <i>serpin27a<sup>ex</sup></i> do this in very different manners. Diffused network analyses within each cluster point to microtubule components as one of the main groups of regulated proteins. Functional studies on the role of microtubules provide the proof of principle that microtubules have different functions in different domains along the DV axis of the embryo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94972">The genetic architecture of the load linked to dominant and recessive self-incompatibility alleles in Arabidopsis halleri and Arabidopsis lyrata</a></h4>

              
                The long-term balancing selection acting on mating types or sex-determining genes is expected to lead to the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the tightly linked chromosomal segments that are locally ‘sheltered’ from purifying selection. However, the factors determining the extent of this accumulation are poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of variations in the intensity of balancing selection along a dominance hierarchy formed by alleles at the sporophytic self-incompatibility system of the Brassicaceae to compare the pace at which linked deleterious mutations accumulate among them. We first experimentally measured the phenotypic manifestation of the linked load at three different levels of the dominance hierarchy. We then sequenced and phased polymorphisms in the chromosomal regions linked to 126 distinct copies of <i>S</i>-alleles in two populations of <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> and three populations of <i>Arabidopsis lyrata</i>. We find that linkage to the <i>S</i>-locus locally distorts phylogenies over about 10–30 kb along the chromosome. The more intense balancing selection on dominant <i>S</i>-alleles results in greater fixation of linked deleterious mutations, while recessive <i>S</i>-alleles accumulate more linked deleterious mutations that are segregating. Hence, the structure rather than the overall magnitude of the linked genetic load differs between dominant and recessive <i>S</i>-alleles. Our results have consequences for the long-term evolution of new <i>S</i>-alleles, the evolution of dominance modifiers between them, and raise the question of why the non-recombining regions of some sex and mating type chromosomes expand over evolutionary times while others, such as the <i>S</i>-locus of the Brassicaceae, remain restricted to small chromosomal regions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96699">Additional feedforward mechanism of Parkin activation via binding of phospho-UBL and RING0 in trans</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function Parkin mutations lead to early-onset of Parkinson’s disease. Parkin is an auto-inhibited ubiquitin E3 ligase activated by dual phosphorylation of its ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain and ubiquitin by the PINK1 kinase. Herein, we demonstrate a competitive binding of the phospho-Ubl and RING2 domains towards the RING0 domain, which regulates Parkin activity. We show that phosphorylated Parkin can complex with native Parkin, leading to the activation of autoinhibited native Parkin in <i>trans</i>. Furthermore, we show that the activator element (ACT) of Parkin is required to maintain the enzyme kinetics, and the removal of ACT slows the enzyme catalysis. We also demonstrate that ACT can activate Parkin in <i>trans</i> but less efficiently than when present in the <i>cis</i> molecule. Furthermore, the crystal structure reveals a donor ubiquitin binding pocket in the linker connecting REP and RING2, which plays a crucial role in Parkin activity.

	<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been widely used to study the mechanisms that underlie motor output. Yet, the extent to which TMS acts upon the cortical neurons implicated in volitional motor commands and the focal limitations of TMS remain subject to debate. Previous research links TMS to improved subject performance in behavioral tasks, including a bias in phoneme discrimination. Our study replicates this result, which implies a causal relationship between electro-magnetic stimulation and psychomotor activity, and tests whether TMS-facilitated psychomotor activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) may thus serve as a superior input for neural decoding. First, we illustrate that site-specific TMS elicits a double dissociation in discrimination ability for two phoneme categories. Next, we perform a classification analysis on the EEG signals recorded during TMS and find a dissociation between the stimulation site and decoding accuracy that parallels the behavioral results. We observe weak to moderate evidence for the alternative hypothesis in a Bayesian analysis of group means, with more robust results upon stimulation to a brain region governing multiple phoneme features. Overall, task accuracy was a significant predictor of decoding accuracy for phoneme categories (F(1,135) = 11.51, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0009) and individual phonemes (F(1,119) = 13.56, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0003), providing new evidence for a causal link between TMS, neural function, and behavior.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the <i>C9orf72</i> gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A large body of evidence implicates dipeptide repeats (DPRs) proteins as one of the main drivers of neuronal injury in cell and animal models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pure repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD was generated. Embryonic and adult transgenic zebrafish lysates were investigated for the presence of RAN-translated DPR species and adult-onset motor deficits. Using C9orf72 cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish, hypothermic-therapeutic temperature management (TTM) was explored as a potential therapeutic option for C9orf72-ALS/FTD.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we describe a pure RAN translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD that exhibits significant RAN-translated DPR pathology and progressive motor decline. We further demonstrate that hypothermic-TTM results in a profound reduction in DPR species in C9orf72-ALS/FTD cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The transgenic model detailed in this paper provides a medium throughput in vivo research tool to further investigate the role of RAN-translation in C9orf72-ALS/FTD and further understand the mechanisms that underpin neuroprotective strategies. Hypothermic-TTM presents a viable therapeutic avenue to explore in the context of C9orf72-ALS/FTD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study examines associations among fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) injury patterns, etiologies, and outcomes in fetal intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study of IPH diagnosed on fetal MRI (1996–2022). IPH and associated abnormalities were categorized by 2 pediatric neuroradiologists; electronic medical records were reviewed by 2 pediatric neurologists to classify etiology and outcomes including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, developmental delay, and death.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-four fetuses with IPH were identified (34 singleton and 10 twin gestations) with MRI at median 24 weeks gestation (interquartile range [IQR] = 22–28 weeks). IPH was commonly supratentorial (84%) and focal (50%) or focal with diffuse injury (43%) and was often associated with germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH; 75%) and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; 52%). An etiology was identified in 75%, including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS, n = 10), COL4A1/2 variants (n = 8), or other fetal/maternal conditions (n = 15). COL4A1/2 variants were associated with focal IPH and the presence of hemorrhagic porencephaly, and intrauterine transfusion was associated with infratentorial hemorrhage. Twenty-two fetuses were liveborn, and 18 pregnancies were terminated. Among those with follow-up ≥ 12 months (median = 7 years), 12 of 13 had cerebral palsy, 6 of 13 had developmental delay, and 5 of 13 had epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>An etiology for fetal IPH with or without GMH-IVH is identified in most cases in our cohort and is commonly TTTS, COL4A1/2 variants, or other maternal/fetal comorbidities. Pattern of fetal IPH on MRI is associated with etiology. Cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental impairment were common in liveborn infants. Genetic studies should be considered in cases of fetal IPH without an otherwise apparent cause. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Yang et al. reveal how accumulated endogenous toxins—aldehydes—produced by a Western diet disrupts TGF-β signaling, leading to MASLD/MASH and cancer. Targeting SPTBN1 (SMAD3 adaptor) blocks aldehyde-induced SPTBN1 cleavage and adduct formation, offering a non-toxic approach to achieving beneficial responses in patients with MetS, MASH, and cancer.

	<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), computer simulations, and virtual reality (VR) are increasingly becoming accessible tools that can be leveraged to implement training protocols and educational resources. Typical assessment tools related to sensory and neural processing associated with task performance in virtual environments often rely on self-reported surveys, unlike electroencephalography (EEG), which is often used to compare the effects of different types of sensory feedback (e.g., auditory, visual, and haptic) in simulation environments in an objective manner. However, it can be challenging to know which aspects of the EEG signal represent the impact of different types of sensory feedback on neural processing. Machine learning approaches offer a promising direction for identifying EEG signal features that differentiate the impact of different types of sensory feedback during simulation training. For the current study, machine learning techniques were applied to differentiate neural circuitry associated with haptic and non-haptic feedback in a simulated drilling task. Nine EEG channels were selected and analyzed, extracting different time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear features, where 360 features were tested (40 features per channel). A feature selection stage identified the most relevant features, including the Hurst exponent of 13&amp;amp;ndash;21 Hz, kurtosis of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, power spectral density of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, variance of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, and spectral entropy of 13&amp;amp;ndash;21 Hz. Using those five features, trials with haptic feedback were correctly identified from those without haptic feedback with an accuracy exceeding 90%, increasing to 99% when using 10 features. These results show promise for the future application of machine learning approaches to predict the impact of haptic feedback on neural processing during VR protocols involving drilling tasks, which can inform future applications of VR and simulation for occupational skill acquisition.</p>

	<p>During the period in which children learn to read and write, a gradual shift from right to left hemisphere dominance for language is typically seen. However, in children with dyslexia, a deviant pattern is described in the literature. As part of a larger longitudinal study (The Bergen Longitudinal Dyslexia Study), the present study aimed to assess this development from an early age before children learn to read and write. Dichotic listening (DL), which is a non-invasive test, was used to assess the development of brain laterality in a Typical group and a Dyslexia group. The participants received yearly sessions of evidence-based literacy training at ages 5 to 7. The Typical group showed increasing ear scores and a shift from no ear advantage in the Pre-literacy stage (age 6), indicative of no hemisphere dominance, to a right ear advantage, indicative of a left hemisphere dominance, in the Emergent literacy stage (age 8) and the Literacy stage (age 11). The Dyslexia group showed a different pattern, with a significant right ear advantage at age 6, indicative of a right hemisphere dominance, and increasing ear scores at ages 8 and 11; however, no ear dominance was observed in the Literacy stage. The results point to an effect of relevant, evidence-based training affecting both right and left hemispheres in dyslexia, which should form a basis for further research.</p>

	<p>Background: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is associated with seizures. We examined the impact of repeated seizures on the behavioral and molecular changes in male Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Methods: Seizures were induced by administering three flurothyl seizures per day across postnatal days (PD) 7&amp;amp;ndash;11, for a total of 15 seizures. In adulthood, mice were tested in a battery of behavioral tasks to assess long-term behavioral deficits. Results: The two-hit impact of a Fmr1 knockout and seizures resulted in decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test and a longer latency to their first nose poke (repetitive behavior). Seizures resulted in decreased activity, decreased repetitive behavior (grooming and rearings), and decreased social behavior, while they also increased habituation to auditory stimuli and increased freezing in delayed fear conditioning in both KO and control mice. KO mice displayed increased repetitive behavior in the open field task (clockwise revolutions) and repeated nose pokes, and decreased anxiety in the open field test. No differences in mTOR signaling were found. Conclusions: These findings further illuminate the long-term effects of synergistic impact of two hits on the developing brain.</p>

	<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been suggested as a possible treatment method for cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (pwAD), similar to multidomain cognitive training (CT). The effectiveness, however, of combining these techniques for pwAD remains controversial due to the variability in rTMS parameters, differences in CT protocol designs&amp;amp;mdash;many of which neglect the language domain&amp;amp;mdash;and the inclusion of patients at various stages of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) and with different types of dementia. The current review aims to evaluate the cognitive benefits of combining rTMS with CT, including language training, for individuals with mild to moderate AD. An extensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library with relevant terms, resulting in nine studies with a total of 290 participants [190 in the Active Group (AG) and 100 in the Control Group (CG)]. The comprehensive review of the articles revealed that the combined treatment improved global cognitive function, as well as neurocognitive, neuropsychiatric, and quality of life in the AG. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously, given the relatively small number of existing studies on this specific combination.</p>

	<p>Anhedonia constitutes a core symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) mediating the ultimate goal of MDD treatment: functional remission. Anhedonia is also present in other clinical populations, including patients with chronic pain. Recent data links anhedonia to insulin resistance (IR). Some researchers have underlined a different dimension of anhedonia as a temperament/personality trait. The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to explore the links between anhedonia (main outcome) and (1) IR, (2) temperamental, personality, and schizotypy traits (exposures). The study population included patients with MDD, fibromyalgia, and healthy controls. Participants were split into groups: (1) insulin resistant (IR[+] n = 69, HOMA-IR &amp;amp;ge; 2.1) and (2) insulin sensitive (IR[&amp;amp;minus;] n = 69, HOMA-IR &amp;amp;lt; 2.1). Anhedonia was significantly higher in the IR[+] group than the IR[&amp;amp;minus;] group. IR was a predictor of higher anhedonia levels. IR[+] vs. IR[&amp;amp;minus;] participants showed higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of hyperthymic affective temperaments, as well as conscientiousness and emotional stability personality traits. Depressive, irritable, and anxious temperaments, cognitive disorganization, and introvertive anhedonia positively predicted anhedonia, while hyperthymic temperament, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability traits negatively predicted anhedonia. IR partially mediated the relationship between depressive temperament and anhedonia. In sum, IR, affective temperaments, and personality traits are predictors of anhedonia.</p>

                Background Motorcycle accidents can be particularly hazardous, as riders are exposed to various risk factors, such as high speeds, lack of protective enclosures, and limited safety features. Aim of the study To describe the ocular injuries associated with motorcycled accidents presented to tertiary hospitals and forensic centers in Iraq. Patients and methods The study was conducted in three Teaching hospitals and forensic centers in Baghdad and Al-Qadisiyah in Iraq. Information regarding ocular injuries, recorded and classified according to the International Ocular Trauma Classification, was gathered from motorcycle crash injuries that were presented to the emergency departments of these facilities from June 1, 2019, to June 1, 2023 Results The study involved 335 ophthalmological accidents; the mean age of the patients was 27.84± 9.6 years, most of them were males (96.7%), and there were only 11 females as passengers, 39 (11.6%) had injuries in both eyes. Lesions involving the periorbita, lids, and conjunctiva comprised most of the findings. There were 60.9% of patients with lid lacerations with or without sub-conjunctival bleeding, 22.1% with corneoscleral injury, and 17.9% with commotio retinae. It was the leading cause of decreased visual acuity, with 9% having lens capsule damage with or without iris prolapse and 8.1% having a ruptured capsule, 55.82% of patients had a mild injury, 27.16% had a moderate injury, and 17.01% had a severe injury. Conclusion Eye injury associated with motorcycle accidents mainly affects males in their youth age and has serious outcomes, sometimes ending with blindness.

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The main purpose of this study was to explore experiences of women who survived pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in Shashemene referral hospital and Melka Oda general hospital, 2021. Design: An institution-based exploratory qualitative study with a descriptive phenomenological study design Setting: The present study was conducted in Shashemene referral hospital and Melka Oda general hospital from March 03 to May 18, 2021. Participants: A total of 17 individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with women who experienced and survived pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis using Atlas-ti software. Result: The present study revealed that women’s level of awareness on raised blood pressure and or convulsion occurring during pregnancy was poor. Barriers that limit pregnant women from getting treatment at the earliest point included misconception, lack of insight, failure to accept counseling from health care providers, low income, and influence from husbands. Discussions with the women in this study showed that these mothers were not counseled on danger signs during antenatal care check-ups. Almost all of the women were very concerned and frustrated due to their diagnosis. Conclusions: Women’s awareness of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia was poor and antenatal care was not offered as per expected quality. Improving awareness of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and enhancing the quality of antenatal care is essential.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-15/v2?src=rss">Facilitation of practical work in Natural Sciences: experiences and approaches of junior teachers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study delved into the experiences and approaches employed by junior teachers in facilitating practical work in Natural Sciences during the teaching and learning process. In South Africa, Grade 7 marks the final year of primary school education, with learners typically aged between 11 to 13. The researchers noted significant challenges faced by junior Grade 7 teachers in preparing, organizing, and carrying out practical work within the context of teaching and learning in Natural Sciences. Methods In the present study, a qualitative multiple-case study design was employed. Three grade 7 Natural Sciences junior-level teachers were purposefully selected as participants. Data was gathered through classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis. Results The study findings revealed that certain grade 7 junior Natural Sciences teachers found it challenging to manage practical work during teaching and learning. Some teachers also faced difficulties in maintaining discipline during practical work and demonstrations, both inside and outside the classroom. To cope with the demands of facilitating practical work in Natural Sciences teaching and learning, teachers employed various approaches, such as group work, observations, demonstrations, illustrations, projects, and inquiry-based scientific investigations. Conclusion It is recommended that teachers should receive professional training on effectively facilitating practical work to support the new teaching and learning methods outlined in the Curriculum Assessment Policy Statement. They should also be equipped with pedagogical content knowledge to help them achieve the goals of practical work in teaching and learning Natural Sciences.

                Background Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) encompass a heterogenous group of auto-immune diseases. The identification of myositis specific antibodies (MSA) and their associations with distinct phenotypes has improved the categorization of these conditions. Objective The aim of this study was to describe and report the clinical and immunological characteristics of IIM among Tunisian patients. Method A retrospective study conducted in the internal medicine department at the Rabta University Hospital Center over 22 years, including adult patients with IIM according to the American college of rheumatology/European league against rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria and Connors’ criteria for anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS). Inclusion body myositis and myositis associated with other conditions were excluded. Demographic, clinical, and immunological characteristics were analyzed and compared. Results Ninety-seven patients were included (Male/female ratio= 0.36, mean age = 48.4 +- 13.8 years). Muscular involvement was present in 88% of patients, affecting locomotor muscles (88%), gastrointestinal (43%), laryngeal (10%), cardiac (8%), and respiratory (1%) systems. Muscle weakness was primarily noted in the pelvic girdle (81%), scapular region (74%), axial muscles (20%), and distal muscles (5%). Myolysis was observed in 77% of patients, and histological evidence of myositis in 73%. Diffuse interstitial pneumonia (DIP) was present in 45% of patients, cutaneous involvement in 85%, and articular involvement in 48%. MSAs were detected in 52% of patients. Analysis revealed significantly higher frequencies of amyopathic forms, DIP, palmar hyperkeratosis, and articular involvement in the ASS group. The DM group exhibited higher frequencies of gastrointestinal signs, Gottron’s papules, heliotrope rash, photosensitive rashes, ulcerations, and skin necrosis. The NAM group had higher frequencies of gastrointestinal signs, myolysis, and lower frequencies of DIP and cutaneous involvement. Conclusion Our findings corroborate previously established clinico-immunological associations reported in the literature underscoring the need for a combined clinico-serological approach in classifying IIM.

                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with early diagnosis and risk factor identification crucial for improving outcomes. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measurements have emerged as promising tools in breast cancer diagnostics. However, the influence of hormonal status on these measurements remains unclear. Objective This scoping review aims to synthesize current evidence on how hormonal changes in pre- and post-menopausal women influence ADC values of benign, malignant, and fibroglandular breast tissues. Method Following the Arksey and O’Malley framework, we conducted a comprehensive search of Scopus, Embase, and PubMed databases for relevant studies published between January 2000 and 2021. Inclusion criteria encompassed 1.5 Tesla MRI studies reporting ADC values in female subjects, considering menopausal status. Results Six studies meeting the inclusion criteria, involving 612 patients, were analyzed. Findings suggest that menopausal status may influence ADC values, with postmenopausal women generally showing lower ADC values in both normal fibroglandular tissue and breast lesions. The impact of menstrual cycle phases on ADC values was less consistent across studies. Conclusions This review highlights the potential influence of hormonal status on ADC values in breast tissues. While DWI with ADC mapping shows promise as a reliable diagnostic tool across different hormonal states, further research is needed to fully understand and account for hormonal influences on ADC measurements. Future studies should focus on longitudinal designs, standardization of DWI protocols, and integration of hormonal status information into breast cancer risk assessment models.

                <p>by Tao Wang, Linlin Zhuo, Yifan Chen, Xiangzheng Fu, Xiangxiang Zeng, Quan Zou</p>

The identification of cancer driver genes (CDGs) poses challenges due to the intricate interdependencies among genes and the influence of measurement errors and noise. We propose a novel energy-constrained diffusion (ECD)-based model for identifying CDGs, termed ECD-CDGI. This model is the first to design an ECD-Attention encoder by combining the ECD technique with an attention mechanism. ECD-Attention encoder excels at generating robust gene representations that reveal the complex interdependencies among genes while reducing the impact of data noise. We concatenate topological embedding extracted from gene-gene networks through graph transformers to these gene representations. We conduct extensive experiments across three testing scenarios. Extensive experiments show that the ECD-CDGI model possesses the ability to not only be proficient in identifying known CDGs but also efficiently uncover unknown potential CDGs. Furthermore, compared to the GNN-based approach, the ECD-CDGI model exhibits fewer constraints by existing gene-gene networks, thereby enhancing its capability to identify CDGs. Additionally, ECD-CDGI is open-source and freely available. We have also launched the model as a complimentary online tool specifically crafted to expedite research efforts focused on CDGs identification.

                <p>by Daniel Seeler, Nastasja Grdseloff, Claudia Jasmin Rödel, Charlotte Kloft, Salim Abdelilah-Seyfried, Wilhelm Huisinga</p>

Endothelial cells, which line the lumen of blood vessels, locally sense and respond to blood flow. In response to altered blood flow dynamics during early embryonic development, these cells undergo shape changes that directly affect vessel geometry: In the dorsal aorta of zebrafish embryos, elongation of endothelial cells in the direction of flow between 48 and 72 hours post fertilization (hpf) reduces the vessel’s diameter. This remodeling process requires Endoglin; excessive endothelial cell growth in the protein’s absence results in vessel diameter increases. To understand how these changes in vessel geometry emerge from morphological changes of individual endothelial cells, we developed a novel mathematical approach that allows 3D reconstruction and quantification of both dorsal aorta geometry and endothelial cell surface morphology. Based on fluorescently marked endothelial cell contours, we inferred cross-sections of the dorsal aorta that accounted for dorsal flattening of the vessel. By projection of endothelial cell contours onto the estimated cross-sections and subsequent triangulation, we finally reconstructed 3D surfaces of the individual cells. By simultaneously reconstructing vessel cross-sections and cell surfaces, we found in an exploratory analysis that morphology varied between endothelial cells located in different sectors of the dorsal aorta in both wild-type and Endoglin-deficient zebrafish embryos: In wild-types, ventral endothelial cells were smaller and more elongated in flow direction than dorsal endothelial cells at both 48 hpf and 72 hpf. Although dorsal and ventral endothelial cells in Endoglin-deficient embryos had similar sizes at 48 hpf, dorsal endothelial cells were much larger at 72 hpf. In Endoglin-deficient embryos, elongation in flow direction increased between 48 hpf and 72 hpf in ventral endothelial cells but hardly changed in dorsal endothelial cells. Hereby, we provide evidence that dorsal endothelial cells contribute most to the disparate changes in dorsal aorta diameter in wild-type and Endoglin-deficient embryos between 48 hpf and 72 hpf.

                Background Twenty soybean genotypes were screened for Soybean yellow mosaic virus (YMV) identification which were collected from the Genetics and plant breeding farm laboratory. Methods To evaluate genetic studies of the chosen materials, the use of a net house assay upon sap inoculation made it easier to determine the trend of the Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) in a controlled environment. Younger leaves from these plants were gathered and used for molecular analysis. Results Six genotypes were identified with semi-resistant disease reactions. Yellow mosaic virus-resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes were distinguished using a soybean “Rsv1-h” gene-based primer pair. To discover the existence of the Rsv-1-h gene responsible for YMV resistance, a genetic diversity panel of 15 soybean genotypes was investigated with two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The BARCSOYSSR_13_1115 and BARCSOYSSR_13_1173 primer sets were employed to validate the desired genes in these genotypes. Conclusion The genotypes HIHS-WIHS, MINA-HAI, Shohag, G-2120, BRAGG, and BS-3 presented the major gene Rsv1-h, which is said to be essential for yellow mosaic virus resistance and can provide better yield also than other genotypes. The six soybean genotypes with the Rsv1-h gene may be resistant to mosaic virus and could be exploited as a source of improved breeding material in the future.

                Background The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a pressing need for exploring new natural compounds with innovative mechanisms to replace existing antibiotics. Bacteriocins offer promising alternatives for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies in livestock, aquaculture, and human health. Specifically, those produced by LAB are recognized as GRAS and QPS. Methods In this study was used a deep learning neural network for binary classification of bacteriocin amino acid sequences, distinguishing those produced by LAB. The features were extracted using the k-mer method and vector embedding. Ten different groups were tested, combining embedding vectors and k-mers: EV, ‘EV+3-mers’, ‘EV+5-mers’, ‘EV+7-mers’, ‘EV+15-mers’, ‘EV+20-mers’, ‘EV+3-mers+5-mers’, ‘EV+3-mers+7-mers’, ‘EV+5-mers+7-mers’, and ‘EV+15-mers+20-mers’. Results Five sets of 100 characteristic k-mers unique to bacteriocins produced by LAB were obtained for values of k = 3, 5, 7, 15, and 20. Significant difference was observed between using only and concatenation. Specially, ‘5-mers+7-mers+EV ’ group showed superior accuracy and loss results. Employing k-fold cross-validation with k=30, the average results for loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were 9.90%, 90.14%, 90.30%, 90.10%, and 90.10% respectively. Folder 22 stood out with 8.50% loss, 91.47% accuracy, and 91.00% precision, recall, and F1 score. Conclusions The model developed in this study achieved consistent results with those seen in the reviewed literature. It outperformed some studies by 3-10%. The lists of characteristic k-mers pave the way to identify new bacteriocins that could be valuable for therapeutic and preventive strategies within the livestock, aquaculture industries, and potentially in human health.

                Qiao et al. investigate the rescue of mito-dysfunction from fibroblasts to adenoid cystic carcinoma by tunneling-nanotube-mediated mitochondrial transfer and permanent cell fusion. Besides rescue, cell fusion promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and exacerbates cancer cell malignancy. Both rescue processes are “selectively” driven by mitochondrial dysfunction and TMEM16F-mediated phosphatidylserine externalization, unveiling potential therapeutic targets.

                Wang et al. revealed the regulatory mechanisms of the tumor metabolite lactate in promoting immune escape in HNSCC. Lactate accumulation facilitates H3K9 lactylation and downstream IL-11 activation, leading to exhaustion of CD8+ T cells through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94698">Defining cell type-specific immune responses in a mouse model of allergic contact dermatitis by single-cell transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), a prevalent inflammatory skin disease, is elicited upon repeated skin contact with protein-reactive chemicals through a complex and poorly characterized cellular network between immune cells and skin resident cells. Here, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the murine hapten-elicited model of ACD reveals that upon elicitation of ACD, infiltrated CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes were primarily the IFNγ-producing type 1 central memory phenotype. In contrast, type 2 cytokines (IL4 and IL13) were dominantly expressed by basophils, IL17A was primarily expressed by δγ T cells, and IL1β was identified as the primary cytokine expressed by activated neutrophils/monocytes and macrophages. Furthermore, analysis of skin resident cells identified a sub-cluster of dermal fibroblasts with preadipocyte signature as a prominent target for IFNγ<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and dermal source for key T cell chemokines CXCL9/10. IFNγ treatment shifted dermal fibroblasts from collagen-producing to CXCL9/10-producing, which promoted T cell polarization toward the type-1 phenotype through a CXCR3-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, targeted deletion of <i>Ifngr1</i> in dermal fibroblasts in mice reduced <i>Cxcl9/10</i> expression, dermal infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell, and alleviated ACD inflammation in mice. Finally, we showed that IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CXCL10-producing dermal fibroblasts co-enriched in the dermis of human ACD skin. Together, our results define the cell type-specific immune responses in ACD, and recognize an indispensable role of dermal fibroblasts in shaping the development of type-1 skin inflammation through the IFNGR-CXCR3 signaling circuit during ACD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97908">Adverse impact of female reproductive signaling on age-dependent neurodegeneration after mild head trauma in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Environmental insults, including mild head trauma, significantly increase the risk of neurodegeneration. However, it remains challenging to establish a causative connection between early-life exposure to mild head trauma and late-life emergence of neurodegenerative deficits, nor do we know how sex and age compound the outcome. Using a <i>Drosophila</i> model, we demonstrate that exposure to mild head trauma causes neurodegenerative conditions that emerge late in life and disproportionately affect females. Increasing age-at-injury further exacerbates this effect in a sexually dimorphic manner. We further identify sex peptide signaling as a key factor in female susceptibility to post-injury brain deficits. RNA sequencing highlights a reduction in innate immune defense transcripts specifically in mated females during late life. Our findings establish a causal relationship between early head trauma and late-life neurodegeneration, emphasizing sex differences in injury response and the impact of age-at-injury. Finally, our findings reveal that reproductive signaling adversely impacts female response to mild head insults and elevates vulnerability to late-life neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90061">MDverse, shedding light on the dark matter of molecular dynamics simulations</a></h4>

              
                The rise of open science and the absence of a global dedicated data repository for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has led to the accumulation of MD files in generalist data repositories, constituting the <i>dark matter of MD</i> — data that is technically accessible, but neither indexed, curated, or easily searchable. Leveraging an original search strategy, we found and indexed about 250,000 files and 2000 datasets from Zenodo, Figshare and Open Science Framework. With a focus on files produced by the Gromacs MD software, we illustrate the potential offered by the mining of publicly available MD data. We identified systems with specific molecular composition and were able to characterize essential parameters of MD simulation such as temperature and simulation length, and could identify model resolution, such as all-atom and coarse-grain. Based on this analysis, we inferred metadata to propose a search engine prototype to explore the MD data. To continue in this direction, we call on the community to pursue the effort of sharing MD data, and to report and standardize metadata to reuse this valuable matter.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85742">Quantitative modeling of the emergence of macroscopic grid-like representations</a></h4>

              
                When subjects navigate through spatial environments, grid cells exhibit firing fields that are arranged in a triangular grid pattern. Direct recordings of grid cells from the human brain are rare. Hence, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies proposed an indirect measure of entorhinal grid-cell activity, quantified as hexadirectional modulation of fMRI activity as a function of the subject’s movement direction. However, it remains unclear how the activity of a population of grid cells may exhibit hexadirectional modulation. Here, we use numerical simulations and analytical calculations to suggest that this hexadirectional modulation is best explained by head-direction tuning aligned to the grid axes, whereas it is not clearly supported by a bias of grid cells toward a particular phase offset. Firing-rate adaptation can result in hexadirectional modulation, but the available cellular data is insufficient to clearly support or refute this option. The magnitude of hexadirectional modulation furthermore depends considerably on the subject’s navigation pattern, indicating that future fMRI studies could be designed to test which hypothesis most likely accounts for the fMRI measure of grid cells. Our findings also underline the importance of quantifying the properties of human grid cells to further elucidate how hexadirectional modulations of fMRI activity may emerge.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96992">Inhibition of ULK1/2 and KRASG12C controls tumor growth in preclinical models of lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                Mutational activation of <i>KRAS</i> occurs commonly in lung carcinogenesis and, with the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of covalent inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> such as sotorasib or adagrasib, KRAS oncoproteins are important pharmacological targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, not all KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven NSCLCs respond to these inhibitors, and the emergence of drug resistance in those patients who do respond can be rapid and pleiotropic. Hence, based on a backbone of covalent inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, efforts are underway to develop effective combination therapies. Here, we report that the inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> signaling increases autophagy in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-expressing lung cancer cells. Moreover, the combination of DCC-3116, a selective ULK1/2 inhibitor, plus sotorasib displays cooperative/synergistic suppression of human KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and superior tumor control in vivo. Additionally, in genetically engineered mouse models of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven NSCLC, inhibition of either KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> or ULK1/2 decreases tumor burden and increases mouse survival. Consequently, these data suggest that ULK1/2-mediated autophagy is a pharmacologically actionable cytoprotective stress response to inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> in lung cancer.

	<p>It is challenging to differentiate between central nervous system (CNS) virus infections and neurological autoimmune diseases in the emergency department. Considering their different pathogenesis, we assume they differ in neuropsychiatric symptoms and laboratory results. A total of 80 patients were included in this study, 50 with CNS virus infections and 30 with CNS autoimmune diseases, confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A binary logistic regression model and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were employed to examine the discrimination between the two types of diseases based on neuropsychiatric symptoms and laboratory results. Compared to patients with neurological autoimmune diseases, patients with CNS virus infections had a higher incidence of abnormal behavior (p = 0.026) and abnormal sensation/thought (p = 0.029); higher total (p = 0.005), direct (p = 0.004), and indirect bilirubin (p = 0.004); and increased CSF cell (p = 0.01) and CSF white cell counts (p = 0.01). Patients with disturbance of consciousness and abnormal sensation/thought were 7.79-fold and 5.07-fold more likely to be diagnosed with CNS virus infections (OR = 7.79, p = 0.008; OR = 5.07, p = 0.032). Each unit increase in blood indirect bilirubin concentration and CSF white cell counts increased the risk of developing CNS virus infections by 1.25-fold and 1.01-fold (OR = 1.25, p = 0.016; OR = 1.01, p = 0.011). ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve was 88.0% (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Our study found that patients with CNS viral infections tend to have higher blood indirect bilirubin concentration, CSF leukocyte count, frequency of disorders of consciousness, and abnormal sensation and thought, which may help differentiate them from those with neurological autoimmune diseases.</p>

	<p>Background. Incidentally discovered low-grade gliomas (iLGGs) are very rare and little is still known about their associated functional imaging activation patterns, white-matter status, and plasticity potential. Recent studies shed light on several clinical factors responsible for the good clinical status observed in these patients versus those with their symptomatic counterpart (sLGGs), including small volume. Comparisons were typically carried out by comparing iLGGs with the wider and more heterogeneous sLGG group. In this study, we investigated whether iLGGs affect the brain differently from comparably small sLGGs. Method. Starting from a sample of 13 patients with iLGG, in the current comparative cross-sectional study, we identified a group of patients with sLGGs, primarily matched by lesion volume. We looked for potential differences between the two groups in language-related functional and structural parameters (the fMRI network associated with naming and white-matter fascicles). Results. The t-test did not show significant differences in the fMRI network, but these emerged when performing masking. No significant differences were observed at the white-matter level. Conclusions. Given that small volumes characterized both groups and that demographic variables were comparable, too, we hypothesized that differences between the two groups could be attributed to alternative lesion-related parameters. We discussed these findings from clinical and neurosurgical perspectives.</p>

	<p>Subinsular stroke (subIS) can occur between the penetrating middle cerebral artery (MCA) branches, which clinical and radiological findings sometimes encounter in patients after the recanalization of left proximal MCA occlusion. However, no supportive data are available to clarify this relationship. This study investigated whether the involvement of subIS can impact outcomes after successful reperfusion therapy. Data from 152 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy between 2019 and 2023 were collected. A 3-month functional independence defined as a modified Rankin Scale 0&amp;amp;ndash;2 (primary outcome) and influencing factors were analyzed retrospectively. Recanalization was achieved in 35 patients, of whom 11 (31%) developed subIS. Patients with subIS were older in age (81 vs. 75; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), had lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on admission (0.52 vs. 0.62; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and higher modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores (4 vs. 2; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than those without subIS. In a multivariate analysis, subIS was independently associated with a worse functional outcome (odds ratio: 10.5, p = 0.02). The cut-off value of the ADCs was 0.52 with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 64%, respectively. Subinsular ischemic lesions contribute to poor functional independence in patients after the successful recanalization of left MCA occlusion. The attenuation of the ADC value in these territories could be a valuable predictor of the outcome.</p>

	<p>Background: Road safety improvement is a governmental priority due to driver-caused accidents. Driving style variation affects safety, with emotional regulation being pivotal. However, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies show inconsistent prefrontal cortex activity during emotion processing. This study examines prefrontal cortex response to negative emotional stimuli, particularly traffic accident images, across drivers diverse in age and gender. Method: The study involved 118 healthy males (44.38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.98 years) and 84 females (38.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.60 years). The Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI) was used to assess driving behavior alongside fNIRS recordings. Participants viewed traffic accident and neutral images while prefrontal oxygenation was monitored. Results: Women rated traffic accidents (t-test = 2.43; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.016) and neutral images (t-test = 2.19; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.030) lower in valence than men. Arousal differences were significant for traffic accident images (t-test = &amp;amp;minus;3.06; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.002). correlational analysis found an inverse relationship between Dissociative scale scores and oxygenation (all p-values &amp;amp;le; 0.013). Greater prefrontal oxygenation occurred with neutral images compared to traffic accidents. Left hemisphere differences (t-test = 3.23; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) exceeded right hemisphere differences (t-test = 2.46; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.015). Subgroup analysis showed male participants to be driving these disparities. Among adaptive drivers, significant oxygenation differences between neutral and accident images were evident in both hemispheres (left: t-test = 2.72, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.009; right: t-test = 2.22, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.030). Conclusions: Male drivers with maladaptive driving styles, particularly dissociative ones, exhibit reduced prefrontal oxygenation when exposed to neutral and traffic accident images. This response was absent in female drivers, with no notable age-related differences.</p>

	<p>Hypnotic phenomena exhibit significant inter-individual variability, with some individuals consistently demonstrating efficient responses to hypnotic suggestions, while others show limited susceptibility. Recent neurophysiological studies have added to a growing body of research that shows variability in hypnotic susceptibility is linked to distinct neural characteristics. Building on this foundation, our previous work identified that individuals with high and low hypnotic susceptibility can be differentiated based on the arrhythmic activity observed in resting-state electrophysiology (rs-EEG) outside of hypnosis. However, because previous work has largely focused on mean spectral characteristics, our understanding of the variability over time of these features, and how they relate to hypnotic susceptibility, is still limited. Here we address this gap using a time-resolved assessment of rhythmic alpha peaks and arrhythmic components of the EEG spectrum both prior to and following hypnotic induction. Using multivariate pattern classification, we investigated whether these neural features differ between individuals with high and low susceptibility to hypnosis. Specifically, we used multivariate pattern classification to investigate whether these non-stationary neural features could distinguish between individuals with high and low susceptibility to hypnosis before and after a hypnotic induction. Our analytical approach focused on time-resolved spectral decomposition to capture the intricate dynamics of neural oscillations and their non-oscillatory counterpart, as well as Lempel&amp;amp;ndash;Ziv complexity. Our results show that variations in the alpha center frequency are indicative of hypnotic susceptibility, but this discrimination is only evident during hypnosis. Highly hypnotic-susceptible individuals exhibit higher variability in alpha peak center frequency. These findings underscore how dynamic changes in neural states related to alpha peak frequency represent a central neurophysiological feature of hypnosis and hypnotic susceptibility.</p>

	<p>Rapid identification of the type and origin of a stroke is crucial for prompt and appropriate treatment, which can significantly influences patient outcomes. We report a multidisciplinary management case involving a 76-year-old man who presented with left-sided weakness and mild dysarthria. Imaging revealed a completely occluded right internal carotid artery. Despite multiple endovascular recanalization attempts, adequate flow could not be achieved, leading to the decision to perform an open thrombo-endarterectomy. The patient underwent carotid endarterectomy with microsurgical techniques under general anesthesia. The atheroma plaque and central thrombus were removed, which reestablished flow. Continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring was utilized to ensure patient safety. The patient woke up without new deficits and was discharged for rehabilitation. Follow-up imaging confirmed arterial patency, and the patient eventually made an excellent recovery, including being independent over one and a half years. Emergent recanalization with carotid endarterectomy following a failed endovascular recanalization is both safe and feasible, emphasizing the need for collaboration between different treatment providers to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Our report highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and the advantages of a hybrid operating room in the treatment of acute complete carotid artery occlusion.</p>

	<p>Sigma-1R (S1R) is a ubiquitously distributed protein highly expressed in the brain and liver. It acts as a ligand-inducible chaperone protein localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. S1R participates in several signaling pathways that oversee diverse cellular and neurological functions, such as calcium and proteome homeostasis, neuronal activity, memory, and emotional regulation. Despite its crucial functions, S1R expression profile in the brain with respect to age and sex remains elusive. To shed light on this matter, we assessed S1R distribution in the mouse brain across different developmental stages, including juvenile, early adult, and middle-aged mice. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that S1R is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus in juvenile mice, particularly in CA1 and CA3 regions. Notably, S1R is not expressed in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus of juvenile mice. We observed dynamic changes in S1R levels during development, with most brain regions showing either an abrupt or gradual decline as mice transition from juveniles to adults. Sexual dimorphism is observed before puberty in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and during adulthood in the hippocampus and cortex.</p>

	<p>Accurate and generalizable classification of brain states is essential for understanding their neural underpinnings and improving clinical diagnostics. Traditionally, functional connectivity patterns and graph-theoretic metrics have been utilized. However, cortical gradient features, which reflect global brain organization, offer a complementary approach. We hypothesized that a machine learning model integrating these three feature sets would effectively discriminate between baseline and atypical brain states across a wide spectrum of conditions, even though the underlying neural mechanisms vary. To test this, we extracted features from brain states associated with three meta-conditions including unconsciousness (NREM2 sleep, propofol deep sedation, and propofol general anesthesia), psychedelic states induced by hallucinogens (subanesthetic ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide, and nitrous oxide), and neuropsychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia). We used support vector machine with nested cross-validation to construct our models. The soft voting ensemble model marked the average balanced accuracy (average of specificity and sensitivity) of 79% (62&amp;amp;ndash;98% across all conditions), outperforming individual base models (70&amp;amp;ndash;76%). Notably, our models exhibited varying degrees of transferability across different datasets, with performance being dependent on the specific brain states and feature sets used. Feature importance analysis across meta-conditions suggests that the underlying neural mechanisms vary significantly, necessitating tailored approaches for accurate classification of specific brain states. This finding underscores the value of our feature-integrated ensemble models, which leverage the strengths of multiple feature types to achieve robust performance across a broader range of brain states. While our approach offers valuable insights into the neural signatures of different brain states, future work is needed to develop and validate even more generalizable models that can accurately classify brain states across a wider array of conditions.</p>

	<p>This retrospective study assesses the efficacy and tolerability of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (anti-CGRP) therapy in adolescents and young adults (ages 12&amp;amp;ndash;21) with migraine and chronic daily headaches unresponsive to standard treatments. Migraines in this demographic significantly impair school performance, self-esteem, psychological well-being, and cognitive health. These young patients are also particularly sensitive to the side effects of conventional medications, which are often prescribed off-label and come with high insurance denial rates. Medication overuse, including analgesics, triptans, and NSAIDs, is prevalent due to treatment failures. Elevated plasma CGRP levels observed during migraines suggest that anti-CGRP therapies, successful in adult populations, may also benefit this younger age group. Over a three-year period, patients at a specialized pediatric headache center were evaluated for the impact of anti-CGRP treatments, including monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab) and small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists (ubrogepant, rimegepant, and atogepant), administered either alone or in combination with OnabotulinumtoxinA. Data were extracted from the hospital&amp;amp;rsquo;s electronic medical records, and patient progress was consistently documented using a structured template for each clinic visit. Additional patient satisfaction data were collected via telephone follow-ups and patient message reviews. The study included 23 patients, primarily treated for chronic migraine (CM) (78.3%), with a smaller subset addressing episodic migraine (EM), new daily persistent headaches (NDPHs), and post-traumatic headaches (PTHs). Comprehensive demographic and clinical data, including age, treatment duration, history of preventive treatment failures, and comorbidities like psychiatric conditions and sleep disorders, were collected. Anti-CGRP therapies, particularly when combined with traditional treatments or OnabotulinumtoxinA, resulted in significant improvements: 91.3% of patients experienced reduced migraine duration and intensity, 82.6% reported improvements in other bothersome symptoms, and 73.9% saw an improved response to rescue medications. Additionally, 78.3% of patients reported a reduction in their use of rescue medications per week by more than 50%, and emergency room visits were reduced for 56.5% of patients. Significant reductions in headache days were observed in 82.6% of patients after one month and 87% after three months, with nearly 40% experiencing more than a 50% reduction in both periods. The greatest benefits were observed in patients treated for more than six months. Adverse effects were minimal, with 95.7% of patients reporting no side effects, and patient satisfaction was high, with 69.6% opting to continue treatment. Overall, this study highlights the substantial potential of anti-CGRP therapy in improving outcomes for adolescents and young adults with CM and EM, offering a promising approach for a demographic that faces considerable challenges with conventional treatment options. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and expand clinical applications in this age group.</p>

                Background Most stroke survivors consider community ambulation an essential but unmet goal of their recovery. Historically, interventions to enhance community ambulation have focused on improving biomechanical impairments of gait; however, recent evidence suggests that biopsychosocial and environmental factors may impact community ambulation, even beyond more obvious physical impairments. The identification of factors that pose as significant facilitators or barriers to community ambulation may serve to guide stakeholders in designing relevant and evidence-based interventions for improving community ambulation post-stroke. Objective This review aims to map the type and extent of existing evidence on the physical, biopsychosocial, and environmental factors affecting community ambulation post-stroke. Additionally, this review will describe the various methods used to examine the extent to which stroke survivors are restricted to community ambulation. Methods Nine databases will be searched including CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science. We will include studies published in English during or after 2001. Studies that examine physical, biopsychosocial, and/or environmental factors affecting community ambulation in ambulatory adults at least six months post-stroke will be considered for inclusion. Studies that assess general physical activity or community mobility through transportation modes other than walking will be excluded. All identified records will be collated in citation management software, followed by steps of deduplication, title/abstract screening, and full-text reviews by at least two independent reviewers. The bibliographies of the extracted studies will also be reviewed for relevant articles. The extracted studies will be analyzed, critically appraised, and presented in tabular, narrative, and evidence map formats. Discussion The evidence gained will be used to build a framework for community ambulation, informing stakeholders to develop meaningful interventions to improve community ambulation. The mapped evidence will motivate future studies to develop holistic approaches that specifically focus on the most vital factors that influence post-stroke community ambulation.

                Background Activation of coagulation is a common phenomenon in patients with high-grade glioma, a primary malignant brain tumor. Objective Identify if there is an alteration in the coagulation profile in patients with high-grade glioma compared to other patients with benign brain tumors. Methods Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, ECOG at admission, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, platelet count, and blood panel results of 21 high-grade glioma patients (cases) and 42 meningioma patients (controls) from northern Peru were reviewed. Bivariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression were performed to determine which factors are associated with glioma. Results Both groups had high proportions of high blood pressure (29%) and diabetes mellitus (14%). According to multivariate analysis, altered values for prothrombin time, platelet count, and ECOG score were associated with glioma (p=0.01). Furthermore, alterations in the blood panel were observed in both cases and controls but failed to reach statistical significance. Conclusion Patients with high-grade glioma seem to suffer more from hypercoagulable states than other patients with benign brain tumors, suggesting careful vigilance and anticoagulant treatment for these patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-979/v1?src=rss">A systematic literature review of interpersonal communication strategies for optimizing government employee performance in the digital era [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This research shows that ongoing digital changes have a significant impact, particularly in the government sector. In addition to ease and benefits, such as operational efficiency and faster public services, new challenges, such as problems related to system integration, human resources (HR) limitations in the use of technology, and public access to digital technology, are also present. Therefore, this study aims to explore the role of interpersonal communication in enhancing employee performance in the context of HR development in the digital era by employing the systematic literature review (SLR) method and using data from electronic databases, specifically Google Scholar using the Harsing’s Publish or Perish (Windows GUI Edition) 8.2.3944.8118, the application can be accessed by downloading (https://publish-or-perish.en.softonic.com/), and Scopus (www.scopus.com) with a focus on journals published between 2017 and 2024. By identifying research gaps, research questions were developed to understand the influence of interpersonal communication on improving employee performance in the context of public services, necessary adaptations, and interpersonal communication strategies. This research provides comprehensive insights and practical solutions for the government sector to address the dynamics of the current and future digital era, based on data analysis from reliable database sources. The risk of bias in this study was addressed through the selection criteria and data extraction method. Thematic analysis and quantitative summarization were used for data presentation and synthesis. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that interpersonal communication has a significant positive influence on employee performance. The effect size estimates for each intervention and the corresponding confidence intervals are presented. To ensure honesty and accuracy in the interpretation of the results, potential evidence limitations and biases should be acknowledged transparently.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-526/v2?src=rss">Exploring the Potential for Tuition-Free Higher Education in South Africa: A Scoping Review [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The debate on tuition-free higher education has raged in South Africa since the #FeesMustFall protests at South African universities in 2015 and 2016. The government responded with a tuition-free education policy targeting students from households earning less than R350 000. However, the question remains can South Africa sustain a tuition-free education policy given its developing nation status and the levels of its GDP? This article sought to assess the feasibility of tuition-free higher education for all in South Africa. A scoping review was used, and fifteen articles about tuition-free higher education feasibility in South Africa were reviewed. The choice of the scoping review was due to the need for an understanding of the current state of play in research on the feasibility of tuition-free higher education in South Africa. The results suggest that tuition-free higher education for all is not feasible in South Africa. There seems to be a consensus that South Africa lacks the resources to finance tuition-free higher education for all. Tuition-free higher education is also viewed as a regressive tax on the poor given that the majority of students in higher education institutions come from middle and upper-income households. However, it is important to note that a distinction is drawn between tuition-free higher education for all and tuition-free higher education for the poor and academically deserving. The latter seems to receive support with some viewing it as a moral imperative in an unequal society such as South Africa’s. It is recommended that future studies approach the issue from an empirical standpoint whereby the GDP levels are assessed against higher education funding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-780/v2?src=rss">Evaluating the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa: a causal loop diagram approach  [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This research investigated the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, aiming to elucidate the complexities surrounding its implementation and impact. By employing a causal loop diagram approach, the study examined the interplay of socioeconomic, political, and institutional factors influencing the provision of fee-free higher education. Method A participatory approach to developing the CLD was used. Through an extensive literature review, the research contextualised fee-free higher education enabling a preliminary CLD to be developed. Discussions were held to improve the preliminary model based on stakeholder and expert opinion. The model was then validated by stakeholders and experts. Results The CLD has explicitly mapped out the causal relationships which play a fundamental role in fee-free higher education in South Africa. Key findings revealed that fee-free higher education initiatives, such as managing funding constraints and administrative complexities, hold promise for fostering inclusivity and socioeconomic development but are hindered by bureaucratic policy establishments and inefficiencies. These challenges underscore the gap between policy formulation and implementation, highlighting the need for comprehensive reforms to streamline administrative processes and enhance financial sustainability within the higher education sector. Conclusion This research thoroughly examined the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities in its implementation. The study emphasized the need for systemic reforms to improve accessibility and effectiveness, while also underscoring the potential of such initiatives to promote social mobility and economic empowerment, aligning with global goals like the SDGs and the African Agenda 2063.

                Despite the growing interest in social prescribing the diversification of health and social care strategies to support the well-being of patients has remained entrenched with a focus on the hospital setting within the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates has commenced progressing community mental health care to lead changes in how care and treatment are delivered within the United Arab Emirates. The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

                <p>by Alexander Ney, Nuno R. Nené, Eva Sedlak, Pilar Acedo, Oleg Blyuss, Harry J. Whitwell, Eithne Costello, Aleksandra Gentry-Maharaj, Norman R. Williams, Usha Menon, Giuseppe K. Fusai, Alexey Zaikin, Stephen P. Pereira</p>
Background <p>The grim (<10% 5-year) survival rates for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are attributed to its complex intrinsic biology and most often late-stage detection. The overlap of symptoms with benign gastrointestinal conditions in early stage further complicates timely detection. The suboptimal diagnostic performance of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 and elevation in benign hyperbilirubinaemia undermine its reliability, leaving a notable absence of accurate diagnostic biomarkers. Using a selected patient cohort with benign pancreatic and biliary tract conditions we aimed to develop a data analysis protocol leading to a biomarker signature capable of distinguishing patients with non-specific yet concerning clinical presentations, from those with PDAC.</p> Methods <p>539 patient serum samples collected under the Accelerated Diagnosis of neuro Endocrine and Pancreatic TumourS (ADEPTS) study (benign disease controls and PDACs) and the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS, healthy controls) were screened using the Olink Oncology II panel, supplemented with five in-house markers. 16 specialized base-learner classifiers were stacked to select and enhance biomarker performances and robustness in blinded samples. Each base-learner was constructed through cross-validation and recursive feature elimination in a discovery set comprising approximately two thirds of the ADEPTS and UKCTOCS samples and contrasted specific diagnosis with PDAC.</p> Results <p>The signature which was developed using diagnosis-specific ensemble learning demonstrated predictive capabilities outperforming CA19-9, the only biomarker currently accepted by the FDA and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for pancreatic cancer, and other individual biomarkers and combinations in both discovery and held-out validation sets. An AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98–0.99) and sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98–1) at 90% specificity was achieved with the ensemble method, which was significantly larger than the AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.66–0.91) and sensitivity 0.67 (95% CI 0.50–0.83), also at 90% specificity, for CA19-9, in the discovery set (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.00050, respectively). During ensemble signature validation in the held-out set, an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91–0.99), sensitivity 0.86 (95% CI 0.68–1), was attained compared to an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.66–0.93), sensitivity 0.65 (95% CI 0.48–0.56) at 90% specificity for CA19-9 alone (p = 0.0082 and p = 0.024, respectively). When validated only on the benign disease controls and PDACs collected from ADEPTS, the diagnostic-specific signature achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92–0.99), sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI 0.64–0.95) at 90% specificity, which was still significantly higher than the performance for CA19-9 taken as a single predictor, AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.64–0.93) and sensitivity of 0.18 (95% CI 0.03–0.69) (p = 0.013 and p = 0.0055, respectively).</p> Conclusion <p>Our ensemble modelling technique outperformed CA19-9, individual biomarkers and indices developed with prevailing algorithms in distinguishing patients with non-specific but concerning symptoms from those with PDAC, with implications for improving its early detection in individuals at risk.</p>
