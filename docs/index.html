              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10521">Active filtering: a predictive function of recurrent circuits of sensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our brains encode many features of the sensory world into memories: we can sing along with songs we have heard before, interpret spoken and written language composed of words we have learned, and recognize faces and objects. Where are these memories stored? Each area of the cerebral cortex has a huge number of local, recurrent, excitatory-excitatory synapses, as many as 500 million per cubic millimeter. Here I review evidence that cortical recurrent connectivity in sensory cortex is a substrate for sensory memories. Evidence suggests that the local recurrent network encodes the structure of natural sensory input, and that it does so via active filtering, transforming network inputs to boost or select those associated with natural sensation. This is a form of predictive processing, in which the cortical recurrent network selectively amplifies some input patterns and attenuates others, and a form of memory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11201">Evolution of diverse (and advanced) cognitive abilities through adaptive fine-tuning of learning and chunking mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of cognition is frequently discussed as the evolution of cognitive abilities or the evolution of some neuronal structures in the brain. However, since such traits or abilities are often highly complex, understanding their evolution requires explaining how they could have gradually evolved through selection acting on heritable variations in simpler cognitive mechanisms. With this in mind, making use of a previously proposed theory, here we show how the evolution of cognitive abilities can be captured by the fine-tuning of basic learning mechanisms and, in particular, chunking mechanisms. We use the term chunking broadly for all types of non-elemental learning, claiming that the process by which elements are combined into chunks and associated with other chunks, or elements, is critical for what the brain can do, and that it must be fine-tuned to ecological conditions. We discuss the relevance of this approach to studies in animal cognition, using examples from animal foraging and decision-making, problem solving, and cognitive flexibility. Finally, we explain how even the apparent human-animal gap in sequence learning ability can be explained in terms of different fine-tunings of a similar chunking process.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11566">Artificial Neural Networks for Magnetoencephalography: A review of an emerging field</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique that measures the intricate brain dynamics underlying cognitive processes with an unparalleled combination of high temporal and spatial precision. MEG data analytics has always relied on advanced signal processing and mathematical and statistical tools for various tasks ranging from data cleaning to probing the signals' rich dynamics and estimating the neural sources underlying the surface-level recordings. Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12111">Using Space-Filling Curves and Fractals to Reveal Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Neuroimaging Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method, Fractal Space-Curve Analysis (FSCA), which combines Space-Filling Curve (SFC) mapping for dimensionality reduction with fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The method is suitable for multidimensional geometrically embedded data, especially for neuroimaging data which is highly correlated temporally and spatially. We conduct extensive feasibility studies on diverse, artificially generated data with known fractal characteristics: the fractional Brownian motion, Cantor sets, and Gaussian processes. We compare the suitability of dimensionality reduction via Hilbert SFC and a data-driven alternative. FSCA is then successfully applied to real-world magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) scans.
  The method utilizing Hilbert curves is optimized for computational efficiency, proven robust against boundary effects typical in experimental data analysis, and resistant to data sub-sampling. It is able to correctly quantify and discern correlations in both stationary and dynamic two-dimensional images. In MRI Alzheimer's dataset, patients reveal a progression of the disease associated with a systematic decrease of the Hurst exponent. In fMRI recording of breath-holding task, the change in the exponent allows distinguishing different experimental phases.
  This study introduces a robust method for fractal characterization of spatial and temporal correlations in many types of multidimensional neuroimaging data. Very few assumptions allow it to be generalized to more dimensions than typical for neuroimaging and utilized in other scientific fields. The method can be particularly useful in analyzing fMRI experiments to compute markers of pathological conditions resulting from neurodegeneration. We also showcase its potential for providing insights into brain dynamics in task-related experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12139">Discontinuous phase transition of feature detection in lateral predictive coding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain adopts the strategy of lateral predictive coding (LPC) to construct optimal internal representations for salient features in input sensory signals to reduce the energetic cost of information transmission. Here we consider the task of distinguishing a non-Gaussian signal by LPC from $(N-1)$ Gaussian background signals of the same magnitude, which is intractable by principal component decomposition. We study the emergence of feature detection function from the perspective of statistical mechanics, and formulate a thermodynamic free energy to implement the tradeoff between energetic cost $E$ and information robustness. We define $E$ as the mean $L_1$-norm of the internal state vectors, and quantify the level of information robustness by an entropy measure $S$. We demonstrate that energy--information tradeoff may induce a discontinuous phase transition of the optimal matrix, from a very weak one with $S \approx 0$ to a functional LPC system with moderate synaptic weights in which a single unit responds selectively to the input non-Gaussian feature with high signal-to-noise ratio.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409">Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17745">Shaping the distribution of neural responses with interneurons in a recurrent circuit model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.17745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient coding theory posits that sensory circuits transform natural signals into neural representations that maximize information transmission subject to resource constraints. Local interneurons are thought to play an important role in these transformations, dynamically shaping patterns of local circuit activity to facilitate and direct information flow. However, the relationship between these coordinated, nonlinear, circuit-level transformations and the properties of interneurons (e.g., connectivity, activation functions, response dynamics) remains unknown. Here, we propose a normative computational model that establishes such a relationship. Our model is derived from an optimal transport objective that conceptualizes the circuit's input-response function as transforming the inputs to achieve an efficient target response distribution. The circuit, which is comprised of primary neurons that are recurrently connected to a set of local interneurons, continuously optimizes this objective by dynamically adjusting both the synaptic connections between neurons as well as the interneuron activation functions. In an example application motivated by redundancy reduction, we construct a circuit that learns a dynamical nonlinear transformation that maps natural image data to a spherical Gaussian, significantly reducing statistical dependencies in neural responses. Overall, our results provide a framework in which the distribution of circuit responses is systematically and nonlinearly controlled by adjustment of interneuron connectivity and activation functions.

                arXiv:2406.10184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evidence indicates that intracranial EEG connectivity, as estimated from daily resting state recordings from epileptic patients, may be capable of identifying preictal states. In this study, we employed hyperbolic embedding of brain networks to capture non-trivial patterns that discriminate between connectivity networks from days with (preictal) and without (interictal) seizure. A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that representations of brain connectivity in a latent geometry space can reveal a daily and reliable signature of the upcoming seizure(s), thus providing a promising biomarker for seizure forecasting.

Abstract: With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.

Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel problem class related to dynamics on large-scale networks relevant to neurobiology and machine learning. Specifically, we ask if a network can sustain inherent dynamic activity beyond some arbitrary observation time or if the activity ceases through quiescence or saturation via an epileptic-like state. We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to answer the question we pose.

Abstract: Incomplete Hippocampal Inversion (IHI), sometimes called hippocampal malrotation, is an atypical anatomical pattern of the hippocampus found in about 20% of the general population. IHI can be visually assessed on coronal slices of T1 weighted MR images, using a composite score that combines four anatomical criteria. IHI has been associated with several brain disorders (epilepsy, schizophrenia). However, these studies were based on small samples. Furthermore, the factors (genetic or environmental) that contribute to the genesis of IHI are largely unknown. Large-scale studies are thus needed to further understand IHI and their potential relationships to neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, visual evaluation is long and tedious, justifying the need for an automatic method. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, to automatically rate IHI. We proceed by predicting four anatomical criteria, which are then summed up to form the IHI score, providing the advantage of an interpretable score. We provided an extensive experimental investigation of different machine learning methods and training strategies. We performed automatic rating using a variety of deep learning models (conv5-FC3, ResNet and SECNN) as well as a ridge regression. We studied the generalization of our models using different cohorts and performed multi-cohort learning. We relied on a large population of 2,008 participants from the IMAGEN study, 993 and 403 participants from the QTIM/QTAB studies as well as 985 subjects from the UKBiobank. We showed that deep learning models outperformed a ridge regression. We demonstrated that the performances of the conv5-FC3 network were at least as good as more complex networks while maintaining a low complexity and computation time. We showed that training on a single cohort may lack in variability while training on several cohorts improves generalization.

                arXiv:2408.00109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous attractors offer a unique class of solutions for storing continuous-valued variables in recurrent system states for indefinitely long time intervals. Unfortunately, continuous attractors suffer from severe structural instability in general--they are destroyed by most infinitesimal changes of the dynamical law that defines them. This fragility limits their utility especially in biological systems as their recurrent dynamics are subject to constant perturbations. We observe that the bifurcations from continuous attractors in theoretical neuroscience models display various structurally stable forms. Although their asymptotic behaviors to maintain memory are categorically distinct, their finite-time behaviors are similar. We build on the persistent manifold theory to explain the commonalities between bifurcations from and approximations of continuous attractors. Fast-slow decomposition analysis uncovers the persistent manifold that survives the seemingly destructive bifurcation. Moreover, recurrent neural networks trained on analog memory tasks display approximate continuous attractors with predicted slow manifold structures. Therefore, continuous attractors are functionally robust and remain useful as a universal analogy for understanding analog memory.

                arXiv:2501.10425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), the information of a neuron is computed based on the sum of the amplitudes (weights) of the electrical potentials received in input from other neurons. We propose here a new class of neural networks, namely Delay Neural Networks (DeNN), where the information of a neuron is computed based on the sum of its input synaptic delays and on the spike times of the electrical potentials received from other neurons. This way, DeNN are designed to explicitly use exact continuous temporal information of spikes in both forward and backward passes, without approximation. (Deep) DeNN are applied here to images and event-based (audio and visual) data sets. Good performances are obtained, especially for datasets where temporal information is important, with much less parameters and less energy than other models.

Abstract: We demonstrate that scalable neuromorphic hardware can implement the finite element method, which is a critical numerical method for engineering and scientific discovery. Our approach maps the sparse interactions between neighboring finite elements to small populations of neurons that dynamically update according to the governing physics of a desired problem description. We show that for the Poisson equation, which describes many physical systems such as gravitational and electrostatic fields, this cortical-inspired neural circuit can achieve comparable levels of numerical accuracy and scaling while enabling the use of inherently parallel and energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. We demonstrate that this approach can be used on the Intel Loihi 2 platform and illustrate how this approach can be extended to nontrivial mesh geometries and dynamics.

                arXiv:2501.10777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of linkage, building blocks, and problem decomposition have long existed in the genetic algorithm (GA) field and have guided the development of model-based GAs for decades. However, their definitions are usually vague, making it difficult to develop theoretical support. This paper provides an algorithm-independent definition to describe the concept of linkage. With this definition, the paper proves that any problems with a bounded degree of linkage are decomposable and that proper problem decomposition is possible via linkage learning. The way of decomposition given in this paper also offers a new perspective on nearly decomposable problems with bounded difficulty and building blocks from the theoretical aspect. Finally, this paper relates problem decomposition to PAC learning and proves that the global optima of these problems and the minimum decomposition blocks are PAC learnable under certain conditions.

                arXiv:2501.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online synaptic plasticity rules derived from gradient descent achieve high accuracy on a wide range of practical tasks. However, their software implementation often requires tediously hand-derived gradients or using gradient backpropagation which sacrifices the online capability of the rules. In this work, we present a custom automatic differentiation (AD) pipeline for sparse and online implementation of gradient-based synaptic plasticity rules that generalizes to arbitrary neuron models. Our work combines the programming ease of backpropagation-type methods for forward AD while being memory-efficient. To achieve this, we exploit the advantageous compute and memory scaling of online synaptic plasticity by providing an inherently sparse implementation of AD where expensive tensor contractions are replaced with simple element-wise multiplications if the tensors are diagonal. Gradient-based synaptic plasticity rules such as eligibility propagation (e-prop) have exactly this property and thus profit immensely from this feature. We demonstrate the alignment of our gradients with respect to gradient backpropagation on an synthetic task where e-prop gradients are exact, as well as audio speech classification benchmarks. We demonstrate how memory utilization scales with network size without dependence on the sequence length, as expected from forward AD methods.

                arXiv:2501.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling Large Language Models (LLMs) with Evolutionary Algorithms has recently shown significant promise as a technique to design new heuristics that outperform existing methods, particularly in the field of combinatorial optimisation. An escalating arms race is both rapidly producing new heuristics and improving the efficiency of the processes evolving them. However, driven by the desire to quickly demonstrate the superiority of new approaches, evaluation of the new heuristics produced for a specific domain is often cursory: testing on very few datasets in which instances all belong to a specific class from the domain, and on few instances per class. Taking bin-packing as an example, to the best of our knowledge we conduct the first rigorous benchmarking study of new LLM-generated heuristics, comparing them to well-known existing heuristics across a large suite of benchmark instances using three performance metrics. For each heuristic, we then evolve new instances won by the heuristic and perform an instance space analysis to understand where in the feature space each heuristic performs well. We show that most of the LLM heuristics do not generalise well when evaluated across a broad range of benchmarks in contrast to existing simple heuristics, and suggest that any gains from generating very specialist heuristics that only work in small areas of the instance space need to be weighed carefully against the considerable cost of generating these heuristics.

Abstract: This study uses two meta-heuristics methodologies to introduce two novel quantum-inspired meta heuristic approaches: quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QIGA1) and quantum-inspired genetic algorithm with dynamic approach (QIGA2). The two suggested methods combine a classical and quantum genetic algorithm approach. Both approaches use The correlation coefficient as an assessment function to identify the best (optimal) values for binary image. In quantum computing, they use simple ideas like qubits and state superposition. Due to these characteristics, parallelism which uses the time discreteness of quantum mechanical systems, is exhibited. For five distinct MNIST datasets, the performance of all participating algorithms has been assessed by comparing the suggested approaches first with their traditional approach counterparts and then with the proposed methods QIGA1 and QIGA2. Each method's ideal threshold value, associated fitness value (best and average), loss, and accuracy for each MNIST dataset have all been published. The outcomes demonstrate the superior efficiency of the suggested approaches over their traditional equivalents.

Abstract: We present HyperCam, an energy-efficient image classification pipeline that enables computer vision tasks onboard low-power IoT camera systems. HyperCam leverages hyperdimensional computing to perform training and inference efficiently on low-power microcontrollers. We implement a low-power wireless camera platform using off-the-shelf hardware and demonstrate that HyperCam can achieve an accuracy of 93.60%, 84.06%, 92.98%, and 72.79% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Face Detection, and Face Identification tasks, respectively, while significantly outperforming other classifiers in resource efficiency. Specifically, it delivers inference latency of 0.08-0.27s while using 42.91-63.00KB flash memory and 22.25KB RAM at peak. Among other machine learning classifiers such as SVM, xgBoost, MicroNets, MobileNetV3, and MCUNetV3, HyperCam is the only classifier that achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining competitive memory footprint and inference latency that meets the resource requirements of low-power camera systems.

Abstract: Recent studies in quantum machine learning advocated the use of hybrid models to assist with the limitations of the currently existing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, but what was missing from most of them was the explanations and interpretations of the choices that were made to pick those exact architectures and the differentiation between good and bad hybrid architectures, this research attempts to tackle that gap in the literature by using the Regularized Evolution algorithm to search for the optimal hybrid classical-quantum architecture for the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, ultimately the classical models dominated the leaderboard with the best hybrid model coming in eleventh place among all unique models, while we also try to explain the factors that contributed to such results,and for some models to behave better than others in hope to grasp a better intuition about what we should consider good practices for designing an efficient hybrid architecture.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10810">Convergence and Running Time of Time-dependent Ant Colony Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.10810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a well-known method inspired by the foraging behavior of ants and is extensively used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we first consider a general framework based on the concept of a construction graph - a graph associated with an instance of the optimization problem under study, where feasible solutions are represented by walks. We analyze the running time of this ACO variant, known as the Graph-based Ant System with time-dependent evaporation rate (GBAS/tdev), and prove that the algorithm's solution converges to the optimal solution of the problem with probability 1 for a slightly stronger evaporation rate function than was previously known. We then consider two time-dependent adaptations of Attiratanasunthron and Fakcharoenphol's $n$-ANT algorithm: $n$-ANT with time-dependent evaporation rate ($n$-ANT/tdev) and $n$-ANT with time-dependent lower pheromone bound ($n$-ANT/tdlb). We analyze both variants on the single destination shortest path problem (SDSP). Our results show that $n$-ANT/tdev has a super-polynomial time lower bound on the SDSP. In contrast, we show that $n$-ANT/tdlb achieves a polynomial time upper bound on this problem.

Abstract: In the current study, the fatigue life of QSTE340TM steel was modelled using a machine learning method, namely, a neural network. This problem was solved by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with a 3-75-1 architecture, which allows the prediction of the crack length based on the number of load cycles N, the stress ratio R, and the overload ratio Rol. The proposed model showed high accuracy, with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranging from 0.02% to 4.59% for different R and Rol. The neural network effectively reveals the nonlinear relationships between input parameters and fatigue crack growth, providing reliable predictions for different loading conditions.

                arXiv:2501.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent approaches to training algorithm selectors in the black-box optimisation domain have advocated for the use of training data that is algorithm-centric in order to encapsulate information about how an algorithm performs on an instance, rather than relying on information derived from features of the instance itself. Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.

                arXiv:2501.11453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrate-and-Fire (IF) is an idealized model of the spike-triggering mechanism of a biological neuron. It is used to realize the bio-inspired event-based principle of information processing in neuromorphic computing. We show that IF is closely related to the concept of Send-on-Delta (SOD) as used in threshold-based sampling. It turns out that the IF model can be adjusted in a way that SOD can be understood as differential version of IF. As a result, we gain insight into the underlying metric structure based on the Alexiewicz norm with consequences for clarifying the underlying signal space including bounded integrable signals with superpositions of finitely many Dirac impulses, the identification of a maximum sparsity property, error bounds for signal reconstruction and a characterization in terms of sparse regularization.

                arXiv:2501.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequences provide a remarkably general way to represent and process information. This powerful abstraction has placed sequence modeling at the center of modern deep learning applications, inspiring numerous architectures from transformers to recurrent networks. While this fragmented development has yielded powerful models, it has left us without a unified framework to understand their fundamental similarities and explain their effectiveness. We present a unifying framework motivated by an empirical observation: effective sequence models must be able to perform associative recall. Our key insight is that memorizing input tokens through an associative memory is equivalent to performing regression at test-time. This regression-memory correspondence provides a framework for deriving sequence models that can perform associative recall, offering a systematic lens to understand seemingly ad-hoc architectural choices. We show numerous recent architectures -- including linear attention models, their gated variants, state-space models, online learners, and softmax attention -- emerge naturally as specific approaches to test-time regression. Each architecture corresponds to three design choices: the relative importance of each association, the regressor function class, and the optimization algorithm. This connection leads to new understanding: we provide theoretical justification for QKNorm in softmax attention, and we motivate higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work unlocks decades of rich statistical tools that can guide future development of more powerful yet principled sequence models.

Abstract: In this paper, we comprehensively study the inductive biases of two major approaches to augmenting Transformers with a recurrent mechanism: (1) the approach of incorporating a depth-wise recurrence similar to Universal Transformers; and (2) the approach of incorporating a chunk-wise temporal recurrence like Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Furthermore, we propose and investigate novel ways to extend and combine the above methods - for example, we propose a global mean-based dynamic halting mechanism for Universal Transformers and an augmentation of Temporal Latent Bottleneck with elements from Universal Transformer. We compare the models and probe their inductive biases in several diagnostic tasks, such as Long Range Arena (LRA), flip-flop language modeling, ListOps, and Logical Inference.

                arXiv:2402.16562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in reinforcement learning algorithms refers to choosing the optimal parameters that may increase the algorithm's performance. Manual or random hyperparameter tuning methods can be problematic, as even slight variations in their values can result in significantly different outcomes in the learning process. In this paper, we propose a new method, QF-tuner, for automatic hyperparameter tuning in the Q-learning algorithm using the FOX optimization algorithm (FOX). A new objective function has been proposed for the FOX, prioritizing reward over learning error and time. QF-tuner starts by running the FOX and tries to minimize the fitness value derived from observations at each iteration by executing the Q-learning algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated using two control tasks from the OpenAI Gym: CartPole and FrozenLake. The empirical results of the QF-tuner on the CartPole control task show a reward of 499, and on the FrozenLake control task, a reward of 1. These results indicate that the QF-tuner outperforms other optimization algorithms. On the FrozenLake control task, there was a 36\% increase in reward with a 26\% reduction in learning time; on the CartPole control task, there was a 57\% increase in reward with a 20\% decrease in learning time. Thus, the QF-tuner is an essential method for hyperparameter tuning in reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling more effective solutions to control task problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00312">UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.00312v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without requiring expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.

                arXiv:2411.13742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically benchmark 30 optimisers on 372 instances of the variational quantum eigensolver for solving the Fermi-Hubbard system with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz. We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.

                arXiv:2412.02482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.

                Objectives Good oral hygiene measures are important for successful orthodontic treatment. They involve various types of mouthwashes which have been reported to cause alteration of mechanical properties of archwires. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a new kind of chlorine-dioxide-containing mouthwash on the mechanical properties and surface morphology of stainless steel orthodontic archwires against the already prevalent chlorhexidine mouthwash in the market. Method Group A – Chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2% (study), Group B – Chlorine Dioxide mouthwash (study), and Group C – Artificial Saliva (control). 42 specimens of 5 cm long 19x25 inch SS archwires were immersed in each group equally. Post immersion, the frictional force was analyzed in the universal testing machine for each group using custom-made acrylic jigs for 10 specimens. The remaining 4 specimens from each group were sent for surface morphology evaluation using an atomic force microscope. Results Friction resistance evaluation for the archwires revealed a mean friction of 0.011 ± 0.0056 in Group A, 0.015 ± 0.0052 in Group B, and 0.010 ± 0.0067 in Group C. Results suggested that the static friction of Group C (control group) was found to be the least when compared with the experimental groups, although not producing statistically significant values. Surface roughness of archwires compared at a 10μm range revealed a mean roughness of 19.38 ± 0.82 in Group A, 25.39 ± 7.01 in Group B, and 16.65 ± 3.07 in Group C which shows there wasn’t any statistically significant difference in the mean roughness midst the three sets. Conclusion Chlorine dioxide and Chlorhexidine mouthwashes caused an increase in the frictional resistance of the archwires when compared to the control group. When measured at a range of 10μm the mean surface roughness did not differ across the control and the experimental groups.

                Background Cervical cancer poses a significant public health challenge, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Despite advancements in treatment, the disease remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. Chemoradiation utilizing cisplatin has been the cornerstone therapy for locally advanced cervical cancer. Prognostic biomarkers, including hematological parameters, have emerged as valuable tools in guiding treatment decisions and predicting outcomes. Methodology Data from patients treated between January 2021 and June 2022 were analyzed. Demographic information, histopathology, pre-treatment blood parameters, treatment details, and response assessments were collected. The parameters assessed included hemoglobin levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and eosinophil albumin ratio (EAR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine optimal cut-off values for these biomarkers. Results Of the 140 patients included, the majority had squamous cell carcinoma (92%) and were at stage II or III. Complete response to treatment was observed in 86.4% of patients. Non-responders demonstrated significantly higher levels of hemoglobin, NLR, and EAR, along with lower PNI levels compared to responders. ROC analysis revealed cut-off values for hemoglobin (< 9.5), NLR (< 2.98), PLR (> 289.26), PNI (< 37.67), and EAR (< 49.63) associated with treatment response. Conclusion The study highlights the potential utility of pre-treatment blood parameters as predictive markers for treatment response in locally advanced cervical cancer. Lower hemoglobin, higher NLR, and EAR, along with reduced PNI, were associated with poorer treatment outcomes. Integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could aid in treatment planning and improve patient outcomes. Further validation and prospective studies are warranted to establish the role of these biomarkers in guiding personalized treatment strategies for cervical cancer patients.

                Abstract* Background Intensive care units (ICUs) are essential for patient recovery, but prolonged stays often result in complications like reduced mobility and muscle weakness. Aims This study examines current ICU rehabilitation practices in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through a web-based cross-sectional survey involving 80 physiotherapists from both public and private sectors. Methods The questionnaire, validated by experts with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.84, explored various rehabilitation strategies. Most participants held bachelor’s degrees and had 2-5 years of experience. Results Over 96% required physician referrals for ICU physiotherapy sessions, and 75% noted that hospitals provided development programs to enhance skills. Respiratory therapy, joint mobilization, and electrical stimulation were the most commonly used interventions, while massage, continuous passive motion machines, and taping were less frequently applied. Among neonatal ICU patients, 85.7% of physiotherapists regularly performed passive range of motion exercises, and 69% consistently involved parents in the treatment plan. The results indicate a variety of practices among ICU physiotherapists in the UAE, with no clear adherence to standardized protocols. This lack of consistency may negatively affect patient care quality. Conclusion The study underscores the importance of implementing standardized rehabilitation protocols and enhancing patient education to improve outcomes in ICU settings.

It has been classically conjectured that the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli. An important issue associated with this conjecture is the identification of the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task. We address this issue by using a new clustering procedure for sets of electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain. This clustering procedure indicates that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus in order to build a model.

                <p>by Xiaojun Wu, MeiLu McDermott, Adam L MacLean</p>

Biological systems exhibit complex dynamics that differential equations can often adeptly represent. Ordinary differential equation models are widespread; until recently their construction has required extensive prior knowledge of the system. Machine learning methods offer alternative means of model construction: differential equation models can be learnt from data via model discovery using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). However, SINDy struggles with realistic levels of biological noise and is limited in its ability to incorporate prior knowledge of the system. We propose a data-driven framework for model discovery and model selection using hybrid dynamical systems: partial models containing missing terms. Neural networks are used to approximate the unknown dynamics of a system, enabling the denoising of the data while simultaneously learning the latent dynamics. Simulations from the fitted neural network are then used to infer models using sparse regression. We show, via model selection, that model discovery using hybrid dynamical systems outperforms alternative approaches. We find it possible to infer models correctly up to high levels of biological noise of different types. We demonstrate the potential to learn models from sparse, noisy data in application to a canonical cell state transition using data derived from single-cell transcriptomics. Overall, this approach provides a practical framework for model discovery in biology in cases where data are noisy and sparse, of particular utility when the underlying biological mechanisms are partially but incompletely known.

                <p>by Meichen Fang, Gennady Gorin, Lior Pachter</p>

Single-cell transcriptomics experiments provide gene expression snapshots of heterogeneous cell populations across cell states. These snapshots have been used to infer trajectories and dynamic information even without intensive, time-series data by ordering cells according to gene expression similarity. However, while single-cell snapshots sometimes offer valuable insights into dynamic processes, current methods for ordering cells are limited by descriptive notions of “pseudotime” that lack intrinsic physical meaning. Instead of pseudotime, we propose inference of “process time” via a principled modeling approach to formulating trajectories and inferring latent variables corresponding to timing of cells subject to a biophysical process. Our implementation of this approach, called Chronocell, provides a biophysical formulation of trajectories built on cell state transitions. The Chronocell model is identifiable, making parameter inference meaningful. Furthermore, Chronocell can interpolate between trajectory inference, when cell states lie on a continuum, and clustering, when cells cluster into discrete states. By using a variety of datasets ranging from cluster-like to continuous, we show that Chronocell enables us to assess the suitability of datasets and reveals distinct cellular distributions along process time that are consistent with biological process times. We also compare our parameter estimates of degradation rates to those derived from metabolic labeling datasets, thereby showcasing the biophysical utility of Chronocell. Nevertheless, based on performance characterization on simulations, we find that process time inference can be challenging, highlighting the importance of dataset quality and careful model assessment.

                <p>by Peng Ren, Xuehua Cui, Xia Liang</p>

Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by progressive degeneration or death of neurons. The complexity of clinical symptoms and irreversibility of disease progression significantly affects individual lives, leading to premature mortality. The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases keeps increasing, yet the specific pathogenic mechanisms remain incompletely understood and effective treatment strategies are lacking. In recent years, convergent experimental evidence supports the “prion-like transmission” assumption that abnormal proteins induce misfolding of normal proteins, and these misfolded proteins propagate throughout the neural networks to cause neuronal death. To elucidate this dynamic process in vivo from a computational perspective, researchers have proposed three connectome-based biophysical models to simulate the spread of pathological proteins: the Network Diffusion Model, the Epidemic Spreading Model, and the agent-based Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model. These models have demonstrated promising predictive capabilities. This review focuses on the explanations of their fundamental principles and applications. Then, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of the models. Building upon this foundation, we introduce new directions for model optimization and propose a unified framework for the evaluation of connectome-based biophysical models. We expect that this review could lower the entry barrier for researchers in this field, accelerate model optimization, and thereby advance the clinical translation of connectome-based biophysical models.

                <p>by Nan Wu, Zhi-Chao Xu, Kai-Dong Du, Shen Huang, Naohiro Kobayashi, Yutaka Kuroda, Yan-Hong Bai</p>

<i>Gaussia</i> Luciferase (GLuc) is a renowned reporter protein that can catalyze the oxidation of coelenterazine (CTZ) and emit a bright light signal. GLuc comprises two consecutive repeats that form the enzyme body and a central putative catalytic cavity. However, deleting the C-terminal repeat only limited reduces the activity (over 30% residual luminescence intensity detectable), despite being a key part of the cavity. How does the remaining GLuc (tGLuc) catalyze CTZ? To address this question, we built a structural model of tGLuc by removing the C-terminal repeat from the resolved structure of intact GLuc, and verified that the cavity-forming component in GLuc remains stable and provides an open-mouth cavity in tGLuc during 500 ns MD simulations in water. Docking simulation and a followed umbrella sampling analysis further revealed that the cavity on tGLuc has a high affinity for CTZ, with a binding energy of up to -114 kJ/mol. Moreover, R76, a validated activity-critical amino acid residue, resides in the cavity and forms a stable hydrogen bond with CTZ. Then, we constructed a cluster model to examine the CTZ oxidation pathway in the cavity using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The result showed that the pathway consists of four elementary reactions, with the highest Gibbs energy barrier being 65.4 kJ/mol. Both intramolecular electron transfer and the convergence of S1/S0 potential energy surfaces occurred in the last elementary reaction, which was regarded as the reported Chemically-Initiated-Electron-Exchange-Luminescence (CIEEL) reaction. Geometry and wavefunction analysis on the pathway indicated that R76 plays a vital role in CTZ oxidation, which first anchors the environmental oxygen molecule and induces it to form a singlet biradical state, facilitating its attack on CTZ. Subsequently, R76 and the adjacent Q88, positioned near R76 through the tGLuc refolding process, stabilize the transition states and facilitate the emergence of radical electrons on CTZ at the onset of the CIEEL reaction, which contributes to the subsequent intramolecular electron transfer and the production of excited amide product. This study provides a comprehensive explanation of tGLuc’s catalytic mechanism. However, it is important to note that these findings are specific to tGLuc and may not extend to other CTZ-based luciferases, particularly those lacking arginine in their catalytic cavities, which likely operate via distinct mechanisms.

                <p>by Alessandro Pazzaglia, Andrej Bicanski, Andrea Ferrario, Jonathan Arreguit, Dimitri Ryczko, Auke Ijspeert</p>

This study introduces a novel neuromechanical model employing a detailed spiking neural network to explore the role of axial proprioceptive sensory feedback, namely stretch feedback, in salamander locomotion. Unlike previous studies that often oversimplified the dynamics of the locomotor networks, our model includes detailed simulations of the classes of neurons that are considered responsible for generating movement patterns. The locomotor circuits, modeled as a spiking neural network of adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, are coupled to a three-dimensional mechanical model of a salamander with realistic physical parameters and simulated muscles. In open-loop simulations (i.e., without sensory feedback), the model replicates locomotor patterns observed in-vitro and in-vivo for swimming and trotting gaits. Additionally, a modular descending reticulospinal drive to the central pattern generation network allows to accurately control the activation, frequency and phase relationship of the different sections of the limb and axial circuits. In closed-loop swimming simulations (i.e. including axial stretch feedback), systematic evaluations reveal that intermediate values of feedback strength increase the tail beat frequency and reduce the intersegmental phase lag, contributing to a more coordinated, faster and energy-efficient locomotion. Interestingly, the result is conserved across different feedback topologies (ascending or descending, excitatory or inhibitory), suggesting that it may be an inherent property of axial proprioception. Moreover, intermediate feedback strengths expand the stability region of the network, enhancing its tolerance to a wider range of descending drives, internal parameters’ modifications and noise levels. Conversely, high values of feedback strength lead to a loss of controllability of the network and a degradation of its locomotor performance. Overall, this study highlights the beneficial role of proprioception in generating, modulating and stabilizing locomotion patterns, provided that it does not excessively override centrally-generated locomotor rhythms. This work also underscores the critical role of detailed, biologically-realistic neural networks to improve our understanding of vertebrate locomotion.

Coronaviruses express their structural and accessory genes via a set of subgenomic RNAs, whose synthesis is directed by transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) in the 5′ genomic leader and upstream of each body open reading frame. In SARS-CoV-2, the TRS has the consensus AAACGAAC; upon searching for emergence of this motif in the global SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we find that it evolves frequently, especially in the 3′ end of the genome. We show well-supported examples upstream of the Spike gene—within the nsp16 coding region of ORF1b—which is expressed during human infection, and upstream of the canonical Envelope gene TRS, both of which have evolved convergently in multiple lineages. The most frequent neo-TRS is within the coding region of the Nucleocapsid gene, and is present in virtually all viruses from the B.1.1 lineage, including the variants of concern Alpha, Gamma, Omicron and descendants thereof. Here, we demonstrate that this TRS leads to the expression of a novel subgenomic mRNA encoding a truncated C-terminal portion of Nucleocapsid, which is an antagonist of type I interferon production and contributes to viral fitness during infection. We observe distinct phenotypes when the Nucleocapsid coding sequence is mutated compared to when the TRS alone is ablated. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing evolutionary changes at the functional RNA level in addition to the amino acid level.

                <p>by Cas W. Coopmans, Helen de Hoop, Filiz Tezcan, Peter Hagoort, Andrea E. Martin</p>

Studies of perception have long shown that the brain adds information to its sensory analysis of the physical environment. A touchstone example for humans is language use: to comprehend a physical signal like speech, the brain must add linguistic knowledge, including syntax. Yet, syntactic rules and representations are widely assumed to be atemporal (i.e., abstract and not bound by time), so they must be translated into time-varying signals for speech comprehension and production. Here, we test 3 different models of the temporal spell-out of syntactic structure against brain activity of people listening to Dutch stories: an integratory bottom-up parser, a predictive top-down parser, and a mildly predictive left-corner parser. These models build exactly the same structure but differ in when syntactic information is added by the brain—this difference is captured in the (temporal distribution of the) complexity metric “incremental node count.” Using temporal response function models with both acoustic and information-theoretic control predictors, node counts were regressed against source-reconstructed delta-band activity acquired with magnetoencephalography. Neural dynamics in left frontal and temporal regions most strongly reflect node counts derived by the top-down method, which postulates syntax early in time, suggesting that predictive structure building is an important component of Dutch sentence comprehension. The absence of strong effects of the left-corner model further suggests that its mildly predictive strategy does not represent Dutch language comprehension well, in contrast to what has been found for English. Understanding when the brain projects its knowledge of syntax onto speech, and whether this is done in language-specific ways, will inform and constrain the development of mechanistic models of syntactic structure building in the brain.

A single exposure to a stressful event can result in enduring changes in behaviour. Long-term modifications in neuronal networks induced by stress are well explored but the initial steps leading to these alterations remain incompletely understood. In this study, we found that acute stress exposure triggers an immediate increase in the firing activity of calretinin-positive neurons in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT/CR+) that persists for several days in mice. This increase in activity had a causal role in stress-induced changes in spontaneous behaviour. Attenuating PVT/CR+ neuronal activity for only 1 h after the stress event rescued both the protracted increase in PVT/CR+ firing rate and the stress-induced behavioural alterations. Activation of the key forebrain targets (basolateral amygdala, prelimbic cortex, and nucleus accumbens) that mediate defensive behaviour has also been reduced by this post-stress inhibition. Reduction of PVT/CR+ cell activity 5 days later remained still effective in ameliorating stress-induced changes in spontaneous behaviour. The results demonstrate a critical role of the prolonged, post-stress changes in firing activity of PVT/CR+ neurons in shaping the behavioural changes associated with stress. Our data proposes a therapeutic window for intervention in acute stress-related disorders, offering potential avenues for targeted treatment strategies.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections drive one in 20 new cancer cases, exerting a particularly high burden on women. Most anogenital HPV infections are cleared in less than two years, but the underlying mechanisms that favour persistence in around 10% of women remain largely unknown. Notwithstanding, it is precisely this information that is crucial for improving treatment, screening, and vaccination strategies. To understand viral and immune dynamics in non-persisting HPV infections, we set up an observational longitudinal cohort study with frequent on-site visits for biological sample collection. We enrolled 189 women aged from 18 to 25 and living in the area of Montpellier (France) between 2016 and 2020. We performed 974 on-site visits for a total of 1,619 months of follow-up. We collected data on virus load, local immune cell populations, local concentrations of cytokines, and circulating antibody titres. Using hierarchical Bayesian statistical modelling to simultaneously analyse the data from 164 HPV infections from 76 participants, we show that in two months after infection, HPV viral load in non-persisting infections reaches a plateau that lasts on average for 13 to 20 months (95% credibility interval) and is then followed by a rapid clearance phase. This first description of the dynamics of HPV infections comes with the identification of immune correlates associated with infection clearance, especially gamma-delta T cells and CXCL10 concentration. A limitation of this study on HPV kinetics is that many infection follow-ups are censored. Furthermore, some immune cell populations are difficult to label because cervical immunity is less well characterised than systemic immunity. These results open new perspectives for understanding the frontier between acute and chronic infections, and for controlling HPV-associated diseases, as well as for research on human cancers of infectious origin.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Recent advances in microCT are facilitating the investigation of microstructures in spiders and insects leading to an increased number of studies investigating their neuroanatomy. Although microCT is a powerful tool, its effectiveness depends on appropriate tissue preparation and scan settings, particularly for soft, non-sclerotized tissues, such as muscles, organs, and neural tissues. As the application of microCT in spiders is only in its infancy, published protocols are often difficult to implement due to substantial size variation of the specimens. The present study was initiated to determine how to account for this variation. Our work builds on previous methods using microCT to image spider brains, with the aim to consolidate current knowledge and reduce time spent troubleshooting appropriate methodology, thereby facilitating future studies of spiders and their central nervous systems (CNS). We tested three different preparation and imaging techniques based on published protocols with minor modifications using 216 spiders with prosoma lengths ranging from 1.25 mm (small spiders) to 13.33 mm (large spiders). We compared the efficacy of the various specimen preparations, staining methods, and scan settings by categorizing the quality of dorsal and lateral microCT scans. We observed that only the phosphotungstic acid (PTA) staining agent resulted in complete staining of the prosoma and the CNS, allowing the CNS structures to be distinguished for small, medium, and large spiders. The use of image averaging, increased number of projections, image exposure timing, and detector binning did not greatly affect image quality for small and larger spiders but reduced noise. These settings did help improve image quality for medium spiders in conjunction with higher resolutions and an aluminum filter. We discussed the suitability of methods concerning spider size, effort, chemical risk, and image quality.</p>

                Despite extensive functional mapping studies using rodent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), interpreting the fMRI signals in relation to their neuronal origins remains challenging due to the hemodynamic nature of the response. Ultra high-resolution rodent fMRI, beyond merely enhancing spatial specificity, has revealed vessel-specific hemodynamic responses, highlighting the distinct contributions of intracortical arterioles and venules to fMRI signals. This ‘single-vessel’ fMRI approach shifts the paradigm of rodent fMRI, enabling its integration with other neuroimaging modalities to investigate neuro-glio-vascular (NGV) signaling underlying a variety of brain dynamics. Here, we review the emerging trend of combining multimodal fMRI with opto/chemogenetic neuromodulation and genetically encoded biosensors for cellular and circuit-specific recording, offering unprecedented opportunities for cross-scale brain dynamic mapping in rodent models.

                How do you know you have heard right? Metacognition, the ability to assess and monitor one’s own cognitive state, is key to understanding human communication in complex environments. However, the foundational role of metacognition in hearing and communication is only beginning to be explored, and the neuroscience behind it is an emerging field: how does confidence express in neural dynamics of the listening brain? What is known about auditory metaperceptual alterations as a hallmark phenomenon in psychosis, dementia, or hearing loss? Building on Bayesian ideas of auditory perception and auditory neuroscience, ‘meta-listening’ offers a framework for more comprehensive research into how metacognition in humans and non-humans shapes the listening brain.

                The claustrum complex is viewed as fundamental for higher-order cognition; however, the circuit organization and function of its neuroanatomical subregions are not well understood. We demonstrated that some of the key roles of the CLA complex can be attributed to the connectivity and function of a small group of neurons in its ventral subregion, the endopiriform (EN). We identified a subpopulation of EN neurons by their projection to the ventral CA1 (EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons), embedded in recurrent circuits with other EN neurons and the piriform cortex. Although the EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neuron activity was biased toward novelty across stimulus categories, their chemogenetic inhibition selectively disrupted the memory-guided but not innate responses of mice to novelty. Based on our functional connectivity analysis, we suggest that EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons serve as an essential node for recognition memory through recurrent circuits mediating sustained attention to novelty, and through feed-forward inhibition of distal vCA1 neurons shifting memory-guided behavior from familiarity to novelty.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99010">Syngeneic natural killer cell therapy activates dendritic and T cells in metastatic lungs and effectively treats low-burden metastases</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells can control metastasis through cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production independently of T cells in experimental metastasis mouse models. The inverse correlation between NK activity and metastasis incidence supports a critical role for NK cells in human metastatic surveillance. However, autologous NK cell therapy has shown limited benefit in treating patients with metastatic solid tumors. Using a spontaneous metastasis mouse model of MHC-I<sup>+</sup> breast cancer, we found that transfer of IL-15/IL-12-conditioned syngeneic NK cells after primary tumor resection promoted long-term survival of mice with low metastatic burden and induced a tumor-specific protective T cell response that is essential for the therapeutic effect. Furthermore, NK cell transfer augments activation of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and stem cell-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in metastatic lungs, to which IFN-γ of the transferred NK cells contributes significantly. These results imply direct interactions between transferred NK cells and endogenous cDCs to enhance T cell activation. We conducted an investigator-initiated clinical trial of autologous NK cell therapy in six patients with advanced cancer and observed that the NK cell therapy was safe and showed signs of effectiveness. These findings indicate that autologous NK cell therapy is effective in treating established low burden metastases of MHC-I<sup>+</sup> tumor cells by activating the cDC-T cell axis at metastatic sites.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100767">Aberrant FGF signaling promotes granule neuron precursor expansion in SHH subgroup infantile medulloblastoma</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway genes, for example, <i>Suppressor of Fused</i> (SUFU), drive granule neuron precursors (GNP) to form medulloblastomas (MB<sup>SHH</sup>). However, how different molecular lesions in the Shh pathway drive transformation is frequently unclear, and <i>SUFU</i> mutations in the cerebellum seem distinct. In this study, we show that fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) signaling is integral for many infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> cases and that <i>FGF5</i> expression is uniquely upregulated in infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors. Similarly, mice lacking SUFU (Sufu-cKO) ectopically express <i>Fgf5</i> specifically along the secondary fissure where GNPs harbor preneoplastic lesions and show that FGFR signaling is also ectopically activated in this region. Treatment with an FGFR antagonist rescues the severe GNP hyperplasia and restores cerebellar architecture. Thus, direct inhibition of FGF signaling may be a promising and novel therapeutic candidate for infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99997">Tripartite organization of brain state dynamics underlying spoken narrative comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension involves the dynamic interplay of multiple cognitive processes, from basic sound perception, to linguistic encoding, and finally to complex semantic-conceptual interpretations. How the brain handles the diverse streams of information processing remains poorly understood. Applying Hidden Markov Modeling to fMRI data obtained during spoken narrative comprehension, we reveal that the whole brain networks predominantly oscillate within a tripartite latent state space. These states are, respectively, characterized by high activities in the sensory-motor (State #1), bilateral temporal (State #2), and default mode networks (DMN; State #3) regions, with State #2 acting as a transitional hub. The three states are selectively modulated by the acoustic, word-level semantic, and clause-level semantic properties of the narrative. Moreover, the alignment with both the best performer and the group-mean in brain state expression can predict participants’ narrative comprehension scores measured from the post-scan recall. These results are reproducible with different brain network atlas and generalizable to two datasets consisting of young and older adults. Our study suggests that the brain underlies narrative comprehension by switching through a tripartite state space, with each state probably dedicated to a specific component of language faculty, and effective narrative comprehension relies on engaging those states in a timely manner.

Constitutional <i>PIK3R1</i> mutations cause diseases with a genotype-phenotype relationship not yet fully explained: heterozygous loss-of-function mutations cause SHORT syndrome, featuring insulin resistance and short stature attributed to reduced p110α function, while heterozygous activating mutations cause immunodeficiency, attributed to p110δ activation and known as APDS2. Surprisingly, APDS2 patients do not show features of p110α hyperactivation, but do commonly have SHORT syndrome-like features, suggesting p110α hypofunction. We sought to investigate this. In dermal fibroblasts from an APDS2 patient, we found no increased PI3K signalling, with p110δ expression markedly reduced. In preadipocytes, the APDS2 variant was potently dominant negative, associating with Irs1 and Irs2 but failing to heterodimerise with p110α. This attenuation of p110α signalling by a p110δ-activating PIK3R1 variant potentially explains co-incidence of gain-of-function and loss-of-function <i>PIK3R1</i> phenotypes.

                The basal ganglia (BG) are an evolutionarily conserved and phylogenetically old set of sub-cortical nuclei that guide action selection, evaluation, and reinforcement. The entopeduncular nucleus (EP) is a major BG output nucleus that contains a population of GABA/glutamate cotransmitting neurons (EP<i><sup>Sst+</sup></i>) that specifically target the lateral habenula (LHb) and whose function in behavior remains mysterious. Here, we use a probabilistic switching task that requires an animal to maintain flexible relationships between action selection and evaluation to examine when and how GABA/glutamate cotransmitting neurons contribute to behavior. We find that EP<i><sup>Sst+</sup></i> neurons are strongly engaged during this task and show bidirectional changes in activity during the choice and outcome periods of a trial. We then tested the effects of either permanently blocking cotransmission or modifying the GABA/glutamate ratio on behavior in well-trained animals. Neither manipulation produced detectable changes in behavior despite significant changes in synaptic transmission in the LHb, demonstrating that the outputs of these neurons are not required for ongoing action-outcome updating in a probabilistic switching task.

                Cognitive flexibility requires both the encoding of task-relevant and the ignoring of task-irrelevant stimuli. While the neural coding of task-relevant stimuli is increasingly well understood, the mechanisms for ignoring task-irrelevant stimuli remain poorly understood. Here, we study how task performance and biological constraints jointly determine the coding of relevant and irrelevant stimuli in neural circuits. Using mathematical analyses and task-optimized recurrent neural networks, we show that neural circuits can exhibit a range of representational geometries depending on the strength of neural noise and metabolic cost. By comparing these results with recordings from primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) over the course of learning, we show that neural activity in PFC changes in line with a minimal representational strategy. Specifically, our analyses reveal that the suppression of dynamically irrelevant stimuli is achieved by activity-silent, sub-threshold dynamics. Our results provide a normative explanation as to why PFC implements an adaptive, minimal representational strategy.

">Protective mechanisms against Alzheimer's Disease in APOE3-Christchurch homozygous astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The APOE3-Christchurch (APOE3-Ch) variant has been linked to reduced Alzheimer's Disease (AD) risk, but its protective mechanisms remain unclear. This study explores the neuroprotective phenotype of APOE3-Ch astrocytes, focusing on lipid metabolism and tau processing. APOE3-Ch astrocytes demonstrate enhanced tau oligomer uptake via HSPG- and LRP1-mediated pathways, facilitated by elevated HSPG expression, and achieve superior tau degradation through lysosomal pathways and proteasomal pathways, in contrast to wild-type astrocytes, which primarily use proteasomal mechanisms. Transcriptomic analysis reveals upregulation of genes involved in endocytosis and cell projection assembly, explaining enhanced tau uptake and clearance in APOE3-Ch astrocytes. Lipidomic profiling identifies reduced levels of pathological lipids such as ceramides and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), potentially mitigating neuroinflammation. These findings provide insight into the protective mechanisms of APOE3-Ch astrocytes and underscore their potential as therapeutic targets for tauopathy and neurodegeneration in AD.

">Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme N-terminal catalytic domain prevents endogenous opioid degradation in brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) regulates blood pressure by cleaving angiotensin peptides in the periphery, and can also regulate endogenous opioid signaling by degrading enkephalin peptides in the brain. ACE has two catalytic domains, located in the N-terminal or C-terminal region of the protein, but little is known about the roles that these two catalytic domains play in regulating endogenous opioid degradation in brain tissue. Using acute brain slice preparations from mice of both sexes, we developed methods to study degradation of Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (MERF) by ACE, and investigated the role of each ACE catalytic domain in MERF degradation. Using mutant mouse lines with functional inactivation of either the N-terminal domain or the C-terminal domain, we incubated acute brain slices with exogenous MERF at a saturating concentration. The degradation MERF to produce Met-enkephalin was only reduced by N-terminal domain inactivation. Additionally, application of a selective N-terminal domain inhibitor (RXP 407) reduced degradation of both exogenously applied and endogenously released MERF, without affecting degradation of endogenously released Met-enkephalin or Leu-enkephalin. Taken together, our results suggest that the ACE N-terminal domain is the primary site of MERF degradation in brain tissue, and that N-terminal domain inhibition is sufficient to reduce degradation of this specific endogenous opioid peptide. Our results have exciting implications for the development of novel pharmacotherapies that target the endogenous opioid system to treat psychiatric and neurological disorders.

">A single dorsal vagal complex circuit mediates the aversive and anorectic responses to GLP1R agonists</a></h4>

              
                GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) effectively reduce feeding to treat obesity, although nausea and other aversive side effects of these drugs can limit their use. Brainstem circuits that promote satiation and that mediate the physiologic control of body weight can be distinguished from those that cause aversion. It remains unclear whether brainstem Glp1r neurons contribute to the normal regulation of energy balance and whether GLP1RAs control appetite via circuits distinct from those that mediate aversive responses, however. Hence, we defined roles for AP and NTS Glp1r-expressing neurons (APGlp1r and NTSGlp1r neurons, respectively) in the physiologic control of body weight, the GLP1RA-dependent suppression of food intake, and the GLP1RA-mediated stimulation of aversive responses. While silencing non-aversive NTSGlp1r neurons interfered with the physiologic restraint of feeding and body weight, restoring NTSGlp1r neuron Glp1r expression on an otherwise Glp1r-null background failed to enable long-term body weight suppression by GLP1RAs. In contrast, selective Glp1r expression in APGlp1r neurons restored both aversive responses and long-term body weight suppression by GLP1RAs. Thus, while non-aversive NTSGlp1r neurons control physiologic feeding, aversive APGlp1r neurons mediate both the anorectic and weight loss effects of GLP1RAs, dictating the functional inseparability of these pharmacologic GLP1RA responses at a circuit level.

">Working memory shapes neural geometry in human EEG over learning</a></h4>

              
                Working memory has been traditionally studied as a passive storage for information. However, recent advances have suggested that working memory is prospective rather than retrospective, meaning that its content undergoes transformations that will support future behaviour. One perspective that underscores this notion conceptualises memory processes as a computational resource that can be used to reduce the complexity of computation at decision time. Here, we explore this perspective by examining whether the process of maintenance shapes neural geometry and leads to low-dimensional representations during storage and later decision time. We recorded EEG in 25 human participants who learnt to solve a XOR task. We hypothesised that separating task features by a working memory delay would result in participants temporally decomposing the XOR computation, by prospectively processing one of the task features early in trial time. In line with our predictions, participants transformed the first feature from a sensory to an abstract format and maintained this pre-processed information throughout the delay. This process was related to the low-dimensional representation required at decision time early in learning, a representation that has recently been shown to support later cross-generalisation. These results demonstrate that low-dimensional representations, elsewhere associated with slow learning, might also provide a mechanism for maintenance processes in working memory.

">Spatial Frequency Maps in Human Visual Cortex: A Replication and Extension</a></h4>

              
                In a step toward developing a model of human primary visual cortex, a recent study developed a model of spatial frequency tuning in V1 (Broderick, Simoncelli, & Winawer, 2022). The model is compact, using just 9 parameters to predict BOLD response amplitude for locations across all of V1 as function of stimulus orientation and spatial frequency. Here we replicated this analysis in a new dataset, the 'nsdsynthetic' supplement to the Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2022), in order to assess generalization of model parameters. Furthermore, we extended the analyses to extrastriate maps V2 and V3. For each retinotopic map in each of the 8 NSD subjects, we fit the 9 parameter model. Despite many experimental differences between NSD and the original study, including stimulus size, experimental design, and MR field strength, there was good agreement in most model parameters. The dependence of preferred spatial frequency on eccentricity in V1 was similar between NSD and Broderick et al. Moreover, the effect of absolute stimulus orientation on spatial frequency maps was similar: higher preferred spatial frequency for horizontal and cardinal orientations compared to vertical and oblique orientations in both studies. The extension to extrastriate maps revealed that the biggest change in tuning between maps was in bandwidth: the bandwidth in spatial frequency tuning increased by 70% from V1 to V2 and 100% from V1 to V3, paralleling known increases in receptive field size. Together, the results show robust reproducibility of visual fMRI experiments, and bring us closer to a systematic characterization of spatial encoding in the human visual system.

">Population-level encoding of somatosensation in mouse sensorimotor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Dexterous limb movements rely on somatosensation (touch and proprioception), which provides the sense of the body's posture, movement, and interaction with objects. The heterogeneous responses of single neurons in sensorimotor cortex to somatosensation have led to disparate views of the computational role of this brain area in somatosensory processing. Here, we use population-level analyses of neural activity recorded during active and passive limb movements to assess the structure and summarize the properties of neural encoding in sensorimotor cortex. We used 2-photon imaging to record the activity of thousands of neurons in these brain areas from eight anesthetized mice during passive deflections of each limb. We additionally analyzed neural responses to passive limb movements in eight awake mice, sourced from an open dataset (Alonso et al., 2023), and neural responses to spontaneous limb movements in eight mice, collected during a previous study. To conduct the population-level analyses, we found the principal components of the time-varying neural population activity matrix in each set of experiments. Across all three datasets and behavioral conditions, a small fraction of principal components explained a large fraction of variance in the neural responses. These low-dimensional representations of single and multi-limb movements were well conserved across animals, including orthogonal representations of ipsilateral and contralateral limbs. This organization of somatosensory information mirrors the well-known structure of neural encoding of motor commands. Furthermore, while the activity of individual neurons and small populations best encoded intrinsic variables, larger populations of neurons additionally encode extrinsic variables --- a representational structure that is commonly associated with higher-level brain areas. Together, these analyses demonstrate that population-level encoding of somatosensory information in mouse sensorimotor cortex is structured to facilitate sensorimotor integration across the brain.

">Chronic social instability stress differentially affects the behavior and the transcriptome of the anterodorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis between male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Stress can be broken down into systemic and processive stressors with processive stressors requiring higher limbic processing. These are also often called social stressors as they require an understanding of social dynamics as opposed to physical based stressors. This differing of processing necessitates we study both phenomena. Additionally, sex is an important aspect of stress research as men and women show differing responses to stress and mood disorder development. To study this, we used a chronic social instability stress (CSIS) paradigm to stress male and female mice. This paradigm is approximately 7-weeks long and involves changing the cage mates of a mouse every 3 days so stable social dynamics cannot form. Afterwards, one cohort was used for avoidance behavior testing using the open field test, the elevated plus maze, the light/dark box emergence test, and the novelty suppressed feeding test. A second cohort was used for bulk RNA-Sequencing of the anterodorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis which is a limbic structure known to be related to chronic stress signaling. In the behavior assays, CSIS caused the females to be less avoidant, while the males became more avoidant. Additionally, we found that a low estrogen state in the females caused them to be less avoidant than in a high estrogen state. In the transcriptome, we found major differences between the males and females with the males expressing more genes related to transcription whereas the females expressed more genes related to synaptic transmission. We also found that the transcriptome in the males is more sensitive to the stress than the females. In summary, we have found how social stress is differentially regulated between males and females and how this may be related to the development of stress-related behavioral changes.

">CHD2 Dosage Ties Autolysosomal Pathway to Cortical Maturation in Disease and Evolution</a></h4>

              
                The relatively slow pace of cortical development in humans has long been a topic of investigation. Studies seeking to understand the underlying mechanisms have mostly focused on neurogenetic comparisons with extant species. Here we ask if developmental tempo differences may have also existed between us and our extinct relatives for whom genomes are available. To do so, we nominate a sapiens-specific derived allele, virtually fixed in contemporary populations, which resides in an enhancer region active during early cortical development. The single nucleotide variant is predicted to significantly affect CHD2 expression, a chromatin remodeler known to play an important role in neural development and for which haploinsufficiency is associated with epilepsy and autism. We leverage patient induced pluripotent stem lines (iPSC) and engineered iPSCs in which we reintroduced the ancestral allele and generated heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. We reveal that CHD2 deficiency impairs lysosomal acidification and autophagosome flux. In contrast, ancestralized lines, which we find express higher levels of CHD2, exhibit enhanced lysosomal function and consequently accelerated autophagosome flux, consistent with our observations in chimpanzee and bonobo lines. This set of findings demonstrates that CHD2 dosage critically regulates the autolysosomal pathway. Through deep phenotyping of cortical organoid and neuron cultures, we show that the CHD2-modulated autolysosomal pathway impacts the timing of developmental programs, acquisition of neuronal functional properties and circuit maturation. Finally, we validate an estrogen-dependent rewiring of CHD2 regulation in the evolution of our lineage, providing a mechanistic understanding of how a single nucleotide variant in a regulatory region contributed to the modern pace of neuronal development and maturation. Together, our findings establish CHD2 as a regulator in setting neurodevelopmental tempo via the autolysosomal pathway.

">Type-I nNOS neurons orchestrate cortical neural activity and vasomotion</a></h4>

              
                It is unknown how the brain orchestrates coordination of global neural and vascular dynamics. We sought to uncover the role of a sparse but unusual population of genetically-distinct interneurons known as type-I nNOS neurons, using a novel pharmacological strategic to unilaterally ablate these neurons from the somatosensory cortex of mice. Region-specific ablation produced changes in both neural activity and vascular dynamics, decreased power in the delta-band of the local field potential, reduced sustained vascular responses to prolonged sensory stimulation, and abolished the post-stimulus undershoot in cerebral blood volume. Coherence between the left and right somatosensory cortex gamma-band power envelope and blood volume at ultra-low frequencies was decreased, suggesting type-1 nNOS neurons integrate long-range coordination of brain signals. Lastly, we observed decreases in the amplitude of resting-state blood volume oscillations and decreased vasomotion following the ablation of type-I nNOS neurons. This demonstrates that a small population of nNOS-positive neurons are indispensable for regulating both neural and vascular dynamics in the whole brain and implicates disruption of these neurons in diseases ranging from neurodegeneration to sleep disturbances.

">Quieting the Storm: Hypoxia as a Strategy to Boost UC-MSC Therapies for Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Integrating stem cell therapies into clinical settings faces several challenges, particularly in achieving the high cell yields necessary for attaining therapeutic doses. Preconditioning with hypoxic conditions has shown promise in enhancing the UC-MSCs reparative capabilities of the central nervous system. Recent evidence suggests that oxygen concentration and exposure duration can shape MSCs' phenotypes, supporting the need for further optimization of this strategy in a way to achieve maximal repair. In this study, we assessed the effects of both prolonged mild hypoxia (MH; 5% oxygen for 48 hours) and short severe hypoxia (SSH; 0.1% oxygen for 24 hours) on UC-MSCs' ability to alleviate motor and cognitive deficits in a rodent model of neonatal HIE. Our results show that short, severe hypoxia led to more improvements in functional recovery than prolonged mild hypoxia, supporting that specific preconditioning parameters are crucial in maximizing UC-MSC therapeutic potential. To investigate the molecular effects of hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs in the neonatal brain post-HIE, we employed untargeted proteomics on ipsilesional brain samples from control, HIE, HIE treated with naive UC-MSCs, and HIE treated with SSH-preconditioned UC-MSCs groups, 30 days after lesion induction. This approach identified protein signatures related to injury and therapeutic intervention. Pathway enrichment analysis further revealed that administration of UC-MSCs preconditioned with short severe hypoxia significantly impacted neural signaling, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism pathways, pointing to long-term mechanisms that may support neuronal repair. These findings enhance our understanding of hypoxia-preconditioning in MSCs therapy in driving a positive therapeutic response, supporting the development of more effective and feasible treatments for neonatal HIE.

">DNA methylation as a contributor to dysregulation of STX6 and other frontotemporal lobar degeneration genetic risk-associated loci</a></h4>

              
                Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) represents a spectrum of clinically, genetically, and pathologically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterised by progressive atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. The two major FTLD pathological subgroups are FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau. While majority of FTLD cases are sporadic, there also exists heterogeneity within the familial cases, typically involving mutations in MAPT, GRN or C9orf72, which is not fully explained by known genetic mechanisms. We sought to address this gap by investigating the effect of epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation variation, on genes associated with FTLD genetic risk in different FTLD subtypes. We compiled a list of genes associated with genetic risk of FTLD using text-mining databases and literature searches. Frontal cortex DNA methylation profiles were derived from three FTLD datasets containing different subgroups of FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau: FTLD1m (N = 23) containing FTLD-TDP type A C9orf72 mutation carriers and TDP Type C sporadic cases, FTLD2m (N = 48) containing FTLD-Tau MAPT mutation carriers, FTLD-TDP Type A GRN mutation carriers, and FTLD-TDP Type B C9orf72 mutation carriers and FTLD3m (N = 163) progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cases, and corresponding controls. To investigate the downstream effects of DNA methylation further, we then leveraged transcriptomic and proteomic datasets for FTLD cases and controls to examine gene and protein expression levels. Our analysis revealed shared promoter region hypomethylation in STX6 across FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes, though the largest effect size was observed in the PSP cases compared to controls (delta-beta = -32%, adjusted-p value=0.002). We also observed dysregulation of the STX6 gene and protein expression across FTLD subtypes. Additionally, we performed a detailed examination of MAPT, GRN and C9orf72 in subtypes with and without the presence of the genetic mutations and observed nominally significant differentially methylated CpGs in variable positions across the genes, often with unique patterns and downstream consequences in gene/protein expression in mutation carriers. We highlight the contribution of DNA methylation at different gene regions in regulating the expression of genes previously associated with genetic risk of FTLD, including STX6. We analysed the relationship of subtypes and presence of mutations with this epigenetic mechanism to increase our understanding of how these mechanisms interact in FTLD.

">GAL-101 prevents amyloid beta-induced membrane depolarization in two different types of retinal cells</a></h4>

              
                Glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are two of the major causes of progressive vision loss and ultimately blindness worldwide. Both retinopathies share several pathological features with Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as: impairment of neuronal function, astrocytosis, and activation of immune-competent microglia and Mueller cells. It also has been shown that these conditions are characterized by the presence of an elevated concentration of amyloid beta (Abeta). Under pathological conditions, Abeta1-42 tends to aggregate, forming toxic soluble oligomers, considered to be the most harmful amyloid species. One strategy adopted to prevent cell damage caused by these oligomers is to impair their aggregation. Here we studied GAL-101, a small molecule designed to modify the aggregation of Abeta1-42. To assess the role of GAL-101 in the aggregation of Abeta1-42, in vitro electrophysiological measurements on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were performed to determine the polarization of the resting membrane potential. Cells treated only with Abeta1-42 oligomers showed a strong depolarization of the resting membrane potential, which is believed to be the main reason for retinal cells malfunctioning in neurodegenerative diseases of the eye. Pre-incubation with GAL-101 stabilized the cell resting potential to around -50mV during exposure to Abeta1-42, in both RGCs and RPE cells. GAL-101 was able to prevent changes in resting membrane potential and thus would be expected to prevent impairment of retinal cell function. These results are supportive of evaluating GAL-101 as a potential treatment of Abeta-associated retinopathies like glaucoma and dry AMD.

">Nose-to-Brain Healing: Hypoxia-Preconditioned Mesenchymal Stem Cells Prompt Recovery in Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Rats</a></h4>

              
                Neonatal HIE poses a significant risk factor for neurodevelopment impairment. Therapeutic hypothermia, the current standard of care for this condition, has several constraints and reduced effectivity, especially in more severe cases. Thus, it is necessary to explore novel therapeutics, like MSCs. Although previous studies report that administration of MSCs (from different sources) prompted the recovery of HIE-lesioned animals, high doses are currently used. First, this study compared the efficacy of IN versus IV administration of 50,000 UC-MSCs in a rat model of neonatal HI brain injury. For this cell dose, only IN-UC-MSC therapy reduced infarct volume, an effect accompanied by improvements of motor skills and recognition memory. Also, IN-UC-MSC administration restored myelination in the corpus callosum and mitigated glial reactivity more effectively than IV administration. In a second part of the study, to potentiate the effect of UC-MSCs administration, postnatal rats that underwent HI injury received 25,000 hypoxia-preconditioned UC-MSCs or its secretome two days later, via IN route. The administration of a low-dose of hypoxia-preconditioned UC-MSCs was sufficient to induce neurological recovery and modulation of glial response. Moreover, the administration of the secretome of these cells was enough to induce the same extent of recovery. These findings support the higher potential of IN-UC-MSC administration, compared to IV administration, while enhancing our understanding of hypoxia-preconditioning and the role of the secretome derived from UC-MSCs in driving a positive therapeutic response, contributing to the development of more effective and feasible treatments for neonatal HIE.

">Daily intermittent fasting is an effective multiscale treatment in preclinical models of absence epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Absence epilepsy (AE) is characterized by brief but frequent seizures with loss of consciousness. Existing treatments have heavy side effects, are only partially effective and do not address the comorbidities, including cognitive and social deficits. A tripartite link between seizures, cognitive deficits and diet has been established. We focused on intermittent fasting (IF), a regime where daily periods of fasting alternate with periods of food intake, with no restrictions in the type or quantity of food consumed. To date, the effects of IF on infantile epilepsy have not been addressed. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of a daily, one-month protocol of IF on three established mouse models of AE: the Grm7AAA KI mouse, the Scn2a haploinsufficiency mouse and the pharmacologically-induced AY-9944 mouse model. We show a reduction of the seizure frequency in all models, as well as an improvement of the sociability deficits observed in two of the models, with no adverse effects. Focusing on the Grm7AAA KI model, we performed RNA sequencing in a one of the key brain areas of the absence seizure circuit, the thalamus. We detected a deregulation of genes involved in vascularization associated with the development of malformed blood vessels in epileptic mice. Along with its anti-seizure effects, IF was able to counteract both abnormal gene expression and vessel morphology. This study demonstrates for the first time the positive effects of IF on AE and could facilitate the implementation of the diet in clinical trials.

                Traumatic brain injury significantly reduces the quality of life for millions of survivors worldwide, with no established treatments currently available. High slow-wave activity (SWA) sleep immediately after rodent TBI improves posttraumatic outcomes. However, pharmacological SWA-enhancing strategies are hindered by severe specificity and scalability issues that prevent it from effectively reaching clinical implementation. Alternatively, closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) of sleep slow waves offers specific SWA enhancement with high translational potential. Our present results demonstrate that up-phase-targeted CLAS (upCLAS)-mediated SWA enhancement reduced diffuse axonal injury, decreased demyelination, and preserved cognitive ability in TBI rats. The alleviated posttraumatic phenotype was associated with increased microglia response, likely mediating CLAS' neuroprotective effect in the acute injury phase. Auditory-enhanced SWA may thus constitute a novel noninvasive neuroprotective therapy preventing TBI sequelae via boosted cellular response to tissue damage.

">Estimating the motor exploration in reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                What motor exploration strategies do animals use to learn a skill from rewards? Reinforcement learning theory provides no guidance for estimating motor exploration - the behavioral component aimed at discovering better strategies. Inspired by the brain's modular organization, we postulate a latent learner that explores via an additive source of ideal randomness it injects into behavior. Assuming the learner is ignorant of other motor components, which is sub-optimal by design, evolutionary fitness argues that these should display mainly non-ideal variability. We test this recipe for behavior decomposition in songbirds subjected to a vocal pitch conditioning task. The explorative component we estimate from vocalizations accounts for the motor contribution of a basal ganglia pathway and the other behavioral component accounts for birds' suboptimal learning trajectories. This congruence between normative exploration and brain organization suggests that the evolutionary pressure for behavioral optimality is lesser than to learn from purely random trials.

                Mutations in LRRK2 and GBA1 are the most common genetic causes of familial Parkinsons disease. Previously, we showed that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations inhibit primary cilia formation in rare interneurons and astrocytes of the mouse and human dorsal striatum. This blocks Hedgehog signaling and reduces synthesis of neuroprotective GDNF and NRTN, which support neurons vulnerable in PD. Here we show that GBA1 mutations also impair Hedgehog signaling through a distinct mechanism. Loss of GBA1 activity decreases accessible cholesterol in primary cilia of cultured cells, thereby disrupting Hedgehog signaling. In the mouse striatum, Gba1 mutations result in reduced Hedgehog-induced Gdnf RNA expression in cholinergic interneurons, despite having no detectable impact on cilia formation. Also, both Lrrk2 and Gba1 mutations suppress Hedgehog-induced Bdnf expression in striatal astrocytes. These findings underscore the role of Hedgehog signaling in the nigrostriatal circuit and reveal a convergent mechanism by which distinct mutations may contribute to PD pathogenesis.

	<p>Background: Musculoskeletal injuries can have far-reaching consequences on brain function, leading to reduced motor control, altered movement patterns, increased inhibition of the injured muscle and joint, and changes in neuroplasticity. These deficits, controlled in part by the central nervous system (CNS), might be alleviated with an appropriate adjuvant treatment. One possibly suited treatment at the CNS level is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which modulates cortical excitability and further neuroplasticity. Objectives: The present review outlines the multifaceted repercussions of common musculo-skeletal injuries on CNS functions and presents original studies that mostly report beneficial effects regarding the use of the tDCS intervention in people who had experienced musculoskeletal injury rehabilitation. Results: The first evidence suggests that tDCS, targeting brain areas responsible for motor control or on sensory and pain-related brain regions, may offer significant benefits in the recovery of brain function and motor performance following musculoskeletal injuries. Key findings include enhanced motor function, altered CNS excitability and inhibition, and reduced pain perception, all contributing to improved rehabilitation outcomes. However, the paucity of studies and the heterogeneity of injuries render it challenging to ascertain the optimal treatment parameters. Furthermore, the variability regarding stimulation parameters is a crucial aspect that remains to be addressed and limits the possibility of generalizing these first findings. Conclusions: It is concluded that well-powered trials with standardized protocols should be conducted to confirm these effects and establish clear clinical guidelines for the use of tDCS in sports injury rehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Background/Objectives: Switching between different tasks incurs switch costs. Previous research has demonstrated that rewards can enhance performance in cognitive tasks. However, prior studies have primarily focused on the overall improvement in cognitive task performance, with limited research on how different types of rewards function under various task conditions. This study aims to investigate the distinct effects of immediate and delayed rewards on cognitive task performance in different task conditions (repeated trials and task-switching trials) and to explore the underlying neural mechanisms, particularly focusing on how rewards influence attention allocation during the concurrent processing of multiple cues. Methods: This study recruited 27 college students (average age 19 years old, 10 males and 17 females). A cue-based task-switching paradigm incorporating immediate and delayed rewards was employed. The study examined the effects of immediate and delayed rewards on cognitive task performance in repeated trials and task-switching trials. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying reward effects on attention allocation. Results: Behavioral results indicated that immediate rewards significantly enhanced performance in repeated trials compared to delayed rewards. In contrast, no significant difference between immediate and delayed rewards was observed in task-switching trials. ERP results showed that immediate rewards induced a larger P300 amplitude than delayed rewards under the task repetition condition. No P300 difference was found between immediate and delayed rewards under the task-switching condition. Conclusions: The findings suggest that rewards enhance task performance by optimizing the allocation of attention to the ongoing task when multiple cues are processed concurrently. When additional resources are required to process task-related cues, there may be insufficient remaining capacity to effectively process reward cues, which could be essential for the optimal completion of the task. These results support the Expected Value of Control (EVC) theory in task-switching scenarios.</p>

	<p>Background: Fluorocitrate (FC) ranging from 5 &amp;amp;mu;M to 5 mM is often used as a specific metabolic inhibitor of the astrocytes to study astrocytic functions. Whether FC at such concentrations may affect neuronal metabolism and function in vivo remains unclear. Methods: We examined the effects of FC on the ATP levels and Ca2+ activity of the astrocytes and neurons in the motor cortices of living mice using two-photon microscopy. Results: We found that 25 &amp;amp;mu;M and 250 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC decreased the intracellular ATP levels and Ca2+ activity in the astrocytes in the motor cortex. Equally, 250 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC, but not 25 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC, reduced the intracellular ATP levels in the dendritic processes of the layer 5 pyramidal neurons. However, 25 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC increased the neuronal Ca2+ activity, whereas &amp;amp;ge;250 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC decreased it. To test whether the differential effects of FC on neuronal Ca2+ activity reflect the direct effect of FC on the neurons or its indirect effect on the astrocytes, we used the CNO-hM3Dq chemogenetic approach to block astrocytic Ca2+ activity and examined the effect of FC. In the absence of astrocytic Ca2+ activity, 25 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC still increased and &amp;amp;ge;250 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC reduced the dendritic Ca2+ activity of the neurons, respectively, suggesting a direct effect of 250 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC on inhibiting neuronal Ca2+ activity. Further, 250 &amp;amp;mu;M, but not 25 &amp;amp;mu;M, of FC increased the size of the dendritic spines over 2 h. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that FC at high concentrations (&amp;amp;ge;250 &amp;amp;mu;M) is not a specific inhibitor of astrocytic functions, as it directly affects neuronal metabolism and synaptic plasticity in vivo.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Motor neurorehabilitation can be realized by gradually learning diverse motor imagery (MI) tasks. EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide an effective solution. Nevertheless, existing MI decoding methods cannot balance plasticity for unseen tasks and stability for old tasks. This paper proposes a generative diffusion-based task Incremental Learning (IL) method called GD-TIL. Methods: First, data augmentation is employed to increase data diversity by segmenting and recombining EEG signals. Second, to capture temporal-spatial features (TSFs) from different temporal resolutions, a multi-scale temporal-spatial feature extractor (MTSFE) is developed via integrating multiscale temporal-spatial convolutions, a dual-branch pooling operation, multiple multi-head self-attention mechanisms, and a dynamic convolutional encoder. The proposed self-supervised task generalization (SSTG) mechanism introduces a regularization constraint to guide MTSFE and unified classifier updating, which combines labels and semantic similarity between the augmentation with original views to enhance model generalizability for unseen tasks. In the IL phase, a prototype-guided generative replay module (PGGR) is used to generate old tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; TSFs by training a lightweight diffusion model based on the prototype and label of each task. Furthermore, the generated TSF is merged with a new TSF to fine-tune the convolutional encoder and update the classifier and PGGR. Finally, GD-TIL is evaluated on a self-collected ADL-MI dataset with two MI pairs and a public dataset with four MI tasks. Results: The continuous decoding accuracy reaches 80.20% and 81.32%, respectively. The experimental results exhibit the excellent plasticity and stability of GD-TIL, even beating the state-of-the-art IL methods. Conclusions: Our work illustrates the potential of MI-based BCI and generative AI for continuous neurorehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background: E-cigarettes, initially designed for nicotine consumption, are now increasingly being used to smoke cannabis, resulting in a growing trend known as &amp;amp;ldquo;dual vaping&amp;amp;rdquo;. This term describes individuals, referred to as &amp;amp;ldquo;dual users&amp;amp;rdquo;, who use e-cigarettes for both substances. This study aims to review and analyze existing research on dual vaping, with a focus on the associated health risks and behavioral patterns. Methods: A narrative review of the literature was conducted using PubMed. Studies focusing on individuals who use electronic cigarettes for vaping tobacco and cannabis, either chronically or episodically, were examined. Relevant articles were identified and thematically synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. Results: Dual vaping was found to be prevalent among younger men, White and Hispanic populations, and individuals with higher economic status and educational level. The use of one substance was shown to predispose individuals to the use of the other, often leading to concurrent use of both substances. Peer influence and positive expectations regarding e-cigarettes were identified as significant predictors of dual use. Dual vapers exhibited a higher susceptibility to respiratory and systemic symptoms compared to those who exclusively vaped nicotine or cannabis. Moreover, a notable prevalence of psychiatric disorders, such as substance use disorders, anxiety, and depression, was observed in this group. Fruit-flavored e-cigarettes were the most preferred option among dual vapers when using both nicotine and cannabis. Conclusions: Current evidence is insufficient to fully elucidate the long-term impacts of dual vaping on physical and mental health, particularly when compared to individuals who have never vaped. Further studies are needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this behavior.</p>

                Background This research investigated the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, analysing the interplay of socioeconomic, political, and institutional factors to elucidate the complexities surrounding its implementation and impact. Using a causal loop diagram approach (CLD), the study aims to identify key factors to effective implementation, how they interact to shape the outcome of the policy, and actionable strategies to address the challenges hindering the policy sustainability. Method A participatory approach was used to developing the CLD, integrating insights from an extensive literature review and stakeholder opinion. The initial CLD was constructed based on evidence from prior research contextualizing fee-free higher education within South Africa’s unique socio-political sector. Discussions with stakeholders and experts provided critical feedback to refine the model, ensuring its relevance and accuracy. The CLD methodology was selected for its ability to illustrate complex interdependencies and systemic challenges. Results Key findings highlight the impact of funding constraints, which create reinforcing feedback loops limiting access and infrastructure improvements. Also, administrative inefficiencies within the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) result in delays and inconsistencies, reducing policy inclusivity, and decentralized implementation across institutions perpetuates disparities in quality and access. Conclusion The study concludes the urgent need for systemic reforms, including digitising financial aid processes, centralising NSFAS operations, and improving resource allocation to under-resourced institutions. Furthermore, the study aligns with global goals, particularly Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 4 (Quality Education), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), as well as the African Agenda 2063’s focus on human capital development. While the findings offer valuable recommendations for policymakers, further research is needed to explore longitudinal impacts of these reforms and expand comparative analyses with other nations implementing similar policies.

                Background In this paper, we explore the Cartesian product of fuzzy PUP ideals and subalgebras within a PUP (pseudo-UP)algebra X. We investigate how fuzzy pseudo-UP ideals are affected under PUP homomorphisms, particularly focusing on the image and inverse image of the fuzzy sets K α and K v , which generalize classical fuzzy sets. These fuzzy sets aim to quantify the level of ambiguity in fuzzy situations. Methods We introduced the concept of the Cartesian product of fuzzy PUP ideals and subalgebras of PUP algebra and analyzed their properties. Specifically, we studied the behavior of fuzzy pseudo-UP ideals under PUP homomorphism, using the fuzzy sets K α and K v to model ambiguity. We also examined the strongest fuzzy PUP relation on a fuzzy PUP subalgebra and ideal of PUP algebra. Results We proved that the Cartesian product of fuzzy PUP ideals forms a fuzzy pseudo-UP ideal. This result was characterized through its level sets, providing a deeper understanding of the interaction between fuzzy PUP ideals and their algebraic structure. Additionally, the strongest fuzzy PUP relation on a fuzzy PUP subalgebra was defined, and several important properties were derived. Conclusions This work extends the concept of fuzzy PUP ideals in the context of PUP algebras and explores how fuzzy homomorphism influence their structure. Our results contribute to a better understanding of fuzzy relations in algebraic settings and open the door for further research into the properties and applications of fuzzy ideals in PUP algebras.

                Background Cataracts are an assortment of conditions causing the lens to become opaque and lose its typical transparency. Topical corticosteroids like loteprednol etabonate and dexamethasone are commonly administered to alleviate inflammation following cataract surgery. Aim of the study To compare the efficacy of loteprednol etabonate and dexamethasone in managing different clinical parameters following cataract removal, as well as their patient safety. Methods This trial was registered by local IRB at the College of Medicine/University of Baghdad on November 27, 2023, under document approval number UoB.Med.21. Patients undergoing cataract surgery were randomly assigned to two groups: group A received loteprednol etabonate 0.5% drop postoperatively for four weeks, while group B received dexamethasone 0.1% drop postoperatively for the same period. The levels of intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior chamber (AC) reaction, and scores for flare, conjunctival congestion, and pain were monitored at one and four weeks during follow-up visits. Results The visual outcomes were similar between the two groups, and both treatments were well tolerated with minor side effects. Both loteprednol etabonate and dexamethasone effectively reduced IOP, AC reaction, and grading for flare, conjunctival congestion, and pain in cataract patients. None of these clinical measures displayed any significant differences between the two drugs. Conclusion There is no significant difference between topical loteprednol etabonate 0.5% and topical dexamethasone 0.1% pertaining to clinical ocular parameters post-cataract surgery. The decision between these corticosteroids may depend on patient needs and preferences.

                Abstract* Financial literacy is one of the most important skills that people need in the 21st century, especially the youngest, as is the case with college students and mastering personal finance skills. This topic has gained importance in recent years in the field of scientific research. The objective of this study was to identify the most relevant factors related to financial education among young university students. A systematic literature review was developed based on the parameters established by the PRISMA statement. A total of 44 datasets were analyzed to identify the most recurring factors in the literature. Finally, the validity of the most relevant issues pertaining to the subject of study were identified. Thus, two themes were evident that are still valid and the most frequent in the literature on financial literacy among university students: financial behavior and financial knowledge. It is concluded that financial Inclusion, Budgeting, Financial Attitude, and Adolescents are other topics with a promising future in future research. The results of this study provide a structured guide for future research and help to identify research gaps that can be addressed in future studies.

                Background Adequate housing is a fundamental human need, yet in Egypt and the MENA region, they face challenges due to rising population pressures and economic difficulties. Affordable options are increasingly scarce, especially for those unable to meet housing market rates. This research explores micro-apartments as an eco-friendly solution aligned with global trends toward minimalism, offering compact living spaces of about 40 square meters. In Alexandria, where awareness is limited and energy consumption is high, the study emphasizes micro-apartments as a housing solution with the aim to improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency for the occupants using Phase Change Materials (PCMs) and passive design strategies. Methods This research evaluates micro-apartments as affordable housing in Egypt, emphasizing passive design and RT24HC Phase Change Material for wall insulation in Alexandria. A prototype is developed, and Design Builder software, using version 7.0.2.006 & Energy Plus 9.4 plugin, simulates the chosen RT24HC PCM’s energy efficiency. This methodology optimizes land use and enhances thermal comfort by integrating PCM with passive design, assessing Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfaction (PPD%) and Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). Results The results indicate that integrating the chosen Phase Change Material with passive design significantly lowers discomfort levels in micro-apartments. Four scenarios tested included: two layers of RT24HC PCM, one layer of RT24HC PCM with XPS insulation, two RT24HC PCM layers with window shading, and two RT24HC PCM layers with 1-meter overhang. The fourth scenario, achieving a 14.18% reduction in predicted discomfort (PPD%) and a Predicted Mean Vote of 1.3, highlights the potential of micro-apartments as an energy-efficient housing through effective PCM integration. Conclusion This study advocates for micro-apartment designs using RT24HC PCM tailored to Alexandria’s climate in Egypt to improve thermal comfort and reduce energy consumption. It provides insights for architects, developers, and policymakers in Egypt, highlighting the importance of PCM in sustainable urban housing solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-940/v2?src=rss">Integration of democratic values in natural sciences education: A Literature Review of the last 50 Years [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                This study examines how democratic values have been promoted through natural sciences education over the last 50 years, providing a comprehensive analysis based on a systematic review of relevant literature. The central problem addressed is understanding the role of natural science education in fostering democratic values such as equity, participation, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility. This research aims to identify and analyze strategies, methodologies, and transformative experiences that contribute to the promotion of democratic values. This study employs the PRISMA methodology to ensure a rigorous and structured systematic review. Data were collected from multiple databases using detailed Boolean equations. Tools such as ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used for data preprocessing, clustering, and network visualization, followed by qualitative analysis to categorize the findings. Educational programs in natural sciences have increasingly integrated democratic values, fostering a culture of inclusivity and participation; the incorporation of ICT has enhanced equity and participation, while civic education has been fundamental in developing critical and informed citizens; citizen science initiatives have empowered students to engage in democratic deliberation and address epistemic injustice; cooperative learning methods in science classes have effectively promoted gender equity and inclusion; and emphasis on sustainability and environmental justice in science education has promoted democratic values and empowered students to take action on global challenges. In conclusion, natural science education is an effective vehicle for promoting democratic values, but it is an understudied field. By integrating practices that emphasize inclusivity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility, science education not only enhances students’ scientific understanding but also prepares them to be active, informed, and responsible citizens.

                Background Research integrity, essential for ethical scientific research, has been inadequately addressed in Ethiopia, resulting in gaps in addressing misconduct like plagiarism, falsification and fabrication. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of researchers. Data were collected via a self-administered, structured questionnaire, which was adapted from a similar study. The collected data were analysed using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression. Result A total of 244 researchers participated in the study, resulting in an 82% response rate. In our study, 37.7% of participants reported engaging in at least one form of misconduct, 95% CI [31.6%, 44.1%]. Authorship misconduct was the most common form of self-reported misconduct (47.5%), 95% CI [41.1%, 54.0%], followed by fabrication and falsification (40.6%), 95% CI [34.4%, 47.0%]. Publication pressure was significantly associated with research misconduct (AOR = 3.18; 95% CI: [1.02, 9.95]). Conclusion Research misconduct has profound implications, compromising the validity of scientific findings and eroding public trust in research. Implementing comprehensive education initiatives on responsible research practices, as well as building an all-encompassing institutional policy, can help to reduce the occurrence of misconduct.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The study of in vivo thrombus formation has principally been performed using intravital microscopy in mice and other species. These have allowed us to visualise the molecular and cellular processes that regulate thrombus formation inside the body. However current in vivo arterial thrombosis models are difficult to standardise between labs and frequently produce results that do not reliably translate successfully in human clinical trials. Here we provide a step-by-step description with accompanying video tutorials to demonstrate how to produce a 3D humanised thrombus-on-a-chip model, which uses perfusion of fluorescently-labelled human blood over a mechanically-injured human tissue engineered arterial construct (TEAC) within a 3D printed microfluidic flow chamber to replicate thrombus formation within a healthy artery. We also provide a written methodology on how to use 3D printing to produce a mechanical injury press that can reproducibly damage the TEAC as a stimulus for thrombus formation as part of a mechanical injury model. Perfusion of the uninjured TEAC with whole human blood containing DiOC6-labelled platelets without initiating notable thrombus formation. The mechanical injury press was shown to induce a reproducible puncture wound in the TEAC. Fluorescence microscopy was used to demonstrate that thrombus formation could be observed reproducibly around sites of injury. This humanised thrombosis-on-a-chip model can replace the use of animals in in vivo thrombosis models for preclinical assessment of anti-thrombotic therapies. This method also offers multiple scientific advantages: allowing new drugs to be directly tested on human blood from a diverse array of donors, facilitating use of a realistic and reproducible injury modality as well as removing the potential confounding effects of general anaesthetics in animal studies. The use of human thrombus-on-a-chip models combining TEACs offers a new methodology to reduce animal use whilst improving the predictive capabilities of preclinical trials of anti-thrombotic therapies.

                Background Stunting is a serious public health concern in Rwanda, affecting around 33.3% of children under five in 2020. The researchers have employed machine learning algorithms to predict stunting in Rwanda; however, few studies used ANNs, despite their strong capacity to predict stunting. The purpose of this study was to predict stunting in Rwanda using ANNs and the most recent DHS data from 2020. Methods DHS 2020 dataset was used to train and test an ANN model for predicting stunting in children. The dataset, which included various child, parental, and socio-demographic characteristics, was split into 80% training data and 20% testing and validation data. The model utilised a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Feature importances were determined and highlighted the most critical predictors of stunting. Results An overall accuracy of 72.0% on the test set was observed, with an AUC-ROC of 0.84, indicating the model’s good performance. Factors appear to contribute to stunting among the negative value aspects. First and foremost, the mother’s height is important, as a lower height suggests an increased risk of stunting in children. Positive value characteristics, on the other hand, emphasise elements that reduce the likelihood of stunting. The timing of the initiation of breastfeeding stands out as a crucial factor, showing that early breastfeeding initiation has been linked with a decreased risk of stunting. Conclusions These findings suggest that ANNs can be a useful tool for predicting stunting in Rwanda and identifying the most important associated factors for stunting. These insights can inform targeted interventions to reduce the burden of stunting in Rwanda and other low- and middle-income countries. Potential targeted interventions include nutritional support programs for pregnant and lactating mothers, and providing educational programs for parents on nutrition and hygiene.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The legacy of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, Spain’s first Nobel laureate neuroscientist recognized as the founding father of modern neuroscience, is to be preserved in a new museum in Madrid: the National Museum of Natural Sciences (MNCN), one of the most important scientific research institutes in the country sciences in the scope of natural sciences of the Spanish National Research Council. For a boy who dreamed of being an artist but started his career apprenticed to first a barber and then a cobbler, Santiago Ramón y Cajal made a distinguished mark in science. One of Cajal’s most important contributions to our understanding of the brain was his discovery of the direction of the information flow within neurons and in neural circuits, which he called the “dynamic polarization law,” without a doubt the founding principle of neurosciences. The exposition planned by the MNCN is a perfect occasion to show the academy and, it is hoped, the general public at large the beautiful organization of the nervous system as first acknowledged by modern science. With the highly motivated organizers of this well-planned initiative, neuroscientists at the Cajal Institute are confident that this sample of the Cajal legacy will also be taken as an esthetic experience for those who approach it for the first time. It might be that science and art often go together.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal loss. Previous studies using human postmortem tissues have shown the impact of neurodegenerative disorders on adult neurogenesis. The extent to which adult neural stem cells are activated in the subventricular zone and whether therapeutic treatments such as deep brain stimulation promote adult neurogenesis remains unclear. The goal of the present study is to assess adult neural stem cells activation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases who were treated or not by deep brain stimulation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Postmortem brain samples from Huntington's and Parkinson's disease patients who had received or not long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our results indicate a significant increase in the thickness of the subventricular zone and in the density of proliferating cells and activated stem cells in the brain of Huntington's disease subjects and Parkinson's disease patients treated with deep brain stimulation. We also observed an increase in the density of immature neurons in the brain of these patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, our data indicate that long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus promotes cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone that are reduced in Parkinson's disease. Taken together, our results also provide a detailed characterization of the cellular composition of the adult human subventricular zone and caudate nucleus in normal condition and in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and demonstrate the plasticity of these regions in response to neurodegeneration.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to delineate synaptic density alterations in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and explore its potential role as a biomarker for MSA diagnosis and disease severity monitoring using [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET CT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this prospective study, 60 patients with MSA (30 patients with MSA-parkinsonian [MSA-P] subtype and 30 patients with MSA-cerebellar [MSA-C] subtype), 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET/CT for synaptic density assessment. Visual, voxel, and volumetric region of interest (VOI) analyses were used to elucidate synaptic density patterns in the MSA brain and establish diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic performances of both visual and VOI-based diagnostics were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Spearman correlation analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between brain synaptic density and disease severity</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with MSA displayed extensive reductions in synaptic density throughout the brain, notably affecting both primary VOIs (the cerebellum and putamen) and secondary VOIs including the medulla oblongata, ventral tegmental area, and pons. Notably, patients with MSA-C exhibited a remarkable decrease in cerebellar synaptic density, whereas patients with MSA-P demonstrated significant synaptic loss within the posterior putamen. Compared with patients with PD, the patients with MSA show a more pronounced reduction in synaptic density in infratentorial brain regions. VOI-based diagnosis significantly outperformed visual analysis in diagnosing and differentiating MSA and its subtypes. Synaptic density in primary and multiple secondary VOIs correlated significantly with motor scales in patients with MSA.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study identified widespread synaptic density reductions in MSA, particularly in the basal ganglia and infratentorial region, suggesting [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET as a potential biomarker for diagnosing and evaluating the disease, and guiding synaptic restoration trials.

                Glioma patients suffer devastating neurological complications. Using mouse models, the authors show that glioma induces neuronal mTOR activity, alters translation of synaptic genes, reduces dendritic spines and inhibitory synapses, and causes hyperexcitability and stimulus-evoked discharges. Inhibiting mTOR with AZD8055 reverses these effects and normalizes neuronal activity, highlighting its therapeutic potential.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97438">Sir2 and Fun30 regulate ribosomal DNA replication timing via MCM helicase positioning and nucleosome occupancy</a></h4>

              
                The association between late replication timing and low transcription rates in eukaryotic heterochromatin is well known, yet the specific mechanisms underlying this link remain uncertain. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the histone deacetylase Sir2 is required for both transcriptional silencing and late replication at the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays. We have previously reported that in the absence of <i>SIR2</i>, a de-repressed RNA PolII repositions MCM replicative helicases from their loading site at the ribosomal origin, where they abut well-positioned, high-occupancy nucleosomes, to an adjacent region with lower nucleosome occupancy. By developing a method that can distinguish activation of closely spaced MCM complexes, here we show that the displaced MCMs at rDNA origins have increased firing propensity compared to the nondisplaced MCMs. Furthermore, we found that both activation of the repositioned MCMs and low occupancy of the adjacent nucleosomes critically depend on the chromatin remodeling activity of <i>FUN30</i>. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which Sir2 delays replication timing, and it demonstrates, for the first time, that activation of a specific replication origin in vivo relies on the nucleosome context shaped by a single chromatin remodeler.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96724">A septo-hypothalamic-medullary circuit directs stress-induced analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Stress is a potent modulator of pain. Specifically, acute stress due to physical restraint induces stress-induced analgesia (SIA). However, where and how acute stress and pain pathways interface in the brain are poorly understood. Here, we describe how the dorsal lateral septum (dLS), a forebrain limbic nucleus, facilitates SIA through its downstream targets in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of mice. Taking advantage of transsynaptic viral-genetic, optogenetic, and chemogenetic techniques, we show that the dLS→LHA circuitry is sufficient to drive analgesia and is required for SIA. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dLS→LHA pathway is opioid-dependent and modulates pain through the pro-nociceptive neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Remarkably, we found that the inhibitory dLS neurons are recruited specifically when the mice struggle to escape under restraint and, in turn, inhibit excitatory LHA neurons. As a result, the RVM neurons downstream of LHA are disengaged, thus suppressing nociception. Together, we delineate a poly-synaptic pathway that can transform escape behavior in mice under restraint to acute stress into analgesia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89506">Systematic evaluation of intratumoral and peripheral BCR repertoires in three cancers</a></h4>

              
                The current understanding of humoral immune response in cancer patients suggests that tumors may be infiltrated with diffuse B cells of extra-tumoral origin or may develop organized lymphoid structures, where somatic hypermutation and antigen-driven selection occur locally. These processes are believed to be significantly influenced by the tumor microenvironment through secretory factors and biased cell-cell interactions. To explore the manifestation of this influence, we used deep unbiased immunoglobulin profiling and systematically characterized the relationships between B cells in circulation, draining lymph nodes (draining LNs), and tumors in 14 patients with three human cancers. We demonstrated that draining LNs are differentially involved in the interaction with the tumor site, and that significant heterogeneity exists even between different parts of a single lymph node (LN). Next, we confirmed and elaborated upon previous observations regarding intratumoral immunoglobulin heterogeneity. We identified B cell receptor (BCR) clonotypes that were expanded in tumors relative to draining LNs and blood and observed that these tumor-expanded clonotypes were less hypermutated than non-expanded (ubiquitous) clonotypes. Furthermore, we observed a shift in the properties of complementarity-determining region 3 of the BCR heavy chain (CDR-H3) towards less mature and less specific BCR repertoire in tumor-infiltrating B-cells compared to circulating B-cells, which may indicate less stringent control for antibody-producing B cell development in tumor microenvironment (TME). In addition, we found repertoire-level evidence that B-cells may be selected according to their CDR-H3 physicochemical properties before they activate somatic hypermutation (SHM). Altogether, our work outlines a broad picture of the differences in the tumor BCR repertoire relative to non-tumor tissues and points to the unexpected features of the SHM process.

">A cholinergic spinal pathway for the adaptive control of breathing</a></h4>

              
                The ability to amplify motor neuron (MN) output is essential for generating high intensity motor actions. This is critical for breathing that must be rapidly adjusted to accommodate changing metabolic demands. While brainstem circuits generate the breathing rhythm, the pathways that directly augment respiratory MN output are not well understood. Here, we mapped first-order inputs to phrenic motor neurons (PMNs), a key respiratory MN population that initiates diaphragm contraction to drive breathing. We identified a predominant spinal input from a distinct subset of genetically-defined V0C cholinergic interneurons. We found that these interneurons receive phasic excitation from brainstem respiratory centers, augment phrenic output through M2 muscarinic receptors, and are highly activated under a hypercapnia challenge. Specifically silencing cholinergic interneuron neurotransmission impairs the breathing response to hypercapnia. Collectively, our findings identify a novel spinal pathway that amplifies breathing, presenting a potential target for promoting recovery of breathing following spinal cord injury.

">A formal model of anxiety disorders based on the neural circuit dynamics of the fear and extinction circuits</a></h4>

              
                The pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is the outcome of an imbalance of the fear-anxiety circuit and the extinction circuit. We present a formal model using nonlinear dynamics and network theory, which captures the dynamic interactions of the key nodes of the anxiety and extinction networks. This rudimentary model can be modified by newer data. These core nodes consist of the cells of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus coding negative valence, the neurons of the basal-lateral amygdala coding negative valence (Rspo2+), the anterior cingulate cortex, the ventral hippocampus neurons coding fear memories, the somatostatin expressing cells of the lateral segment of the central amygdala, the medial segment of the central nucleus of the amygdala-bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and their target nodes. The extinction network consists primarily of the paraventricular thalamic cells coding positive valence, (Ppp1r1b+) cells of the basolateral amygdala coding positive valence, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the PKC{delta} cells of the lateral segment of the central amygdala, and the intercalated cells. Human and non-human animal genetic and epigenetic studies point to deficiencies in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophic receptor kinase tyrosine 2 production in key nodes causing reduced plasticity extinction network plasticity and leading to a weakened extinction response. We rely primarily on the neurophysiological studies of non-human animal models since nodes generating fear/anxiety and extinction responses are highly conserved across species and equivalent nodes are present within analogous circuits of the human brain. The results are confirmed, where possible by human functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. We believe this simplified model is of heurist value and can lead to a more consistent focus on physiologically based pathophysiology. This would lead to treatments to reverse the pathologic physiology produced by genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, and greater efforts to directly correct pathologic circuit activity through direct interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation.

">High intensity exercise before sleep boosts memory encoding the next morning</a></h4>

              
                The importance of sleep for memory consolidation has been extensively studied, but its role for memory encoding remains less well characterized. At the molecular and cellular level, the renormalization of synaptic weights during sleep has received substantial support, which is thought to free capacity to encode new information at the behavioral level. However, at the systems level and behaviorally, support for this process playing a major role for memory function remains scarce. In the current study, we investigated the utility of moderate- and high-intensity evening exercise as a low-cost low-tech intervention to modulate sleep and its influence on subsequent encoding in the morning. Our findings indicate that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) improved post-sleep memory performance with effects lasting up to 24 hours after initial encoding. In addition, we show that especially the early parts of the encoding task were affected by the HIIT intervention, which is in line with increases in synaptic homeostasis being targeted by the exercise. Intriguingly, low-performing participants seemed to benefit more from the HIIT intervention suggesting it not only as a tool for basic research but also as a candidate for applications to boost memory performance in mental disorders or in the elderly. These results provide first evidence that acute exercise can affect learning processes even hours after it occurs.

">Diversity in the impact of heterogeneities on recurrent networks performing a cognitive task</a></h4>

              
                Background and motivation: Artificial recurrent networks are widely used as models to study the complex dynamics underlying biological neural networks during execution of cognitive tasks. However, most studies assume individual units in the recurrent network to be homogeneous repeating units, whereas real neurons exhibit several forms of heterogeneities. In this study, we designed and employed a systematic framework for quantitative assessment of the impact of neural heterogeneities on recurrent networks that were trained to perform a cognitive task. Methodology: Our framework involved training of a population of recurrent networks, differing in terms of their hyperparameters, to perform a cognitive task in the presence of six graded levels of intrinsic heterogeneities. We tested the impact of heterogeneities on several performance metrics that encompassed training performance, task-execution dynamics, and resilience to different forms of post-training heterogeneities (also introduced at different levels. Results: Our population-of-networks approach demonstrate that intrinsic heterogeneities impacted network performance and dynamics in diverse ways even if they were trained with the same training algorithm, convergence criteria, and task specifications. First, our analyses unveiled pronounced network-to-network variability in the dependence of training performance on the level of heterogeneity, in terms of the number of training trials required for learning and the error values associated with task performance. Second, the impact of training heterogeneities on network dynamics during task execution also manifested substantial variability across networks. Finally, our analyses revealed a prominent impact of different forms of post-training heterogeneities on performance errors and network dynamics. We observed progressive increases in errors as well as in trajectory deviations with graded increases in post-training heterogeneities. Importantly, we observed pronounced variability in how robustness to post-training heterogeneities depended on the level of training heterogeneities. Specifically, certain networks showed enhanced robustness to post-training heterogeneities when training heterogeneities were low, whereas others showed better robustness when training heterogeneities were high. Implications: The striking nature of network-to-network variability observed in our analyses strongly advocates a complex systems viewpoint to study the impact of neural heterogeneities on circuit function. Within such a complex system framework, where several functionally specialized subsystems interact with each other in non-random ways to yield collective performance of the task, we argue that the emphasis should not be on heterogeneities in individual components of neural circuits. Instead, we emphasize the need to focus on the global structure of different forms and degrees of heterogeneities across different components and a systematic assessment of how they interact with each other towards adapting and achieving collective function.

                Sleep-wakefulness regulation dynamically evolves along development in flies, fish, and humans. While the mechanisms regulating sleep in adults are relatively well understood, little is known about their counterparts in early developmental stages. Here, we report a neuropeptidergic circuitry that modulates sleep in developing Drosophila larvae. Through an unbiased screen, we identified the neuropeptide Hugin and its receptor PK2-R1 as critical regulators of larval sleep. Our data suggest that HugPC neurons secrete Hugin peptides to activate insulin-producing cells (IPCs), which express a Hugin receptor PK2-R1. IPCs, in turn, release Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) to regulate sleep. We further show that the Hugin/PK2-R1 axis is dispensable for adult sleep control. Our findings thus reveal the neuromodulatory circuitry regulating larval sleep, highlighting differential impacts of the same modulatory axis on developmental sleep and adult sleep.

                Hypoxia-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability has been identified as a key contributor to the progression of ischemic-hypoxic brain injury and neuronal dysfunction in stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases. Emerging clinical evidence highlights that the vasoprotective signaling properties of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), mediated through its bioactive lipid component sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), may be impaired in cardiovascular and inflammatory conditions. Nonetheless, the precise contributions and mechanistic roles of S1P signaling within the cerebral microvasculature remain insufficiently characterized. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of S1P signaling via its endothelial receptor S1PR1 in the pathophysiology of early brain injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a particularly severe form of stroke. Additionally, we sought to evaluate the relevance of the endothelial S1PR1 pathway in the human cerebrovascular endothelium, its functional role in hypoxia-induced cerebral endothelial barrier dysfunction, and its underlying molecular mechanisms. To address these objectives, we utilized endothelial-specific S1PR1 knockout mice subjected to the endovascular rupture model of aneurysmal SAH, performed mechanistic studies in primary human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, and characterized S1PR1 expression in human brain tissue using validated protocols. Our findings reveal robust expression of S1PR1 in the cerebrovascular endothelium of both mice and humans. Functional analyses demonstrated that S1PR1 is critical for maintaining BBB integrity and mitigating neuronal injury in the context of SAH. Mechanistic in vitro studies indicated that S1PR1 exerts a vasoprotective effect by limiting hypoxia-induced BBB dysfunction in human primary brain microvascular endothelial cells through inhibition of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), suppression of stress fiber formation and caveolin-1-dependent endosomal trafficking. These results highlight the pivotal role of endothelial S1PR1 signaling in preserving cerebral vascular integrity and provide a strong scientific foundation for developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting the S1P pathway in the endothelium to enhance neurovascular protection.

">The interplay between CB2 and NMDA receptors in Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, causing symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, slowness, and balance problems due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Nowadays there is no cure for PD. Alpha synuclein (-syn) aggregates, which are a hallmark of PD, are known to induce microglial activation, specifically the detrimental M1 microglial phenotype, which contributes to neuroinflammation and disease progression. Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) activation has been shown to counteract neuroinflammation. CB2R is able to interact with NMDA receptors (NMDAR), which has also attracted attention in PD research due to its role in excitotoxicity. Here we aimed to study the interaction between CB2R and NMDAR in a PD context. We observed that -syn fibrils alter CB2R activation and CB2R-NMDAR heteromerization in a heterologous expression system. Furthermore, activation of CB2R counteracted NMDAR signaling. In neurons -syn fibrils decreased CB2R-NMDAR heteromer expression, while increasing CB2R signaling. Importantly, CB2R activation counteracted the -syn fibrils-induced increase in M1 activated microglia, while it favored the polarization of microglia to the beneficial M2 phenotype. These results reinforce the idea of using cannabinoids for treating PD, as they provide not only the anti-inflammatory effects of cannabinoids but also counteract the detrimental increase in NMDAR signaling present in this disease.

                The complexity of our environment poses significant challenges for adaptive behavior. Recognizing shared structures across tasks can theoretically improve learning through generalization. However, how such shared representations emerge and influence performance remains poorly understood. Contrary to expectations, our findings revealed that individuals trained on tasks with similar low-dimensional structures performed worse than those trained on dissimilar tasks. Magnetoencephalography revealed correlated neural representations in the same-structure group and anticorrelated ones in the different-structure group. Crucially, practice reduced this performance gap and shifted the neural representations of the tasks in the same-structure group towards anticorrelation, like those in the different-structure group. A neural network model trained on similar tasks replicated these findings: tasks with similar structures require more iterations to orthogonalize their representations. These results highlight a complex interplay between task similarity, neural dynamics, and behavior, challenging traditional assumptions about learning and generalization.

">Acute temporal, regional, and cell-type specific NKCC1 disruption following severe TBI in the developing gyrencephalic brain.</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with no effective treatment and limited clinical management. We developed a multifactorial traumatic brain injury model in piglets which mirrors the evolving pathophysiology of severe pediatric TBI, showing age-dependent hypoxic-ischemic cerebral cortical injury and matrix metalloproteinase-driven vasogenic edema, with infant piglets experiencing less tissue damage than toddler piglets. Extracellular matrix breakdown can precipitate neuronal dysfunction, disrupting chloride homeostasis and the reversal potential for GABA. We hypothesized that ongoing tissue damage might be related to markers of immature GABA, evaluated by changes to the expression and phosphorylation of sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2), and a regulatory kinase, (STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase) SPAK. We mapped these markers in developing swine and infant human brain, identifying a postnatal pNKCC1 decrease in human infant hippocampus, and a perinatal cortical and hippocampal GABA switch in pigs, with no change in the thalamus. In infant piglets with severe TBI, upregulation of neuronal pNKCC1 correlated with hypoxic-ischemic injury and seizure duration. We also observed dysregulation of NKCC1, KCC2, and SPAK in cortex and hippocampus in infant and toddler piglets with severe TBI, with thalamus unchanged. We noted ectopic, non-apical localization of pNKCC1 signal in choroid plexus epithelium across ages in piglets and humans with severe TBI, indicating acute dysregulation of the CSF chloride milieu. These findings position swine as a useful model for pediatric TBI research and suggest that SPAK or NKCC1 inhibition in infants may be therapeutic.

">Oligodendroglia vulnerability in the human dorsal striatum in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendroglia are the responsible cells for myelination in the central nervous system and their involvement in Parkinsons disease (PD) is poorly understood. We performed snRNA-seq and image-based spatial transcriptomics of human caudate nucleus and putamen (dorsal striatum) from PD and Control brain donors to elucidate the diversity of oligodendroglia and how they are affected by the disease. We have defined fifteen subclasses, from precursor to mature cells, four of which are disease-associated. These PD-specific populations are characterized by the overexpression of heat shock proteins and distinct expression signatures, including immune responses and myelination alterations. We have also identified disruptions in cell communication and oligodendrocyte development, evidenced by changes in neurotransmitter receptors expression and cell adhesion molecules. These transcriptomic changes correlated with impaired myelin integrity and altered oligodendrocyte distribution in the striatum. Thus, we uncover oligodendroglia as a critical cell type in PD and a potential new therapeutic target.

">The Innexin 7 gap junction protein contributes to synchronized activity in the Drosophila antennal lobe and regulates olfactory function</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), gap junctions coordinate synchronous activity among mitral and tufted cells to process olfactory information. In insects, gap junctions are also present in the Antennal Lobe (AL), a structure homologous to the mammalian OB. The invertebrate gap junction protein ShakB contributes to electrical synapses between AL Projections Neurons (PNs) in Drosophila. Other gap junction proteins, including Innexin 7 (Inx7), are also expressed in the Drosophila AL, but little is known about their contribution to intercellular communication during olfactory information processing. Here we report spontaneous calcium transients in PNs grown in cell culture that are highly synchronous when these neurons are physically connected. RNAi-mediated knock down of Inx7 in cultured PNs blocks calcium transient neuronal synchronization. In vivo, downregulation of Inx7 in the AL impairs both vinegar-induced electrophysiological calcium responses and behavioral responses to this appetitive stimulus. These results demonstrate that Inx7-encoded gap junctions functionally coordinate PN activity and modulate olfactory information processing in the adult Drosophila AL.

">Long-term hippocampal low-frequency stimulation alleviates focal seizures, memory deficits and synaptic pathology in epileptic mice</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundMesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a prevalent form of focal epilepsy characterized by seizures originating from the hippocampus and adjacent regions. Neurostimulation presents an alternative for surgery-ineligible patients with intractable seizures. However, conventional approaches have limited efficacy and require refinement for better seizure control. While hippocampal low-frequency stimulation (LFS) has shown promising seizure reduction in animal studies and small clinical cohorts, its mechanisms, sex-specific outcomes, and long-term effects remain unknown.

ObjectivesWe aimed to identify the long-term antiepileptic and cognitive outcomes and potential underlying mechanisms of hippocampal LFS in chronically epileptic male and female mice.

MethodsWe used the intrahippocampal kainate mouse model replicating the features of MTLE: spontaneous seizures, hippocampal sclerosis, and memory deficits. We applied 1 Hz electrical LFS in the sclerotic hippocampus 6 hours a day, four times a week for 5 weeks and examined its effects on epileptiform activity, spatial memory, and kainate-induced pathological features at cellular and synaptic levels.

ResultsLong-term hippocampal LFS consistently diminished focal seizures in epileptic male and female mice, with seizure reduction extending beyond the stimulation period. Additionally, LFS relieved spatial memory deficits and reversed pathological long-term potentiation-like changes at perforant path-dentate granule cell synapses. LFS had no significant effect on generalized convulsive seizures, anxiety-like behaviour, neurogenesis, hippocampal sclerosis, excitatory synapse marker expression, or presynaptic vesicles in perforant path fibers.

ConclusionThese findings provide clinically relevant insights into the seizure type-specific effects of hippocampal LFS, which, alongside synaptic and behavioural improvements, could contribute to enhanced seizure control and quality of life in MTLE patients.

">Predictive Coding algorithms induce brain-like responses in Artificial Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                This study explores whether predictive coding (PC) inspired Deep Neural Networks can serve as biologically plausible neural network models of the brain. We compared two PC-inspired training objectives, a predictive and a contrastive approach, to a supervised baseline in a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. We evaluated the models on key signatures of PC, including mismatch responses, formation of priors, and learning of semantic information. Our results show that the PC-inspired models, especially a locally trained predictive model, exhibited these PC-like behaviors better than a Supervised or an Untrained RNN. Further, we found that activity regularization evokes mismatch response-like effects across all models, suggesting it may serve as a proxy for the energy-saving principles of PC. Finally, we find that Gain Control (an important mechanism in the PC framework) can be implemented using weight regularization. Overall, our findings indicate that PC-inspired models are able to capture important computational principles of predictive processing in the brain, and can serve as a promising foundation for building biologically plausible artificial neural networks. This work contributes to our understanding of the relationship between artificial and biological neural networks, and highlights the potential of PC-inspired algorithms for advancing brain modelling as well as brain-inspired machine learning.

	<p>Background/Objectives: We examined the effects of cardiovascular exercise on verbal fluency using a between-groups design. Methods: Within our experimental (i.e., exercise) group, participants performed phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks (VFTs) before, during, and after a vigorous 30 min bout of cycling. Participants within our control group also completed these VFTs before, during, and after a non-physical activity. We compared the VFT performance of the experimental (exercise) and control (no-exercise) groups of participants in terms of the characteristics of the words that they produced within the VFTs. In addition, we examined these aspects of VFT performance for each participant group across time within the experiment session. Conclusions: From these comparisons, we see that exercise influenced VFT performance. Most notably, participants engaged in exercise changed their VFT performance over time, while control group participants did not. Exercising participants produced more words over the course of their exercise session that contained fewer letters over time and were lower in frequency during and after exercise as compared to before exercise. Additionally, topic switches in the VFTs increased after exercise as compared to before exercise. Participants in the control group did not change their VFT performance over time according to any of these measures. These findings indicate that exercise impacted participants&amp;amp;rsquo; lexical access and that these VFT performance changes were not due to practice effects.</p>

	<p>Background: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) represents a widely prevalent and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition in pediatric populations, often exhibiting a substantial propensity to persist into adulthood. ADHD is a multifaceted disorder that resists straightforward diagnostic tests. Clinicians must invest substantial time and effort to secure an accurate diagnosis and implement effective treatment. ADHD diagnosis is primarily based on psychiatric tests, as there is currently no clinically utilized objective diagnostic tool. Nonetheless, several studies in have documented endeavors to create objective instruments designed to assist in the diagnostic process of ADHD, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce subjectivity. Method: This research endeavor sought to establish an objective diagnostic modality for ADHD through the utilization of electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis. With the use of innovative deep learning techniques, this research seeks to improve the diagnosis of ADHD using EEG data. To capture complex patterns in EEG data, this study proposes a double-augmented attention mechanism ResNet-based model. Using an autoencoder for feature extraction, the Reptile Search Algorithm for feature selection, and a modified ResNet architecture for model training comprise the technique. Results: AUC, F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall, and other standard classifiers like Random Forest and AdaBoost were utilized to compare the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance. By a wide margin, the proposed ResNet model outperforms the traditional models with a 99.42% accuracy, 99.03% precision, 99.82% recall, and 99.42% F1-score. Conclusions: ROC AUC score of 0.99 for the model underscores its remarkable capability to differentiate between children with and without ADHD, thereby minimizing misclassification errors and improving diagnostic precision.</p>

	<p>This case study examined the process of integration of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and sensorimotor psychotherapy (SP) in three-phase trauma treatment with a 32-year-old female Bengali refugee with Complex Post Traumatic Disorder (C-PTSD). The treatment was provided in a Western country. The client&amp;amp;rsquo;s improvement was assessed by using self-report assessments of post-traumatic, dissociative, and depressive symptoms. Psychodiagnostics&amp;amp;rsquo; scores gathered after 2 years of treatment showed significant improvements in post-traumatic, dissociative, and depressive symptoms. Although firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to the limitations of this study, results suggest that integrating CBT and SP in a phase-trauma approach may be an effective treatment for C-PTSD in a transcultural setting. However, replicating and standardizing such preliminary results on larger samples is necessary. Background/Objectives: SP is an innovative psychotherapeutic intervention aimed at treating trauma through a bottom-up approach, however, little research exists regarding the efficacy of this psychotherapy. This case study aims to investigate the efficacy of the combination of CBT and SP in treating a C-PTSD patient in a transcultural setting. Methods: Three questionnaires were administered to investigate post-traumatic, depressive, and dissociative symptoms. Results: Clinical and psychodiagnostic outcomes highlight significant psychological improvements in the patient. Conclusions: Although any firm conclusion cannot be drawn because of various intrinsic limitations (i.e., single case study) that straiten our ability to extend these results, this case study suggests that the integration of CBT and SP may be an effective treatment for C-PTSD in a transcultural setting.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: In a tonal language like Chinese, phonologically contrasting tones signify word meanings at the syllable level. Although the development of lexical tone perception ability has been examined in many behavioral studies, its developmental trajectory from childhood to adulthood at the neural level remains unclear. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the issue by measuring the mismatch negativity (MMN) response to a Chinese lexical tonal contrast in three groups. Methods: The MMN response to a flat-falling tonal contrast (Tone1 versus Tone4) were recorded from children (25 participants aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;8), adolescents (26 participants aged 12&amp;amp;ndash;14), and young adults (20 participants aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;24). Nonsense speech stimuli were also used by superimposing Tone1 and Tone4 on an English syllable. Results: All three groups demonstrated typical early MMN responses in both the meaningful and nonsense syllable conditions. However, the MMN amplitudes varied significantly across groups, with the child group showing smaller responses compared to the adolescent and adult groups, while the latter two groups had similar MMN amplitudes. Conclusions: Neural sensitivity to tonal contrasts is not fully mature in children and reaches a more adult-like level during adolescence, with no significant difference in sensitivity to meaningful versus nonsense syllables. These results provide new insights into the neural development of lexical tone perception in a tonal language, highlighting its maturation during adolescence in this process.</p>

	<p>Background: Many studies, for example, on taste-visual dissonance, have shown that the influence of the visual cortex on taste sensation is enormous. The presented work aims to investigate, using fNIRS, whether a taste stimulus, in this case, the taste of bitter, also causes stimulation of the visual cortex in the fNIRS study. Methods: fNIRS was used to examine 51 participants (204 examinations, 9996 records), collecting signals from the left hemisphere. Differences between the maximum and minimum changes in oxyHb concentrations (&amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb) for the areas of the brain cortex considered responsible for recording visual and gustatory signals were analyzed. Protocols I, II, III, and IV&amp;amp;mdash;activation with distillate water, coffee with lower concentration, reference (no stimulation), and coffee with higher concentration, respectively, were used. Results: We recorded high signals for teste activation on channels covering the gustatory cortex, which confirms the correctness of the choice of research method. As expected, a significant statistical difference was observed between protocols I, II, and IV and reference III (without stimulation). What seems important is the fact that we also received high signals for the channels 45&amp;amp;ndash;49, which cover the visual cortex. The statistical analysis shows no differences between protocols I, II, and IV (different taste activation&amp;amp;mdash;water, coffee A, and coffee B) for specific channels for analyzing regions of interest. As a result of the analysis of the correlation between the subjective bitterness assessment solutions and the signal &amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb height, it was observed that a statistically significant correlation, although weak, occurs only for 14 and gustatory channels, only for coffee with a higher concentration. Additionally, the only statistically significant difference between women and men was observed in Protocol I (water), where the &amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb signal was twice as high in women compared to men. Conclusions: In conclusion, we can clearly state that the senses of sight and taste work closely together. Moreover, this cooperation is not one-sided: while visual activation influences taste perception, interestingly, a taste stimulus can also generate a hemodynamic response, activating the visual cortex.</p>

	<p>Background: Perfectionism in adolescents can have both adaptive and maladaptive forms, with implications for mental health and school performance. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among perfectionism, mental health factors, and emotional regulation in adolescents and to evaluate the efficacy of psychoeducational interventions. Methods: Two studies were conducted: (1) A cross-sectional study (n = 261) examined the correlations among perfectionism, mental health factors, and emotional regulation. (2) An experimental study (n = 115) evaluated the effects of psychoeducation on perfectionism and healthy habits compared with a control group. The measures included questionnaires on perfectionism, depression, anxiety, stress, and emotional regulation. Results: Study 1 found that maladaptive perfectionism was positively correlated with depression (r = 0.52, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), anxiety (r = 0.48, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), stress (r = 0.45, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and difficulties in emotional regulation (r = 0.39, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Adaptive perfectionism was negatively correlated with deficits in emotional understanding (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.31, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Study 2 showed that psychoeducational interventions reduced maladaptive perfectionism (mean difference = &amp;amp;minus;5.7, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.62) and depression levels (mean difference = &amp;amp;minus;3.2, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.38) but increased stress in the experimental groups. No significant changes were observed in adaptive perfectionism or the anxiety level. Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex relationships among perfectionism, mental health, and emotional regulation in adolescents. Targeted interventions can reduce maladaptive perfectionism and its associated negative effects. Further research is needed on the long-term outcomes and refinement of interventional strategies.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the microstructural dynamics of the subventricular zone (SVZ) with aging and their associations with clinical disability and brain structural damage in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One-hundred and forty-one pediatric-onset MS patients (67 pediatric and 74 adults with pediatric-onset) and 233 healthy controls (HC) underwent neurological and 3.0 T MRI assessment. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted from the SVZ and the thalamus (as control region).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, SVZ FA was higher until age 40 then declined, whereas MD was lower until age 35 before rising (false discovery rate <i>p</i> value [pFDR] ≤ 0.008). Thalamic FA was higher until age 30 and then declined, whereas MD was higher until age 50 (pFDR ≤ 0.007). Pediatric MS patients showed significantly higher SVZ FA than pediatric HC (pFDR &lt; 0.001), while adult patients showed no differences compared to adult HC (pFDR ≤ 0.724). Adult patients had lower thalamic FA and higher MD (pFDR &lt; 0.001). Adults had lower SVZ FA and MD, but higher thalamic MD compared to pediatric patients (pFDR &lt; 0.001). In pediatric MS, higher SVZ FA and MD were associated with higher white matter (WM) lesion volume (LV) and choroid plexus volume and lower brain and thalamic volumes (pFDR ≤ 0.047). In adult patients, higher SVZ MD associated with higher WM LV, lower brain volumes, and lower z-SDMT (pFDR≤0.019). Thalamic microstructural abnormalities were associated with more severe disability and brain damage in both groups (pFDR ≤ 0.018).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that microstructural changes in the SVZ occur early in pediatric MS and are associated with brain structural damage but not with clinical impairment. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study assesses whether longitudinal quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration after large middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and determines how early changes are detectable.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective, single-center observational cohort study included patients with large MCA stroke admitted to Boston Medical Center's intensive care unit (2019–2024). Associations between time-to-neurologic deterioration and quantitative pupillometry, including Neurological Pupil Index (NPi), were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates adjusted for age, sex, and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. Models using dilation velocity were compared with partial likelihood ratio tests. Pupillometric changes over 2-h intervals in the 12 h preceding deterioration were analyzed with linear mixed-effects modeling and Tukey's test. Matched referents (age, sex, stroke side, follow-up duration) were used for comparison. Optimal thresholds were identified using the Youden Index.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 71 patients (mean age 66.5 years; 59.2% women), 32 (45.1%) experienced deterioration. A 1-unit decrease in NPi was associated with a higher hazard of deterioration (hazard ratio 2.46; 95% confidence interval 1.68–3.61). Dilation velocity improved model performance compared to NPi alone. NPi was significantly lower at 0–2 h (3.81 vs. 4.38, p = 0.001) and 2–4 h (3.71 vs. 4.38, p &lt; 0.001) before deterioration compared to 10–12 h prior. Optimal thresholds were 4.01 for NPi, 0.49 mm/s for dilation velocity, and −0.15 change in NPi over 12 h.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration in MCA stroke, with declines detectable up to 12 h prior. Dilation velocity shows promise as a novel biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>The long-term clinical outcomes and associated prognostic factors in contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2)-antibody diseases are unknown. A total of 75 participants with CASPR2 antibodies were longitudinally assessed for disability, quality-of-life, and chronic pain. Although most symptoms improved within 6 months of treatment, neuropathic pain and fatigue were the most immunotherapy refractory, and persisted for up to 6 years. Furthermore, these two factors—but not CASPR2 antibody levels or subclasses—independently predicted worse disability and quality-of-life at 24 months. Quality-of-life varied widely for any given modified Rankin Scale score, indicating a divergence between patient and clinician assessed outcomes. Further work should study the relative importance of these measures, and the immunopathogenesis underlying intractable symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>Neuropeptides belonging to the cholecystokinin/sulfakinin (CCK/SK) family mediate satiety signals across phylogeny. In this study, a potential anatomical substrate for such satiety signals was described in the snail <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i>. We propose that CCK/SK signals directly modulate gustatory sensory neurons that project from the lips to the brain.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Snails belonging to the genus <i>Biomphalaria</i> serve as obligatory intermediate hosts for the trematode <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>, the causative agent for the most widespread form of schistosomiasis. The simpler nervous systems of gastropod molluscs, such as <i>Biomphalaria</i>, provide advantageous models for investigating neural responses to infection at the cellular and network levels. The present study examined neuropeptides related to cholecystokinin (CCK), a major multifunctional regulator of central nervous system (CNS) function in mammals. A neural transcriptome generated from the CNS of <i>Biomphalaria alexandrina</i> included a transcript encoding two CCK-related peptides, designated <i>Balex</i>-CCK1 (pEGEWSYDY<sub>(SO</sub>
<sub>3</sub>
<sub>H)</sub>GLGGGRF-NH<sub>2</sub>) and <i>Balex</i>-CCK2 (NYGDY<sub>(SO</sub>
<sub>3</sub>
<sub>H)</sub>GIGGGRF-NH<sub>2</sub>). Peptide expression was examined in <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i> at the mRNA level using the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) protocol and at the protein level using an antibody against <i>Balex</i>-CCK1. Expression was detected in 60–70 neurons distributed throughout the CNS, as well as in profuse fiber systems connecting the ganglia and projecting to the periphery. CCK-like immunoreactive (CCK<sub>li</sub>) fibers were also observed on organs associated with the cardiorespiratory (nephridium, mantle, gill) and male reproductive systems. A comparison of mRNA and peptide localization suggested that CCK expression could be regulated at the level of translation. A potential role of these peptides in mediating responses to infection by larval schistosomes is discussed.</p>

                Xu et al. investigated the single-cell characteristics of pancreatic cancer liver metastasis and found that the pro-metastatic neutrophil cluster is enriched at the metastatic border. NFE2-driven neutrophil phenotypic polarization represents a critical pro-metastatic mechanism. TGF-β/SMAD3 activates NFE2, further promoting NET release at the invasive front by transcriptional regulation of PADI4.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sexual minority older adults (SMOAs) report greater subjective cognitive decline (SCD) than heterosexual older adults (HOAs). This study aimed to compare the impact of multiple psycho-social risk factors on objective and subjective cognitive decline in HOAs and SMOAs. Methods: Two samples of self-identified HOAs and SMOAs were selected from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Reliable change indices for episodic and semantic memory were created to assess cognitive decline. SCD was self-reported for memory and general cognition. Depressive symptoms, loneliness, marital status and socio-economic status were investigated as risk factors. Results: No between-group differences were found in cognitive decline. Higher depression was associated with greater SCD risk and worse semantic memory decline. The latter effect was stronger in SMOAs. The findings were largely replicated in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Poor mental health may represent the strongest driver of cognitive decline in SMOAs and to a greater extent than in HOAs.</p>

	<p>Background: Tramadol (TRA) is an opioid that is used to manage moderate to severe pain. Long-term use of TRA can lead to the development of opioid use disorder. Objectives: This study investigates the role of forced exercise in reducing TRA-seeking behavior. Methods: Adult male rats (240&amp;amp;ndash;260 g) were divided into five groups; the control group received vehicle injections, the TRA group received TRA (75 mg/kg, i.p) every other day for 8 days, and three TRA&amp;amp;ndash;exercise groups were forced to run on a treadmill (60 min/day, 5 days/week) for 2, 4, or 6 weeks prior to conditioning with TRA. A tramadol-conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure assessed TRA reinforcement, after which all rats were euthanized, tissue extracted, and mRNA expression for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and interleukin 1 beta (Il-1&amp;amp;beta;) determined in hippocampus (Hipp), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Results: TRA-seeking behavior was seen in the TRA group and the 6 weeks forced exercise group. By contrast, forced exercise for 2 or 4 weeks attenuated TRA-seeking behavior. This attenuation was associated with a significant increase in Bdnf mRNA expression in the Hipp and NAc, but not the PFC. Additionally, the TRA-induced elevations in Il-1&amp;amp;beta; mRNA expression were reversed by all durations of exercise in Hipp. However, only 2 and 4 weeks, but not 6 weeks, of exercise reduced elevations in PFC and NAc Il-1&amp;amp;beta; expression. Conclusion: Forced exercise for 2 and 4 weeks attenuates TRA-seeking behavior partially through the regulation of Bdnf and Il-1&amp;amp;beta; mRNA expression.</p>

                <p>The subjective visual vertical (VV), the visually estimated direction of gravity, is essential for assessing vestibular function and visuospatial cognition. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying altered VV perception in stroke participants with unilateral spatial neglect (USN), specifically by examining their eye movement patterns during VV judgment tasks. Participants with USN demonstrated limited eye movement scanning along a rotating bar, often fixating on prominent ends, such as the top or bottom. This suggests a reflexive response to visually salient areas, potentially interfering with accurate VV perception. In contrast, participants without USN showed broader scanning around the center of the bar. Notably, participants with USN without frontal lobe lesions occasionally exhibited extended scanning that included the bar&rsquo;s center, which was associated with accurate VV judgments. These findings suggest that (1) a tendency to fixate on peripheral, prominent areas and (2) frontal lobe involvement in disengaging and redirecting spatial attention may influence VV perception in USN. Based on these results, targeted rehabilitation strategies that encourage individuals with USN to extend their visual scanning beyond prominent endpoints and include central areas could improve VV accuracy. This study highlights the specific eye movement behaviors contributing to VV misperception, emphasizing the importance of training that broadens scanning to improve VV perception effectively.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0287-24.2024?rss=1">Exploring Relevant Features for EEG-Based Investigation of Sound Perception in Naturalistic Soundscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>A comprehensive analysis of everyday sound perception can be achieved using electroencephalography (EEG) with the concurrent acquisition of information about the environment. While extensive research has been dedicated to speech perception, the complexities of auditory perception within everyday environments, specifically the types of information and the key features to extract, remain less explored. Our study aims to systematically investigate the relevance of different feature categories: discrete sound-identity markers, general cognitive state information, and acoustic representations, including discrete sound onset, the envelope, and mel-spectrogram. Using continuous data analysis, we contrast different features in terms of their predictive power for unseen data and thus their distinct contributions to explaining neural data. For this, we analyze data from a complex audio-visual motor task using a naturalistic soundscape. The results demonstrated that the feature sets that explain the most neural variability were a combination of highly detailed acoustic features with a comprehensive description of specific sound onsets. Furthermore, it showed that established features can be applied to complex soundscapes. Crucially, the outcome hinged on excluding periods devoid of sound onsets in the analysis in the case of the discrete features. Our study highlights the importance to comprehensively describe the soundscape, using acoustic and non-acoustic aspects, to fully understand the dynamics of sound perception in complex situations. This approach can serve as a foundation for future studies aiming to investigate sound perception in natural settings.</p>

                <p>Alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure are commonly found in migraine patients. Here, we employ a longitudinal study of episodic migraine without aura using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate whether such WM microstructure alterations vary through the different phases of the pain cycle. Fourteen patients with episodic migraine without aura related with menstruation were scanned through four phases of their (spontaneous) migraine cycle (interictal, preictal, ictal, and postictal). Fifteen healthy controls were studied in the corresponding phases of the menstrual cycle. Multishell dMRI data were acquired and preprocessed to obtain maps of diffusion parameters reflecting WM microstructure. After a whole-brain analysis comparing patients with controls, a region-of-interest analysis was performed to determine whether the patients&rsquo; microstructural changes varied across the migraine cycle in specific WM tracts. Compared with controls, patients showed reduced axial diffusivity (AD) in several WM tracts across the whole brain in the interictal phase and increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in commissural fibers in the ictal phase. Interestingly, AD returned to baseline levels during peri-ictal phases in specific projection and association fibers. In contrast, FA values decreased in the ictal phase away from normal values in a few commissural and projection tracts. Widespread WM fiber tracts suffer structural variations across the migraine cycle, suggesting microstructural changes potentially associated with limbic and salience functional networks and highlighting the importance of the cycle phase in imaging studies of migraine.</p>

                <p>Psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are highly comorbid in people with epilepsy. However, the mechanisms mediating the shared pathophysiology are currently unknown. There is considerable evidence implicating the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the network communication of anxiety and fear, a process demonstrated to involve parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. The loss of PV interneurons has been well described in the hippocampus of chronically epileptic mice and in postmortem human tissue of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We hypothesize that a loss of PV interneurons in the BLA may contribute to comorbid mood disorders in epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we employed a ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model of TLE in mice, which exhibits profound behavioral deficits associated with chronic epilepsy. We demonstrate a loss of PV interneurons and dysfunction of the remaining PV interneurons in the BLA of chronically epileptic mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate altered principal neuron function and impaired coordination of BLA network and behavioral states in chronically epileptic mice. To determine whether the loss of PV interneurons contributes to these altered network and behavioral states, we partially ablated PV interneurons in the BLA by stereotaxically injecting AAV-Flex-DTA into the BLA of PV-Cre mice. Loss of PV interneurons in the BLA is sufficient to alter behavioral states, such as increasing avoidance behaviors and impairing fear learning. These data suggest that compromised inhibition in the BLA in chronically epileptic mice may contribute to behavioral deficits, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to comorbid anxiety and epilepsy.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy&ndash;aphasia syndrome (EAS) is a spectrum of childhood disorders that exhibit complex comorbidities that include epilepsy and the emergence of cognitive and language disorders. CNKSR2 is an X-linked gene in which mutations are linked to EAS. We previously demonstrated Cnksr2 knock-out (KO) mice model key phenotypes of EAS analogous to those present in clinical patients with mutations in the gene. Cnksr2 KO mice have increased seizures, impaired learning and memory, increased levels of anxiety, and loss of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). The intricate interplay between these diverse phenotypes at the brain regional and cell-type level remains unknown. Here, we leverage conditional deletion of the X-linked Cnksr2 in a neuronal cell-type manner in male mice to demonstrate that anxiety and impaired USVs track with its loss from excitatory neurons. Finally, we further narrow the essential role of Cnksr2 loss in USV deficits to excitatory neurons of the ACC, a region in mice recently implicated in USV production associated with specific emotional states or social contexts, such as mating calls, distress calls, or social bonding signals. Together, our results reveal Cnksr2-based mechanisms that underlie USV impairments that suggest communication impairments can be dissociated from seizures or anxiety. Furthermore, we highlight the cortical circuitry important for initiating USVs.</p>

                Aim To determine the influencing factors of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) perceived by North-African children/adolescents with type-1 diabetes-mellitus (T1DM) and their parents. Methods It was a cross sectional study conducted in Tunisia. A total of 116 patients ( ie ; 43 children and 73 adolescents) and their parents were included. The Arabic validated version of the Pediatric Generic Core Quality-of-Life Inventory 4.0-Scale (PedsQL4.0) was used to evaluate the HRQoL of children/adolescents as perceived by patients and parents. The dependent data were the patients’ self-report and the parents’ proxy-report of the PedsQL4.0 total scores, and the independent data were the patients and parents characteristics. Results Patients’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The combination of these factors explained 34.84% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Parents’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by lipodystrophy, siblings; body mass index (BMI), hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C. The combination of these factors explained 56.92% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Conclusion T1DM patients self-reported HRQoL was influenced by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and HbA1C. The parents’ proxy-report HRQoL was influenced by lipodystrophy, siblings, BMI, hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C.

                Introduction Recent reports indicate the emergence of community-acquired pneumonia associated with K64- Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Here, we identify the capsular types and sequence type of invasive and commensal K. pneumoniae isolates from Vietnam. Methods We included 93 K. pneumoniae isolates from patients hospitalized at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi between 2007 and 2011; and 110 commensal isolates from throat swabs from healthy volunteers living in rural and urban Hanoi in 2012. We determined sequence types (STs) by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and capsule typing for seven K types by PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion. Results The most common detected capsule types were K1 (39/203, 19.2%, mainly ST23) and K2 (31/203, 15.3%, multiple STs: ST65, ST86, ST380). We found significantly more K2 isolates among invasive in comparison to commensal isolates (22.6% vs 9%, p = 0.01) but no significant difference was observed between invasive and commensal K1 isolates (14.5% vs 24.7%, p = 0.075). K64 with varying sequence types were predominantly seen among invasive K. pneumoniae (8 vs. 3) and were isolated from sepsis and meningitis patients. Among K64 isolates, one was carbapenem-resistant with ST799. Conclusion Our study confirms that capsule type K64 K. pneumoniae is associated with community-acquired invasive infections in Vietnam. Research is needed to unravel the mechanisms of virulence of capsule type K64 in both community and hospital settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-73/v2?src=rss">Factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services among people with disabilities in Chile: A population-based study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Rehabilitation services are necessary for many people with disabilities to improve their functioning and be included in society. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services among people with disabilities in Chile in 2015. Methods This cross-sectional analysis of secondary data from Chile’s 2015 Second National Disability Study (ENDISC II) included people with disabilities aged ≥18 years. The dependent variable was the use of rehabilitation services in the previous year, and the exposure variables were sociodemographic and confounders. Poisson regression was used to determine associated factors, and prevalence ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. All results were weighted according to the ENDISC II complex sampling. Results A total of 2610 people with disabilities were included, and 19.1% used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. Educational level (PR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25–0.75), having a mental illness (PR 1.77; 95% CI 1.44–2.18), and caregiver assistance (PR 1.57; 95% CI 1.25–1.97) were factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services. Conclusions In 2015, one-fifth of people with disabilities in Chile used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. People with disabilities with lower educational levels were less likely to access these services. By contrast, people with mental illness and caregiver assistance were more likely to use rehabilitation services.

                Background Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit a variety of environments including plant surfaces, water, soil, and animal hosts. However, limited research has been conducted on soil and plant associated yeasts in Africa, with most studies originating from developed regions. Methods This study explored the diversity, distribution, and phenotypic characterization of cultivable wild yeast in samples from rhizosphere soil, leaves, litter, and tree bark collected from South West Ethiopia. Yeast isolates were characterized using morphological, physiological and biochemical methods, Stress-tolerant yeast species were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). Results Based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses, a total of 15 yeast genera were identified from 23 plant species. Predominant yeast species included Candida spp., Saccharomyces spp., Meyerozyma spp., Pichia spp., Geotrichum spp., and Hanseniaspora spp. Plant species with the highest yeast diversity were Ficus vasta, Ficus exasperata, Ficus sycomorus, Cordia africana, and Ritchiea albersii. Bark samples yielded more yeast isolates than rhizosphere soil, litter, and leaves. Stress-tolerant species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida pelliculosa, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Pichia kluyveri, and Trichosporon asahii were identified using MALDI-TOF. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between yeast populations in bark and leaf samples or between rhizosphere soil and leaves, though a weak positive correlation was found between rhizosphere soil and bark or litter. Seasonal analysis showed a strong positive correlation between yeast abundance in spring and summer, but no association between autumn and spring. Conclusion Ethiopian forests are home for various yeast species including the stress-tolerant wild yeasts. This study highlights the significant yeast diversity in Ethiopian forests, with potential applications in improving industrial fermentation processes that operate under stressful conditions.

                Background This study investigates chloride concentrations in tap water samples from Gimba city administration, using the argentometric method to assess water quality. Chloride levels are a key indicator of water treatment effectiveness, particularly the adequacy of chlorination, which is critical for preventing waterborne diseases. Methods Chloride concentrations in tap water samples from various locations in Gimba city administration, were determined using the argentometric titration method. Silver nitrate (AgNO₃) was employed as the titrant to precisely quantify chloride ions. The water samples were collected from different sites in Gimba, and chloride levels were measured to evaluate the adequacy of water treatment processes. Results The chloride concentrations across all samples ranged from 52.8 mg/L to 71.9 mg/L, well below the World Health Organization’s recommended limit for drinking water. Significant variation in chloride levels was observed, with Dembesh exhibiting the highest concentration and Medera the lowest. Conclusion The low chloride concentrations suggest insufficient chlorination at the sampling sites, which may compromise the effectiveness of water disinfection and contribute to the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the region. The study underscores the need for enhanced water treatment and disinfection practices in Gimba city to ensure safe drinking water and reduce health risks.

                Backgrounds Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health issue in Indonesia, ranking second globally in TB incidence in 2021. Diagnosing intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) is challenging due to its symptoms, which mimic other diseases, limited laboratory tests, and the need for invasive procedures like colonoscopy. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive laboratory panel for ITB using various biomarkers. Methods A cross-sectional study from November 2020 to December 2022 was carried out at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital. Laboratory parameters from 143 subjects were identified by Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis. The scoring system was developed based on the identified independent diagnostic parameters scored by regression coefficient β value and standard errors, with the cut-off value determined by the ROC curve. The sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system were determined using the ROC curve. Results Among 143 subjects, 22 were diagnosed with ITB and 121 Non-ITB (prevalence of 15.38%). This study was dominated by females (65.03%), with a ratio of 1.86: 1. The median age in this study was 41 years. The scoring system to differentiate ITB and Non-ITB consisted of 6 diagnostic parameters (referred to as the HEALTH scoring system) as follows: stool HBD-2 (1 and 0 points), ESR (1 and 0 points), blood ADA activity (1 and 0 points), Lymphocyte (0 and 1 point), stool TB PCR (2 and 0 points), and NLR (1 and 0 points). Subjects with scores ≥ 4 could be diagnosed as ITB. The sensitivity and specificity of the HEALTH scoring system were 68.18% and 95.04%, respectively. Conclusion This study developed and validated a laboratory panel called the HEALTH scoring system based on clinical biomarkers of stool HBD-2 level, ESR, blood ADA activity, lymphocytes, stool TB PCR, and NLR, which could be used to differentiate ITB from other gastrointestinal diseases.

                Background This study analyzed the nexus between rural household welfare and agricultural technology adoption in Ethiopia using secondary data from the Ethiopian Socioeconomic Survey (ESS). The agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in Ethiopia’s economy, contributing significantly to income, consumption, and employment. This research aims to analyze how adopting agricultural technologies such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation affects poverty and food insecurity among rural households. The research examined poverty and food insecurity levels in Ethiopia and investigates the impact of adopting agricultural technologies on rural household welfare. Methods We used both Descriptive and econometric methods, in which descriptive analysis has been used to assess poverty and food insecurity levels, and a seemingly unrelated bivariate and multivariate probit model applied to analyze the effect of agricultural technology adoption. Result From descriptive summary, it is noted that out of a total sample of the study, 47.61% (2322 out of 4877) are adopting agricultural technologies in many forms more than 70% of female-headed households are food secured and non-poor and 68% of male-headed households are food secured and nun poor. The findings from regression model indicate that access to irrigation, improved seeds, and fertilizers significantly reduces the likelihood of poverty and food insecurity among rural households. Conclusion Based on these results, policy recommendations include promoting agricultural technologies, enhancing access to credit, investing in agricultural extension services, diversifying livelihoods, improving education, and implementing targeted poverty alleviation programs. Further research is encouraged to explore the reasons behind insignificant variables and to identify additional factors affecting rural household welfare in Ethiopia.

                Background This study was designed to investigate the mediation effects of social empowerment (SE) in the relationship between perceived social support (PSS) and life satisfaction (LS) in women self-help group members. Also, this research attempted to understand the moderating effect of decision making (DM) and external communication (EC) on the relationship between the constructs. Methods To achieve the above objective, the primary data were collected from the self-help group women members by using an existing scale. In this survey, 333 participants who are members of self-help group completed the questionnaire and considered for the study. The study is non-experimental and survey-based, with no interventions or manipulations involved. In line with ethical guidelines, we obtained informed consent directly from each respondent before their participation. Conclusion The path coefficient values, t-statistics and P-Values confirmed the positive relationship between PSS->LS; PSS->SE & SE->LS in women self-group members. PLS structural equation modelling estimated by the bootstrap method revealed that SE partially mediates the relationship between PSS & LS. With regard to the interaction effect, the slope analysis and f2 effect size confirmed the moderating effect of EC in the relationship between PSS -> LS & SE -> LS.

                Background Sustainable modular dwelling design for rural areas should focus on creating healthy and economically accessible spaces, sensitive to local needs and integrating environmental, functional, sociological and technological aspects. Flexibility is essential to reduce the initial investment and allow future transformations, optimizing the recovery and reuse of materials. These houses must be adaptable, safe and have basic services, satisfying the needs and stages of families’ development. In Ecuador, poverty and energy inefficiency worsen the quality of life in rural areas. This project in the Cebadas parish proposes modular dwelling that applies bioclimatic and sustainable criteria, using local materials to improve habitability and promote the social and economic development of the community. Method The research approach is qualitative-quantitative. Qualitative, since it is necessary to identify the qualities of the sector, bibliographic exploration of guidelines and sustainable strategies. Quantitative, to evaluate the degree of affectation through a diagnosis of the study site and to provide efficient solutions that respond to the context and social reality. Results The spaces presented in the proposal respond to the spatial need for growth and expansion of the users of the sector, through 6 basic guidelines that this type of dwelling should have: Environment, Visual, Form, Function, Bioclimatic and Materials. Conclusions The flexible modular dwelling project for rural environments addresses complex housing needs, highlighting the flexibility and adaptability of an expandable module. It includes income generation with a duplex apartment, fosters communal and cultural life with public and commercial spaces, promotes tourism and rural development with landscape design and crops. In addition, it ensures sustainability through bioclimatic strategies and responsible use of resources.

                Background This study used ChatGPT for sentiment analysis to investigate the possible links between online sentiments and COVID-19 vaccination rates. It also examines Internet posts to understand the attitudes and reasons associated with vaccine-related opinions. Methods We collected 500,558 posts over 60 weeks from the Blind platform, mainly used by working individuals, and 854 relevant posts were analyzed. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant content, attitudes toward and reasons for vaccine opinions were studied through sentiment analysis. The study further correlated these categorized attitudes with the actual vaccination data. Results The proportions of posts expressing positive, negative, and neutral attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were 5%, 83%, and 12%, respectively. The total post count showed a positive correlation with the vaccination rate, indicating a high correlation between the number of negative posts about the vaccine and the vaccination rate. Negative attitudes were predominantly associated with societal distrust and perceived oppression. Conclusions This study demonstrates the interplay between public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines as expressed through social media and vaccination behavior. These correlations can serve as useful clues for devising effective vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-100/v1?src=rss">Optimizing machine learning performance for medical imaging analyses in low-resource environments: The prospects of CNN-based Feature Extractors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Machine learning (ML) algorithms have generally enhanced the speed and accuracy of image-based diagnosis, and treatment strategy planning, compared to the traditional approach of interpreting medical images by experienced radiologists. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been particularly useful in this regard. However, training CNNs come with significant time and computational cost necessitating the development of efficient solutions for deploying CNNs in low-resource environments. This study investigates the use of pre-trained CNNs as feature extractors in medical imaging analyses and highlights the key considerations to be taken into account when implementing these extractors. Methods Eight medical imaging datasets covering several diseases (e.g. breast cancer, brain tumor and malaria) were used. Five ML algorithms (k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forests and light gradient boosting machine) were implemented with three pre-trained CNN models (VGG-16, EfficientNet-B0, and ResNet-50). These pre-trained models were deployed as feature extractors fed into the classifiers for image classification tasks. The performance of these classifiers was assessed using a ten-fold cross validation scheme with metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, specificity, sensitivity, AUC-ROC, Matthews’ correlation coefficient (MCC), precision, time and space complexities. Results From our experiments, we found a general improvement in ML models’ performance after feature extraction (FE). Of the three FE models tested,EfficientNet-B0 performed best in terms of predicitve performance i.e. accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, AUC-ROC, MCC, F1 score, and precision. However, VGG-16 had the best performance in terms of time and memory efficiency. Our results identify two conditions necessary for the optimal performance of the FE models; (i) balanced datasets - a set where classes or categories are represented in approximately equal proportions, (ii) big data sets - adequate number of objects for training and testing. Interestingly, the performance of the ML models did not correlate with the number of class labels i.e. the type of classification task whether binary or multi-class had no influence in the models’ performance. Of the five algorithms investigated, logistic regression benefitted the most from the adoption of the feature extractors. Conclusion Our results confirm that the use of CNNs as feature extractors offer an effective balance between high performance and computational efficiency, making them well-suited for use in low-resource environments.

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                <p>by Jiang Mao, Constantin A Rothkopf, Alan A Stocker</p>

Sensory neurons continually adapt their response characteristics according to recent stimulus history. However, it is unclear how such a reactive process can benefit the organism. Here, we test the hypothesis that adaptation actually acts proactively in the sense that it optimally adjusts sensory encoding for future stimuli. We first quantified human subjects’ ability to discriminate visual orientation under different adaptation conditions. Using an information theoretic analysis, we found that adaptation leads to a reallocation of coding resources such that encoding accuracy peaks at the mean orientation of the adaptor while total coding capacity remains constant. We then asked whether this characteristic change in encoding accuracy is predicted by the temporal statistics of natural visual input. Analyzing the retinal input of freely behaving human subjects showed that the distribution of local visual orientations in the retinal input stream indeed peaks at the mean orientation of the preceding input history (i.e., the adaptor). We further tested our hypothesis by analyzing the internal sensory representations of a recurrent neural network trained to predict the next frame of natural scene videos (PredNet). Simulating our human adaptation experiment with PredNet, we found that the network exhibited the same change in encoding accuracy as observed in human subjects. Taken together, our results suggest that adaptation-induced changes in encoding accuracy prepare the visual system for future stimuli.

                <p>by Natalie R. Davidson, Fan Zhang, Casey S. Greene</p>

While single-cell experiments provide deep cellular resolution within a single sample, some single-cell experiments are inherently more challenging than bulk experiments due to dissociation difficulties, cost, or limited tissue availability. This creates a situation where we have deep cellular profiles of one sample or condition, and bulk profiles across multiple samples and conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose BuDDI (BUlk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance). BuDDI utilizes domain adaptation techniques to effectively integrate available corpora of case-control bulk and reference scRNA-seq observations to infer cell-type-specific perturbation effects. BuDDI achieves this by learning independent latent spaces within a single variational autoencoder (VAE) encompassing at least four sources of variability: 1) cell type proportion, 2) perturbation effect, 3) structured experimental variability, and 4) remaining variability. Since each latent space is encouraged to be independent, we simulate perturbation responses by independently composing each latent space to simulate cell-type-specific perturbation responses. We evaluated BuDDI’s performance on simulated and real data with experimental designs of increasing complexity. We first validated that BuDDI could learn domain invariant latent spaces on data with matched samples across each source of variability. Then we validated that BuDDI could accurately predict cell-type-specific perturbation response when no single-cell perturbed profiles were used during training; instead, only bulk samples had both perturbed and non-perturbed observations. Finally, we validated BuDDI on predicting sex-specific differences, an experimental design where it is not possible to have matched samples. In each experiment, BuDDI outperformed all other comparative methods and baselines. As more reference atlases are completed, BuDDI provides a path to combine these resources with bulk-profiled treatment or disease signatures to study perturbations, sex differences, or other factors at single-cell resolution.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the advances in treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS), unremitting neurodegeneration continues to drive disability and disease progression. Smoldering/slowly expanding lesions (SELs) and dysfunction of the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) are pathologic hallmarks of MS cortex and intricately tied to disability and neurodegeneration, respectively. We hypothesized that neuronal hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and is exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization of hnRNP A1) was examined in healthy control and MS brains using immunohistochemistry. MS cases were stratified by severity of hnRNP A1 pathology to examine the link between RBP dysfunction, demyelination, and neurodegeneration.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that smoldering/SELs were only present within a subset of MS tissues characterized by elevated neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup>) in adjacent cortical gray matter. In contrast to healthy controls and MS with low hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>low</i>
</sup>), MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> showed elevated markers of neurodegeneration, including neuronal loss and injury, brain atrophy, axonal loss, and axon degeneration. Additionally, we discovered a subpopulation of morphologically intact neurons lacking expression of NeuN, a neuron-specific RBP, in cortical projection neurons in MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and may be exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS. The discovery of NeuN-negative neurons suggests that some cortical neurons may only be injured and not lost. By characterizing RBP pathology in MS cortex, this study has important implications for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms driving neurodegeneration, the substrate of disability and disease progression.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27105?af=R">A Prospective Multicenter Analysis of Mobile Stroke Unit Cost‐Effectiveness</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Given the high disease and cost burden of ischemic stroke, evaluating the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of new approaches to prevent and treat ischemic stroke is critical. Effective ischemic stroke management depends on timely administration of thrombolytics after stroke onset. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness associated with the use of mobile stroke units (MSUs) to expedite tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, as compared with standard management through emergency medical services (EMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study is a prospective, multicenter, alternating-week, cluster-controlled trial of MSU versus EMS. One-year and life-time cost-effectiveness analyses, using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) method, were performed from the perspective of CMS's Medicare. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated using patient-reported EQ-5D-5L data were used as the effectiveness measure. Health care utilizations were converted to costs using average national Medicare reimbursements. ICERs excluding patients with pre-existing disability, and limited to stroke-related costs were also calculated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The first-year ICER for all tPA-eligible patients using total cost differences between MSU and EMS groups was $238,873/QALY; for patients without pre-existing disability was $61,199/QALY. The lifetime ICERs for all tPA-eligible patients and for those without pre-existing disability were $94,710 and $31,259/QALY, respectively. All ICERs were lower when restricted to stroke-related costs and were highly dependent on the number of patients treated per year in an MSU.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MSUs' cost-effectiveness is borderline if we consider total first-year costs and outcomes in all tPA-eligible patients. MSUs are cost-effective to highly cost-effective when calculations are based on patients without pre-existing disability, patients' lifetime horizon, stroke-related costs, and more patients treated per year in an MSU.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between developmental and premorbid body composition measurements and the risk of motor neuron disease (MND).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a cohort study in the UK Biobank to assess the association of developmental body metrics and premorbid body composition measures (using 28 measurements and 7 patterns of body composition) with the risk of MND. Among participants with longitudinal measures, we compared the changes in body composition over time between individuals who later developed MND and those who remained free of MND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 412,691 individuals included in this study, 549 people received an MND diagnosis during the follow-up visit. Higher birth weight was associated with an increased risk of MND among individuals born over 4 kg (hazard ratio [HR] per kg increase = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.38–3.55), and taller adult height was associated with an increased risk of MND (HR per 5 cm increase = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03–1.17). We observed that measures of elevated fat mass were associated with a lower risk of MND more than 5 years before diagnosis. A higher “leg-dominant fat distribution” pattern was associated with an increased risk whereas higher “muscle strength” was associated with a reduced risk of MND 5 years before diagnosis. Longitudinal analyses indicated a faster decline in measures of fat mass and muscle strength, as well as a shift in fat distribution from arm to leg dominant, among individuals who later developed MND, compared with others.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Body composition at early and middle age may be indicative of the risk of MND development. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:259–269</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Previous studies have observed liver abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. This study aimed to investigate whether early signs of liver disease, measured by magnetic resonance imaging-derived iron-corrected T1-mapping (cT1), are risk factors for developing ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>cT1 and proton density fat fraction were measured and automatically analyzed using LiverMultiScan® software. The Fibrosis-4 index was calculated using an established formula based on age and blood markers. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between liver disease, liver biomarkers, and incident ALS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 533,707 individuals from UK Biobank, 24 ALS cases were identified among 28,328 participants with liver disease during the follow-up period. Among a total of 33,959 individuals with complete liver imaging data, 15 incident ALS cases were observed during a median follow-up period of 5.6 years. Individuals with liver disease had a higher risk of developing ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 7.35 (95% CI 4.47–12.09; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). An increase in cT1 was also associated with a higher risk of ALS. After adjusting for age, sex, Townsend deprivation index, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, body mass index, proton density fat fraction, Fibrosis-4, and metabolic syndrome, an increase in cT1 remained significantly associated with a higher risk of ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.15 (95% CI 1.79–5.55) per 1-SD increase. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these robust results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Liver disease activity, indicated by cT1, increases the risk of developing ALS, independent of metabolic syndrome, liver fat, or fibrosis. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:270–280</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively studied asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers, identifying those developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 56 asymptomatic family members (AFM) with a <i>C9orf72</i> mutation (AFM C9+), 132 non-carriers (AFM C9−), and 359 population-based controls. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we measured cortical thickness, gyrification, and subcortical volumes longitudinally. Linear mixed-effects models on non-converting AFM C9+ scans (n = 107) created a reference for these measurements, establishing individual atrophy patterns. Atrophy patterns from presymptomatic phenoconverters (n = 10 scans) served as a template for group comparisons and similarity assessments. Similarity with phenoconverters was quantified using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for cortical and Kullback–Leibler similarity (KLS) for subcortical measures. Using longitudinal similarity assessments, we predicted when participants would reach the average similarity level of phenoconverters at their first post-onset scan.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five AFM C9+ converted to ALS or ALS-FTD. Up to 6 years before symptoms, these phenoconverters exhibited significant atrophy in frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortex, along with smaller thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala compared to other AFM C9+. Some non-converted AFM C9+ had high DSC and KLS, approaching values of phenoconverters, whereas others, along with AFM C9− and controls, had lower values. At age 80, we predicted 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 13.2–40.1%) of AFM C9+ and no AFM C9− would reach the same DSC as phenoconverters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Distinctive atrophy patterns are visible years before symptom onset on presymptomatic scans of phenoconverters. Combining baseline and follow-up similarity measures may serve as a promising imaging biomarker for identifying those at risk of ALS or ALS-FTD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:281–295</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in <i>ABCD1</i>, a peroxisomal gene. More than half of males with an <i>ABCD1</i> mutation develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cALD), but underlying mechanisms remain unknown and therapies are limited. We sought to develop and characterize a mouse model of cALD to facilitate study of disease mechanisms and therapy development.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used immunoassays and immunohistochemistry to assess novel (interleukin 18 [IL-18]) and established molecular markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain tissue from cALD patients. We generated a cALD phenotype in <i>Abcd1-</i>knockout mice using a 2-hit method that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. We then used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry to assess the fidelity of cALD molecular markers in the mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Human and mouse cALD lesions shared histologic features of myelin phagocytosis, myelin loss, abundant microglial activation, T and B-cell infiltration, and astrogliosis. Compared to wild-type controls, <i>Abcd1</i>-knockout mice displayed more cerebral demyelination, blood–brain barrier disruption, and perivascular immune cell infiltration. This enhanced inflammatory response was associated with higher levels of fibrin deposition, oxidative stress, demyelination, and axonal injury. IL-18 immunoreactivity co-localized with perivascular monocytes/macrophages in both human and mouse brain tissue. In cALD patients, CSF IL-18 levels correlated with MRI lesion severity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest loss of <i>Abcd1</i> function in mice predisposes to more severe blood–brain barrier disruption, cerebral inflammation driven by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, demyelination, and axonal damage, replicating human cALD features. This novel mouse model could shed light on cALD mechanisms and accelerate cALD therapy development. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:296–312</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Whereas highly cost-effective and cost-saving for patients with small infarcts, whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains cost-effective in patients with extensive ischemic injury is uncertain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the United States, Australian, and Spanish societal perspectives, using a 7-state Markov model, with each state defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Initial probabilities at 3 months were derived from the SELECT2 trial. All other model inputs, including transition probabilities, health care and non-health care costs, and utility weights, were sourced from published literature and government websites. Our analysis included extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EVT in patients with large ischemic stroke improved health outcomes and was associated with lower costs from a societal viewpoint. EVT was cost-effective with a mean between-group difference of 1.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and a cost-saving of $23,409 in the United States, $10,691 in Australia, and $30,036 in Spain, in addition to uncosted benefits in productivity for patients and carers. Subgroup analyses were directionally consistent with the overall population, notably with preserved cost-effectiveness in older patients (≥ 70 years) and those with more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 20). Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the base-case results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EVT demonstrated cost-effectiveness in patients with large core across different settings in the United States, Australia, and Spain, including older patients and those with more severe strokes. These results further support adaptation of systems of care to accommodate the expansion of thrombectomy eligibility to patients with large cores and maximize EVT benefits.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate versus placebo in a phase IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2-period cross-over clinical trial in patients with isolated laryngeal dystonia (LD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2021, pausing during the COVID-19 pandemic, at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in 106 patients with alcohol-responsive (EtOH+) and alcohol-non-responsive (EtOH−) LD (53 to receive 1.5g of sodium oxybate first, 53 to receive matching placebo first). The primary outcome was a change from baseline in LD symptom severity 40 minutes after drug intake. Safety was based on vital signs, cognitive function, suicidality, daytime sleepiness, and adverse events. Patients, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to study procedures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to baseline, EtOH+ but not EtOH− patients had a statistically significant improvement in LD symptoms following sodium oxybate versus placebo (EtOH+: 98.75% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6–26.9; <i>p</i> = 0.008; EtOH−: 98.75% CI = −6.2 to 18.7; <i>p</i> = 0.42). Statistically significant minimum drug efficacy in EtOH+ patients was found at ≥16% symptom improvement (OR = 2.09; 98.75% CI = 0.75–5.80; <i>p</i> = 0.036), with an average of 40.81% benefits (98.75% CI = 34.7–48.6). Drug efficacy waned by 300 minutes after intake without a rebound. No changes were found in cognitive function, suicidality, or vital signs. Common adverse events included mild dizziness, nausea, and daytime sleepiness.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sodium oxybate showed clinically meaningful improvement of symptoms in EtOH+ LD patients, with acceptable tolerability. Sodium oxybate offers the first pathophysiologically relevant oral treatment for laryngeal dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:329–343</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27123?af=R">Sex Modifies the Severity and Outcome of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The limited existing evidence on sex differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with spontaneous, non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) comes from small, single-center studies. Here, we performed an individual patient data meta-analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials and 1 multi-ethnic observational study of ICH to investigate the impact of sex on ICH severity and outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Inclusion criteria in our study were a neuroimaging-confirmed ICH. We evaluated whether sex was associated with ICH severity (hematoma volume and expansion) and poor functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale &gt;3) 3 or 6 months after the ICH.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 4,812 ICH patients were evaluated (mean age 62, 40% female). Males with ICH were younger, more likely to be smokers and have diabetes, and less likely to be on anticoagulants (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In multivariable analyses, male sex was associated with non-lobar location (odds ratio [OR]: 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.39–1.92]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), larger hemorrhages (beta: 0.16 [0.08–0.23]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and a higher risk of hematoma expansion (OR: 1.43 [1.20–1.71]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Despite the larger hemorrhage volume and higher risk of expansion, male sex was associated with a 24% lower risk of poor outcomes (OR: 0.76 [0.64–0.90]; <i>p</i> = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to females, males with ICH have larger bleeds and higher risk of hematoma expansion. Despite the larger bleeds and higher risk of hematoma expansion, males with ICH have lower risk of poor outcomes. Our results suggest that the biology and clinical trajectory are different in females and males with ICH, supporting sex-specific research in this condition.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Excitotoxicity is a common hallmark of epilepsy and other neurological diseases associated with elevated extracellular glutamate levels. Thus, here, we studied the protective effects of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b>, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of glutamate uptake in epilepsy models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> was evaluated in a range of acute and chronic seizure models, while its adverse effect profile was assessed in a panel of standard tests in rodents. The effect of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on glutamate uptake was assessed in COS-7 cells expressing the transporter. WAY 213613, a selective competitive EAAT2 inhibitor, was used to probe the reversal of the enhanced glutamate uptake in the same transporter expression system. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting analyses were used to study a potential influence of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on GLT-1 expression in mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> showed robust protection in a panel of animal models of seizures and epilepsy, including the maximal electroshock- and 6 Hz-induced seizures, corneal kindling, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, lamotrigine-resistant amygdala kindling, as well as seizures induced by pilocarpine or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Importantly, <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> displayed a favorable adverse effect profile in the rotarod, the minimal motor impairment, and the Irwin tests. <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> enhanced glutamate uptake in vitro and this effect was abolished by WAY 213613, while no influence on GLT-1 expression in vivo was observed after repeated treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, our results show that <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> has favorable tolerability and provides robust preclinical efficacy against seizures. Thus, allosteric enhancement of EAAT2 function could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of epilepsy and potentially other neurological disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27129?af=R">Distinct Constructs Underlie Patient‐Reported and Performance‐Rated Outcomes after Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which capture patients' perspectives on the consequences of health and disease, are widely used in neurological care and research. However, it is unclear how PROMs relate to performance-rated impairments. Sociodemographic factors are known to affect PROMs. Direct damage to brain regions critical for self-awareness (i.e., parietal regions and the salience/ventral-attention network) may also impair self-report outcomes. This study examined the relationship between PROMs and performance-based measures in stroke survivors with arm motor impairments. We hypothesized that PROMs would be distinct from performance-based outcomes, influenced by sociodemographic factors, and linked to damage in brain circuits involved in self-perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally assessed 54 stroke survivors using patient-reported and performance-rated measures at 4 timepoints. We used factor analysis to reveal the outcome battery's factorial structure. Linear regression examined the association between classes of measures and sociodemographics. Voxel-lesion-symptom-mapping, region-of-interest-based analysis, and voxel-lesion-network-mapping investigated the relationship between classes of outcomes and stroke-related injury.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Performance-based and patient-reported measures formed distinct factors, consistent across recovery phases. Higher education (β1 = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and income adequacy (β2 = 0.48, <i>p</i> = 0.05) were associated with patient-reported, but not performance-rated outcomes. Greater parietal lobe injury, irrespective of hemisphere, was associated with worse patient-reported outcomes; greater corticospinal tract injury related to worse performance-rated outcomes. Lesions with greater functional connectivity to the salience/ventral-attention network were associated with worse patient-reported outcomes (<i>r</i> = −0.35, <i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings reveal important differences between performance-rated and patient-reported outcomes, each with specific associated factors and anatomy post-stroke. Incorporating sociodemographic and neuroanatomic characteristics into neurorehabilitation strategies may inform and optimize patient outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:242–253</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27125?af=R">Association of Seizure Control with Mortality, Cognition, and Function in People With Dementia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The effects of seizure control on outcomes in persons with dementia (PWD) remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of seizure control on mortality, function, cognition, and mood among PWD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This longitudinal, multicenter study is based on 39 Alzheimer's disease centers (ADCs) in the United States from September 2005 to December 2021. PWD were grouped by seizure status into recurrent (seizures in the past year), remote (prior seizures but none in the past year), and no seizures (controls). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality among seizure groups. We used Weibull survival analysis to assess the mortality risks by seizure status after adjusting for age, sex, education, race, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, degree of cognitive impairment, dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation, brain trauma, stroke, Parkinson's disease, alcohol abuse, and depression. Cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating), function (physical dependence and nursing home residence), day-to-day activities (Functional Assessment Scores), and mood (Geriatric Depression Scale) were compared among seizure groups after adjusting for dementia duration and age.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 26,501 participants, 374 (1.4%) had recurrent seizures and 510 (1.9%) had remote seizures. In multivariable survival analysis, recurrent seizures were associated with a higher mortality risk than remote and no seizures (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI]; recurrent aHR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.51 to 2.12; remote aHR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.38). Median time-to-death for recurrent, remote, and no seizures was 2.4, 4.0, and 4.7 years, respectively. People with recurrent seizures had worse cognition, day-to-day function, and physical dependence than those with remote seizures and controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PWD with poorly controlled recurrent seizures have worse mortality, functional, and cognitive outcomes than PWD with remote and no seizures. These findings underscore the need for timely identification and management of ongoing seizures in PWD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:358–368</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27128?af=R">Neurologic Manifestations of Long COVID Disproportionately Affect Young and Middle‐Age Adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate neurologic manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) in post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) and non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP) patients across the adult lifespan.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional study of the first consecutive 200 PNP and 1,100 NNP patients evaluated at a Neuro-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinic between May 2020 and March 2023. Patients were divided into younger (18–44 years), middle-age (45–64 years), and older (65+ years) age groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals accounted for 142 of 200 (71%) of PNP and 995 of 1100 (90.5%) of NNP patients. Significant age-related differences in the frequencies of comorbidities and abnormal neurologic findings demonstrated higher prevalence in older patients. Conversely, 10 months from COVID-19 onset, we found significant age-related differences in Neuro-PASC symptoms indicating lower prevalence, and therefore, symptom burden, in older individuals. Moreover, there were significant age-related differences in subjective impression of fatigue (median [interquartile range (IQR)] patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] score: younger 64 [57–69], middle-age 63 [57–68], older 60.5 [50.8–68.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.04) and sleep disturbance (median [IQR] PROMIS score: younger 57 [51–63], middle-age 56 [53–63], older 54 [46.8–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.002) in the NNP group, commensurate with higher impairment in quality of life (QoL) among younger patients. Finally, there were significant age-related differences in objective executive function (median [IQR] National Institutes of Health [NIH] toolbox score: younger 48 [35–63], middle-age 49 [38–63], older 54.5 [45–66.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.01), and working memory (median [IQR] NIH toolbox score: younger 47 [40–53], middle-age 50 [44–57], older 48 [43–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.0002) in NNP patients, with the worst performance coming from the younger group.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals are disproportionally affected by Neuro-PASC regardless of acute COVID-19 severity. Although older people more frequently have abnormal neurologic findings and comorbidities, younger and middle-age patients suffer from a higher burden of Neuro-PASC symptoms and cognitive dysfunction contributing to decreased QoL. Neuro-PASC principally affects adults in their prime, contributing to profound public health and socioeconomic impacts warranting dedicated resources for prevention, diagnosis and interventions.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires assessed anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among these variables. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. While these findings are promising, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine these relationships over time. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

                Background The study analyzes the impact of public health spending on malnutrition among Peruvians, using data from the National Household Survey, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Ministry of Economy and Finance from 2010. -2020. Previous studies have revealed the existing relationship of health spending with the reduction of malnutrition. Methods A quantitative approach is considered, with an explanatory type of research using panel data methodology considering the bidimensionality of the data, which allows quantifying this effect for the Peruvian case using the National Household Survey, data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, as well as information from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Transparency Portal of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the period 2010-2020. Results The results show that public expenditure on health has a negative relationship with malnutrition; the rural sector has a positive relationship with malnutrition given the limitations present for access to adequate food. Similarly, the unemployment rate shows a positive relationship with malnutrition, given that being unemployed leads to a higher cause of malnutrition in the population, and the gross domestic product has a negative relationship with malnutrition, given that greater economic growth produces an impact on reducing malnutrition, with the greatest impact being on the rural population and the gross domestic product. Conclusions In the analysis period 2010-2020 in Peru, based on the panel data analysis, the impact of public health expenditure on reducing malnutrition is observed in 10 departments, achieving a reduction in malnutrition; while in 14 departments, this indicator has not been reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-99/v1?src=rss">Predicting determinants of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia using machine learning algorithm: Evidence from the Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Survey 2019 dataset [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer rev</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Globally, around 40% of women report unintended pregnancies, with approximately 214 million women in developing countries wanting to avoid pregnancy but not using any contraception. Modern contraceptives (MCs) are effective tools for preventing unintended pregnancies, controlling rapid population growth, and reducing fertility and maternal mortality rates, particularly in developing countries. Low use of contraceptives is responsible for the high fertility and maternal mortality rates in sub-Saharan African nations like Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to identify the determinants of modern contraceptive use among Ethiopian women of reproductive age using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methodology The study utilized secondary data from the 2019 Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Ethiopia survey, analyzing 8,837 samples. Preprocessing steps included data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and splitting the data, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing the algorithms. Six supervised ML algorithms were employed and assessed using confusion matrices, with information gain applied to identify critical attributes for predicting MC use. Results Only 24% of participants used modern contraceptives {95% CI (23.1%, 24.9%). Extreme gradient boosting (XGB) demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy (81.97%, 95% CI {79.06%, 82.7%}) and area under the ROC curve (76.63%), followed by logistic regression (80.52%) and support vector machines (80.41%). Key determinants of MC use included starting family planning at age 20 or older, being single, having partner approval, being the wife of the household head, age between 36–49 years, advice from healthcare providers, concerns about side effects, and having a household size of five or more. Conclusion and Recommendations The use of modern contraceptives among Ethiopian women remains low. Extreme gradient boosting proved most effective in predicting determinants of MC use. Improved counseling during ANC/PNC visits, promoting partner discussions on family planning, and addressing concerns about family size and contraceptive use are recommended strategies to enhance MC uptake.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27182?af=R">Clinical Relevance of ‘Cap’ and ‘Track’ Development after Recent Small Subcortical Infarct</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After a recent small subcortical infarct (RSSI), some patients develop perilesional or remote hyperintensities (‘caps/tracks’) to the index infarct on T2/FLAIR MRI. However, their clinical relevance remains unclear. We investigated the clinicoradiological correlates of ‘caps/tracks’, and their impact on long-term outcomes following RSSI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We identified participants with lacunar stroke and MRI-confirmed RSSI from 3 prospective studies. At baseline, we collected risk factors, RSSI characteristics, small vessel disease (SVD) features, and microstructural integrity on diffusion imaging. Over 1-year, we repeated MRI and recorded ‘caps/tracks’ blinded to other data. We evaluated predictors of ‘caps/tracks’, and their association with 1-year functional (modified Rankin Scale score ≥2), mobility (Timed Up-and-Go), cognitive outcomes (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score &lt;26), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (stroke/transient ischemic attack/incident infarct) using multivariable regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 185 participants, 93 (50.3%) developed ‘caps/tracks’ first detected at median 198 days after stroke. ‘Caps/tracks’ were independently predicted by baseline factors: larger RSSI, RSSI located in white matter, higher SVD score, and higher mean diffusivity in normal-appearing white matter (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}], 1.15 [1.07–1.25], 6.01 [2.80–13.57], 1.77 [1.31–2.44], 1.42 [1.01–2.03]). At 1 year, ‘cap/track’ formation was associated with worse functional outcome (OR: 3.17, 95% CI: 1.28–8.22), slower gait speed (β: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.01–0.25), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.05–4.02), but not with cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>‘Caps/tracks’ after RSSI are associated with worse clinical outcomes, and may reflect vulnerability to progressive SVD-related injury. Reducing ‘caps/tracks’ may offer early efficacy markers in trials aiming to improve outcome after lacunar stroke. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
