                arXiv:2408.16732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the TAUKADIAL challenge, focusing on the classification of speech from people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and neurotypical controls. We conducted three experiments comparing five machine-learning methods: Random Forests, Sparse Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Sparse Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree, utilizing 1076 acoustic features automatically extracted using openSMILE. In Experiment 1, the entire dataset was used to train a language-agnostic model. Experiment 2 introduced a language detection step, leading to separate model training for each language. Experiment 3 further enhanced the language-agnostic model from Experiment 1, with a specific focus on evaluating the robustness of the models using out-of-sample test data. Across all three experiments, results consistently favored models capable of handling high-dimensional data, such as Random Forest and Sparse Logistic Regression, in classifying speech from MCI and controls.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16755">Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation for Enhancing Remote Pilot Training and Operations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the drone industry, particularly in the use of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), requires the development of advanced training protocols for remote pilots. Remote pilots must develop a combination of technical and cognitive skills to manage the complexities of modern drone operations. This paper explores the integration of neurotechnology, specifically auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS), as a method to enhance remote pilot training and performance. The scientific literature shows aVNS can safely improve cognitive functions such as attention, learning, and memory. It has also been shown useful to manage stress responses. For safe and efficient sUAS/UAV operation, it is essential for pilots to maintain high levels of vigilance and decision-making under pressure. By modulating sympathetic stress and cortical arousal, aVNS can prime cognitive faculties before training, help maintain focus during training and improve stress recovery post-training. Furthermore, aVNS has demonstrated the potential to enhance multitasking and cognitive control. This may help remote pilots during complex sUAS operations by potentially reducing the risk of impulsive decision-making or cognitive errors. This paper advocates for the inclusion of aVNS in remote pilot training programs by proposing that it can provide significant benefits in improving cognitive readiness, skill and knowledge acquisition, as well as operational safety and efficiency. Future research should focus on optimizing aVNS protocols for drone pilots while assessing long-term benefits to industrial safety and workforce readiness in real-world scenarios.

                arXiv:2408.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the relay version of the generalized Hutchinson's equation as a phenomenological model of an isolated neuron. After an exponential substitution, the equation takes the form of a differential-difference equation with a piecewise-constant right-hand side. In the work of A. Yu. Kolesov and others, this equation was studied with a negative continuous initial function, and the existence and orbital stability of a periodic solution with a period longer than the delay were proven. In the present work, all possible solutions with continuous on the interval of the delay length initial functions, containing no more than two zeros, are constructed. It is proven that the equation has a periodically unstable solution, the period of which is shorter than the delay.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16347">Desynchronization Index: a New Approach for Exploring Complex Epileptogenic Networks in Stereoelectroencephalography</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.16347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive surgical procedure to record the electrical activities in cortical brain regions, aiming at identifying the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. To improve the accuracy of the EZ definition, SEEG analysis can be supported by computational tools, among which the Epileptogenic Index (EI) represents the most common solution. However, the scientific community has still not found an agreement on which quantitative biomarkers can characterize the cortical sites within the EZ. In this work, we design a new algorithm, named Desynchronization Index (DI), to assist neurophysiologists in SEEG interpretation. Our algorithm estimates the effective connectivity between cortical sites and hypothesizes that the EZ is identified by those sites getting abnormally desynchronized from the network during the seizure generation. We test the proposed method over a SEEG dataset of 10 seizures, comparing its accuracy in terms of EZ definition against the EI algorithm and clinical ground truth. Our results indicate that the DI algorithm underscores specific connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing sensitivity in detecting epileptogenic cortical sites.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16570">Predictability maximization and the origins of word order harmony</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.16570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18489">FAST functional connectivity implicates P300 connectivity in working memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.18489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in Electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel methodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00951">An internal sensory model allows for balance control using muscle spindle exafferent acceleration feedback</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.00951v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All motor tasks with an approximately linear mechanical system (e.g., a freely standing person, a rider on a bicycle) allows for optimal control actions that are a simple linear combination of full state sensory feedback. When the sensory feedback is not full state (i.e., does not contain position and velocity information about all joints), optimal control for these systems is based on an internal dynamical system that estimates the states, and that can be implemented as a recurrent neural network (RNN) in the central nervous system (CNS). It uses a sensory model to update the state estimates with the available (non-full state) sensory feedback. The weights of this RNN are fully specified by results from optimal feedback control. This is highly relevant for all sensory systems that do not provide full state feedback, and especially for muscle spindle primary afferents under well-coordinated fusimotor and skeletomotor control because, under this condition, their firing rates scale with the exafferent joint acceleration component. A sensory model exists for this exafferent acceleration component, and this can be used by the CNS to estimate the states. As a proof of the viability of this mechanism, I demonstrate that it balances a standing body and a rider-bicycle combination using realistic parameter values and with forcing torques that are feasible for humans.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16300">A Distance Similarity-based Genetic Optimization Algorithm for Satellite Ground Network Planning Considering Feeding Mode</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the satellite industry, the information transmission network based on communication satellites has gradually become a major and important part of the future satellite ground integration network. However, the low transmission efficiency of the satellite data relay back mission has become a problem that is currently constraining the construction of the system and needs to be solved urgently. Effectively planning the task of satellite ground networking by reasonably scheduling resources is crucial for the efficient transmission of task data. In this paper, we hope to provide a task execution scheme that maximizes the profit of the networking task for satellite ground network planning considering feeding mode (SGNPFM). To solve the SGNPFM problem, a mixed-integer planning model with the objective of maximizing the gain of the link-building task is constructed, which considers various constraints of the satellite in the feed-switching mode. Based on the problem characteristics, we propose a distance similarity-based genetic optimization algorithm (DSGA), which considers the state characteristics between the tasks and introduces a weighted Euclidean distance method to determine the similarity between the tasks. To obtain more high-quality solutions, different similarity evaluation methods are designed to assist the algorithm in intelligently screening individuals. The DSGA also uses an adaptive crossover strategy based on similarity mechanism, which guides the algorithm to achieve efficient population search. In addition, a task scheduling algorithm considering the feed-switching mode is designed for decoding the algorithm to generate a high-quality scheme. The results of simulation experiments show that the DSGA can effectively solve the SGNPFM problem.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16467">Spiking Diffusion Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) gaining attention for their ultra-low energy consumption and high biological plausibility compared with traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Despite their distinguished properties, the application of SNNs in the computationally intensive field of image generation is still under exploration. In this paper, we propose the Spiking Diffusion Models (SDMs), an innovative family of SNN-based generative models that excel in producing high-quality samples with significantly reduced energy consumption. In particular, we propose a Temporal-wise Spiking Mechanism (TSM) that allows SNNs to capture more temporal features from a bio-plasticity perspective. In addition, we propose a threshold-guided strategy that can further improve the performances by up to 16.7% without any additional training. We also make the first attempt to use the ANN-SNN approach for SNN-based generation tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal that our approach not only exhibits comparable performance to its ANN counterpart with few spiking time steps, but also outperforms previous SNN-based generative models by a large margin. Moreover, we also demonstrate the high-quality generation ability of SDM on large-scale datasets, e.g., LSUN bedroom. This development marks a pivotal advancement in the capabilities of SNN-based generation, paving the way for future research avenues to realize low-energy and low-latency generative applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/AndyCao1125/SDM.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16632">Maelstrom Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks has struggled to devise a way to incorporate working memory into neural networks. While the ``long term'' memory can be seen as the learned weights, the working memory consists likely more of dynamical activity, that is missing from feed-forward models. Current state of the art models such as transformers tend to ``solve'' this by ignoring working memory entirely and simply process the sequence as an entire piece of data; however this means the network cannot process the sequence in an online fashion, and leads to an immense explosion in memory requirements. Here, inspired by a combination of controls, reservoir computing, deep learning, and recurrent neural networks, we offer an alternative paradigm that combines the strength of recurrent networks, with the pattern matching capability of feed-forward neural networks, which we call the \textit{Maelstrom Networks} paradigm. This paradigm leaves the recurrent component - the \textit{Maelstrom} - unlearned, and offloads the learning to a powerful feed-forward network. This allows the network to leverage the strength of feed-forward training without unrolling the network, and allows for the memory to be implemented in new neuromorphic hardware. It endows a neural network with a sequential memory that takes advantage of the inductive bias that data is organized causally in the temporal domain, and imbues the network with a state that represents the agent's ``self'', moving through the environment. This could also lead the way to continual learning, with the network modularized and ``'protected'' from overwrites that come with new data. In addition to aiding in solving these performance problems that plague current non-temporal deep networks, this also could finally lead towards endowing artificial networks with a sense of ``self''.

                arXiv:2408.16256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the two cancers responsible for the most deaths in women, with about 42,000 deaths each year in the US. That there are over 300,000 breast cancers newly diagnosed each year suggests that only a fraction of the cancers result in mortality. Thus, most of the women undergo seemingly curative treatment for localized cancers, but a significant later succumb to metastatic disease for which current treatments are only temporizing for the vast majority. The current prognostic metrics are of little actionable value for 4 of the 5 women seemingly cured after local treatment, and many women are exposed to morbid and even mortal adjuvant therapies unnecessarily, with these adjuvant therapies reducing metastatic recurrence by only a third. Thus, there is a need for better prognostics to target aggressive treatment at those who are likely to relapse and spare those who were actually cured. While there is a plethora of molecular and tumor-marker assays in use and under-development to detect recurrence early, these are time consuming, expensive and still often un-validated as to actionable prognostic utility. A different approach would use large data techniques to determine clinical and histopathological parameters that would provide accurate prognostics using existing data. Herein, we report on machine learning, together with grid search and Bayesian Networks to develop algorithms that present a AUC of up to 0.9 in ROC analyses, using only extant data. Such algorithms could be rapidly translated to clinical management as they do not require testing beyond routine tumor evaluations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16285">ART: Actually Robust Training</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current interest in deep learning captures the attention of many programmers and researchers. Unfortunately, the lack of a unified schema for developing deep learning models results in methodological inconsistencies, unclear documentation, and problems with reproducibility. Some guidelines have been proposed, yet currently, they lack practical implementations. Furthermore, neural network training often takes on the form of trial and error, lacking a structured and thoughtful process. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we introduce Art, a Python library designed to help automatically impose rules and standards while developing deep learning pipelines. Art divides model development into a series of smaller steps of increasing complexity, each concluded with a validation check improving the interpretability and robustness of the process. The current version of Art comes equipped with nine predefined steps inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Recipe for Training Neural Networks, a visualization dashboard, and integration with loggers such as Neptune. The code related to this paper is available at: https://github.com/SebChw/Actually-Robust-Training.

	<p>This retrospective study assesses the efficacy and tolerability of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (anti-CGRP) therapy in adolescents and young adults (ages 12&amp;amp;ndash;21) with migraine and chronic daily headaches unresponsive to standard treatments. Migraines in this demographic significantly impair school performance, self-esteem, psychological well-being, and cognitive health. These young patients are also particularly sensitive to the side effects of conventional medications, which are often prescribed off-label and come with high insurance denial rates. Medication overuse, including analgesics, triptans, and NSAIDs, is prevalent due to treatment failures. Elevated plasma CGRP levels observed during migraines suggest that anti-CGRP therapies, successful in adult populations, may also benefit this younger age group. Over a three-year period, patients at a specialized pediatric headache center were evaluated for the impact of anti-CGRP treatments, including monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab) and small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists (ubrogepant, rimegepant, and atogepant), administered either alone or in combination with OnabotulinumtoxinA. Data were extracted from the hospital&amp;amp;rsquo;s electronic medical records, and patient progress was consistently documented using a structured template for each clinic visit. Additional patient satisfaction data were collected via telephone follow-ups and patient message reviews. The study included 23 patients, primarily treated for chronic migraine (CM) (78.3%), with a smaller subset addressing episodic migraine (EM), new daily persistent headaches (NDPHs), and post-traumatic headaches (PTHs). Comprehensive demographic and clinical data, including age, treatment duration, history of preventive treatment failures, and comorbidities like psychiatric conditions and sleep disorders, were collected. Anti-CGRP therapies, particularly when combined with traditional treatments or OnabotulinumtoxinA, resulted in significant improvements: 91.3% of patients experienced reduced migraine duration and intensity, 82.6% reported improvements in other bothersome symptoms, and 73.9% saw an improved response to rescue medications. Additionally, 78.3% of patients reported a reduction in their use of rescue medications per week by more than 50%, and emergency room visits were reduced for 56.5% of patients. Significant reductions in headache days were observed in 82.6% of patients after one month and 87% after three months, with nearly 40% experiencing more than a 50% reduction in both periods. The greatest benefits were observed in patients treated for more than six months. Adverse effects were minimal, with 95.7% of patients reporting no side effects, and patient satisfaction was high, with 69.6% opting to continue treatment. Overall, this study highlights the substantial potential of anti-CGRP therapy in improving outcomes for adolescents and young adults with CM and EM, offering a promising approach for a demographic that faces considerable challenges with conventional treatment options. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and expand clinical applications in this age group.</p>

                <p>Peak-alpha frequency varies across individuals and mental states, but it also forms a negative gradient from posterior to anterior regions in association with increases in cortical thickness and connectivity, reflecting a cortical hierarchy in temporal integration. Tracking the spatial standard deviation of peak-alpha frequency in scalp EEG, we observed that a posterior-to-anterior gradient dynamically formed and dissolved. Periods of high spatial standard deviation yielded robustly negative posterior-to-anterior gradients&mdash;the "gradient state"&mdash;while periods of low spatial standard deviation yielded globally converged peak-alpha frequency&mdash;the "uniform state." The state variations were characterized by a combination of slow (0.3&ndash;0.5&nbsp;Hz) oscillations and random-walk-like fluctuations. They were relatively independently correlated with peak-alpha frequency variations in anterior regions and peak-alpha power variations in central regions driven by posterior regions (together accounting for ~50% of the state variations), suggesting that two distinct mechanisms modulate the state variations: an anterior mechanism that directly adjusts peak-alpha frequencies and a posterior&ndash;central mechanism that indirectly adjusts them by influencing synchronization. The state variations likely reflect general operations as their spatiotemporal characteristics remained unchanged while participants engaged in a variety of tasks (breath focus, vigilance, working memory, mental arithmetic, and generative thinking) with their eyes closed or watched a silent nature video. The ongoing state variations may dynamically balance two global processing modes, one that facilitates greater temporal integration (and potentially also information influx) toward anterior regions in the gradient state and the other that facilitates flexible global communication (via phase locking) in the uniform state.</p>

                <p>Adolescent inhibition of thalamocortical projections from postnatal days P20 to 50 leads to long-lasting deficits in prefrontal cortex function and cognition in the adult mouse. While this suggests a role of thalamic activity in prefrontal cortex maturation, it is unclear how inhibition of these projections affects prefrontal circuitry during adolescence. Here, we used chemogenetic tools to inhibit thalamoprefrontal projections in male/female mice from P20 to P35 and measured synaptic inputs to prefrontal pyramidal neurons by layer (either II/III or V/VI) and projection target (mediodorsal thalamus (MD), nucleus accumbens (NAc), or callosal prefrontal projections) 24&nbsp;h later using slice physiology. We found a decrease in the frequency of excitatory and inhibitory currents in layer II/III NAc and layer V/VI MD-projecting neurons while layer V/VI NAc-projecting neurons showed an increase in the amplitude of excitatory and inhibitory currents. Regarding cortical projections, the frequency of inhibitory but not excitatory currents was enhanced in contralateral mPFC-projecting neurons. Notably, despite these complex changes in individual levels of excitation and inhibition, the overall balance between excitation and inhibition in each cell was only altered in the contralateral mPFC projections. This finding suggests homeostatic regulation occurs within subcortically but not intracortical callosal-projecting neurons. Increased inhibition of intraprefrontal connectivity may therefore be particularly important for prefrontal cortex circuit maturation. Finally, we observed cognitive deficits in the adult mouse using this narrowed window of thalamocortical inhibition.</p>

                <p>Volatile anesthetics are currently believed to cause unconsciousness by acting on one or more molecular targets including neural ion channels, receptors, mitochondria, synaptic proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins. Anesthetic gases including isoflurane bind to cytoskeletal microtubules (MTs) and dampen their quantum optical effects, potentially contributing to causing unconsciousness. This possibility is supported by the finding that taxane chemotherapy consisting of MT-stabilizing drugs reduces the effectiveness of anesthesia during surgery in human cancer patients. In order to experimentally assess the contribution of MTs as functionally relevant targets of volatile anesthetics, we measured latencies to loss of righting reflex (LORR) under 4% isoflurane in male rats injected subcutaneously with vehicle or 0.75&nbsp;mg/kg of the brain-penetrant MT&ndash;stabilizing drug epothilone B (epoB). EpoB-treated rats took an average of 69&nbsp;s longer to become unconscious as measured by latency to LORR. This was a statistically significant difference corresponding to a standardized mean difference (Cohen's <I>d</I>) of 1.9, indicating a "large" normalized effect size. The effect could not be accounted for by tolerance from repeated exposure to isoflurane. Our results suggest that binding of the anesthetic gas isoflurane to MTs causes unconsciousness and loss of purposeful behavior in rats (and presumably humans and other animals). This finding is predicted by models that posit consciousness as a property of a quantum physical state of neural MTs.</p>

                <p>Uncovering the relationships between neural circuits, behavior, and neural dysfunction may require rodent pose tracking. While open-source toolkits such as DeepLabCut have revolutionized markerless pose estimation using deep neural networks, the training process still requires human intervention for annotating key points of interest in video data. To further reduce human labor for neural network training, we developed a method that automatically generates annotated image datasets of rodent paw placement in a laboratory setting. It uses invisible but fluorescent markers that become temporarily visible under UV light. Through stroboscopic alternating illumination, adjacent video frames taken at 720&nbsp;Hz are either UV or white light illuminated. After color filtering the UV-exposed video frames, the UV markings are identified and the paw locations are deterministically mapped. This paw information is then transferred to automatically annotate paw positions in the next white light-exposed frame that is later used for training the neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a KineWheel&ndash;DeepLabCut setup for the markerless tracking of the four paws of a harness-fixed mouse running on top of the transparent wheel with mirror. Our automated approach, made available open-source, achieves high-quality position annotations and significantly reduces the need for human involvement in the neural network training process, paving the way for more efficient and streamlined rodent pose tracking in neuroscience research.</p>

                Background Most stroke survivors consider community ambulation an essential but unmet goal of their recovery. Historically, interventions to enhance community ambulation have focused on improving biomechanical impairments of gait; however, recent evidence suggests that biopsychosocial and environmental factors may impact community ambulation, even beyond more obvious physical impairments. The identification of factors that pose as significant facilitators or barriers to community ambulation may serve to guide stakeholders in designing relevant and evidence-based interventions for improving community ambulation post-stroke. Objective This review aims to map the type and extent of existing evidence on the physical, biopsychosocial, and environmental factors affecting community ambulation post-stroke. Additionally, this review will describe the various methods used to examine the extent to which stroke survivors are restricted to community ambulation. Methods Nine databases will be searched including CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science. We will include studies published in English during or after 2001. Studies that examine physical, biopsychosocial, and/or environmental factors affecting community ambulation in ambulatory adults at least six months post-stroke will be considered for inclusion. Studies that assess general physical activity or community mobility through transportation modes other than walking will be excluded. All identified records will be collated in citation management software, followed by steps of deduplication, title/abstract screening, and full-text reviews by at least two independent reviewers. The bibliographies of the extracted studies will also be reviewed for relevant articles. The extracted studies will be analyzed, critically appraised, and presented in tabular, narrative, and evidence map formats. Discussion The evidence gained will be used to build a framework for community ambulation, informing stakeholders to develop meaningful interventions to improve community ambulation. The mapped evidence will motivate future studies to develop holistic approaches that specifically focus on the most vital factors that influence post-stroke community ambulation.

                Background Activation of coagulation is a common phenomenon in patients with high-grade glioma, a primary malignant brain tumor. Objective Identify if there is an alteration in the coagulation profile in patients with high-grade glioma compared to other patients with benign brain tumors. Methods Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, ECOG at admission, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, platelet count, and blood panel results of 21 high-grade glioma patients (cases) and 42 meningioma patients (controls) from northern Peru were reviewed. Bivariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression were performed to determine which factors are associated with glioma. Results Both groups had high proportions of high blood pressure (29%) and diabetes mellitus (14%). According to multivariate analysis, altered values for prothrombin time, platelet count, and ECOG score were associated with glioma (p=0.01). Furthermore, alterations in the blood panel were observed in both cases and controls but failed to reach statistical significance. Conclusion Patients with high-grade glioma seem to suffer more from hypercoagulable states than other patients with benign brain tumors, suggesting careful vigilance and anticoagulant treatment for these patients.

                This research shows that ongoing digital changes have a significant impact, particularly in the government sector. In addition to ease and benefits, such as operational efficiency and faster public services, new challenges, such as problems related to system integration, human resources (HR) limitations in the use of technology, and public access to digital technology, are also present. Therefore, this study aims to explore the role of interpersonal communication in enhancing employee performance in the context of HR development in the digital era by employing the systematic literature review (SLR) method and using data from electronic databases, specifically Google Scholar using the Harsing’s Publish or Perish (Windows GUI Edition) 8.2.3944.8118, the application can be accessed by downloading (https://publish-or-perish.en.softonic.com/), and Scopus (www.scopus.com) with a focus on journals published between 2017 and 2024. By identifying research gaps, research questions were developed to understand the influence of interpersonal communication on improving employee performance in the context of public services, necessary adaptations, and interpersonal communication strategies. This research provides comprehensive insights and practical solutions for the government sector to address the dynamics of the current and future digital era, based on data analysis from reliable database sources. The risk of bias in this study was addressed through the selection criteria and data extraction method. Thematic analysis and quantitative summarization were used for data presentation and synthesis. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that interpersonal communication has a significant positive influence on employee performance. The effect size estimates for each intervention and the corresponding confidence intervals are presented. To ensure honesty and accuracy in the interpretation of the results, potential evidence limitations and biases should be acknowledged transparently.

                The debate on tuition-free higher education has raged in South Africa since the #FeesMustFall protests at South African universities in 2015 and 2016. The government responded with a tuition-free education policy targeting students from households earning less than R350 000. However, the question remains can South Africa sustain a tuition-free education policy given its developing nation status and the levels of its GDP? This article sought to assess the feasibility of tuition-free higher education for all in South Africa. A scoping review was used, and fifteen articles about tuition-free higher education feasibility in South Africa were reviewed. The choice of the scoping review was due to the need for an understanding of the current state of play in research on the feasibility of tuition-free higher education in South Africa. The results suggest that tuition-free higher education for all is not feasible in South Africa. There seems to be a consensus that South Africa lacks the resources to finance tuition-free higher education for all. Tuition-free higher education is also viewed as a regressive tax on the poor given that the majority of students in higher education institutions come from middle and upper-income households. However, it is important to note that a distinction is drawn between tuition-free higher education for all and tuition-free higher education for the poor and academically deserving. The latter seems to receive support with some viewing it as a moral imperative in an unequal society such as South Africa’s. It is recommended that future studies approach the issue from an empirical standpoint whereby the GDP levels are assessed against higher education funding.

                Background This research investigated the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, aiming to elucidate the complexities surrounding its implementation and impact. By employing a causal loop diagram approach, the study examined the interplay of socioeconomic, political, and institutional factors influencing the provision of fee-free higher education. Method A participatory approach to developing the CLD was used. Through an extensive literature review, the research contextualised fee-free higher education enabling a preliminary CLD to be developed. Discussions were held to improve the preliminary model based on stakeholder and expert opinion. The model was then validated by stakeholders and experts. Results The CLD has explicitly mapped out the causal relationships which play a fundamental role in fee-free higher education in South Africa. Key findings revealed that fee-free higher education initiatives, such as managing funding constraints and administrative complexities, hold promise for fostering inclusivity and socioeconomic development but are hindered by bureaucratic policy establishments and inefficiencies. These challenges underscore the gap between policy formulation and implementation, highlighting the need for comprehensive reforms to streamline administrative processes and enhance financial sustainability within the higher education sector. Conclusion This research thoroughly examined the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities in its implementation. The study emphasized the need for systemic reforms to improve accessibility and effectiveness, while also underscoring the potential of such initiatives to promote social mobility and economic empowerment, aligning with global goals like the SDGs and the African Agenda 2063.

                Despite the growing interest in social prescribing the diversification of health and social care strategies to support the well-being of patients has remained entrenched with a focus on the hospital setting within the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates has commenced progressing community mental health care to lead changes in how care and treatment are delivered within the United Arab Emirates. The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

                <p>by Alexander Ney, Nuno R. Nené, Eva Sedlak, Pilar Acedo, Oleg Blyuss, Harry J. Whitwell, Eithne Costello, Aleksandra Gentry-Maharaj, Norman R. Williams, Usha Menon, Giuseppe K. Fusai, Alexey Zaikin, Stephen P. Pereira</p>
Background <p>The grim (<10% 5-year) survival rates for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are attributed to its complex intrinsic biology and most often late-stage detection. The overlap of symptoms with benign gastrointestinal conditions in early stage further complicates timely detection. The suboptimal diagnostic performance of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 and elevation in benign hyperbilirubinaemia undermine its reliability, leaving a notable absence of accurate diagnostic biomarkers. Using a selected patient cohort with benign pancreatic and biliary tract conditions we aimed to develop a data analysis protocol leading to a biomarker signature capable of distinguishing patients with non-specific yet concerning clinical presentations, from those with PDAC.</p> Methods <p>539 patient serum samples collected under the Accelerated Diagnosis of neuro Endocrine and Pancreatic TumourS (ADEPTS) study (benign disease controls and PDACs) and the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS, healthy controls) were screened using the Olink Oncology II panel, supplemented with five in-house markers. 16 specialized base-learner classifiers were stacked to select and enhance biomarker performances and robustness in blinded samples. Each base-learner was constructed through cross-validation and recursive feature elimination in a discovery set comprising approximately two thirds of the ADEPTS and UKCTOCS samples and contrasted specific diagnosis with PDAC.</p> Results <p>The signature which was developed using diagnosis-specific ensemble learning demonstrated predictive capabilities outperforming CA19-9, the only biomarker currently accepted by the FDA and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for pancreatic cancer, and other individual biomarkers and combinations in both discovery and held-out validation sets. An AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98–0.99) and sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98–1) at 90% specificity was achieved with the ensemble method, which was significantly larger than the AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.66–0.91) and sensitivity 0.67 (95% CI 0.50–0.83), also at 90% specificity, for CA19-9, in the discovery set (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.00050, respectively). During ensemble signature validation in the held-out set, an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91–0.99), sensitivity 0.86 (95% CI 0.68–1), was attained compared to an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.66–0.93), sensitivity 0.65 (95% CI 0.48–0.56) at 90% specificity for CA19-9 alone (p = 0.0082 and p = 0.024, respectively). When validated only on the benign disease controls and PDACs collected from ADEPTS, the diagnostic-specific signature achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92–0.99), sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI 0.64–0.95) at 90% specificity, which was still significantly higher than the performance for CA19-9 taken as a single predictor, AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.64–0.93) and sensitivity of 0.18 (95% CI 0.03–0.69) (p = 0.013 and p = 0.0055, respectively).</p> Conclusion <p>Our ensemble modelling technique outperformed CA19-9, individual biomarkers and indices developed with prevailing algorithms in distinguishing patients with non-specific but concerning symptoms from those with PDAC, with implications for improving its early detection in individuals at risk.</p>

Mobile genetic elements shape microbial gene repertoires and populations. Recent results reveal that many, possibly most, microbial mobile genetic elements require helpers to transfer between genomes, which we refer to as Hitcher Genetic Elements (hitchers or HGEs). They may be a large fraction of pathogenicity and resistance genomic islands, whose mechanisms of transfer have remained enigmatic for decades. Together with their helper elements and their bacterial hosts, hitchers form tripartite networks of interactions that evolve rapidly within a parasitism–mutualism continuum. In this emerging view of microbial genomes as communities of mobile genetic elements many questions arise. Which elements are being moved, by whom, and how? How often are hitchers costly hyper-parasites or beneficial mutualists? What is the evolutionary origin of hitchers? Are there key advantages associated with hitchers’ lifestyle that justify their unexpected abundance? And why are hitchers systematically smaller than their helpers? In this essay, we start answering these questions and point ways ahead for understanding the principles, origin, mechanisms, and impact of hitchers in bacterial ecology and evolution.

The widespread sharing of information on the Internet has given rise to ecological studies that use data from digital sources including digitized museum records and social media posts. Most of these studies have focused on understanding species occurrences and distributions. In this essay, we argue that data from digital sources also offer many opportunities to study animal behavior including long-term and large-scale comparisons within and between species. Following Nikko Tinbergen’s classical roadmap for behavioral investigation, we show how using videos, photos, text, and audio posted on social media and other digital platforms can shed new light on known behaviors, particularly in a changing world, and lead to the discovery of new ones.

While extinction risk categorization is fundamental for building robust conservation planning for marine fishes, empirical data on occurrence and vulnerability to disturbances are still lacking for most marine teleost fish species, preventing the assessment of their International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) status. In this article, we predicted the IUCN status of marine fishes based on two machine learning algorithms, trained with available species occurrences, biological traits, taxonomy, and human uses. We found that extinction risk for marine fish species is higher than initially estimated by the IUCN, increasing from 2.5% to 12.7%. Species predicted as Threatened were mainly characterized by a small geographic range, a relatively large body size, and a low growth rate. Hotspots of predicted Threatened species peaked mainly in the South China Sea, the Philippine Sea, the Celebes Sea, the west coast Australia and North America. We also explored the consequences of including these predicted species’ IUCN status in the prioritization of marine protected areas through conservation planning. We found a marked increase in prioritization ranks for subpolar and polar regions despite their low species richness. We suggest to integrate multifactorial ensemble learning to assess species extinction risk and offer a more complete view of endangered taxonomic groups to ultimately reach global conservation targets like the extending coverage of protected areas where species are the most vulnerable.

The chelicerate body plan is distinguished from other arthropod groups by its division of segments into 2 tagmata: the anterior prosoma (“cephalothorax”) and the posterior opisthosoma (“abdomen”). Little is understood about the genetic mechanisms that establish the prosomal-opisthosomal (PO) boundary. To discover these mechanisms, we created high-quality genomic resources for the large-bodied spider <i>Aphonopelma hentzi</i>. We sequenced specific territories along the antero-posterior axis of developing embryos and applied differential gene expression analyses to identify putative regulators of regional identity. After bioinformatic screening for candidate genes that were consistently highly expressed in only 1 tagma (either the prosoma or the opisthosoma), we validated the function of highly ranked candidates in the tractable spider model <i>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</i>. Here, we show that an arthropod homolog of the Iroquois complex of homeobox genes is required for proper formation of the boundary between arachnid tagmata. The function of this homolog had not been previously characterized, because it was lost in the common ancestor of Pancrustacea, precluding its investigation in well-studied insect model organisms. Knockdown of the spider copy of this gene, which we designate as <i>waist-less</i>, in <i>P</i>. <i>tepidariorum</i> resulted in embryos with defects in the PO boundary, incurring discontinuous spider germ bands. We show that <i>waist-less</i> is required for proper specification of the segments that span the prosoma-opisthosoma boundary, which in adult spiders corresponds to the narrowed pedicel. Our results demonstrate the requirement of an ancient, taxon-restricted paralog for the establishment of the tagmatic boundary that defines Chelicerata.

                Introduction Actinomycosis is an uncommon inflammatory bacterial disease caused by Actinomyces species, especially Actinomyces Israeli. Abdominopelvic forms are relatively rare and may involve the colon as a solid mass, mimicking a malignant tumor. Case presentation A 68-year-old Tunisian man, with a history of diabetes, hypertension, penicillin allergy, and renal failure, presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, vomiting, and bowel obstruction. CT scan showed an acute intestinal obstruction upstream with obstructive tissular mass at the sigmoid colon. Emergency surgery revealed a sigmoid mass and a pre-perforative cecum. Subtotal colectomy was performed, with ileostomy and distal end closure. Histological examination confirmed Actinomyces infection. The patient was then placed on long-term doxycycline and Bactrim, with no recurrence over a 9-month follow-up period. Conclusion Abdominal actinomycosis, though rare, presents diagnostic challenges. It can be mistaken for malignancy, leading to unnecessary surgery in non-complicated cases, since it is effectively treated by antibiotics. In complicated cases, a combined approach involving both surgery and antibiotic therapy is necessary until the infection is completely eradicated.

                Background Bacterial infections continue to pose a global health challenge, driven by antibiotic resistance and septicemia. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in bacterial infections versus non-infectious causes of inflammation. Methods A prospective study included 164 adult patients who were divided into two groups: a group of patients with confirmed bacterial infections and a second group of patients with other diagnoses (inflammatory pathologies, neoplasms, venous thromboembolic diseases, etc.). NLR and PLR values were compared between the bacterial infection group and the non-infectious causes group and the diagnostic performances of NLR and PLR for detecting bacterial infections were evaluated in comparison with other infection markers. Results NLR and PLR were significantly higher in bacterial infections (p < 10^-6), and NLR was correlated positively with inflammation markers. NLR and PLR demonstrated significant potential in diagnosing bacterial infections, with an AUC of 0.72 and 0.60, respectively, using the following cutoff values: 4.3 for NLR and 183 for PLR. Conclusion These findings underscore the importance of NLR and PLR as adjunctive tools for bacterial infection diagnosis.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a key component of the brain's memory systems, with anatomical connections to the hippocampus, anterior thalamus, and entorhinal cortex. This circuit has been implicated in episodic memory and many of these structures have been shown to encode temporal information, which is critical for episodic memory. For example, hippocampal time cells reliably fire during specific segments of time during a delay period. Although RSC lesions are known to disrupt temporal memory, time cells have not been observed there. In this study, we reanalyzed archival RSC neuronal firing data during the intertrial delay period from two previous experiments involving different behavioral tasks, a blocked alternation task and a cued T-maze task. For the blocked alternation task, rats were required to approach the east or west arm of a plus maze for reward during different blocks of trials. Because the reward locations were not cued, the rat had to remember the goal location for each trial. In the cued T-maze task, the reward location was explicitly cued with a light and the rats simply had to approach the light for reward, so there was no requirement to hold a memory during the intertrial delay. Time cells were prevalent in the blocked alternation task, and most time cells clearly differentiated the east and west trials. We also found that RSC neurons could exhibit off-response time fields, periods of reliably inhibited firing. Time cells were also observed in the cued T-maze, but they were less prevalent and they did not differentiate left and right trials as well as in the blocked alternation task, suggesting that RSC time cells are sensitive to the memory demands of the task. These results suggest that temporal coding is a prominent feature of RSC firing patterns, consistent with an RSC role in episodic memory.</p>

                The human voice is a potent social signal and a distinctive marker of individual identity. As individuals go through puberty, their voices undergo acoustic changes, setting them apart from others. In this article, we propose that hormonal fluctuations in conjunction with morphological vocal tract changes during puberty establish a sensitive developmental phase that affects the monitoring of the adolescent voice and, specifically, self–other distinction. Furthermore, the protracted maturation of brain regions responsible for voice processing, coupled with the dynamically evolving social environment of adolescents, likely disrupts a clear differentiation of the self-voice from others’ voices. This socioneuroendocrine framework offers a holistic understanding of voice monitoring during adolescence.

                Immunity acquired by vaccination following infection, termed hybrid immunity, has been shown to confer enhanced protection against SARS-CoV-2. Jung et al. identify Fc-mediated humoral profiles that are amplified in hybrid immunity, especially in the elderly. This suggests possible benefits of vaccination strategy mimicking hybrid immunity in the elderly.

                Muscle spindles are the principal receptors for proprioception. Torell and Dimitriou demonstrate that under isometric conditions human spindles encode local muscle pressure, whereas release of pressure lowers spindle firing below baseline rates; pressure also enhances spindle responses during stretch. These findings urge a re-evaluation of proprioceptive feedback in various contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98677">Opposing actions of co-released GABA and neurotensin on the activity of preoptic neurons and on body temperature</a></h4>

              
                Neurotensin (Nts) is a neuropeptide acting as a neuromodulator in the brain. Pharmacological studies have identified Nts as a potent hypothermic agent. The medial preoptic area, a region that plays an important role in the control of thermoregulation, contains a high density of neurotensinergic neurons and Nts receptors. The conditions in which neurotensinergic neurons play a role in thermoregulation are not known. In this study, optogenetic stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons induced a small hyperthermia. In vitro, optogenetic stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons resulted in synaptic release of GABA and net inhibition of the preoptic pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (Adcyap1) neurons firing activity. GABA-A receptor antagonist or genetic deletion of Slc32a1 (VGAT) in Nts neurons unmasked also an excitatory effect that was blocked by a Nts receptor 1 antagonist. Stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons lacking <i>Slc32a1</i> resulted in excitation of <i>Adcyap1</i> neurons and hypothermia. Mice lacking <i>Slc32a1</i> expression in Nts neurons presented changes in the fever response and in the responses to heat or cold exposure as well as an altered circadian rhythm of body temperature. Chemogenetic activation of all Nts neurons in the brain induced a 4–5°C hypothermia, which could be blocked by Nts receptor antagonists in the preoptic area. Chemogenetic activation of preoptic neurotensinergic projections resulted in robust excitation of preoptic <i>Adcyap1</i> neurons. Taken together, our data demonstrate that endogenously released Nts can induce potent hypothermia and that excitation of preoptic <i>Adcyap1</i> neurons is the cellular mechanism that triggers this response.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95028">Detection of TurboID fusion proteins by fluorescent streptavidin outcompetes antibody signals and visualises targets not accessible to antibodies</a></h4>

              
                Immunofluorescence localises proteins via fluorophore-labelled antibodies. However, some proteins evade detection due to antibody-accessibility issues or because they are naturally low abundant or antigen density is reduced by the imaging method. Here, we show that the fusion of the target protein to the biotin ligase TurboID and subsequent detection of biotinylation by fluorescent streptavidin offers an ‘all in one’ solution to these restrictions. For all proteins tested, the streptavidin signal was significantly stronger than an antibody signal, markedly improving the sensitivity of expansion microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy. Importantly, proteins within phase-separated regions, such as the central channel of the nuclear pores, the nucleolus, or RNA granules, were readily detected with streptavidin, while most antibodies failed. When TurboID is used in tandem with an HA epitope tag, co-probing with streptavidin and anti-HA can map antibody-accessibility and we created such a map for the trypanosome nuclear pore. Lastly, we show that streptavidin imaging resolves dynamic, temporally, and spatially distinct sub-complexes and, in specific cases, reveals a history of dynamic protein interaction. In conclusion, streptavidin imaging has major advantages for the detection of lowly abundant or inaccessible proteins and in addition, provides information on protein interactions and biophysical environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94995">Damage-induced basal epithelial cell migration modulates the spatial organization of redox signaling and sensory neuron regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Epithelial damage leads to early reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, which regulates sensory neuron regeneration and tissue repair. How the initial type of tissue injury influences early damage signaling and regenerative growth of sensory axons remains unclear. Previously we reported that thermal injury triggers distinct early tissue responses in larval zebrafish. Here, we found that thermal but not mechanical injury impairs sensory axon regeneration and function. Real-time imaging revealed an immediate tissue response to thermal injury characterized by the rapid Arp2/3-dependent migration of keratinocytes, which was associated with tissue scale ROS production and sustained sensory axon damage. Isotonic treatment was sufficient to limit keratinocyte movement, spatially restrict ROS production, and rescue sensory neuron function. These results suggest that early keratinocyte dynamics regulate the spatial and temporal pattern of long-term signaling in the wound microenvironment during tissue repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91260">PKR activation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-transgenic mice with nephropathy</a></h4>

              
                HIV disease remains prevalent in the USA and chronic kidney disease remains a major cause of morbidity in HIV-1-positive patients. Host double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) is a sensor for viral dsRNA, including HIV-1. We show that PKR inhibition by compound C16 ameliorates the HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) kidney phenotype in the Tg26 transgenic mouse model, with reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction. Combined analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data revealed that oxidative phosphorylation was one of the most downregulated pathways and identified signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) as a potential mediating factor. We identified in Tg26 mice a novel proximal tubular cell cluster enriched in mitochondrial transcripts. Podocytes showed high levels of HIV-1 gene expression and dysregulation of cytoskeleton-related genes, and these cells dedifferentiated. In injured proximal tubules, cell-cell interaction analysis indicated activation of the pro-fibrogenic PKR-STAT3-platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-D pathway. These findings suggest that PKR inhibition and mitochondrial rescue are potential novel therapeutic approaches for HIVAN.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91970">Divergent downstream biosynthetic pathways are supported by L-cysteine synthases of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>’s (<i>Mtb</i>) autarkic lifestyle within the host involves rewiring its transcriptional networks to combat host-induced stresses. With the help of RNA sequencing performed under various stress conditions, we identified that genes belonging to <i>Mtb</i> sulfur metabolism pathways are significantly upregulated during oxidative stress. Using an integrated approach of microbial genetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, animal experiments, chemical inhibition, and rescue studies, we investigated the biological role of non-canonical <span class="small-caps">L</span>-cysteine synthases, CysM and CysK2. While transcriptome signatures of <i>RvΔcysM</i> and <i>RvΔcysK2</i> appear similar under regular growth conditions, we observed unique transcriptional signatures when subjected to oxidative stress. We followed pool size and labelling (<sup>34</sup>S) of key downstream metabolites, viz. mycothiol and ergothioneine, to monitor L-cysteine biosynthesis and utilization. This revealed the significant role of distinct L-cysteine biosynthetic routes on redox stress and homeostasis. CysM and CysK2 independently facilitate <i>Mtb</i> survival by alleviating host-induced redox stress, suggesting they are not fully redundant during infection. With the help of genetic mutants and chemical inhibitors, we show that CysM and CysK2 serve as unique, attractive targets for adjunct therapy to combat mycobacterial infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91097">Long-distance electron transport in multicellular freshwater cable bacteria</a></h4>

              
                Filamentous multicellular cable bacteria perform centimeter-scale electron transport in a process that couples oxidation of an electron donor (sulfide) in deeper sediment to the reduction of an electron acceptor (oxygen or nitrate) near the surface. While this electric metabolism is prevalent in both marine and freshwater sediments, detailed electronic measurements of the conductivity previously focused on the marine cable bacteria (<i>Candidatus</i> Electrothrix), rather than freshwater cable bacteria, which form a separate genus (<i>Candidatus</i> Electronema) and contribute essential geochemical roles in freshwater sediments. Here, we characterize the electron transport characteristics of <i>Ca</i>. Electronema cable bacteria from Southern California freshwater sediments. Current–voltage measurements of intact cable filaments bridging interdigitated electrodes confirmed their persistent conductivity under a controlled atmosphere and the variable sensitivity of this conduction to air exposure. Electrostatic and conductive atomic force microscopies mapped out the characteristics of the cell envelope’s nanofiber network, implicating it as the conductive pathway in a manner consistent with previous findings in marine cable bacteria. Four-probe measurements of microelectrodes addressing intact cables demonstrated nanoampere currents up to 200 μm lengths at modest driving voltages, allowing us to quantify the nanofiber conductivity at 0.1 S/cm for freshwater cable bacteria filaments under our measurement conditions. Such a high conductivity can support the remarkable sulfide-to-oxygen electrical currents mediated by cable bacteria in sediments. These measurements expand the knowledgebase of long-distance electron transport to the freshwater niche while shedding light on the underlying conductive network of cable bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92195">TRIP13 localizes to synapsed chromosomes and functions as a dosage-sensitive regulator of meiosis</a></h4>

              
                Meiotic progression requires coordinated assembly and disassembly of protein complexes involved in chromosome synapsis and meiotic recombination. Mouse TRIP13 and its ortholog Pch2 are instrumental in remodeling HORMA domain proteins. HORMAD proteins are associated with unsynapsed chromosome axes but depleted from the synaptonemal complex (SC) of synapsed homologs. Here we report that TRIP13 localizes to the synapsed SC in early pachytene spermatocytes and to telomeres throughout meiotic prophase I. Loss of TRIP13 leads to meiotic arrest and thus sterility in both sexes. <i>Trip13</i>-null meiocytes exhibit abnormal persistence of HORMAD1 and HOMRAD2 on synapsed SC and chromosome asynapsis that preferentially affects XY and centromeric ends. These major phenotypes are consistent with reported phenotypes of <i>Trip13</i> hypomorph alleles. <i>Trip13</i> heterozygous mice exhibit meiotic defects that are less severe than the <i>Trip13</i>-null mice, showing that TRIP13 is a dosage-sensitive regulator of meiosis. Localization of TRIP13 to the synapsed SC is independent of SC axial element proteins such as REC8 and SYCP2/SYCP3. Terminal FLAG-tagged TRIP13 proteins are functional and recapitulate the localization of native TRIP13 to SC and telomeres. Therefore, the evolutionarily conserved localization of TRIP13/Pch2 to the synapsed chromosomes provides an explanation for dissociation of HORMA domain proteins upon synapsis in diverse organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92345">Polysaccharides induce deep-sea Lentisphaerae strains to release chronic bacteriophages</a></h4>

              
                Viruses are ubiquitous in nature and play key roles in various ecosystems. Notably, some viruses (e.g. bacteriophage) exhibit alternative life cycles, such as chronic infections without cell lysis. However, the impact of chronic infections and their interactions with the host organisms remains largely unknown. Here, we found for the first time that polysaccharides induced the production of multiple temperate phages infecting two deep-sea <i>Lentisphaerae</i> strains (WC36 and zth2). Through physiological assays, genomic analysis, and transcriptomics assays, we found these bacteriophages were released via a chronic style without host cell lysis, which might reprogram host polysaccharide metabolism through the potential auxiliary metabolic genes. The findings presented here, together with recent discoveries made on the reprogramming of host energy-generating metabolisms by chronic bacteriophages, shed light on the poorly explored marine virus–host interaction and bring us closer to understanding the potential role of chronic viruses in marine ecosystems.

">Altered Copper Transport in Oxidative Stress-Dependent Brain Endothelial Barrier Dysfunction Associated with Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Oxidative stress and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption due to brain endothelial barrier dysfunction contribute to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which is characterized by beta-amyloid (A{beta}) accumulation in senile plaques. Copper (Cu) is implicated in AD pathology and its levels are tightly controlled by several Cu transport proteins. However, their expression and role in AD, particularly in relation to brain endothelial barrier function remains unclear. In this study, we examined the expression of Cu transport proteins in the brains of AD mouse models as well as their involvement in A{beta}42-induced brain endothelial barrier dysfunction. We found that the Cu uptake transporter CTR1 was upregulated, while the Cu exporter ATP7A and/or ATP7B were downregulated in the hippocampus of AD mouse models, and in A{beta}42-treated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). In the 5xFAD AD mouse model, Cu levels (assessed by ICP-MS) were elevated in the hippocampus. Moreover, A{beta}42-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ROS-dependent loss in barrier function in hBMEC (measured by transendothelial electrical resistance), and tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin were all inhibited by either a membrane permeable Cu chelator or by knocking down CTR1 expression. These findings suggest that dysregulated expression of Cu transport proteins may lead to intracellular Cu accumulation in the AD brain, and that A{beta}42 promotes ROS-dependent brain endothelial barrier dysfunction and VE-Cadherin phosphorylation in a CTR1-Cu-dependent manner. Our study uncovers the critical role of Cu transport proteins in oxidative stress-related loss of BBB integrity in AD.

">FREQuency-resolved brain Network Estimation via Source Separation (FREQ-NESS)</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a dynamic system whose network organisation is often studied by focusing on specific frequency bands or anatomical regions, leading to fragmented insights, or by employing complex and elaborate methods that hinder straightforward interpretations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method called FREQuency-resolved Network Estimation via Source Separation (FREQ-NESS). This method is designed to estimate the activation and spatial configuration of simultaneous brain networks across frequencies by analysing the frequency-resolved multivariate covariance between whole-brain voxel time series. We applied FREQ-NESS to source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data during resting state and isochronous auditory stimulation. Results revealed simultaneous, frequency-specific brain networks in resting state, such as the default mode, alpha-band, and motor-beta networks. During auditory stimulation, FREQ-NESS detected: (1) emergence of networks attuned to the stimulation frequency, (2) spatial reorganisation of existing networks, such as alpha-band networks shifting from occipital to sensorimotor areas, (3) stability of networks unaffected by auditory stimuli. Furthermore, auditory stimulation significantly enhanced cross-frequency coupling, with the phase of attuned auditory networks modulating the gamma band amplitude of medial temporal lobe networks. In conclusion, FREQ-NESS effectively maps the brains spatiotemporal dynamics, providing a comprehensive view of brain function by revealing simultaneous, frequency-resolved networks and their interaction.

">Segregated basal ganglia output pathways correspond to genetically divergent neuronal subclasses</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia control multiple sensorimotor behaviors though anatomically segregated and topographically organized subcircuits with outputs to specific downstream circuits. However, it is unclear how the anatomical organization of basal ganglia output circuits relates to the molecular diversity of cell types. Here, we demonstrate that the major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) is comprised of transcriptomically distinct subclasses that reflect its distinct progenitor lineages. We show that these subclasses are topographically organized within SNr, project to distinct targets in the midbrain and hindbrain, and receive inputs from different striatal subregions. Finally, we show that these mouse subclasses are also identifiable in human SNr neurons, suggesting that the genetic organization of SNr is evolutionarily conserved. These findings provide a unifying logic for how the developmental specification of diverse SNr neurons relates to the anatomical organization of basal ganglia circuits controlling specialized downstream brain regions.

">Regulation of transposons within medium spiny neurons enables molecular and behavioral responses to cocaine</a></h4>

              
                A more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which substance use is encoded in the brain could illuminate novel strategies to treat substance use disorders, including cocaine use disorder (CUD). We have previously discovered that Zfp189, which encodes a Kruppel-associated box zinc finger protein (KZFP) transcription factor (TF), differentially accumulates in nucleus accumbens (NAc) Drd1+ and Drd2+ medium spiny neurons (MSNs) over the course of cocaine exposure and is causal in producing MSN functional and behavioral changes to cocaine(1). Here, we aimed to illuminate the brain cell-type specific molecular mechanisms through which this KZFP TF produces CUD-related brain changes, with emphasis on investigating transposable elements (TEs), since KZFPs like ZFP189 are known regulators of TEs(2-6). First, we annotated TEs in existing single nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNAseq) datasets of rodents that were exposed to either acute or repeated cocaine. We discovered that expression of NAc TEs was dramatically altered by cocaine experience, the most sensitive NAc cell-type was MSNs, and TEs in Drd1+ MSNs were considerably more dynamic over the course of cocaine exposure than TEs in Drd2+ MSNs. To determine the causality of this TE dysregulation within NAc MSNs in cocaine-induced brain changes, we virally delivered conditional synthetic ZFP189 TFs of our own design to Drd1+ or Drd2+ MSNs. These synthetic ZFP189 TFs are capable of directly activating (ZFP189VPR) or repressing (ZFP189WT) brain TEs2. We discover that behavioral and cell morphological adaptations to cocaine are produced by activating TEs with ZFP189VPR in Drd1+ MSNs or stabilizing TEs with ZFP189WT in Drd2+ MSNs, revealing a persistent opponent process balanced across MSN subtypes and weighted by TE stability and consequent gene expression within MSN subtype. We next performed snRNAseq of the whole NAc virally manipulated with ZFP189 TFs. We observed that, relative to ZFP189WT, NAc manipulated with ZFP189VPR impeded cocaine-induced gene expression in NAc cell-types, including both Drd1+ and Drd2+ MSNs. Within either MSN subtype, the consequence of normal ZFP189 function was to enhance immune-related gene expression, and ZFP189VPR impeded these gene expression profiles. We finally performed cocaine intravenous self-administration to determine the consequence of NAc ZFP189-mediated transcriptional control on cocaine use behaviors. We observed that ZFP189VPR impeded any increases in active lever responses following a period forced cocaine abstinence. This research demonstrates that KZFP-mediated transcriptional repression of TEs within NAc MSNs is a causal molecular step in enabling gene expression and subsequent cellular and behavioral responses to cocaine use, and the use of ZFP189VPR in this work demonstrates cell-type specific mechanistic strategies to block CUD-related brain adaptations, which may inform future CUD treatments.

">Individual Differences in Cognition and Perception Predict Neural Processing of Speech in Noise for Audiometrically Normal Listeners.</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with normal hearing exhibit considerable variability in their capacity to understand speech in noisy environments. Previous research suggests the cause of this variance may be due to individual differences in cognition and auditory perception. To investigate the impact of cognitive and perceptual differences on speech comprehension, 25 adult human participants with normal hearing completed numerous cognitive and psychoacoustic tasks including the Flanker, Stroop, Trail Making, Reading Span, and temporal fine structure (TFS) tests. They also completed a continuous multi-talker spatial attention task while neural activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). The auditory cortical N1 response was extracted as a measure of neural speech encoding during continuous speech listening using an engineered "chirped-speech" (Cheech) stimulus. We compared N1 component morphologies of target and masker speech stimuli to assess neural correlates of attentional gains while listening to concurrently played short story narratives. Performance on cognitive and psychoacoustic tasks were used to predict N1 component amplitude differences between attended and unattended speech using multiple regression. Results show inhibitory control and working memory abilities can predict N1 amplitude differences between the target and masker stories. Interestingly, none of the cognitive and psychoacoustic predictors correlated with behavioral speech-in-noise listening performance in the attention task, suggesting that neural measures may be more sensitive measures of cognitive and auditory processing as compared to behavioral measures alone.

">Inflammatory pain in mice induces light cycle-dependent effects on sleep architecture</a></h4>

              
                As a syndrome, chronic pain comprises physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms such as disability, negative affect, feelings of stress, and fatigue. A rodent model of long-term inflammatory pain, induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection, has previously been shown to cause anhedonia and dysregulated naturalistic behaviors, in a manner similar to animal models of stress. We examined whether this extended to alterations in circadian rhythms and sleep, such as those induced by chronic social defeat stress, using actigraphy and wireless EEG. CFA-induced inflammatory pain profoundly altered sleep architecture in male and female mice. Injection of the hind paw, whether with CFA or saline, reduced some measures of circadian rhythmicity such as variance, period, and amplitude. CFA increased sleep duration primarily in the dark phase, while sleep bout length was decreased in the light and increased in the dark phase. Additionally, CFA reduced wake bout length, especially during the dark phase. Increases in REM and SWS duration and bouts were most significant in the dark phase, regardless of whether CFA had been injected at its onset or 12 hours prior. Taken together, these results indicate that inflammatory pain acutely promotes but also fragments sleep.

">Using in vivo calcium imaging and home cage behavioural analysis to study pain in mouse models of rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of in vivo calcium imaging to monitor activity in joint afferents and group-housed home cage monitoring for the assessment of pain-like behaviors in mouse models of rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis. Methods: Antigen induced arthritis (AIA) was used to model rheumatoid arthritis and partial medial meniscectomy (PMX) was used to model osteoarthritis. Group-housed home cage monitoring was used to assess behaviour in all mice, and weight bearing was performed in PMX mice. In vivo calcium with GCaMP6s was used to monitor spontaneous activity in L4 ganglion joint neurons retrogradely labelled with fast blue 2 days following AIA and 13-15 weeks following PMX. Cartilage degradation was assessed in knee joint sections stained with Safranin O and Fast Green in PMX mice. Results: Antigen induced arthritis produced knee joint swelling and PMX caused degeneration of articular cartilage in the knee. In the first 46 hours following AIA, mice travelled less distance and were less mobile compared to their control cage mates. In contrast, these parameters were similar between PMX and sham mice between 4-12 weeks post-surgery. Joint neurons had increased spontaneous activity in AIA but not PMX mice. Spontaneous activity was mostly localized to medium-sized neurons in AIA mice and was not correlated with any of the home cage behaviors. Conclusion: We conclude that group-housed home cage monitoring is a suitable technique for assessing joint pain behaviour in AIA mice. In vivo imaging of joint afferents revealed increased spontaneous activity in AIA but not PMX mice.

">Dissociation of putative open loop circuit from ventral putamen to motor cortical areas in humans I: high-resolution connectomics</a></h4>

              
                Human movement is partly organized and executed by cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic closed-loop circuits (CLCs), wherein motor cortical areas both send inputs to and receive feedback from the basal ganglia, particularly the dorsal putamen (PUTd). These networks are compromised in Parkinson's disease (PD) due to neurodegeneration of dopaminergic inputs primarily to PUTd. Yet, fluid movement in PD can sporadically occur, especially when induced by emotionally arousing events. Rabies virus tracing in non-human primates has identified a potential alternative motor pathway, wherein the ventral putamen (PUTv) receives inputs from subcortical limbic areas (such as amygdala nuclei) and sends outputs to motor cortical areas putatively via the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). We hypothesize that this separable open loop circuit (OLC) may exist in humans and explain the preservation of movement after CLC degradation. Here, we provide evidence for the normal human OLC with ultra-high field (7T), multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging. We acquired resting-state functional connectivity (FC) scans from 21 healthy adults (avg. age = 29, 12M/9F, all right-handed) and mapped left-hemisphere seed-to-voxel connectivity to assess PUTv FC with putative subcortical nodes and motor cortical areas. We found that putative OLC node (basolateral amygdala, NBM) FC was greater with PUTv (p < 0.05), while CLC subcortical seed (ventrolateral nucleus of thalamus) FC was greater with PUTd (p < 0.01). Striatal FC patterns varied across cortical motor areas, with cingulate (p < 0.0001) and supplementary (p < 0.0001) motor areas showing greater FC with PUTv vs. nucleus accumbens. SMA had greater FC with PUTd vs. PUTv (p < 0.0001), while cingulate and primary motor areas showed no significant differences in FC between PUTd and PUTv (p > 0.1). Collectively, these results suggest that PUTv is functionally connected to motor cortical areas and may be integrated into a separable motor OLC with subcortical limbic inputs.

">Selective autophagy fine-tunes Stat92E activity by degrading Su(var)2-10/PIAS during glial injury signalling in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Glial immunity plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of nervous system homeostasis and responses to stress conditions, including neural injuries. In Drosophila melanogaster, the transcription factor Stat92E is activated in glial cells following central nervous system injury, independently of the canonical JAK/STAT pathway, to shape glial reactivity towards degenerated axons. However, the upstream regulatory mechanisms governing Stat92E activation remain elusive. Here, we reveal a selective autophagy-mediated regulation of Stat92E in glia by the degradation of the Stat92E repressor Su(var)2-10, a member of the PIAS SUMO ligase family. Atg8a, a core autophagy factor co-localizes and interacts with Su(var)2-10. Su(var)2-10 elimination is required for efficient Stat92E-dependent transcription after injury. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autophagy is essential for the upregulation of immune pathways, exemplified by virus-induced RNA 1 (vir-1), in glial cells following axon injury. We propose that Stat92E function is gated both by activating phosphorylation and autophagic Su(var)2-10 breakdown to licence glial reactivity. These findings underscore the critical role of autophagy in glial immunity and its potential impact on neural injury responses.

">Glutamate uptake is transiently compromised in the perilesional cortex following controlled cortical impact</a></h4>

              
                Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, is regulated by the excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) GLT-1 and GLAST. Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), extracellular glutamate levels increase, contributing to excitotoxicity, circuit dysfunction, and morbidity. Increased neuronal glutamate release and compromised astrocyte-mediated uptake contribute to elevated glutamate, but the mechanistic and spatiotemporal underpinnings of these changes are not well established. Using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI and iGluSnFR glutamate imaging, we quantified extracellular glutamate dynamics after injury. Three days post-injury, glutamate release was increased, and glutamate uptake and GLT-1 expression were reduced. 7- and 14-days post-injury, glutamate dynamics were comparable between sham and CCI animals. Changes in peak glutamate response were unique to specific cortical layers and proximity to injury. This was likely driven by increases in glutamate release, which was spatially heterogenous, rather than reduced uptake, which was spatially uniform. The astrocyte K+ channel, Kir4.1, regulates activity-dependent slowing of glutamate uptake. Surprisingly, Kir4.1 was unchanged after CCI and accordingly, activity-dependent slowing of glutamate uptake was unaltered. This dynamic glutamate dysregulation after TBI underscores a brief period in which disrupted glutamate uptake may contribute to dysfunction and highlights a potential therapeutic window to restore glutamate homeostasis.

">Region-specific Nucleus Accumbens Dopamine Signals Encode Distinct Aspects of Avoidance Learning</a></h4>

              
                Avoidance learning, learning to avoid bad outcomes, is an essential survival behavior. Dopamine signals are widely observed in response to aversive stimuli, indicating they could play a role in learning about how to avoid these stimuli. However, it is unclear what computations dopamine signals perform to support avoidance learning. Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity in dopamine responses to aversive stimuli has been observed across nucleus accumbens (NAc) subregions. To understand how heterogeneous dopamine responses to aversive stimuli contribute to avoidance learning, we recorded NAc core (Core) and NAc ventromedial shell (vmShell) dopamine during a task in which mice could avoid a footshock punishment by moving to the opposite side of a 2-chamber apparatus during a five-second warning cue. We found that NAc Core and vmShell dopamine signals responded oppositely during shocks and warning cues. Both signals evolved substantially, but differently, with learning. NAc vmShell dopamine responses to cues and shocks were present during early learning but not sustained during expert performance. NAc Core dopamine responses strengthen with learning and are especially evident during expert performance. Our data support a model in which NAc vmShell dopamine guides initial cue-shock associations by signaling salience, while NAc Core dopamine encodes prediction errors that guide the consolidation of avoidance learning.

                Cortical hyperexcitability is a key pathophysiological feature in several neurological disorders, including migraine, epilepsy, tinnitus, and Alzheimers disease. We examined the temporal characteristics of Evoked Related Potentials (ERPs) in a healthy population using the Pattern Glare Test, a diagnostic tool used to assess patients with sensitivity to cortical hyperexcitability. During the experiment, participants recorded state measures with this study focussing on susceptibility to migraine. We investigated two timeframes: habituation over the course of the experiment and sensitization over the course of stimulus presentation. We found evidence of hyperexcitability in the visual cortex, for the clinically aggravating stimuli (medium). Participants who reported a higher state measure exhibited a higher degree of habituation and sensitization, which was dependent on susceptibility to migraine. These findings suggest that the same experimental paradigm and analysis should be performed on a clinically diagnosed population.

">Handy divisions: Hand-specific specialization of prehensile control in bimanual tasks</a></h4>

              
                When hammering a nail, why do right-handers wield the hammer in the right hand? The dynamic dominance theory suggests a somewhat surprising answer. The two hands are specialized for different types of tasks: the dominant for manipulating objects, and the non-dominant for stabilizing objects. Right-handers wield the moving object with their right hand to leverage the skills of both hands. Functional specialization in hand use is often illustrated using examples of object manipulation. However, the dynamic dominance theory is supported by wrist kinematics rather than object manipulation data. Therefore, our goal was to determine whether this theory extends to object manipulation. We hypothesized that hand-specific differences will be evident in the kinematics of hand-held objects and in the control of grip forces. Right-handed individuals held two instrumented objects that were coupled by a spring. They moved one object while stabilizing the other object in various bimanual tasks. They performed motions of varying difficulty by tracking predictable or unpredictable targets. The two hands switched roles (stabilization vs movement) in various experimental blocks. The changing spring length perturbed both objects. We quantified the movement performance by measuring the object positions, and grip force control by measuring grip-load coupling in the moving hand and mean grip force in the stabilizing hand. The right hand produced more accurate object movement, along with stronger grip-load coupling, indicating superior predictive control of the right hand. In contrast, the left hand stabilized the object better and exerted a higher grip force, indicating superior impedance control of the left hand. Task difficulty had a weak effect on grip-load coupling during object movement and no effect on mean grip force during object stabilization. These results suggest that dynamic dominance extends to object manipulation, though the weak effect of task difficulty on grip characteristics warrants further investigation.

">Mouse olfactory system acts as anemo-detector and -discriminator</a></h4>

              
                Airflow detection while smelling is a fundamental requirement for olfaction, yet the mechanisms underlying such multimodal processing in the olfactory system remain unknown. We report here that mice can learn to accurately discriminate airflow with parallel processing of both mechanical and chemical stimuli revealed by modulated sniffing and refined calcium signaling in the olfactory bulb inhibitory network. Genetic perturbation of AMPAR function and optogenetic control bidirectionally shifted airflow discrimination learning pace, with contrasting phenotypes observed for odor learning, engagement of inhibitory circuits, and setting the optimal inhibition level for stimulus refinement. Multimodal odor-airflow stimuli at subthreshold levels enhanced learning, demonstrating that mechanical stimuli heighten olfactory perception. Our results, thus explain the multimodality of olfaction, and reveal an unexplored dimensionality of odor perception.

">Dopamine and temporal discounting: revisiting pharmacology and individual differences</a></h4>

              
                Disorders characterised by changes in dopamine (DA) neurotransmission are often linked to changes in the temporal discounting of future rewards. Likewise, pharmacological manipulations of DA neurotransmission in healthy individuals modulates temporal discounting, but there is considerable variability in the directionality of reported pharmacological effects, as enhancements and reductions of DA signalling have been linked to both increases and reductions of temporal discounting. This may be due to meaningful individual differences in drug effects and/or false positive findings in small samples. To resolve these inconsistencies, we 1) revisited pharmacological effects of the DA precursor L-DOPA on temporal discounting in a large sample of N = 76 healthy participants (n = 44 male) and 2) examined several putative proxy measures for DA to revisit the role of individual differences in a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled pre-registered study (https://osf.io/a4k9j/). Replicating previous findings, higher rewards were discounted less (magnitude effect). Computational modelling using hierarchical Bayesian estimation confirmed that the data in both drug conditions were best accounted for by a non-linear temporal discounting drift diffusion model. In line with recent animal and human work, L-DOPA reliably reduced the discount rate with a small effect size, challenging earlier findings in substantially smaller samples. We found no credible evidence for linear or quadratic effects of putative DA proxy measures on model parameters, calling into question the role of these measures in accounting for individual differences in DA drug effects.

">'Eye Know': Gaze reflects confidence in explicit predictions while relying on a distinct computational mechanism</a></h4>

              
                We learn by continuously forming associations to predict future events. This learning is manifested in both explicit decisions and implicit sensorimotor behaviors. Despite significant advances in understanding each of these learning systems, their computational interplay remains unclear. We explored the relationship between explicit predictions and oculomotor expectations during associative learning in virtual reality, across an exploratory and two additional pre-registered experiments (Total N = 115). Participants' explicit predictions about target location and their subsequent anticipatory gaze patterns both showed learning patterns. Moreover, gaze exhibited computational hallmarks of confidence in the explicit prediction, possibly reflecting an oculomotor confidence-like assessment. However, ocular and explicit learning also diverged significantly. Oculomotor learning exhibited reduced accuracy and metacognitive sensitivity relative to explicit responses. Oculomotor's computational learning mechanism was characterized by more exploratory behavior, increased rule changes, and reduced perseverance. These findings suggest complementary learning processes for explicit and oculomotor systems that enable adaptive behavior.

">Columnar cholinergic neurotransmission onto T5 cells of Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                A large variety of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), nicotinic and muscarinic, are expressed in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster. Nonetheless, how AChRs affect brain function remains poorly understood. T5 cells are the primary motion-sensing neurons in the OFF-motion pathway and receive visual input from four different columnar cholinergic neurons, Tm1, Tm2, Tm4 and Tm9. We reasoned that different postsynaptic AChRs might also contribute to T5 function. We demonstrate that the nicotinic nAChRalpha1, nAChRalpha4, nAChRalpha5 and nAChRalpha7 subunits localize on T5 dendrites. By targeting synaptic markers specifically to each cholinergic input neuron, we uncover a prevalence of the nAChRalpha5 in Tm1, Tm2 and Tm4 synapses and of nAChRalpha7 in Tm9 synapses on T5 dendrites. Knock-down of nAChRalpha4, nAChRalpha5, nAChRalpha7, and mAChR-B individually alters the optomotor response and reduces T5 directional selectivity. Our findings expose the complex molecular mechanisms underlying motion detection in T5 cells and offer a system to study AChRs in visual information processing.

">Synaptic connectome of a neurosecretory network in the Drosophila brain</a></h4>

              
                Hormones mediate inter-organ signaling which is crucial in orchestrating diverse behaviors and physiological processes including sleep and activity, feeding, growth, metabolism and reproduction. The pars intercerebralis and pars lateralis in insects represent major hubs which contain neurosecretory cells (NSC) that produce various hormones. To obtain insight into how hormonal signaling is regulated, we have characterized the synaptic connectome of NSC in the adult Drosophila brain. Identification of neurons providing inputs to multiple NSC subtypes implicates diuretic hormone 44-expressing NSC as a major coordinator of physiology and behavior. Surprisingly, despite most NSC having dendrites in the subesophageal zone (primary taste processing center), gustatory inputs to NSC are largely indirect. We also deciphered pathways via which diverse olfactory inputs are relayed to NSC. Further, our analyses revealed substantial inputs from descending neurons to NSC, suggesting that descending neurons regulate both endocrine and motor output to synchronize physiological changes with appropriate behaviors. In contrast to NSC inputs, synaptic output from NSC is sparse and mostly mediated by corazonin NSC. Therefore, we additionally determine putative paracrine interconnectivity between NSC subtypes and hormonal pathways from NSC to peripheral tissues by analyzing single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Our comprehensive characterization of the Drosophila neurosecretory network connectome provides a platform to understand complex hormonal networks and how they orchestrate animal behaviors and physiology.

">Age Dependent Integration of Cortical Progenitors Transplanted at the Adult CSF-Brain Interface</a></h4>

              
                There has been renewed interest in neural transplantation of cells and tissues for brain repair. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of transplanted neural precursor cells and in vitro grown organoids to mature and locally integrate into host brain neural circuitry. Much effort has focused on how the transplant behaves and functions after the procedure, but the extent to which the host brain can properly innervate the transplant, particularly in the context of aging, is largely unexplored. Here we report that transplantation of rat embryonic cortical precursor cells into the cerebrospinal fluid-subventricular zone (CSF-SVZ) of adult rat brains generates a brain-like tissue (BLT) at an ectopic site. This model allows for the measurement of long-range connectivity and cellular interactions between the transplant and the host brain as a function of host age. The transplanted precursor cells initially proliferate, then differentiate, and develop into mature BLTs, which receive supportive cellular components from the host including blood vessels, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. There was integration of the BLT into the host brain which occurred at all ages studied, suggesting that host age does not affect the maturation and integration of the transplant-derived BLT. Long-range axonal projections from the BLT into the host brain were robust throughout the different aged recipients. However, long-distance innervation originating from the host brain into the BLT significantly declined with age. This work demonstrates the feasibility and utility of integrating new neural tissue structures at ectopic sites into adult brain circuits to study host-transplant interactions.

">How Alzheimer's Abeta propagates and triggers tau pathology in intact neurons</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease begins with Abeta accumulation, progresses to tau aggregates and results in widespread neurodegeneration (1-3). Simultaneous propagation of Abeta aggregates from very limited to wide and distant brain regions is one of the outstanding events in the early stage. Here, we demonstrate that the neurovascular unit (4,5) comprising capillaries and pericytes, the machinery supplying oxygen and glucose to neurons, is also the machinery for propagating effector molecules that impose Alzheimer's pathologies on intact neurons. We discovered two distinct signaling cascades, one activated in capillary endothelial cells and the other in pericytes. At the origin of either cascade, we identified amylospheroid (ASPD) (6,7), a highly toxic 30-mer assembly of Abeta, and its sole target NKAalpha3 (8), a neuron-specific isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase (9,10) but present in endothelial cells and pericytes. In endothelial cells, ASPD binding to NKAalpha3 releases angiotensin II, which increases beta-secretase in intact neurons, causing a huge increase of AbetaSUB42 and resultant accumulation. In pericytes, ASPD binding to NKAalpha3 releases an unknown effector molecule that activates delta-secretase in intact neurons, further augmenting Abeta42 and producing pathogenic tau1-368 fragment. Thus, Abeta and tau pathologies are directly linked. Stopping the signaling cascades near the origin by inhibiting ASPD-NKAalpha3 interaction (8) may provide a new therapeutic approach.

">Postural demands modulate tactile perception in the lower limb in young and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Balance control requires constant integration of feedforward and feedback signals. In healthy aging, the quality of feedback signals decreases while feedforward control is upweighted; but it is unclear how tactile perception is modulated when balance control is challenged and how this interacts with age-related changes in sensorimotor processes. We therefore examined tactile perception in standing when confronted with different postural demands in young and older adults. To this end, we measured tactile sensitivity on the calf during sitting (baseline), standing on solid ground, and standing on unstable ground (foam). We also measured the center of pressure during standing using a force plate and calculated a 95% confidence ellipse area and the center of pressure length. Tactile sensitivity was assessed by fitting a psychometric function to verbal responses for detecting vibrotactile probes, calculating the detection threshold at 50% detection, and normalizing the two standing conditions to baseline. We examined the effect of age and postural demands on the center of pressure kinematics and detection thresholds. We found higher sway and poorer tactile sensitivity when standing on foam irrespective of age. The increase of postural demands seems to reduce the reliance on tactile feedback signals from the lower limbs in both young and older adults. Our results suggest that postural demands challenge healthy agers as young adults, probably leading to a down-weighting of tactile feedback processing.

">Does slow oscillation-spindle coupling contribute to sleep-dependent memory consolidation? A Bayesian meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                The active system consolidation theory suggests that information transfer between the hippocampus and cortex during sleep underlies memory consolidation. Neural oscillations during sleep, including the temporal coupling between slow oscillations (SO) and sleep spindles (SP), may play a mechanistic role in memory consolidation. However, differences in analytical approaches and the presence of physiological and behavioral moderators have led to inconsistent conclusions. This meta-analysis, comprising 23 studies and 297 effect sizes, focused on four standard phase-amplitude coupling measures including coupling phase, strength, percentage, and SP amplitude, and their relationship with memory retention. We developed a standardized approach to incorporate non-normal circular- linear correlations. We found strong evidence supporting that precise and strong SO-fast SP coupling in the frontal lobe predicts memory consolidation. The strength of this association is mediated by memory type, aging, and dynamic spatio-temporal features, including SP frequency and cortical topography. In conclusion, SO-SP coupling should be considered as a general physiological mechanism for memory consolidation.

">CDKL5's role in microtubule-based transport and cognitive function</a></h4>

              
                Cyclin-dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) is a serine-threonine kinase highly enriched in mammalian neurons. CDKL5 is located on the X-chromosome and its loss-of-function leads to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder called CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD). CDKL5 phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein MAP1S and regulates its binding to microtubules. How MAP1S phosphorylation affects microtubule function is not well understood. To address this question, we generated MAP1S phosphomutant mice, in which the CDKL5 phosphorylation sites S786 and S812 are mutated to Alanine (MAP1S S786/812A or MAP1S SA). Using a microtubule co-sedimentation assay, we showed that dynein binding to microtubules is severely reduced in CDKL5 knockout (KO) and MAP1S SA brains. Time-lapse imaging in primary neurons showed impaired dynein motility in both Cdkl5 KO and MAP1S SA. Dynein-driven cargo transport was affected in mutant neuron dendrites, including the delivery of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. We next studied tubulin tyrosination in Cdkl5 KO and MAP1S SA neurons and found that both mutants had a reduced tubulin tyrosination when compared to WT neurons. Since dynein-dynactin has a higher affinity for tyrosinated microtubules, we hypothesized that reduced tyrosination in MAP1S phosphomutant mice could be the mechanistic cause of impaired dynein motility. In support of this, we show that upon expression of tubulin tyrosine kinase TTL, we rescued dynein motility defects in MAP1S phosphomutant neurons. Hippocampal neurons derived from MAP1S SA mice revealed a significant reduction in spine density and synapses, and altered spine morphology. Finally, behavioral phenotyping of MAP1S phosphomutant mice showed increased anxiety, impaired motor performance, social and memory deficits, mirroring to some extent the clinical manifestations present in CDD patients. Our results reveal MAP1S phosphorylation to be an important contributor to dynein-mediated transport and synapse formation.

	<p>Background: Psychotic disorders are major psychiatric disorders that can impact multiple domains including physical, social, and psychological functioning within individuals with these conditions. Being able to better predict the outcomes of psychotic disorders will allow clinicians to identify illness subgroups and optimize treatment strategies in a timely manner. Objective: In this scoping review, we aimed to examine the accuracy of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in predicting the clinical outcomes of patients with psychotic disorders as well as determine the relevant predictors of these outcomes. Methods: This review was guided by the PRISMA Guidelines for Scoping Reviews. Seven electronic databases were searched for relevant published articles in English until 1 February 2024. Results: Thirty articles were included in this review. These studies were mainly conducted in the West (63%) and Asia (37%) and published within the last 5 years (83.3%). The clinical outcomes included symptomatic improvements, illness course, and social functioning. The machine learning models utilized data from various sources including clinical, cognitive, and biological variables such as genetic, neuroimaging measures. In terms of main machine learning models used, the most common approaches were support vector machine, random forest, logistic regression, and linear regression models. No specific machine learning approach outperformed the other approaches consistently across the studies, and an overall range of predictive accuracy was observed with an AUC from 0.58 to 0.95. Specific predictors of clinical outcomes included demographic characteristics (gender, socioeconomic status, accommodation, education, and employment); social factors (activity level and interpersonal relationships); illness features (number of relapses, duration of relapses, hospitalization rates, cognitive impairments, and negative and disorganization symptoms); treatment (prescription of first-generation antipsychotics, high antipsychotic doses, clozapine, use of electroconvulsive therapy, and presence of metabolic syndrome); and structural and functional neuroimaging abnormalities, especially involving the temporal and frontal brain regions. Conclusions: The current review highlights the potential and need to further refine AI and machine learning models in parsing out the complex interplay of specific variables that contribute to the clinical outcome prediction of psychotic disorders.</p>

	<p>Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is typically characterized by headaches and vision loss. However, neurocognitive deficits are also described. Our study aimed to test the influence of therapeutic lumbar puncture on the latter. Methods: A total of 15 patients with IIH were tested with a battery of neurocognitive tests at baseline and after therapeutic lumbar drainage. Hereby, Logical Memory of the Wechsler Memory Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Revised Edition (WMS-R), the California Verbal Learning Test Short Version (CVLT), alertness, selective attention, and word fluency were used. Changes in cognitive functioning in the course of CSF pressure lowering were analysed and compared with age, sex, and education-matched healthy controls. Results: Before intervention, scores of Logical Memory, the RWT, and the HADS-D were significantly lower in IIH patients compared to matched controls. After short-term normalization of CSF pressure, the RWT improved significantly. Additionally, significant positive correlations were found between headache intensity and subjective impairment, as well as between BMI and CSF opening pressure. Conclusion: Our findings confirm lower performance in terms of long-term verbal memory and word fluency compared to controls, as well as depressive symptoms in IIH patients. Significant improvement after short-term normalization of intracranial pressure by means of CSF drainage was seen only for word fluency. This indicates that short-term normalization of CSF pressure is not sufficient to normalize observed neurocognitive deficits.</p>

	<p>Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonists, such as betahistine (BHTE), have shown significant potential in treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders due to their neuroprotective properties. This study investigated BHTE&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neurotoxicity, which is associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Rats were divided into groups and pre-treated with BHTE (5 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) for 30 days, followed by LPS administration (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 4 consecutive days to induce neurotoxicity. LPS exposure resulted in cognitive impairment, as evidenced by performance deficits in maze tests, and a significant reduction in brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels. Additionally, LPS led to increased neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Pre-treatment with BHTE effectively counteracted these effects, improving cognitive performance and restoring ACh levels. BHTE significantly reduced LPS-induced increases in pro-inflammatory markers (COX-2, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, and IL-6) while enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-&amp;amp;beta;1). Furthermore, BHTE improved mitochondrial function by increasing enzyme levels (MRCC-I, II, and IV) and boosted anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and antioxidant defenses (GSH and catalase). BHTE also reduced apoptosis markers, including pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3, and oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA). Molecular modeling studies revealed that BHTE effectively binds to key enzymes involved in neuroinflammation and apoptosis (AChE, COX-2, and caspase-3), with binding free energies between 4 and 5 kcal/mol, interacting with critical residues. These findings underscore BHTE&amp;amp;rsquo;s multifaceted neuroprotective effects against LPS-induced neurotoxicity, offering potential therapeutic avenues for managing neuroinflammation and related neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

	<p>Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that modulates the noradrenergic activity of the locus coeruleus (LC). Yet, there is still uncertainty about the most effective stimulation and reliable outcome parameters. In a double blind, sham-controlled study including a sample of healthy young individuals (N = 29), we compared a shorter (3.4 s) and a longer (30 s) stimulation duration and investigated the effects of taVNS (real vs. sham) on saliva samples (alpha amylase and cortisol concentration), pupil (pupillary light reflex and pupil size at rest) and EEG data (alpha and theta activity at rest, ERPs for No-Go signals), and cognitive tasks (Go/No-Go and Stop Signal Tasks). Salivary alpha amylase concentration was significantly increased in the real as compared to sham stimulation for the 30 s stimulation condition. In the 3.4 s stimulation condition, we found prolonged reaction times and increased error rates in the Go/No-Go task and increased maximum acceleration in the pupillary light reflex. For the other outcomes, no significant differences were found. Our results show that prolonged stimulation increases salivary alpha-amylase, which was expected from the functional properties of the LC. The finding of longer response times to short taVNS stimulation was not expected and cannot be explained by an increase in LC activity. We also discuss the difficulties in assessing pupil size as an expression of taVNS-mediated LC functional changes.</p>

	<p>Selection history is widely accepted as a vital source in attention control. Reward history indicates that a learned association captures attention even when the reward is no longer presented, while statistical learning indicates that a learned probability exerts its influence on attentional control (facilitation or inhibition). Existing research has shown that the effects of the reward history and statistical learning are additive, suggesting that these two components influence attention priority through different pathways. In the current study, leveraging the temporal resolution advantages of EEG, we explored whether these two components represent independent sources of attentional bias. The results revealed faster responses to the target at the high-probability location compared to low-probability locations. Both the target and distractor at high-probability locations elicited larger early Pd (50&amp;amp;ndash;150 ms) and Pd (150&amp;amp;ndash;250 ms) components. The reward distractor slowed the target search and elicited a larger N2pc (180&amp;amp;ndash;350 ms). Further, no interaction between statistical learning and the reward history was observed in RTs or N2pc. The different types of temporal progression in attention control indicate that statistical learning and the reward history independently modulate the attention priority map.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Our team has previously introduced the Single-Step Pedicle Screw System (SSPSS), which eliminates the need for K-wires, as a safe and effective method for percutaneous minimally invasive spine (MIS) pedicle screw placement. Despite this, there are ongoing concerns about the reliability and accuracy of screw placement in MIS procedures without traditional tools like K-wires and Jamshidi needles. To address these concerns, we evaluated the accuracy of the SSPSS workflow by comparing the planned intraoperative screw trajectories with the final screw positions. Traditionally, screw placement accuracy has been assessed by grading the final screw position using postoperative CT scans. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent lumbar interbody fusion, using intraoperative 3D navigation for screw placement. The planned screw trajectories were saved in the navigation system during each procedure, and postoperative CT scans were used to evaluate the implanted screws. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the Gertzbein and Robbins classification scores of the planned trajectories and the final screw positions. Accuracy was defined as a final screw position matching the classification of the planned trajectory. (3) Results: Out of 206 screws, 196 (95%) were accurately placed, with no recorded complications. (4) Conclusions: The SSPSS workflow, even without K-wires and other traditional instruments, facilitates accurate and reliable pedicle screw placement.</p>

	<p>A two-factor account has been proposed as an explanatory model for the formation and maintenance of delusions. The first factor refers to a neurocognitive process leading to a significant change in subjective experience; the second factor has been regarded as a failure in hypothesis evaluation characterized by an impairment in metacognitive ability. This study was focused on the assessment of metacognition in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the study were to measure the overconfidence in metacognitive judgments through the prediction of word list recall and to analyze the correlation between basic neurocognition (memory and executive function) and metacognition through a metamemory test and the severity of psychotic symptoms. Method: Fifty-one participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were evaluated. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to assess the severity of psychiatric symptoms, and the subtest of metamemory included in the Executive Functions and Frontal Lobe-2 battery (BANFE-2) was used to evaluate overconfidence and underestimation errors, intrusion and perseverative response, total volume of recall, and Brief Functioning Assessment Scale (FAST) for social functioning. Results: The strongest correlation is observed between overconfidence errors and the positive factor of the PANSS (r = 0.774, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). For the enter model in the multiple linear regression (r = 0.78, r2 = 0.61; F = 24.57, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), the only significant predictor was overconfidence errors. Conclusion: Our results highlight the relevance of a metacognitive bias of overconfidence, strongly correlated with psychotic symptoms, and support the hypothesis that metacognitive defects contribute to the failure to reject contradictory evidence. From our perspective, these findings align with current mechanistic models of schizophrenia that focus on the role of the prefrontal cortex.</p>

                Background In recent years, the incidence of early-onset pancreatic cancer (EOPC) has increased. Several studies comparing the survival of patients with EOPC to those with average-onset pancreatic cancer (AOPC) have reported mixed results. We aimed, therefore, to perform a meta-analysis summarizing the current evidence. Methods We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for relevant articles published through March 2024. Articles comparing the survival of patients with EOPC – defined as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) diagnosed at ≤ 50 years of age – and AOPC were included in the present meta-analysis. The primary outcome was the pooled adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), and the risk of bias analysis was performed using the Quality in Prognostic Factor Studies tool. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Results A total of 17 studies were eligible for the primary analysis, the results of which indicated that patients with EOPC had a longer overall survival than those with AOPC (aHR = 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74–0.86; P < 0.001). The rate of distant metastasis was higher in EOPC than AOPC; however, patients with EOPC also received more treatments than those with AOPC. Conclusions Patients with EOPC had a better prognosis than those with AOPC. Clinicians must ensure that patients with PDAC receive early and appropriate treatment to improve their survival.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-975/v1?src=rss">Validating instructional practice scale for university instructors in Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Measurement is essential for methods of instruction to be successful. Having an instrument that is reliable and validated in the given setting is vital. The primary goal of this research project is to validate the instructional practice scale (IPS) for university instructors in the Ethiopian context. Methods By implementing a cross-sectional descriptive survey research design, 1,254 participants across four public universities – Arbaminch, Dilla, Wachamo, and Jinka representing the first, second, third, and fourth generations, respectively were randomly selected and participated. The data was split in half and underwent an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results The three components of the EFA were alternately filled with seventeen items that satisfied certain standards, had a loading value of > .5, and a Cronbach alpha of ≥ .874. The factors identified in the EFA have been confirmed to be the thirteen items with loading, Cronbach alpha, Raykov’s rho coefficient (rho_A), composite reliability (CR) value of >.7, and Average Variance Explained (AVE) value of > .5. Tests of measurement and structural models showed a good fit. The Fornell-Larcker criterion, which is employed in discriminant validity analysis, demonstrates that the square root of the AVE for each construct is higher than the correlation it exhibits with other constructs. The correlations’ heterotrait–monotrait (HTMT) ratio is getting close to zero, and there isn’t one in the confidence interval at the.05 significance level. Both guaranteed strong discriminant validity. Conclusion For university instructors, the 13 items generally have powerful psychometric properties. The three subsections of the instruction practice scale—planning (4 indicators), delivering (4 indicators), and assessment (5 indicators) — are meant to measure the instructional practice effectively. Implications of the findings were further discussed.

                <p>Sensory axons projecting to the central nervous system are organized into topographic maps that represent the locations of sensory stimuli. In some sensory systems, even adjacent sensory axons are arranged topographically, forming "fine-scale" topographic maps. Although several broad molecular gradients are known to instruct coarse topography, we know little about the molecular signaling that regulates fine-scale topography at the level of two adjacent axons. Here, we provide evidence that transsynaptic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling mediates local interneuronal communication to regulate fine-scale topography in the nociceptive system of <I>Drosophila</I> larvae. We first show that the topographic separation of the axon terminals of adjacent nociceptors requires their common postsynaptic target, the A08n neurons. This phenotype is recapitulated by knockdown of the BMP ligand, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), in these neurons. In addition, removing the Type 2 BMP receptors or their effector (Mad transcription factor) in single nociceptors impairs the fine-scale topography, suggesting the contribution of BMP signaling originated from A08n. This signaling is likely mediated by phospho-Mad in the presynaptic terminals of nociceptors to ensure local interneuronal communication. Finally, reducing Dpp levels in A08n reduces the nociceptor-A08n synaptic contacts. Our data support that transsynaptic BMP signaling establishes the fine-scale topography by facilitating the formation of topographically correct synapses. Local BMP signaling for synapse formation may be a developmental strategy that independently regulates neighboring axon terminals for fine-scale topography.</p>

                <p>Animal studies consistently demonstrate that testosterone is protective against pain in multiple models, including an animal model of activity-induced muscle pain. In this model, females develop widespread muscle hyperalgesia, and reducing testosterone levels in males results in widespread muscle hyperalgesia. Widespread pain is believed to be mediated by changes in the central nervous system, including the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). The enzyme that converts testosterone to estradiol, aromatase, is highly expressed in the RVM. Therefore, we hypothesized that testosterone is converted by aromatase to estradiol locally in the RVM to prevent development of widespread muscle hyperalgesia in male mice. This was tested through pharmacological inhibition of estrogen receptors (ERs), aromatase, or ER-&alpha; in the RVM which resulted in contralateral hyperalgesia in male mice (C57BL/6J). ER inhibition in the RVM had no effect on hyperalgesia in female mice. As prior studies show modulation of estradiol signaling alters GABA receptor and transporter expression, we examined if removal of testosterone in males would decrease mRNA expression of GABA receptor subunits and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). However, there were no differences in mRNA expression of GABA receptor subunits of VGAT between gonadectomized and sham control males. Lastly, we used RNAscope to determine expression of ER-&alpha; in the RVM and show expression in inhibitory (VGAT+), serotonergic (tryptophan hydroxylase 2+), and &mu;-opioid receptor expressing (MOR+) cells. In conclusion, testosterone protects males from development of widespread hyperalgesia through aromatization to estradiol and activation of ER-&alpha; which is widely expressed in multiple cell types in the RVM.</p>

                <p>Comorbid chronic neuropathic pain and anxiety is a common disease that represents a major clinical challenge. The underlying mechanisms of chronic neuropathic pain and anxiety are not entirely understood, which limits the exploration of effective treatment methods. Glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) have been implicated in regulating pain, but the potential roles of the vlPAG in neuropathic pain-induced anxiety have not been investigated. Herein, whole-cell recording and immunofluorescence showed that the excitability of CamkII&alpha; neurons in the vlPAG (vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons) was decreased in mice with spared nerve injury (SNI), while electroacupuncture (EA) activated these neurons. We also showed that chemogenetic inhibition of vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons resulted in allodynia and anxiety-like behaviors in naive mice. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons reduced anxiety-like behaviors and allodynia in mice with SNI, and EA had a similar effect in alleviating these symptoms. Nevertheless, EA combined with chemogenetic activation failed to further relieve allodynia and anxiety-like behaviors. Artificial inhibition of vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons abolished the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of EA. Overall, our study reveals a novel mechanism of neuropathic pain-induced anxiety and shows that EA may relieve comorbid chronic neuropathic pain and anxiety by activating vlPAG<sup>CamkII&alpha;+</sup> neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/8/ENEURO.0481-23.2024?rss=1">A Method for Evaluating Hunger and Thirst in Monkeys by Measuring Blood Ghrelin and Osmolality Levels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hunger and thirst drive animals&rsquo; consumption behavior and regulate their decision-making concerning rewards. We previously assessed the thirst states of monkeys by measuring blood osmolality under controlled water access and examined how these thirst states influenced their risk-taking behavior in decisions involving fluid rewards. However, hunger assessment in monkeys remains poorly performed. Moreover, the lack of precise measures for hunger states leads to another issue regarding how hunger and thirst states interact with each other in each individual. Thus, when controlling food access to motivate performance, it remains unclear how these two physiological needs are satisfied in captive monkeys. Here, we measured blood ghrelin and osmolality levels to respectively assess hunger and thirst in four captive macaques. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we identified that the levels of blood ghrelin, a widely measured hunger-related peptide hormone in humans, were high after 20&nbsp;h of no food access (with <I>ad libitum</I> water). This reflects a typical controlled food access condition. One hour after consuming a regular dry meal, the blood ghrelin levels in three out of four monkeys decreased to within their baseline range. Additionally, blood osmolality measured from the same blood sample, the standard hematological index of hydration status, increased after consuming the regular dry meal with no water access. Thus, ghrelin and osmolality may reflect the physiological states of individual monkeys regarding hunger and thirst, suggesting that these indices can be used as tools for monitoring hunger and thirst levels that mediate an animal's decision to consume rewards.</p>

                <p>Recent advances in extracellular electrophysiology now facilitate the recording of spikes from hundreds or thousands of neurons simultaneously. This has necessitated both the development of new computational methods for spike sorting and better methods to determine spike-sorting accuracy. One long-standing method of assessing the false discovery rate (FDR) of spike sorting&mdash;the rate at which spikes are assigned to the wrong cluster&mdash;has been the rate of interspike interval (ISI) violations. Despite their near ubiquitous usage in spike sorting, our understanding of how exactly ISI violations relate to FDR, as well as best practices for using ISI violations as a quality metric, remains limited. Here, we describe an analytical solution that can be used to predict FDR from the ISI violation rate (ISI<SUB>v</SUB>). We test this model in silico through Monte Carlo simulation and apply it to publicly available spike-sorted electrophysiology datasets. We find that the relationship between ISI<SUB>v</SUB> and FDR is highly nonlinear, with additional dependencies on firing frequency, the correlation in activity between neurons, and contaminant neuron count. Predicted median FDRs in public datasets recorded in mice were found to range from 3.1 to 50.0%. We found that stochasticity in the occurrence of ISI violations as well as uncertainty in cluster-specific parameters make it difficult to predict FDR for single clusters with high confidence but that FDR can be estimated accurately across a population of clusters. Our findings will help the growing community of researchers using extracellular electrophysiology assess spike-sorting accuracy in a principled manner.</p>

                <p><I>ATP1A3</I> is a Na,K-ATPase gene expressed specifically in neurons in the brain. Human mutations are dominant and produce an unusually wide spectrum of neurological phenotypes, most notably rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism (RDP) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). Here we compared heterozygotes of two mouse lines, a line with little or no expression (<I>Atp1a</I>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup>) and a knock-in expressing p.Asp801Tyr (D801Y, <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup>). Both mouse lines had normal lifespans, but <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> had mild perinatal mortality contrasting with D801N mice (<I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801N</sup>), which had high mortality. The phenotypes of <I>Atp1a</I>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup> and <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> were different, and testing of each strain was tailored to its symptom range. <I>Atp1a</I>3<sup>tm1Ling/+</sup> mice displayed little at baseline, but repeated ethanol intoxication produced hyperkinetic motor abnormalities not seen in littermate controls. <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice displayed robust phenotypes: hyperactivity, diminished posture consistent with hypotonia, and deficiencies in beam walk and wire hang tests. Symptoms also included qualitative motor abnormalities that are not well quantified by conventional tests. Paradoxically, <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> showed sustained better performance than wild type on the accelerating rotarod. <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice were overactive in forced swimming and afterward had intense shivering, transient dystonic postures, and delayed recovery. Remarkably, <I>Atp1a3</I><sup>+/D801Y</sup> mice were refractory to ketamine anesthesia, which elicited hyperactivity and dyskinesia even at higher dose. Neither mouse line exhibited fixed dystonia (typical of RDP patients), spontaneous paroxysmal weakness (typical of AHC patients), or seizures but had consistent, measurable neurological abnormalities. A gradient of variation supports the importance of studying multiple <I>Atp1a3</I> mutations in animal models to understand the roles of this gene in human disease.</p>

                <p>Long-term aluminum (Al) exposure increases the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of the present study was to investigate the neural mechanisms of Al-induced MCI. In our study, a total of 52 individuals with occupational Al exposure &gt;10&nbsp;years were enrolled and divided into two groups: MCI (Al-MCI) and healthy controls (Al-HC). Plasma Al concentrations and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score were collected for all participants. And diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to examine changes of white matter (WM) and functional connectivity (FC). There was a negative correlation between MoCA score and plasma Al concentration. Compared with the Al-HC, fractional anisotropy value for the right fornix (cres)/stria terminalis (FX/ST) was higher in the Al-MCI. Furthermore, there was a difference in FC between participants with and without MCI under Al exposure. We defined the regions with differing FC as a "pathway," specifically the connectivity from the right temporal pole to the right FX/ST, then to the right sagittal stratum, and further to the right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri and right inferior frontal gyrus, orbital part. In summary, we believe that the observed differences in WM integrity and FC in the right FX/ST between participants with and without MCI under long-term Al exposure may represent the neural mechanisms underlying MCI induced by Al exposure.</p>

                <p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key cortical region for pain perception and emotion. Different forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), have been reported in the ACC. Synaptic tagging of LTP plays an important role in hippocampus-related associative memory. In this study, we demonstrate that synaptic tagging of LTD is detected in the ACC of adult male and female mice. This form of tagged LTD requires the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1). The induction of tagged LTD is time-related with the strongest tagged LTD appearing when the interval between two independent stimuli is 30&nbsp;min. Inhibitors of mGluR1 blocked the induction of tagged LTD; however, blocking N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors did not affect the induction of tagged LTD. Nimodipine, an inhibitor of L-type voltage&ndash;gated calcium channels, also blocked tagged LTD. In an animal model of amputation, we found that tagged LTD was either reduced or completely blocked. Together with our previous report of tagged LTP in the ACC, this study strongly suggests that excitatory synapses in the adult ACC are highly plastic. The biphasic tagging of synaptic transmission provides a new form of heterosynaptic plasticity in the ACC which has functional and pathophysiological significance in phantom pain.</p>

                <p>Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) is generally considered to be a proxy for phasic firing of the ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA<SUB>DA</SUB>) neurons. Thus, dopamine release in NAcC is hypothesized to reflect a unitary role in reward prediction error signaling. However, recent studies reveal more diverse roles of dopamine neurons, which support an emerging idea that dopamine regulates learning differently in distinct circuits. To understand whether the NAcC might regulate a unique component of learning, we recorded dopamine release in NAcC while male rats performed a backward conditioning task where a reward is followed by a neutral cue. We used this task because we can delineate different components of learning, which include sensory-specific inhibitory and general excitatory components. Furthermore, we have shown that VTA<SUB>DA</SUB> neurons are necessary for both the specific and general components of backward associations. Here, we found that dopamine release in NAcC increased to the reward across learning while reducing to the cue that followed as it became more expected. This mirrors the dopamine prediction error signal seen during forward conditioning and cannot be accounted for temporal-difference reinforcement learning. Subsequent tests allowed us to dissociate these learning components and revealed that dopamine release in NAcC reflects the general excitatory component of backward associations, but not their sensory-specific component. These results emphasize the importance of examining distinct functions of different dopamine projections in reinforcement learning.</p>

                <p>In retinitis pigmentosa (RP), rod and cone photoreceptors degenerate, depriving downstream neurons of light-sensitive input, leading to vision impairment or blindness. Although downstream neurons survive, some undergo morphological and physiological remodeling. Bipolar cells (BCs) link photoreceptors, which sense light, to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which send information to the brain. While photoreceptor loss disrupts input synapses to BCs, whether BC output synapses remodel has remained unknown. Here we report that synaptic output from BCs plummets in RP mouse models of both sexes owing to loss of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Remodeling reduces the reliability of synaptic output to repeated optogenetic stimuli, causing RGC firing to fail at high-stimulus frequencies. Fortunately, functional remodeling of BCs can be reversed by inhibiting the retinoic acid receptor (RAR). RAR inhibitors targeted to BCs present a new therapeutic opportunity for mitigating detrimental effects of remodeling on signals initiated either by surviving photoreceptors or by vision-restoring tools.</p>

                <p>TFEB and TFE3 (TFEB/3), key regulators of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, play diverse roles depending on cell type. This study highlights a hitherto unrecognized role of TFEB/3 crucial for peripheral nerve repair. Specifically, they promote the generation of progenitor-like repair Schwann cells after axonal injury. In Schwann cell-specific TFEB/3 double knock-out mice of either sex, the TFEB/3 loss disrupts the transcriptomic reprogramming that is essential for the formation of repair Schwann cells. Consequently, mutant mice fail to populate the injured nerve with repair Schwann cells and exhibit defects in axon regrowth, target reinnervation, and functional recovery. TFEB/3 deficiency inhibits the expression of injury-responsive repair Schwann cell genes, despite the continued expression of c<I>-jun</I>, a previously identified regulator of repair Schwann cell function. TFEB/3 binding motifs are enriched in the enhancer regions of injury-responsive genes, suggesting their role in repair gene activation. Autophagy-dependent myelin breakdown is not impaired despite TFEB/3 deficiency. These findings underscore a unique role of TFEB/3 in adult Schwann cells that is required for proper peripheral nerve regeneration.</p>

                <p>The ventral frontal cortex (VFC) in macaques is involved in many affective and cognitive processes and has a key role in flexibly guiding reward-based decision-making. VFC is composed of a set of anatomically distinct subdivisions that are within the orbitofrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior insula. In part, because prior studies have lacked the resolution to test for differences, it is unclear if neural representations related to decision-making are dissociable across these subdivisions. Here we recorded the activity of thousands of neurons within eight anatomically defined subdivisions of VFC in male macaque monkeys performing a two-choice probabilistic task for different fruit juice outcomes. We found substantial variation in the encoding of decision variables across these eight subdivisions. Notably, ventrolateral Area 12l was unique relative to the other areas that we recorded from as the activity of single neurons integrated multiple attributes when monkeys evaluated the different choice options. Activity within Area 12o, in contrast, more closely represented reward probability and whether reward was received on a given trial. Orbitofrontal Area 11m/l contained more specific representations of the quality of the outcome that could be earned later on. We also found that reward delivery encoding was highly distributed across all VFC subdivisions, while the properties of the reward, such as its flavor, were more strongly represented in Areas 11m/l and 13m. Taken together, our work reveals the diversity of encoding within the various anatomically distinct subdivisions of VFC in primates.</p>

                <p>Mitochondrial population maintenance in neurons is essential for neuron function and survival. Contact sites between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are poised to regulate mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons. These contact sites can facilitate transfer of calcium and lipids between the organelles and have been shown to regulate aspects of mitochondrial dynamics. Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VapB) is an ER membrane protein present at a subset of ER&ndash;mitochondrial contact sites. A proline-to-serine mutation in VapB at amino acid 56 (P56S) correlates with susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) type 8. Given the relationship between failed mitochondrial health and neurodegenerative disease, we investigated the function of VapB in mitochondrial population maintenance. We demonstrated that transgenic expression of VapB<sup>P56S</sup> in zebrafish larvae (sex undetermined) increased mitochondrial biogenesis, causing increased mitochondrial population size in the axon terminal. Expression of wild-type VapB did not alter biogenesis but, instead, increased mitophagy in the axon terminal. Using genetic manipulations to independently increase mitochondrial biogenesis, we show that biogenesis is normally balanced by mitophagy to maintain a constant mitochondrial population size. VapB<sup>P56S</sup> transgenics fail to increase mitophagy to compensate for the increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, suggesting an impaired mitophagic response. Finally, using a synthetic ER&ndash;mitochondrial tether, we show that VapB's function in mitochondrial turnover is likely independent of ER&ndash;mitochondrial tethering by contact sites. Our findings demonstrate that VapB can control mitochondrial turnover in the axon terminal, and this function is altered by the P56S ALS-linked mutation.</p>

                <p>The cerebral cortex contains multiple, distinct areas that individually perform specific computations. A particular strength of the cortex is the communication of signals between cortical areas that allows the outputs of these compartmentalized computations to influence and build on each other, thereby dramatically increasing the processing power of the cortex and its role in sensation, action, and cognition. Determining how the cortex communicates signals between individual areas is, therefore, critical for understanding cortical function. Historically, corticocortical communication was thought to occur exclusively by direct anatomical connections between areas that often sequentially linked cortical areas in a hierarchical fashion. More recently, anatomical, physiological, and behavioral evidence is accumulating indicating a role for the higher-order thalamus in corticocortical communication. Specifically, the transthalamic pathway involves projections from one area of the cortex to neurons in the higher-order thalamus that, in turn, project to another area of the cortex. Here, we consider the evidence for and implications of having two routes for corticocortical communication with an emphasis on unique processing available in the transthalamic pathway and the consequences of disorders and diseases that affect transthalamic communication.</p>

                <p>Infection causes reduced activity, anorexia, and sleep, which are components of the phylogenetically conserved but poorly understood sickness behavior. We developed a <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> model to study quiescence during chronic infection, using infection with the Orsay virus. The Orsay virus infects intestinal cells yet strongly affects behavior, indicating gut-to-nervous system communication. Infection quiescence has the sleep properties of reduced responsiveness and rapid reversibility. Both the ALA and RIS neurons regulate virus-induced quiescence though ALA plays a more prominent role. Quiescence-defective animals have decreased survival when infected, indicating a benefit of quiescence during chronic infectious disease. The survival benefit of quiescence is not explained by a difference in viral load, indicating that it improves resilience rather than resistance to infection. Orsay infection is associated with a decrease in ATP levels, and this decrease is more severe in quiescence-defective animals. We propose that quiescence preserves energetic resources by reducing energy expenditures and/or by increasing extraction of energy from nutrients. This model presents an opportunity to explore the role of sleep and fatigue in chronic infectious illness.</p>

                <p>The fluid movement of an arm requires multiple spatiotemporal parameters to be set independently. Recent studies have argued that arm movements are generated by the collective dynamics of neurons in motor cortex. An untested prediction of this hypothesis is that independent parameters of movement must map to independent components of the neural dynamics. Using a task where three male monkeys made a sequence of reaching movements to randomly placed targets, we show that the spatial and temporal parameters of arm movements are independently encoded in the low-dimensional trajectories of population activity in motor cortex: each movement&rsquo;s direction corresponds to a fixed neural trajectory through neural state space and its speed to how quickly that trajectory is traversed. Recurrent neural network models show that this coding allows independent control over the spatial and temporal parameters of movement by separate network parameters. Our results support a key prediction of the dynamical systems view of motor cortex, and also argue that not all parameters of movement are defined by different trajectories of population activity.</p>

                <p>Protein synthesis in response to neuronal activity, known as activity-dependent translation, is critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. However, the signaling cascades that couple neuronal activity to the translational events remain elusive. In this study, we identified the role of calmodulin (CaM), a conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein, in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis in neurons. We found the CaM-regulated rRNA synthesis is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and necessary for nascent protein synthesis and axon growth in hippocampal neurons. Mechanistically, CaM interacts with nucleolar DEAD (Asp&ndash;Glu&ndash;Ala&ndash;Asp) box RNA helicase (DDX21) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner to regulate nascent rRNA transcription within nucleoli. We further found CaM alters the conformation of DDX21 to liberate the DDX21-sequestered RPA194, the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase I, to facilitate transcription of ribosomal DNA. Using high-throughput screening, we identified the small molecules batefenterol and indacaterol that attenuate the CaM-DDX21 interaction and suppress nascent rRNA synthesis and axon growth in hippocampal neurons. These results unveiled the previously unrecognized role of CaM as a messenger to link the activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to the nucleolar events essential for protein synthesis. We thus identified the ability of CaM to transmit information to the nucleoli of neurons in response to stimulation.</p>

                <p>Sleep control depends on a delicate interplay among brain regions. This generates a complex temporal architecture with numerous sleep-stage transitions and intermittent fluctuations to micro-states and brief arousals. These temporal dynamics exhibit hallmarks of criticality, suggesting that tuning to criticality is essential for spontaneous sleep-stage and arousal transitions. However, how the brain maintains criticality remains not understood. Here, we investigate <I></I>- and <I></I>-burst dynamics during the sleep&ndash;wake cycle of rats (Sprague&ndash;Dawley, adult male) with lesion in the wake-promoting locus coeruleus (LC). We show that, in control rats, <I></I>- and <I></I>-bursts exhibit power-law (<I></I>-bursts, active phase) and exponential-like (<I></I>-bursts, quiescent phase) duration distributions, as well as power-law long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs)&mdash;typical of non-equilibrium systems self-organizing at criticality. Furthermore, consecutive <I></I>- and <I></I>-bursts durations are characterized by anti-correlated coupling, indicating a new class of self-organized criticality that emerges from underlying feedback between neuronal populations and brain areas involved in generating arousals and sleep states. In contrast, we uncover that LC lesion leads to alteration of <I></I>- and <I></I>-burst critical features, with change in duration distributions and correlation properties, and increase in <I></I>&ndash;<I></I> coupling. Notably, these LC-lesion effects are opposite to those observed for lesions in the sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) nucleus. Our findings indicate that critical dynamics of <I></I>- and <I></I>-bursts arise from a balanced interplay of LC and VLPO, which maintains brain tuning to criticality across the sleep&ndash;wake cycle&mdash;a non-equilibrium behavior in sleep micro-architecture at short timescales that coexists with large-scale sleep&ndash;wake homeostasis.</p>

                Objective This systematic literature review aimed to study the relationship between CML and hearing loss. Database review Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological malignancy associated with high levels of white blood cells (WBCs). Changes in otolaryngology are observed in CML. Methodology This systematic literature review of the literature was conducted by searching the MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, WPRIM, LILAC Sand SciELO databases. Studies published between 2013 and 2023 that met inclusion criteria were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist was used to evaluate the quality of studies. Results Of the 142 identified articles, 13 were included for final evaluation with a total sample size of 75 cases diagnosed with CML with hearing defect. CML patients with WBCs above 250 x 109/L were at higher risk of ototoxicity. Males accounted for 85% of cases; with a mean age of 38.9 years. Hearing loss as the first manifestation of CML was among 61.5% of cases, it was bilateral in 83.3% of cases, and in 90% of cases were irreversible defect. Conclusion Acute sudden hearing loss has been associated with high levels of WBC in patients with CML. Neither aggressive leukoreduction nor leukapheresis has positive effect on the reversibility of the hearing loss.

                Introduction Sexual dysfunctions are common yet underreported side effects of antipsychotics for schizophrenia, affecting 30-80% of treated individuals. These side effects can severely impact social interactions and treatment adherence for individuals with schizophrenia, but comprehensive comparative evidence assessing the risk profiles of different antipsychotics is lacking. This study aims to address this gap using network meta-analysis that integrates data from both randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS). Protocol This systematic review will include both RCTs and NRS focusing on participants with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses, without restrictions on symptoms, gender, ethnicity, age, or setting. For interventions, all second-generation antipsychotics will be included. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of at least one sexual adverse event of any kind. Secondary outcomes will be the occurrence of any sexual adverse event evaluated in men and women separately, and any adverse event related to the three phases of sexual response cycle separately: desire (e.g. libido, sexual thoughts), arousal (e.g. erection, lubrication) and orgasm (e.g. ejaculation, anorgasmia), and any adverse effect related to breast dysfunction and menstruation irregularities. Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 1 and ROBINS-I will be employed to evaluate the risk of bias for RCTs and NRS, respectively. Single-arm meta-analysis of proportions will synthesize the average frequency of sexual adverse events in treated participants. Pairwise and network meta-analysis of RCTs and NRS will be used to evaluate comparative tolerability. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will explore possible heterogeneity in results and validate the findings’ robustness. The quality of the evidence will be evaluated using GRADE. Discussion This study will provide vital insights into the sexual side effects of antipsychotics by combining evidence from clinical trials and real-world practice, facilitating better decision-making in choosing the optimal antipsychotic for individuals.

                <p>by Yicheng Tao, Fan Feng, Xin Luo, Conrad V. Reihsmann, Alexander L. Hopkirk, Jean-Philippe Cartailler, Marcela Brissova, Stephen C. J. Parker, Diane C. Saunders, Jie Liu</p>

Recent studies show that cellular neighborhoods play an important role in evolving biological events such as cancer and diabetes. Therefore, it is critical to accurately and efficiently identify cellular neighborhoods from spatially-resolved single-cell transcriptomic data or single-cell resolution tissue imaging data. In this work, we develop CNTools, a computational toolbox for end-to-end cellular neighborhood analysis on annotated cell images, comprising both the identification and analysis steps. It includes state-of-the-art cellular neighborhood identification methods and post-identification smoothing techniques, with our newly proposed Cellular Neighbor Embedding (CNE) method and Naive Smoothing technique, as well as several established downstream analysis approaches. We applied CNTools on three real-world CODEX datasets and evaluated identification methods with smoothing techniques quantitatively and qualitatively. It shows that CNE with Naive Smoothing overall outperformed other methods and revealed more convincing biological insights. We also provided suggestions on how to choose proper identification methods and smoothing techniques according to input data.

                Background Rhizomania counts as the most important disease in sugar beet Beta vulgaris L. for which no plant protection is available, leaving plant breeding as the only defence strategy at the moment. Five resistance genes have been detected on the same chromosome and further studies suggested that these might be different alleles at two resistance clusters. Nevertheless, it was postulated that rhizomania resistance might be a quantitative trait with multiple unknown minor resistance genes. Here, we present a first attempt at genomic prediction of rhizomania resistance in a population that carries resistances at the two known resistance clusters. The sugar beet population was genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Methods First, genomic prediction was performed using all SNPs. Next, we calculated the variable importance for each SNP using machine learning and performed genomic prediction by including the SNPs incrementally in the prediction model based on their variable importance. Using this method, we selected the optimal number of SNPs that maximised the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we performed genomic prediction with SNP pairs. We also performed feature selection with SNP pairs using the information about the variable importance of the single SNPs. Results From the four methods under investigation, the latter led to the highest prediction accuracy. These results lead to the conclusion that more than the two known resistance clusters are involved in rhizomania resistance and that genetic interactions affect rhizomania resistance. Finally, we have analysed which SNPs were repeatedly detected in the feature selection process and discovered four SNPs, two of which are located on chromosomes that were previously not associated with rhizomania resistance.

                Introduction Poweromin X Ten (PXT) is a polyherbal formulation, traditionally used to enhance male sexual function. However, the safety and benefits of PXT have not been scientifically evaluated. Therefore, the present study investigated the toxicity and aphrodisiac potential of PXT in male rats and explored its principal mechanisms of action. Methods Male Wistar rats were orally administered PXT (50 or 100 mg/kg) for 28 days, and sexual activity parameters, including latency and frequency of mounting and intromissions, were studied. The reproductive toxicity and spermatogenic potential were also examined. Furthermore, dopamine and serotonin levels in brain regions associated with sexual activity were assessed. Network analysis was used to identify the key bioactive compounds and their core targets involved in their beneficial actions. Results Treatment with PXT improved sexual activity in male rats, as evidenced by reduced mounting and intromission latency and a significant increase in mount frequency. Moreover, PXT exhibited spermatogenic potential and did not induce reproductive toxicity. Notably, treatment with 50 mg/kg PXT elevated dopamine levels in median preoptic area and hypothalamus. Pathway analysis indicated that PXT primarily modulated the PI3K-Akt, calcium, and MAPK signalling pathways to enhance male sexual function. Network analysis identified macelignan, β-estradiol, testosterone, and paniculatine as key bioactive components of PXT, which likely act through core targets, such as androgen receptor (AR), Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to facilitate the improvement of male sexual function. Conclusion Study results suggest that PXT is a safer alternative with aphrodisiac and spermatogenic potential. These effects are partly attributed to the enhanced dopamine levels in the brain. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the specific signalling pathways and bioactive compounds that underlie the improvements in male sexual function associated with PXT.

                Background Traditionally in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), centralised Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) have been set exclusively for Ebola virus disease (EVD) case management during outbreaks. During the 2020 EVD outbreak in DRC’s Equateur Province, existing health centres were equipped as decentralised treatment centres (DTC) to improve access for patients with suspected EVD. Between ETCs and DTCs, we compared the time from symptom onset to admission and diagnosis among patients with suspected EVD. Methods This was a cohort study based on analysis of a line-list containing demographic and clinical information of patients with suspected EVD admitted to any EVD health facility during the outbreak. Results Of 2359 patients with suspected EVD, 363 (15%) were first admitted to a DTC. Of 1996 EVD-suspected patients initially admitted to an ETC, 72 (4%) were confirmed as EVD-positive. Of 363 EVD-suspected patients initially admitted to a DTC, 6 (2%) were confirmed and managed as EVD-positive in the DTC. Among all EVD-suspected patients, the median (interquartile range) duration between symptom onset and admission was 2 (1-4) days in a DTC compared to 4 (2-7) days in an ETC (p<0.001). Similarly, time from symptom onset to admission was significantly shorter among EVD-suspected patients ultimately diagnosed as EVD-negative. Conclusions Since <5% of the EVD-suspected patients admitted were eventually diagnosed with EVD, there is a need for better screening to optimise resource utilization and outbreak control. Only one in seven EVD-suspected patients were admitted to a DTC first, as the DTCs were piloted in a limited and phased manner. However, there is a case to be made for considering decentralized care especially in remote and hard-to-reach areas in places like the DRC to facilitate early access to care, contain viral shedding by patients with EVD and ensure no disrupted provision of non-EVD services.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The transcriptional heterogeneity at a single-nucleus level in human Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) dystrophic muscle has not been explored. Here, we aimed to understand the transcriptional heterogeneity associated with myonuclei, as well as other mononucleated cell types that underly BMD pathogenesis by performing single-nucleus RNA sequencing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We profiled single-nucleus transcriptional profiles of skeletal muscle samples from 7 BMD patients and 3 normal controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 17,216 nuclei (12,879 from BMD patients and 4,337 from controls) were classified into 13 known cell types, including 9 myogenic lineages and 4 non-myogenic lineages, and 1 unclassified nuclear type according to their cell identities. Among them, type IIx myonuclei were the first to degenerate in response to dystrophin reduction. Differential expression analysis revealed that the fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) population had the largest transcriptional changes among all cell types. Sub-clustering analysis identified a significantly compositional increase in the activated FAPs (aFAPs) subpopulation in BMD muscles. Pseudotime analysis, regulon inference, and deconvolution analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data derived from 29 BMD patients revealed that the aFAPs subpopulation, a distinctive and previously unrecognized mononuclear subtype, was profibrogenic and expanded in BMD patients. Muscle quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the mRNA and protein levels of the aFAPs markers including <i>LUM</i>, <i>DCN</i>, and <i>COL1A1</i> in BMD patients were significantly higher than those in controls, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide insights into the transcriptional diversity of human BMD muscle at a single-nucleus resolution and new potential targets for anti-fibrosis therapies in BMD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27069?af=R">Mapping Functional Connectivity Signatures of Pharmacoresistant Focal Cortical Dysplasia‐Related Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine common network alterations in focal cortical dysplasia pharmacoresistant epilepsy (FCD-PRE) using functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective imaging cohort from Children's National Hospital (Washington, DC, USA) from January, 2011 to January, 2022. Patients with 3-T MRI-confirmed FCD-PRE underwent rsfMRI as part of routine clinical care. Patients were included if they were age 5–22 years at the time of the scan, and had a minimum of 18 months of follow-up. Healthy, typically-developing controls were included from Children's National Hospital (n = 16) and matched from Human Connectome Project-Development public dataset (n = 100).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 42 FCD-PRE patients (20 M:22 F, aged 14.2 ± 4.1 years) and 116 healthy controls (56 M:60 F, aged 13.7 ± 3.3 years) with rsfMRI were included. Seed-based functional connectivity maps were generated for each FCD, and each seed was used to generate a patient-specific z-scored connectivity map on 116 controls. FCD-PRE patients had mutual altered connectivity in regions of dorsal attention, default mode, and control networks. Functional connectivity was diminished within the FCD dominant functional network, as well as in homotopic regions. Cluster specific connectivity patterns varied by pathological subtype. Higher FCD connectivity to the limbic network was associated with increased odds of Engel I outcome.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study demonstrates diminished functional connectivity patterns in FCD-PRE, which may represent a neuromarker for the disease, independent of FCD location, involving the dorsal attention, default mode, and control functional networks. Higher connectivity to the limbic network is associated with a seizure-free outcome. Future multicenter, prospective studies are needed to allow for much earlier detection of signatures of treatment-resistant epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96534">Sex-dependent, lateralized engagement of anterior insular cortex inputs to the dorsolateral striatum in binge alcohol drinking</a></h4>

              
                How does alcohol consumption alter synaptic transmission across time, and do these alcohol-induced neuroadaptations occur similarly in both male and female mice? Previously we identified that anterior insular cortex (AIC) projections to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are uniquely sensitive to alcohol-induced neuroadaptations in male, but not female mice, and play a role in governing binge alcohol consumption in male mice (Haggerty et al., 2022). Here, by using high-resolution behavior data paired with in-vivo fiber photometry, we show how similar levels of alcohol intake are achieved via different behavioral strategies across sexes, and how inter-drinking session thirst states predict future alcohol intakes in females, but not males. Furthermore, we show how presynaptic calcium activity recorded from AIC synaptic inputs in the DLS across 3 weeks of water consumption followed by 3 weeks of binge alcohol consumption changes across, fluid, time, sex, and brain circuit lateralization. By time-locking presynaptic calcium activity from AIC inputs to the DLS to peri-initiation of drinking events we also show that AIC inputs into the left DLS robustly encode binge alcohol intake behaviors relative to water consumption. These findings suggest a fluid-, sex-, and lateralization-dependent role for the engagement of AIC inputs into the DLS that encode binge alcohol consumption behaviors and further contextualize alcohol-induced neuroadaptations at AIC inputs to the DLS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94438">Insights into metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer gained from fluorescence lifetime imaging</a></h4>

              
                Heterogeneity of tumor metabolism is an important, but still poorly understood aspect of tumor biology. Present work is focused on the visualization and quantification of cellular metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of redox cofactor NAD(P)H. FLIM-microscopy of NAD(P)H was performed in vitro in four cancer cell lines (HT29, HCT116, CaCo2 and CT26), in vivo in the four types of colorectal tumors in mice and ex vivo in patients’ tumor samples. The dispersion and bimodality of the decay parameters were evaluated to quantify the intercellular metabolic heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that patients’ colorectal tumors have significantly higher heterogeneity of energy metabolism compared with cultured cells and tumor xenografts, which was displayed as a wider and frequently bimodal distribution of a contribution of a free (glycolytic) fraction of NAD(P)H within a sample. Among patients’ tumors, the dispersion was larger in the high-grade and early stage ones, without, however, any association with bimodality. These results indicate that cell-level metabolic heterogeneity assessed from NAD(P)H FLIM has a potential to become a clinical prognostic factor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87634">Differential increase of hippocampal subfield volume after socio-affective mental training relates to reductions in diurnal cortisol</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a central modulator of the HPA-axis, impacting the regulation of stress on brain structure, function, and behavior. The current study assessed whether three different types of 3 months mental Training Modules geared towards nurturing (a) attention-based mindfulness, (b) socio-affective, or (c) socio-cognitive skills may impact hippocampal organization by reducing stress. We evaluated mental training-induced changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity, by combining longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis in 332 healthy adults. We related these changes to changes in diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. We observed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume (CA1-3) following the 3 months compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills (<i>Affect</i> module), as compared to socio-cognitive skills (<i>Perspective</i> module) or a waitlist cohort with no training intervention. Structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA1-3 when fostering socio-affective as compared to socio-cognitive skills. Furthermore, training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Notably, using a multivariate approach, we found that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. Overall, we provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioural intervention, changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93562">On the pH-dependence of α-synuclein amyloid polymorphism and the role of secondary nucleation in seed-based amyloid propagation</a></h4>

              
                The aggregation of the protein α-synuclein is closely associated with several neurodegenerative disorders and as such the structures of the amyloid fibril aggregates have high scientific and medical significance. However, there are dozens of unique atomic-resolution structures of these aggregates, and such a highly polymorphic nature of the α-synuclein fibrils hampers efforts in disease-relevant in vitro studies on α-synuclein amyloid aggregation. In order to better understand the factors that affect polymorph selection, we studied the structures of α-synuclein fibrils in vitro as a function of pH and buffer using cryo-EM helical reconstruction. We find that in the physiological range of pH 5.8–7.4, a pH-dependent selection between Type 1, 2, and 3 polymorphs occurs. Our results indicate that even in the presence of seeds, the polymorph selection during aggregation is highly dependent on the buffer conditions, attributed to the non-polymorph-specific nature of secondary nucleation. We also uncovered two new polymorphs that occur at pH 7.0 in phosphate-buffered saline. The first is a monofilament Type 1 fibril that highly resembles the structure of the juvenile-onset synucleinopathy polymorph found in patient-derived material. The second is a new Type 5 polymorph that resembles a polymorph that has been recently reported in a study that used diseased tissues to seed aggregation. Taken together, our results highlight the shallow amyloid energy hypersurface that can be altered by subtle changes in the environment, including the pH which is shown to play a major role in polymorph selection and in many cases appears to be the determining factor in seeded aggregation. The results also suggest the possibility of producing disease-relevant structure in vitro.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93978">Feedback inhibition by a descending GABAergic neuron regulates timing of escape behavior in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Escape behaviors help animals avoid harm from predators and other threats in the environment. Successful escape relies on integrating information from multiple stimulus modalities (of external or internal origin) to compute trajectories toward safe locations, choose between actions that satisfy competing motivations, and execute other strategies that ensure survival. To this end, escape behaviors must be adaptive. When a <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larva encounters a noxious stimulus, such as the focal pressure a parasitic wasp applies to the larval cuticle via its ovipositor, it initiates a characteristic escape response. The escape sequence consists of an initial abrupt bending, lateral rolling, and finally rapid crawling. Previous work has shown that the detection of noxious stimuli primarily relies on class IV multi-dendritic arborization neurons (Class IV neurons) located beneath the body wall, and more recent studies have identified several important components in the nociceptive neural circuitry involved in rolling. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie the rolling-escape sequence remain unclear. Here, we present both functional and anatomical evidence suggesting that bilateral descending neurons within the subesophageal zone of <i>D. melanogaster</i> larva play a crucial role in regulating the termination of rolling and subsequent transition to escape crawling. We demonstrate that these descending neurons (designated SeIN128) are inhibitory and receive inputs from a second-order interneuron upstream (Basin-2) and an ascending neuron downstream of Basin-2 (A00c). Together with optogenetic experiments showing that co-activation of SeIN128 neurons and Basin-2 influence the temporal dynamics of rolling, our findings collectively suggest that the ensemble of SeIN128, Basin-2, and A00c neurons forms a GABAergic feedback loop onto Basin-2, which inhibits rolling and thereby facilitates the shift to escape crawling.
