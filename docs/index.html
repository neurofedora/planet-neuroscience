	<p>Theatre-based practices, such as improvisation, are frequently applied to simulate everyday social interactions. Although the improvisational context is acknowledged as fictional, realistic emotions may emerge, a phenomenon labelled the ‘paradox of fiction’. This study investigated how manipulating the context (real-life versus fictional) modulates psychophysiological reactivity to social rejection during dyadic interactions. We measured psychophysiological responses elicited during real-life (interview) and fictional (improvisation exercises) social rejections. We analysed the heart rate (HR), skin conductance, facial muscle activity, and electrocortical activity (electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha asymmetry) of student teachers (N = 39) during various social rejections (devaluing, interrupting, nonverbal rejection). All social rejections evoked negative EEG alpha asymmetry, a measure reflecting behavioural withdrawal motivation. Psychophysiological responses during real-life and fictional rejections correlated, and rejection type modified the responses. When comparing responses across all rejection types, facial muscle activity and EEG alpha asymmetry did not differ between real-life and fictional rejections, whereas HR decelerated and skin conductance increased during fictional rejections. These findings demonstrate that regardless of cognitive awareness of fictionality, relatively subtle social rejections elicited psychophysiological reactivity indicating emotional arousal and negative valence. These findings provide novel, biological evidence for the application of theatre-based improvisation to studying experientially everyday social encounters.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Level of hM4D(Gi) DREADD Expression Determines Inhibitory and Neurotoxic Effects in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Selective neuromodulation using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) has become an increasingly important research tool, as well as an emerging therapeutic approach. However, the safety profile of DREADD expression is unknown. Here, different titers of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector were administered in an attempt to vary total expression levels of the inhibitory DREADD hM4D(Gi) in excitatory hippocampal neurons. Male Sprague Dawley rats were injected with AAV2/7 encoding DREADD-mCherry, DREADD, or mCherry. Pronounced neuronal loss and neuroinflammatory reactions were observed after transduction with the high titer DREADD AAV, which also resulted in the highest DREADD expression levels. No such effects were observed in the mCherry control group, despite an equally high titer, nor in conditions where lower viral vector titers were injected. In the high titer DREADD conditions, dentate gyrus (DG) evoked potentials were inhibited on clozapine-induced activation of hM4D(Gi), while in low titer conditions DG evoked potentials were enhanced. Recordings of single neuronal activity nevertheless indicated a reduction in spontaneous firing of granule cell layer neurons. Our results indicate that prolonged, high levels of DREADD expression can have neurotoxic effects and that chemogenetic suppression of excitatory hippocampal neurons can paradoxically enhance DG evoked potentials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Narrow and Broad {gamma} Bands Process Complementary Visual Information in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p> Band plays a key role in the encoding of visual features in the primary visual cortex (V1). In rodents V1 two ranges within the  band are sensitive to contrast: a broad  band (BB) increasing with contrast, and a narrow  band (NB), peaking at ~60 Hz, decreasing with contrast. The functional roles of the two bands and the neural circuits originating them are not completely clear yet. Here, we show, combining experimental and simulated data, that in mice V1 (1) BB carries information about high contrast and NB about low contrast; (2) BB modulation depends on excitatory-inhibitory interplay in the cortex, while NB modulation is because of entrainment to the thalamic drive. In awake mice presented with alternating gratings, NB power progressively decreased from low to intermediate levels of contrast where it reached a plateau. Conversely, BB power was constant across low levels of contrast, but it progressively increased from intermediate to high levels of contrast. Furthermore, BB response was stronger immediately after contrast reversal, while the opposite held for NB. These complementary modulations were reproduced by a recurrent excitatory-inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire network provided that the thalamic inputs were composed of a sustained and a periodic component having complementary sensitivity ranges. These results show that in rodents the thalamic-driven NB plays a specific key role in encoding visual contrast. Moreover, we propose a simple and effective network model of response to visual stimuli in rodents that might help in investigating network dysfunctions of pathologic visual information processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">An Automated Approach to Improve the Quantification of Pericytes and Microglia in Whole Mouse Brain Sections</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Whole slide scanning technology has enabled the generation of high-resolution images from complete tissue sections. However, commonly used analysis software is often unable to handle the large data files produced. Here, we present a method using the open-source software QuPath to detect, classify and quantify fluorescently-labeled cells (microglia and pericytes) in whole coronal brain tissue sections. Whole-brain sections from both male and female NG2DsRed x CX<SUB>3</SUB>CR1<sup>+/GFP</sup> mice were analyzed. Small regions of interest were selected and manual counts were compared with counts generated from an automated approach, across a range of detection parameters. The optimal parameters for detecting cells and classifying them as microglia or pericytes in each brain region were determined and applied to annotations corresponding to the entire somatosensory and motor cortices, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus in each section. 3.74% of all detected cells were classified as pericytes; however, this proportion was significantly higher in the thalamus (6.20%) than in other regions. In contrast, microglia (4.51% of total cells) were more abundant in the cortex (5.54%). No differences were detected between male and female mice. In conclusion, QuPath offers a user-friendly solution to whole-slide image analysis which could lead to important new discoveries in both health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Characterization of the Brain Functional Architecture of Psychostimulant Withdrawal Using Single-Cell Whole-Brain Imaging</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Numerous brain regions have been identified as contributing to withdrawal behaviors, but it is unclear the way in which these brain regions as a whole lead to withdrawal. The search for a final common brain pathway that is involved in withdrawal remains elusive. To address this question, we implanted osmotic minipumps containing either saline, nicotine (24 mg/kg/d), cocaine (60 mg/kg/d), or methamphetamine (4 mg/kg/d) for one week in male C57BL/6J mice. After one week, the minipumps were removed and brains collected 8 h (saline, nicotine, and cocaine) or 12 h (methamphetamine) after removal. We then performed single-cell whole-brain imaging of neural activity during the withdrawal period when brains were collected. We used hierarchical clustering and graph theory to identify similarities and differences in brain functional architecture. Although methamphetamine and cocaine shared some network similarities, the main common neuroadaptation between these psychostimulant drugs was a dramatic decrease in modularity, with a shift from a cortical-driven to subcortical-driven network, including a decrease in total hub brain regions. These results demonstrate that psychostimulant withdrawal produces the drug-dependent remodeling of functional architecture of the brain and suggest that the decreased modularity of brain functional networks and not a specific set of brain regions may represent the final common pathway associated with withdrawal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Humans Use a Temporally Local Code for Vibrotactile Perception</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Sensory environments are commonly characterized by specific physical features, which sensory systems might exploit using dedicated processing mechanisms. In the tactile sense, one such characteristic feature is frictional movement, which gives rise to short-lasting (&lt;10 ms), information-carrying integument vibrations. Rather than generic integrative encoding (i.e., averaging or spectral analysis capturing the "intensity" and "best frequency"), the tactile system might benefit from, what we call a "temporally local" coding scheme that instantaneously detects and analyzes shapes of these short-lasting features. Here, by employing analytic psychophysical measurements, we tested whether the prerequisite of temporally local coding exists in the human tactile system. We employed pulsatile skin indentations at the fingertip that allowed us to trade manipulation of local pulse shape against changes in global intensity and frequency, achieved by adding pulses of the same shape. We found that manipulation of local pulse shape has strong effects on psychophysical performance, arguing for the notion that humans implement a temporally local coding scheme for perceptual decisions. As we found distinct differences in performance using different kinematic layouts of pulses, we inquired whether temporally local coding is tuned to a unique kinematic variable. This was not the case, since we observed different preferred kinematic variables in different ranges of pulse shapes. Using an established encoding model for primary afferences and indentation stimuli, we were able to demonstrate that the found kinematic preferences in human performance, may well be explained by the response characteristics of Pacinian corpuscles (PCs), a class of human tactile primary afferents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">DBscorer: An Open-Source Software for Automated Accurate Analysis of Rodent Behavior in Forced Swim Test and Tail Suspension Test</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) are commonly used behavioral tests for screening antidepressant drugs with a high predictive validity. These tests have also proved useful to assess the non-motor symptoms in the animal models of movement disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and Huntington&rsquo;s disease. Manual analysis of FST and TST is a time-consuming exercise and has large observer-to-observer variability. Automation of behavioral analysis alleviates these concerns, but there are no easy-to-use open-source tools for such analysis. Here, we describe the development of Depression Behavior Scorer (DBscorer), an open-source program installable on Windows, with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), that helps in accurate quantification of immobility behavior in FST and TST from video analysis. Several calibration options allow customization of various parameters to suit the experimental requirements. Apart from the readout of time spent immobile, DBscorer also provides additional data and graphics of immobility/mobility states across time revealing the evolution of behavioral despair over the duration of the test and allows the analysis of additional parameters. Such comprehensive analysis allows a more nuanced understanding of the expression of behavioral despair in FST and TST. We believe that DBscorer would make analysis of behavior in FST and TST unbiased, automated and rapid, and hence prove to be helpful to the wider neuroscience community.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Acute abdomen presentation revealing a metastatic invasive mole with uterine rupture [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia refers to the aggressive subset of gestational trophoblastic disease, including invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor, and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. These tumors may have atypical clinical presentations that can mislead the diagnosis. The reported case is a 48-year-old woman in perimenopause, without any history of vaginal bleedings nor molar pregnancy, who presented to the Emergency Department with acute abdominal pain. Serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) was highly elevated at 261 675.23 mIU/ml. A complicated invasive mole was suspected, and an abdominal computed tomography was performed, showing a moderate hemoperitoneum associated to complex cystic and solid uterine mass, with a common left iliac adenomegaly and multiple pulmonary nodules. MRI showed a multiloculated cystic uterine mass with zones of hemorrhage recalling an invasive mole with perforation of the posterior uterus wall, associated to a high abundance hemoperitoneum. The diagnosis of a metastatic invasive mole complicated of uterine rupture and hemoperitoneum was retained. A surgical intervention was decided immediately and a subtotal hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy was done. Pathologic examination of the specimen was positive for an invasive mole. The patient was proposed for chemotherapy. This case study will increase awareness of unusual clinical presentations of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia We believe that our case will contribute to the literature not only because of the rarity of this entity in perimenopausal period, but also due the atypical clinical presentation as acute abdomen without vaginal bleeding nor history of molar pregnancy evacuation

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Physics-based modeling provides predictive understanding of selectively promiscuous substrate binding by Hsp70 chaperones</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik B. Nordquist, Charles A. English, Eugenia M. Clerico, Woody Sherman, Lila M. Gierasch, Jianhan Chen</p>

To help cells cope with protein misfolding and aggregation, Hsp70 molecular chaperones selectively bind a variety of sequences (“selective promiscuity”). Statistical analyses from substrate-derived peptide arrays reveal that DnaK, the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> Hsp70, binds to sequences containing three to five branched hydrophobic residues, although otherwise the specific amino acids can vary considerably. Several high-resolution structures of the substrate -binding domain (SBD) of DnaK bound to peptides reveal a highly conserved configuration of the bound substrate and further suggest that the substrate-binding cleft consists of five largely independent sites for interaction with five consecutive substrate residues. Importantly, both substrate backbone orientations (N- to C- and C- to N-) allow essentially the same backbone hydrogen-bonding and side-chain interactions with the chaperone. In order to rationalize these observations, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to sample the interactions of all 20 amino acid side chains in each of the five sites of the chaperone in the context of the conserved substrate backbone configurations. The resulting interaction energetics provide the basis set for deriving a predictive model that we call Paladin (Physics-based model of DnaK-Substrate Binding). Trained using available peptide array data, Paladin can distinguish binders and nonbinders of DnaK with accuracy comparable to existing predictors and further predicts the detailed configuration of the bound sequence. Tested using existing DnaK-peptide structures, Paladin correctly predicted the binding register in 10 out of 13 substrate sequences that bind in the N- to C- orientation, and the binding orientation in 16 out of 22 sequences. The physical basis of the Paladin model provides insight into the origins of how Hsp70s bind substrates with a balance of selectivity and promiscuity. The approach described here can be extended to other Hsp70s where extensive peptide array data is not available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neuroblastoma signalling models unveil combination therapies targeting feedback-mediated resistance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mathurin Dorel, Bertram Klinger, Tommaso Mari, Joern Toedling, Eric Blanc, Clemens Messerschmidt, Michal Nadler-Holly, Matthias Ziehm, Anja Sieber, Falk Hertwig, Dieter Beule, Angelika Eggert, Johannes H. Schulte, Matthias Selbach, Nils Blüthgen</p>

Very high risk neuroblastoma is characterised by increased MAPK signalling, and targeting MAPK signalling is a promising therapeutic strategy. We used a deeply characterised panel of neuroblastoma cell lines and found that the sensitivity to MEK inhibitors varied drastically between these cell lines. By generating quantitative perturbation data and mathematical modelling, we determined potential resistance mechanisms. We found that negative feedbacks within MAPK signalling and via the IGF receptor mediate re-activation of MAPK signalling upon treatment in resistant cell lines. By using cell-line specific models, we predict that combinations of MEK inhibitors with RAF or IGFR inhibitors can overcome resistance, and tested these predictions experimentally. In addition, phospho-proteomic profiling confirmed the cell-specific feedback effects and synergy of MEK and IGFR targeted treatment. Our study shows that a quantitative understanding of signalling and feedback mechanisms facilitated by models can help to develop and optimise therapeutic strategies. Our findings should be considered for the planning of future clinical trials introducing MEKi in the treatment of neuroblastoma.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling response strategies for controlling gonorrhoea outbreaks in men who have sex with men in Australia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qibin Duan, Chris Carmody, Basil Donovan, Rebecca J. Guy, Ben B. Hui, John M. Kaldor, Monica M. Lahra, Matthew G. Law, David A. Lewis, Michael Maley, Skye McGregor, Anna McNulty, Christine Selvey, David J. Templeton, David M. Whiley, David G. Regan, James G. Wood</p>

The ability to treat gonorrhoea with current first-line drugs is threatened by the global spread of extensively drug resistant (XDR) <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> (NG) strains. In Australia, urban transmission is high among men who have sex with men (MSM) and importation of an XDR NG strain in this population could result in an epidemic that would be difficult and costly to control. An individual-based, anatomical site-specific mathematical model of NG transmission among Australian MSM was developed and used to evaluate the potential for elimination of an imported NG strain under a range of case-based and population-based test-and-treat strategies. When initiated upon detection of the imported strain, these strategies enhance the probability of elimination and reduce the outbreak size compared with current practice (current testing levels and no contact tracing). The most effective strategies combine testing targeted at regular and casual partners with increased rates of population testing. However, even with the most effective strategies, outbreaks can persist for up to 2 years post-detection. Our simulations suggest that local elimination of imported NG strains can be achieved with high probability using combined case-based and population-based test-and-treat strategies. These strategies may be an effective means of preserving current treatments in the event of wider XDR NG emergence.

Herpesviruses cause severe diseases particularly in immunocompromised patients. Both genome packaging and release from the capsid require a unique portal channel occupying one of the 12 capsid vertices. Here, we report the 2.6 Å crystal structure of the pentameric pORF19 of the γ-herpesvirus Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) resembling the portal cap that seals this portal channel. We also present the structure of its β-herpesviral ortholog, revealing a striking structural similarity to its α- and γ-herpesviral counterparts despite apparent differences in capsid association. We demonstrate pORF19 pentamer formation in solution and provide insights into how pentamerization is triggered in infected cells. Mutagenesis in its lateral interfaces blocked pORF19 pentamerization and severely affected KSHV capsid assembly and production of infectious progeny. Our results pave the way to better understand the role of pORF19 in capsid assembly and identify a potential novel drug target for the treatment of herpesvirus-induced diseases.

The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a pandemic causing significant damage to public health and the economy. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been hampered by the lack of robust mouse models. To overcome this barrier, we used a reverse genetic system to generate a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Incorporating key mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 variants, this model recapitulates critical elements of human infection including viral replication in the lung, immune cell infiltration, and significant in vivo disease. Importantly, mouse adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 does not impair replication in human airway cells and maintains antigenicity similar to human SARS-CoV-2 strains. Coupled with the incorporation of mutations found in variants of concern, CMA3p20 offers several advantages over other mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strains. Using this model, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2–infected mice are protected from lethal challenge with the original Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), suggesting immunity from heterologous Coronavirus (CoV) strains. Together, the results highlight the use of this mouse model for further study of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.

Female mate choice is thought to be responsible for the evolution of many extravagant male ornaments and displays, but the costs of being too selective may hinder the evolution of choosiness. Selection against choosiness may be particularly strong in socially monogamous mating systems, because females may end up without a partner and forego reproduction, especially when many females prefer the same few partners (frequency-dependent selection). Here, we quantify the fitness costs of having mating preferences that are difficult to satisfy, by manipulating the availability of preferred males. We capitalize on the recent discovery that female zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) prefer males of familiar song dialect. We measured female fitness in captive breeding colonies in which one-third of females were given ample opportunity to choose a mate of their preferred dialect (two-thirds of all males; “relaxed competition”), while two-thirds of the females had to compete over a limited pool of mates they preferred (one-third of all males; “high competition”). As expected, social pairings were strongly assortative with regard to song dialect. In the high-competition group, 26% of the females remained unpaired, yet they still obtained relatively high fitness by using brood parasitism as an alternative reproductive tactic. Another 31% of high-competition females paired disassortatively for song dialect. These females showed increased levels of extra-pair paternity, mostly with same-dialect males as sires, suggesting that preferences were not abolished after social pairing. However, females that paired disassortatively for song dialect did not have lower reproductive success. Overall, females in the high-competition group reached equal fitness to those that experienced relaxed competition. Our study suggests that alternative reproductive tactics such as egg dumping can help overcome the frequency-dependent costs of being selective in a monogamous mating system, thereby facilitating the evolution of female choosiness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">An altered balance of integrated and segregated brain activity is a marker of cognitive deficits following sleep deprivation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathan E. Cross, Florence B. Pomares, Alex Nguyen, Aurore A. Perrault, Aude Jegou, Makoto Uji, Kangjoo Lee, Fatemeh Razavipour, Obaï Bin Ka’b Ali, Umit Aydin, Habib Benali, Christophe Grova, Thien Thanh Dang-Vu</p>

Sleep deprivation (SD) leads to impairments in cognitive function. Here, we tested the hypothesis that cognitive changes in the sleep-deprived brain can be explained by information processing within and between large-scale cortical networks. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of 20 healthy volunteers during attention and executive tasks following a regular night of sleep, a night of SD, and a recovery nap containing nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Overall, SD was associated with increased cortex-wide functional integration, driven by a rise of integration within cortical networks. The ratio of within versus between network integration in the cortex increased further in the recovery nap, suggesting that prolonged wakefulness drives the cortex towards a state resembling sleep. This balance of integration and segregation in the sleep-deprived state was tightly associated with deficits in cognitive performance. This was a distinct and better marker of cognitive impairment than conventional indicators of homeostatic sleep pressure, as well as the pronounced thalamocortical connectivity changes that occurs towards falling asleep. Importantly, restoration of the balance between segregation and integration of cortical activity was also related to performance recovery after the nap, demonstrating a bidirectional effect. These results demonstrate that intra- and interindividual differences in cortical network integration and segregation during task performance may play a critical role in vulnerability to cognitive impairment in the sleep-deprived state.

                We report a 29-year-old, HIV-positive woman being treated with antipsychotic medication for psychosis (Clopixol 200mg intramuscularly monthly, Risperidone 2mg orally daily Haloperidol 2.5mg twice a day), who presented with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. She was also receiving lorazepam and sodium valproate. The patient was referred to our department as she had developed involuntary upper limb movements and simple permanent focal seizure on the lower part of the left hemiface. Clinically the patient had altered consciousness, autonomic dysfunction, and rigidity. Her blood tests showed elevated creatine kinase (1467U/L) but no leucocytosis. We did a thorough workup for other causes of such a presentation. A comprehensive history was taken from the family to exclude other medications used. Her cerebrospinal fluid results were average. Blood tests did not show evidence of infection or other abnormalities. Computed tomography brain was normal. The patient died a few days after the beginning of the attack, which we have also observed  in other HIV-female patients. As far as we know, it is the first report about this comorbidity reported in the medical literature.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lightning safety awareness level in Malaysia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Malaysia is one of the countries with the highest lightning flash density globally. While sufficiency of lightning protection system is crucial to ensure human safety against lightning strikes, the public awareness towards lightning safety is also equally important in Malaysia. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the current lightning safety awareness level of the Malaysian population. Methods: An online questionnaire survey which consists of 22 scientific statements of lightning was first developed in Malay and English. The questionnaire allows the respondent to also check their own score upon completion of the questionnaire. It was then distributed to the public for data collection. The sample size comprised of both genders, all layers of society from various educational level and social background. Results: Overall, the awareness on lightning safety amongst Malaysian is at moderate level with an average score of slightly above 50%. Urbanites scored marginally better than their rural counterparts. One’s education level does not dictate their awareness level of lightning safety. Discussion: In conclusion, the public in Malaysia needs to be better educated on lightning safety. Similar studies should be replicated in other countries experiencing similar levels of lightning activity to better understand the public’s perception on lightning.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of electrocardiogram: numerical vs. image data for emotion recognition system [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a physiological signal used to diagnose and monitor cardiovascular disease, usually using ECG wave images. Numerous studies have proven that ECG can be used to detect human emotions using numerical data; however, ECG is typically captured as a wave image rather than as a numerical data. There is still no consensus on the effect of the ECG input format (either as an image or a numerical value) on the accuracy of the emotion recognition system (ERS). The ERS using ECG images is still inadequately studied. Therefore, this study compared ERS performance using ECG image and ECG numerical data to determine the effect of the ECG input format on the ERS. Methods: This study employed the DREAMER dataset, which contains 23 ECG recordings obtained during audio-visual emotional elicitation. Numerical data was converted to ECG images for the comparison. Numerous approaches were used to obtain ECG features. The Augsburg BioSignal Toolbox (AUBT) and the Toolbox for Emotional feature extraction from Physiological signals (TEAP) extracted features from numerical data. Meanwhile, features were extracted from image data using Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB), Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), KAZE, Accelerated-KAZE (AKAZE), Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints (BRISK), and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). Dimension reduction was accomplished using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and valence and arousal were classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results: The experimental results indicated that numerical data achieved arousal and valence accuracy of 69% and 79%, respectively, which was greater than those of image data. For ECG images, the highest accuracy for arousal was 58% percent; meanwhile, the valence was 63%. Conclusions: The finding showed that numerical data provided better accuracy for ERS. However, ECG image data which shows positive potential and can be considered as an input modality for the ERS.

                By building a dense connectome using EM-fMRI, Xu et al. find layout-preserving, surface-to-surface mappings between macaque LPFC and other major association cortices, coarsely resembling how visual cortex maps retina. Thus, LPFC contains overlapping, millimeter-scale maps that parallel the organization of other cortices, which may help integrate representations at appropriate levels.

We use pancreatic islets, retina and liver from rodents to highlight its ability to assess effects of O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S. Protocols aimed at emulating hypoxia-reperfusion conditions resolved a previously unrecognized transient spike in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate (OCR) following replenishment of O<sub>2</sub>, and tissue-specific recovery of OCR following hypoxia. The system revealed both inhibitory and stimulatory effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on insulin secretion rate from isolated islets. The unique ability of this new system to quantify metabolic state and cell function in response to precise changes in dissolved gases provides a powerful platform for cell physiologists to study a wide range of disease states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular features underlying differential SHP1/SHP2 binding of immune checkpoint receptors</a></h4>

              
                A large number of inhibitory receptors recruit SHP1 and/or SHP2, tandem-SH2-containing phosphatases, through phosphotyrosine-based motifs ITIM and ITSM. Despite the similarity, these receptors exhibit differential effector binding specificities, as exemplified by the immune checkpoint receptors PD-1 and BTLA, which preferentially recruit SHP2 and SHP1 respectively. The molecular basis by which structurally similar receptors discriminate SHP1 and SHP2 is unclear. Here, we provide evidence that human PD-1 and BTLA optimally bind to SHP1 and SHP2 via a bivalent, parallel mode that involves both SH2 domains of SHP1 or SHP2. PD-1 mainly uses its ITSM to prefer SHP2 over SHP1 via their C-terminal SH2 domains (cSH2): swapping SHP1-cSH2 with SHP2-cSH2 enabled PD-1:SHP1 association in T cells. In contrast, BTLA primarily utilizes its ITIM to prefer SHP1 over SHP2 via their N-terminal SH2 domains (nSH2). The ITIM of PD-1, however, appeared to be de-emphasized due to a glycine at pY+1 position. Substitution of this glycine with alanine, a residue conserved in BTLA and several SHP1-recruiting receptors, was sufficient to induce PD-1:SHP1 interaction in T cells. Finally, structural simulation and mutagenesis screening showed that SHP1 recruitment activity exhibits a bell-shaped dependence on the side chain volume of the pY+1 residue of ITIM. Collectively, we provide a molecular interpretation of the SHP1/SHP2-binding specificities of PD-1 and BTLA, with implications for the mechanisms of a large family of therapeutically relevant receptors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-EM structures of CTP synthase filaments reveal mechanism of pH-sensitive assembly during budding yeast starvation</a></h4>

              
                Many metabolic enzymes self-assemble into micron-scale filaments to organize and regulate metabolism. The appearance of these assemblies often coincides with large metabolic changes as in development, cancer, and stress. Yeast undergo cytoplasmic acidification upon starvation, triggering the assembly of many metabolic enzymes into filaments. However, it is unclear how these filaments assemble at the molecular level and what their role is in the yeast starvation response. CTP Synthase (CTPS) assembles into metabolic filaments across many species. Here, we characterize <i>in vitro</i> polymerization and investigate <i>in vivo</i> consequences of CTPS assembly in yeast. Cryo-EM structures reveal a pH-sensitive assembly mechanism and highly ordered filament bundles that stabilize an inactive state of the enzyme, features unique to yeast CTPS. Disruption of filaments in cells with non-assembly or pH-insensitive mutations decreases growth rate, reflecting the importance of regulated CTPS filament assembly in homeotstasis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Local chromatin fiber folding represses transcription and loop extrusion in quiescent cells</a></h4>

              
                A longstanding hypothesis is that chromatin fiber folding mediated by interactions between nearby nucleosomes represses transcription. However, it has been difficult to determine the relationship between local chromatin fiber compaction and transcription in cells. Further, global changes in fiber diameters have not been observed, even between interphase and mitotic chromosomes. We show that an increase in the range of local inter-nucleosomal contacts in quiescent yeast drives the compaction of chromatin fibers genome-wide. Unlike actively dividing cells, inter-nucleosomal interactions in quiescent cells require a basic patch in the histone H4 tail. This quiescence-specific fiber folding globally represses transcription and inhibits chromatin loop extrusion by condensin. These results reveal that global changes in chromatin fiber compaction can occur during cell state transitions, and establish physiological roles for local chromatin fiber folding in regulating transcription and chromatin domain formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A WDR35-dependent coat protein complex transports ciliary membrane cargo vesicles to cilia</a></h4>

              
                Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a highly conserved mechanism for motor-driven transport of cargo within cilia, but how this cargo is selectively transported to cilia is unclear. WDR35/IFT121 is a component of the IFT-A complex best known for its role in ciliary retrograde transport. In the absence of WDR35, small mutant cilia form but fail to enrich in diverse classes of ciliary membrane proteins. In <i>Wdr35 </i>mouse mutants, the non-core IFT-A components are degraded and core components accumulate at the ciliary base. We reveal deep sequence homology of WDR35 and other IFT-A subunits to α and ß' COPI coatomer subunits, and demonstrate an accumulation of 'coat-less' vesicles which fail to fuse with <i>Wdr35</i> mutant cilia. We determine that recombinant non-core IFT-As can bind directly to lipids and provide the first <i>in-situ</i> evidence of a novel coat function for WDR35, likely with other IFT-A proteins, in delivering ciliary membrane cargo necessary for cilia elongation.

                Acoustic overexposure and aging can damage auditory synapses in the inner ear by a process known as synaptopathy. These insults may also damage hair bundles and the sensory transduction apparatus in auditory hair cells. However, a connection between sensory transduction and synaptopathy has not been established. To evaluate potential contributions of sensory transduction to synapse formation and development, we assessed inner hair cell synapses in several genetic models of dysfunctional sensory transduction, including mice lacking Transmembrane Channel-like (<i>Tmc</i>) <i>1</i>, <i>Tmc2</i> or both, in <i>Beethoven </i>mice which carry a dominant <i>Tmc1 </i>mutation and in <i>Spinner </i>mice which carry a recessive mutation in Transmembrane inner ear (<i>Tmie)</i>. Our analyses reveal loss of synapses in the absence of sensory transduction and preservation of synapses in <i>Tmc1</i>-null mice following restoration of sensory transduction via <i>Tmc1 </i>gene therapy. These results provide insight into the requirement of sensory transduction for hair cell synapse development and maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multivesicular Release Increases the Efficiency of InformationTransmission at Sensory Synapses</a></h4>

              
                The statistics of vesicle release determine how information is transferred in neural circuits. The classical model is of Poisson synapses releasing vesicles independently but ribbon synapses transmit early sensory signals by multivesicular release (MVR) when two or more vesicles are coordinated as a single synaptic event. To investigate the impact of MVR on the spike code we used leaky integrate-and-fire models with inputs simulating the statistics of vesicle release measured experimentally from retinal bipolar cells. Comparing these with models of independent release we find that MVR increases spike generation and the efficiency of information transfer (bits per spike) over a range of conditions that mimic retinal ganglion cells of different time-constant receiving different number of synaptic inputs of different strengths. When a single input drives a neuron with short time-constant, as occurs when hair cells transmit auditory signals, MVR increases information transfer whenever spike generation requires depolarization greater than that caused by a single vesicle. This study demonstrates how presynaptic integration of vesicles by MVR can compensate for less effective summation post-synaptically to increase the efficiency with which sensory information is transmitted at the synapse.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motor response vigour and fixations reflect subjective preferences during intertemporal choice</a></h4>

              
                Value-based decision-making is of central interest in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, as well as in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders characterised by decision-making impairments. Studies examining (neuro-)computational mechanisms underlying choice behaviour typically focus on participants' decisions. However, there is increasing evidence that option valuation might also be reflected in motor response vigour and eye movements, implicit measures of subjective utility. To examine motor response vigour and visual fixation correlates of option valuation in intertemporal choice, we set up a task where the participants selected an option by pressing a grip force transducer, simultaneously tracking fixation shifts between options. As outlined in our preregistration (https://osf.io/k6jct), we used hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation to model the choices assuming hyperbolic discounting, compared variants of the softmax and drift diffusion model, and assessed the relationship between response vigour and the estimated model parameters. The behavioural data were best explained by a drift diffusion model specifying a non-linear scaling of the drift rate by the subjective value differences. Replicating previous findings (Green et al., 1997; Wagner et al., 2020a), we found a magnitude effect for temporal discounting, such that higher rewards were discounted less. This magnitude effect was further reflected in response vigour, such that stronger forces were exerted in the high vs. the low magnitude condition. Bayesian hierarchical linear regression further revealed higher grip forces, faster response times and a lower number of fixation shifts for trials with higher subjective value differences. Our data suggest that subjective utility or implicit valuation is reflected in response vigour during intertemporal choice. Taking into account response vigour might thus provide deeper insight into decision-making, reward valuation and maladaptive changes in these processes, e.g. in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-Volume Associations in Cerebellar Regions by Sex and Reproductive Stage</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The cerebellum has established associations with motor function and a well-recognized role in cognition. In advanced age, cognitive and motor impairments contribute to reduced quality of life and are more common. Regional cerebellar volume is associated with performance across these domains and sex hormones may influence this volume. Examining sex differences in regional cerebellar volume in conjunction with age, and in the context of reproductive stage stands to improve our understanding of cerebellar aging and pathology. Methods: Data from 530 healthy adults (ages 18-88; 49% female) from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience database were used here. CERES was utilized to assess lobular volume in T1-weighted images. We examined sex differences in adjusted regional cerebellar volume while controlling for age. A subgroup (n = 354, 50% female) was used to assess group differences in female reproductive stages as compared to age-matched males. Results: Sex differences in adjusted volume were seen across most anterior and posterior cerebellar lobules. The majority of cerebellar regions had significant linear relationships with age in males and females. However, there were no interactions between sex and reproductive stage groups (i.e., female reproductive stage did not display a relationship with regional cerebellar volume). Discussion: We found sex differences in volume across much of the cerebellum, linear associations with age, and did not find an effect of female reproductive stage on regional cerebellar volume. Longitudinal investigation into hormonal influences on cerebellar structure and function is warranted as hormonal changes with menopause may impact structure over time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glioma synapses recruit mechanisms of adaptive plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The nervous system plays an increasingly appreciated role in the regulation of cancer. In malignant gliomas, neuronal activity drives tumor progression not only through paracrine signaling factors such as neuroligin-3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but also through electrophysiologically functional neuron-to-glioma synapses. Malignant synapses are mediated by calcium-permeable AMPA (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors in both pediatric and adult high-grade gliomas, and consequent depolarization of the glioma cell membrane drives tumor proliferation. The nervous system exhibits plasticity of both synaptic connectivity and synaptic strength, contributing to neural circuit form and functions. In health, one factor that promotes plasticity of synaptic connectivity and strength is activity-regulated secretion of the neurotrophin BDNF. Here, we show that malignant synapses exhibit similar plasticity regulated by BDNF-TrkB (tropomyosin receptor kinase B) signaling. Signaling through the receptor TrkB, BDNF promotes AMPA receptor trafficking to the glioma cell membrane, resulting in increased amplitude of glutamate-evoked currents in the malignant cells. This potentiation of malignant synaptic strength shares mechanistic features with the long-term potentiation (LTP) that is thought to contribute to memory and learning in the healthy brain. BDNF-TrkB signaling also regulates the number of neuron-to-glioma synapses. Abrogation of activity-regulated BDNF secretion from the brain microenvironment or loss of TrkB in human glioma cells exerts growth inhibitory effects in vivo and in neuron:glioma co-cultures that cannot be explained by classical growth factor signaling alone. Blocking TrkB genetically or pharmacologically abrogates these effects of BDNF on glioma synapses and substantially prolongs survival in xenograft models of pediatric glioblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Taken together, these findings indicate that BDNF-TrkB signaling promotes malignant synaptic plasticity and augments tumor progression.

                We reconstructed all cell nuclei in a 3D image of a Drosophila brain acquired by serial section electron microscopy (EM). The total number of nuclei is approximately 133,000, at least 87% of which belong to neurons. Neuronal nuclei vary from several hundred down to roughly 5 cubic micrometers. Glial nuclei can be even smaller. The optic lobes contain more than two times the number of cells than the central brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuromodulation enables temperature robustness and coupling between fast and slow oscillator circuits in  Cancer borealis</a></h4>

              
                Acute temperature changes can disrupt neuronal activity and coordination with severe consequences for animal behavior and survival. Nonetheless, two rhythmic neuronal circuits in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and their coordination are maintained across a broad temperature range. However, it remains unclear how this temperature robustness is achieved. Here, we dissociate temperature effects on the rhythm generating circuits from those of upstream ganglia. We demonstrate that heat-activated factors extrinsic to the rhythm generators are essential to the slow gastric mill rhythm's temperature robustness and contribute to the temperature response of the fast pyloric rhythm. The gastric mill rhythm crashed when only the STG circuits were heated. It could be restored when upstream ganglia were heated in addition, and the activity of the peptidergic modulatory projection neuron (MCN1) increased. Correspondingly, MCN1's neuropeptide transmitter stabilized the rhythm and maintained it over a broad temperature range. Extrinsic neuromodulation is thus essential for the oscillatory circuits in the STG and enables neural circuits to maintain function in temperature-compromised conditions. In contrast, integer coupling between pyloric and gastric mill rhythms was independent of whether extrinsic inputs and STG pattern generators were temperature-matched or not, demonstrating that the temperature robustness of the coupling is enabled by properties intrinsic to the rhythm generators. However, at near-crash temperature, integer coupling was maintained only in some animals but was absent in others. This was true despite regular rhythmic activity in all animals, supporting that degenerate circuit properties result in idiosyncratic responses to environ-mental challenges.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic Perturbation of an Artificial Neural Network: A Step Towards Quantifying Causal Contributions in The Brain</a></h4>

              
                Lesion inference analysis is a fundamental approach for characterizing the causal contributions of neural elements to brain function. Historically, it has helped to localize specialized functions in the brain after brain damage, and it has gained new prominence through the arrival of modern optogenetic perturbation techniques that allow probing the functional contributions of neural circuit elements at unprecedented levels of detail. While inferences drawn from brain lesions are conceptually powerful, they face methodological difficulties due to the brain's complexity. Particularly, they are challenged to disentangle the functional contributions of individual neural elements because many elements may contribute to a particular function, and these elements may be interacting anatomically as well as functionally. Therefore, studies of real-world data, as in clinical lesion studies, are not suitable for establishing the reliability of lesion approaches due to an unknown, potentially complex ground truth. Instead, ground truth studies of well-characterized artificial systems are required. Here, we systematically and exhaustively lesioned a small Artificial Neural Network (ANN) playing a classic arcade game. We determined the functional contributions of all nodes and links, contrasting results from single-element perturbations and perturbing multiple elements simultaneously. Moreover, we computed pairwise causal functional interactions between the network elements, and looked deeper into the system's inner workings, proposing a mechanistic explanation for the effects of lesions. We found that not every perturbation necessarily reveals causation, as lesioning elements, one at a time, produced biased results. By contrast, multi-site lesion analysis captured crucial details that were missed by single-site lesions. We conclude that even small and seemingly simple ANNs show surprising complexity that needs to be understood for deriving a causal picture of the system. In the context of rapidly evolving multivariate brain-mapping approaches and inference methods, we advocate using in-silico experiments and ground-truth models to verify fundamental assumptions, technical limitations, and the scope of possible interpretations of these methods.

                Enhanced activity and overexpression of Pannexin 1 (PANX1) channels contribute to neuronal pathologies, such as epilepsy and Alzheimers disease (AD). In the hippocampus, the PANX1 channels ablation alters glutamatergic neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and memory flexibility. Nevertheless, PANX1-knockout (KO) mice still preserve the ability to learn, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms work to stabilize neuronal activity. Here, we show that the absence of PANX1 in the adult brain promotes a series of structural and functional modifications in KO hippocampal synapses, preserving spontaneous activity. Adult CA1 neurons of KO mice exhibit enhanced excitability, complex dendritic branching, spine maturation, and multiple synaptic contacts compared to the WT condition. These modifications seem to rely on the actin-cytoskeleton dynamics as an increase in actin polymerization and an imbalance between Rac1 and RhoA GTPase activity is observed in the absence of PANX1. Our findings highlight a novel interaction between PANX1, actin, and small Rho GTPases that appear to be relevant for synapse maintenance as a long-term compensatory mechanism for PANX1 deficiency.

                Background: The male preponderance in autism led to the hypothesis that aspects of female biology are protective against autism. Females with autism report engaging in more compensatory behaviors (i.e., camouflaging) to overcome autism-related social differences, which may be a downstream result of protective pathways. No studies have examined sex-related brain pathways supporting camouflaging in females with autism, despite its potential to inform mechanisms underlying the sex bias in autism. Methods: This study included 45 non-intellectually-disabled adults with autism (male/female: 21/24) and 40 neurotypical adults (male/female: 19/21) ages 18-71. We used group multivariate voxel pattern analysis to conduct a data-driven, connectome-wide characterization of "sex-atypical" (sex-by-diagnosis) and "sex-typical" (sex) brain functional connectivity features linked to camouflaging, and validated findings in females with autism multi-modally via structural connectometry. Exploratory associations with cognitive control, memory, emotion recognition, and depression/anxiety examined the adaptive nature of functional connectivity patterns supporting camouflaging in females with autism. Results: We found 1) "sex-atypical" functional connectivity patterns predicting camouflaging in the hypothalamus and precuneus and 2) "sex-typical" patterns in the anterior cingulate and right anterior parahippocampus. Higher hypothalamic functional connectivity with a limbic reward cluster was the strongest predictor of camouflaging in females with autism (a "sex-atypical" pattern), and also predicted better cognitive control/emotion recognition. Structural connectometry validated functional connectivity results with consistent brain pathways/effect patterns implicated across multi-modal findings in females with autism. Conclusion: This data-driven, connectome-wide characterization of "sex-atypical" and "sex-typical" brain connectivity features supporting compensatory social behavior in autism suggests hormones may play a role in the autism sex bias. Furthermore, both "male-typical" and "female-typical" brain connectivity patterns are implicated in camouflaging in females with autism in circuits associated with reward, emotion, and memory processing. "Sex-atypical" results are consistent with the fetal steroidogenic hypothesis, which would result in masculinized brain features in females with autism. However, female genetics/biology may contribute to "female-typical" patterns implicated in camouflaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurometric correlates to sensitive high-frequency sound amplitude modulation detection by mice</a></h4>

              
                Amplitude modulation (AM) is a common feature of natural sounds, including speech and animal vocalizations. Here, we used operant conditioning and in vivo electrophysiology to determine the AM detection threshold of mice as well as its underlying neuronal encoding. Mice were trained in a Go-NoGo task to detect the transition to AM within a noise stimulus designed to prevent the use of spectral side-bands or a change in intensity as alternative cues. Our results indicate that mice, in comparison with other species, detect high modulation frequencies up to 512 Hz exceptionally well, but show poor performance at low frequencies. Our in vivo multielectrode recordings in the inferior colliculus (IC) of both anesthetized and awake mice revealed a few single units with remarkable phase-locking ability to 512 Hz modulation, but not sufficient to explain the good behavioral detection. Using a model of the population response that combined dimensionality reduction with threshold detection, we reproduced the general high-pass characteristics of behavioral detection based on a subset of neurons showing the largest firing rate change (both increase and decrease) in response to AM. Our data thus identify candidate neurons in the IC to explain the high-pass transfer function for AM detection in the mouse.

                Aging involves various neurobiological changes, although their effect on brain function in humans remains poorly understood. The growing availability of human neuronal and circuit data provides opportunities for uncovering age-dependent changes of brain networks and for constraining models to predict consequences on brain activity. Here we found increased sag current in human layer 5 pyramidal neurons from older subjects, and captured this effect in biophysical models of younger and older pyramidal neurons. We used these models to simulate detailed layer 5 microcircuits and found lower baseline firing in older pyramidal neuron microcircuits, with minimal effect on response. We then validated the predicted reduced baseline firing using extracellular multi-electrode recordings from human brain slices of different ages. Our results thus report changes in human pyramidal neuron input integration properties that can sufficiently account for age-dependent decreases in cortical resting state activity and may underpin a clinical relevance in aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateral entorhinal cortex suppresses drift in cortical memory representations.</a></h4>

              
                Memory retrieval is thought to depend on the reinstatement of cortical memory representations guided by pattern completion processes in the hippocampus. The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is one of the intermediary regions supporting hippocampal-cortical interactions and houses neurons that prospectively signal past events in a familiar environment. To investigate the functional relevance of the LEC's activity for cortical reinstatement, we pharmacologically inhibited the LEC and examined its impact on the stability of ensemble firing patterns in one of the LEC's efferent targets, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). When male rats underwent multiple epochs of identical stimulus sequences in the same environment, the mPFC maintained a stable ensemble firing pattern across repetitions, particularly when the sequence included pairings of neutral and aversive stimuli. With LEC inhibition, the mPFC still formed an ensemble pattern that accurately captured stimuli and their associations within each epoch. However, LEC inhibition markedly disrupted its consistency across the epochs by decreasing the proportion of mPFC neurons that stably maintained firing selectivity for stimulus associations. Thus, the LEC stabilizes cortical representations of learned stimulus associations, thereby facilitating the recovery of the original memory trace without generating a new, redundant trace for familiar experiences. Failure of this process might underlie retrieval deficits in conditions associated with degeneration of the LEC, such as normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.

                The human cerebral cortex is symmetrically organized along large-scale axes but also presents inter-hemispheric differences in structure and function. The quantified contralateral homologous difference, i.e., asymmetry, is a key feature of the human brain left-right axis supporting functional processes, such as language. Here, we assessed whether the asymmetry of cortical functional organization is heritable and phylogenetically conserved between humans and macaques. Our findings indicate asymmetric organization along an axis describing a hierarchical functional trajectory from perceptual/action to abstract cognition. Whereas language network showed leftward asymmetric organization, frontoparietal network showed rightward asymmetric organization. These asymmetries were heritable and comparable between humans and macaques, suggesting (phylo)genetic conservation. However, both language and frontoparietal networks showed a qualitatively larger asymmetry in humans relative to macaques and variable heritability in humans. This may reflect an evolutionary adaptation allowing for experience-dependent specialization, linked to higher-order cognitive functions uniquely developed in humans.

                Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to clear toxic amyloid aggregates involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. A major limitation of PDT is off-target oxidation, which can be lethal for the surrounding cells. We have shown that a novel class of oligo-p-phenylene ethynylene-based compounds (OPEs) exhibit selective binding and fluorescence turn-on in the presence of pre-fibrillar and fibrillar aggregates of disease-relevant proteins such as amyloid-beta (Ab) and alpha-synuclein. Concomitant with fluorescence turn-on, OPE also photosensitizes singlet oxygen under illumination through the generation of a triplet state, pointing to the potential application of OPEs as photosensitizers in PDT. Herein, we investigated the photosensitizing activity of an anionic OPE for the photo-oxidation of toxic Ab; aggregates and compared its efficacy to the well-known but non-selective photosensitizer methylene blue (MB). Our results show that while MB photo-oxidized both monomeric and fibrillar conformers of Ab40, OPE oxidized only Ab40 fibrils, targeting two histidine residues on the fibril surface and a methionine residue located in the fibril core. Oxidized fibrils were shorter and more dispersed, but retained the characteristic beta-sheet rich fibrillar structure and the ability to seed further fibril growth. Importantly, the oxidized fibrils displayed low toxicity. We have thus discovered a class of novel theranostics for the simultaneous detection and oxidization of amyloid aggregates. Importantly, the selectivity of OPE's photosensitizing activity overcomes the limitation of off-target oxidation of currently available photosensitizers, and represents a significant advancement of PDT as a viable strategy to treat neurodegenerative disorders.

                Callosal projection neurons are a broad population of interhemispheric projection neurons that extend an axon across the corpus callosum to connect the two cerebral hemispheres. The corticospinal tract, comprised of the axons of corticospinal projection neurons, is unique to mammals, and its full extension to the lumbar segments that control walking is, like the corpus callosum, unique to placental mammals. The emergence of these two distinct axonal tracts is thought to underpin the evolutionary expansion of complex motor and cognitive abilities. The molecular mechanisms regulating the divergence of corticospinal and callosal projection neurons are incompletely understood. Our recent work identifies a genomic cluster of microRNAs (12qF1/Mirg) unique to placental mammals. These clustered miRNAs are specifically expressed by corticospinal vs. callosal projection neurons during the molecular refinement of corticospinal vs. callosal projection neuron fate (1). One of these, miR-409-3p, can convert layer V callosal into corticospinal projection neurons, acting in part through repression of the callosal-expressed transcriptional regulator Lmo4. This conversion is partial, however, suggesting that miR-409-3p represses multiple callosal projection neuron control genes in order to specify corticospinal projection neurons. One potential additional target of miR-409-3p repression is the callosal-expressed transcriptional co-activator Cited2. Cited2 interacts genetically with Lmo4, and Lmo4 can partially functionally compensate for Cited2 in thymus development(2). Further, Cited2 and Lmo4 function as opposing molecular controls over specific areal identity within superficial layer callosal projection neurons of the somatosensory and motor cortices, respectively (3). Cited2 is highly expressed by callosal, relative to corticospinal, projection neurons from the earliest stages of neurogenesis. Cited2 is necessary for the expansion of intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ), and the resulting generation of superficial layer callosal projection neurons. Here we show that miR-409-3p and Cited2 interact in IPCs and in corticospinal vs. deep layer callosal projection neuron development. miR-409-3p represses the Cited2 3UTR in luciferase assays. Mirg, which encodes miR-409-3p, and Cited2, are reciprocally expressed in IPCs at e15.5 by qPCR. Furthermore, miR-409-3p gain-of-function results in a phenocopy of established Cited2 loss-of-function in IPCs. Later on, miR-409-3p and Cited2 exert opposing effects on the adoption of corticospinal vs. callosal projection neuron subtype identity. Taken together, our work suggests that miR-409-3p, and possibly other 12qF1 miRNAs, represses Cited2 in IPCs to limit their proliferation, and in developing corticospinal and deep layer callosal projection neurons to favor corticospinal fate.

                Disease, injury, and aging induce reactive astrocyte states with pathological functions. In neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory reactive astrocytes are abundant and contribute to progressive cell loss. Modulating the state or function of these reactive astrocytes thereby represents an attractive therapeutic goal. Leveraging a cellular phenotypic screening platform, we show that chemical inhibitors of HDAC3 effectively block pathological astrocyte reactivity. Inhibition of HDAC3 reduces molecular and functional features of reactive astrocytes in vitro including inflammatory gene expression, cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation. Transcriptional and chromatin mapping studies show that HDAC3 inhibition mediates a switch between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory states, which disarms the pathological functions of reactive astrocytes. Systemic administration of a blood-brain barrier penetrant chemical inhibitor of HDAC3, RGFP966, blocks reactive astrocyte formation and promotes axonal protection in vivo. Collectively, these results establish a platform for discovering chemical modulators of reactive astrocyte states, inform the mechanisms controlling astrocyte reactivity, and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of modulating astrocyte reactivity for neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intact Drosophila Whole Brain Cellular Quantitation reveals Sexual Dimorphism</a></h4>

              
                Establishing with precision the quantity and identity of the cell types of the brain is a prerequisite for a detailed compendium of gene and protein expression in the central nervous system. Currently however, strict quantitation of cell numbers has been achieved only for the nervous system of C.elegans. Here we describe the development of a synergistic pipeline of molecular genetic, imaging, and computational technologies designed to allow high-throughput, precise quantitation with cellular resolution of reporters of gene expression in intact whole tissues with complex cellular constitutions such as the brain. We have deployed the approach to determine with exactitude the number of functional neurons and glia in the entire intact Drosophila larval brain, revealing fewer neurons and many more glial cells than previously estimated. Moreover, we discover an unexpected divergence between the sexes at this juvenile developmental stage, with female brains having significantly more neurons than males. Topological analysis of our data establishes that this sexual dimorphism extends to deeper features of brain organisation. Our methodology enables robust and accurate quantification of the number and positioning of cells within intact organs, facilitating sophisticated analysis of cellular identity, diversity, and expression characteristics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synergy of color and motion vision for detecting approaching objects in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Color and motion are used by many species to identify salient moving objects. They are processed largely independently, but color contributes to motion processing in humans, for example, enabling moving colored objects to be detected when their luminance matches the background. Here, we demonstrate an unexpected, additional contribution of color to motion vision in Drosophila. We show that behavioral ON-motion responses are more sensitive to UV than for OFF-motion, and we identify cellular pathways connecting UV-sensitive R7 photoreceptors to ON and OFF-motion-sensitive T4 and T5 cells, using neurogenetics and calcium imaging. Remarkably, the synergy of color and motion vision enhances the detection of approaching UV discs, but not green discs with the same chromatic contrast, and we show how this generalizes for visual systems with ON and OFF pathways. Our results provide a computational and circuit basis for how color enhances motion vision to favor the detection of saliently colored objects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A comparison of single and multi-echo processing of fMRI data during overt autobiographical recall</a></h4>

              
                Recent years have seen an increase in the use of multi-echo fMRI designs by cognitive neuroscientists. Acquiring multiple echoes allows one to reduce thermal noise and identify nuisance signal components in BOLD data (Kundu et al., 2012). At the same time, multi-echo acquisitions increase data processing complexity and may incur a cost to the temporal and spatial resolution of the acquired data. Here, we re-examine a multi-echo dataset (Gilmore et al., 2021) analyzed using multi-echo ICA (ME-ICA) and focused on hippocampal activity during the overly spoken recall of recent and remote autobiographical memories. The goal of the present series of analyses was to determine if ME-ICA's theoretical denoising benefits might lead to a practical difference in the overall conclusions reached. Compared to single echo data, ME-ICA led to qualitatively different conclusions regarding hippocampal contributions to autobiographical recall: whereas the single echo analysis largely failed to reveal hippocampal activity relative to an active baseline, ME-ICA results supported predictions of the Standard Model of Consolidation and a time limited hippocampal involvement (Alvarez and Squire, 1994). These data provide a practical example of the benefits multi-echo denoising in a naturalistic memory paradigm and demonstrate how they can be used to address long-standing theoretical questions.

                We describe how the recently introduced method of significant subgraph mining can be employed as a useful tool in network comparison. It is applicable whenever the goal is to compare two sets of unweighted graphs and to determine differences in the processes that generate them. We provide an extension of the method to dependent graph generating processes as the occur for example in within-subject experimental designs. Furthermore, we present an extensive investigation of error-statistical properties of the method in simulation using Erdos-Renyi models and in empirical data. In particular, we perform an empirical power analysis for transfer entropy networks inferred from resting state MEG data comparing autism spectrum patients with neurotypical controls. From this analysis one may estimate that the appropriate sample size for similar studies should be chosen in the order of n=60 per group or larger.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cone-driven retinal responses are shaped by rod but not cone HCN1</a></h4>

              
                Signal integration of converging neural circuits is poorly understood. One example is in the retina where the integration of rod and cone signaling is responsible for the large dynamic range of vision. The relative contribution of rods versus cones is dictated by a complex function involving background light intensity and stimulus temporal frequency. One understudied mechanism involved in coordinating rod and cone signaling onto the shared retinal circuit is the hyperpolarization activated current (Ih) mediated by HCN1 channels. Ih opposes membrane hyperpolarization driven by activation of the phototransduction cascade and modulates the strength and kinetics of the photoreceptor voltage response. We examined conditional knockout of HCN1 from rods using electroretinography. In the absence of HCN1, rod responses are prolonged in dim light which altered the response to slow modulation of light intensity both at the level of retinal signaling and behavior. Under brighter intensities, cone-driven signaling was suppressed. To our surprise, conditional knockout of HCN1 from cones had no effect on cone-mediated signaling. We propose that Ih is dispensable in cones due to the high level of temporal control of cone phototransduction. Thus, HCN1 is required for cone-driven retinal signaling only indirectly by modulating the voltage response of rods to limit their output.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcription factor control of dendrite targeting via combinatorial cell-surface codes</a></h4>

              
                Transcription factors are central commanders specifying cell fate, morphology, and physiology while cell-surface proteins execute these commands through interaction with cellular environment. In developing neurons, it is presumed that transcription factors control wiring specificity through regulation of cell-surface protein expression. However, the number and identity of cell-surface protein(s) a transcription factor regulates remain largely unclear1,2. Also unknown is whether a transcription factor regulates the same or different cell-surface proteins in different neuron types to specify their connectivity. Here we use a lineage-defining transcription factor, Acj6 (ref. 3), to investigate how it controls precise dendrite targeting of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs). Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion proteins and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo-whose channel activity is dispensable for its wiring function. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting. Combinatorial expression of Acj6 wiring executors rescued acj6 mutant phenotypes with higher efficacy and breadth than expression of individual executors. Thus, a key transcription factor controls wiring specificity of different neuron types by specifying distinct combinatorial expression of cell-surface executors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Challenging the notion of a task-negative network: default mode network involvement under varying levels of cognitive effort</a></h4>

              
                Everyday cognitive functioning is characterized by constant alternations between different modes of information processing, driven by fluctuations in environmental demands. At the neural level, this is realized through corresponding dynamic shifts in functional activation and network connectivity. A distinction is often made between the Default Mode Network (DMN) as a task-negative network that is upregulated in the absence of cognitive demands, and task-positive networks that are upregulated when cognitive demands such as attention and executive control are present. Such networks have been labelled the Extrinsic Mode Network (EMN). We investigated changes in brain activation and functional network connectivity during repeated alternations between levels of cognitive effort. Using fMRI and a block-design Stroop paradigm, participants switched back and forth between periods of no effort (resting), low effort (word reading, automatic processing) and high effort (color naming, cognitive control). Results showed expected EMN-activation for task versus rest, and likewise expected DMN-activation for rest versus task. The DMN was also more strongly activated during low effort contrasted with high effort, suggesting a gradual up- and down-regulation of the DMN, depending on the level of demand. The often reported anti-correlation between DMN and EMN was only present during periods of low effort, indicating intermittent contributions of both networks. These results challenge the traditional view of the DMN as solely a task-negative network. Instead, the present results suggest that both EMN and DMN may contribute to low-effort cognitive processing. In contrast, periods of resting and high effort are dominated by the DMN and EMN, respectively.

                This paper presents a deep-learning based workflow to detect synapses and predict their neurotransmitter type in the primitive chordate Ciona intestinalis (Ciona) EM images. Identifying synapses from electron microscopy (EM) images to build a full map of connections between neurons is a labor-intensive process and requires significant domain expertise. Automation of synapse detection and classification would hasten the generation and analysis of connectomes. Furthermore, inferences concerning neuron type and function from synapse features are in many cases difficult to make. Finding the connection between synapse structure and function is an important step in fully understanding a connectome. Activation maps derived from the convolutional neural network provide insights on important features of synapses based on cell type and function. The main contribution of this work is in the differentiation of synapses by neurotransmitter type through the structural information in their EM images. This enables prediction of neurotransmitter types for neurons in Ciona which were previously unknown. The prediction model with code is available on Github.

                Visual categorization is a human core cognitive capacity that depends on the development of visual category representations in the infant brain. The nature of infant visual category representations and their relationship to the corresponding adult form however remain unknown. Our results clarify the nature of visual category representations in 6- to 8-month-old infants and their developmental trajectory towards adult maturity in the key characteristics temporal dynamics, representational format, and spectral properties. Temporal dynamics change from slowly emerging, developing representations in infants to quickly emerging, complex representations in adults. Despite those differences infants and adults already partly share visual category representations. The format of infants' representations are visual features of low to intermediate complexity, whereas adults' representations also encoded high complexity features. Theta band neural oscillations form the basis of visual category representations in infants, and these representations are shifted to the alpha/beta band in adults.

                Forming a complete picture of the relationship between neural activity and body kinetics requires quantification of skeletal joint biomechanics during behavior. However, without detailed knowledge of the underlying skeletal motion, inferring joint kinetics from surface tracking approaches is difficult, especially for animals where the relationship between surface anatomy and skeleton changes during motion. Here we developed a videography-based method enabling detailed three-dimensional kinetic quantification of an anatomically defined skeleton in untethered freely-behaving animals. This skeleton-based model has been constrained by anatomical principles and joint motion limits and provided skeletal pose estimates for a range of rodent sizes, even when limbs were occluded. Model-inferred joint kinetics for both gait and gap-crossing behaviors were verified by direct measurement of limb placement, showing that complex decision making behaviors can be accurately reconstructed at the level of skeletal kinetics using our anatomically constrained model.

                EEG power spectral density (PSD), the individual alpha frequency (IAF) and the frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) are all EEG spectral measures that have been widely used to evaluate cognitive and attentional processes in experimental and clinical settings, and that can be used for real-world applications (e.g., remote EEG monitoring, brain-computer interfaces, neurofeedback, neuromodulation, etc.). Potential applications remain limited by the high cost, low mobility, and long preparation times associated with high-density EEG recording systems. Low-density wearable systems address these issues and can increase access to larger and diversified samples. The present study tested whether a low-cost, 4-channel wearable EEG system (the MUSE) could be used to quickly measure continuous EEG data, yielding similar frequency components compared to research a grade EEG system (the 64-channel BIOSEMI Active Two). We compare the spectral measures from MUSE EEG data referenced to mastoids to those from BIOSEMI EEG data with two different references for validation. A minimal amount of data was deliberately collected to test the feasibility for real-world applications (EEG setup and data collection being completed in under 5 min). We show that the MUSE can be used to examine power spectral density (PSD) in all frequency bands, the individual alpha frequency (IAF; i.e., peak alpha frequency and alpha center of gravity), and frontal alpha asymmetry. Furthermore, we observed satisfying internal consistency reliability in alpha power and asymmetry measures recorded with the MUSE. Estimating asymmetry on PAF and CoG frequencies did not yield significant advantages relative to the traditional method (whole alpha band). These findings should advance human neurophysiological monitoring using wearable neurotechnologies in large participant samples and increase the feasibility of their implementation in real-world settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A high-fat diet changes astrocytic metabolism to enhance synaptic plasticity and promote exploratory behavior</a></h4>

              
                A high-fat diet (HFD) is generally considered to negatively influence the body, the brain, and cognitive abilities. On the other hand, fat and fatty acids are essential for nourishing and constructing brain tissue. Astrocytes are central for lipolysis and fatty acids metabolism. Here we show that exposure of young mice to one month of HFD elevates lipid content and increases the relative amount of reduced cytochromes in astrocytes but not in neurons. Metabolic changes were paralleled with an enlargement of astrocytic territorial domains due to an increased outgrowth of branches and leaflets. Astrocyte remodeling was associated with an increase in expression of ezrin and with no changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), and glutamine synthetase (GS). Such physiological (non-reactive) enlargement of astrocytes in the brain active milieu promoted glutamate clearance and long-term potentiation. These changes translated into improved exploratory behavior. Thus, dietary fat intake is not invariably harmful and might exert beneficial effects depending on the biological context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multivariate to multivariate approach for voxel-wise genome-wide association analysis</a></h4>

              
                The joint analysis of imaging-genetics data facilitates the systematic investigation of genetic effects on brain structures and functions with spatial specificity. We focus on voxel-wise genome-wide association analysis, which may involve trillions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-voxel pairs. We attempt to identify underlying organized association patterns of SNP-voxel pairs and understand the polygenic and pleiotropic networks on brain imaging traits. We propose a bi-clique graph structure (i.e., a set of SNPs highly correlated with a cluster of voxels) for the systematic association pattern. Next, we develop computational strategies to detect latent SNP-voxel bi-cliques and inference model for statistical testing. We further provide theoretical results to guarantee the accuracy of our computational algorithms and statistical inference. We validate our method by extensive simulation studies and then apply it to the whole genome genetic and voxel-level white matter integrity data collected from 1052 participants of the human connectome project (HCP). The results demonstrate multiple genetic loci influencing white matter integrity measures on splenium and genu of the corpus callosum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine mediates the bidirectional update of interval timing</a></h4>

              
                The role of dopamine as a reward prediction error signal in reinforcement learning tasks has been well-established over the past decades. Recent work has shown that the reward prediction error interpretation can also account for the effects of dopamine on interval timing by controlling the speed of subjective time. According to this theory, the timing of the dopamine signal relative to reward delivery dictates whether subjective time speeds up or slows down: Early DA signals speed up subjective time and late signals slow it down. To test this bidirectional prediction, we reanalyzed measurements of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of mice performing a self-timed movement task. Using the slope of ramping dopamine activity as a read-out of subjective time speed, we found that trial-by-trial changes in the slope could be predicted from the timing of dopamine activity on the previous trial. This result provides a key piece of evidence supporting a unified computational theory of reinforcement learning and interval timing.

	<p>Corpus callosotomy (CC) is an established palliative surgery for human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), especially those with generalized seizures and multiple or unknown epileptogenic focus. However, there are no reports to describe CC in canine patients with epilepsy. Three client-owned Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with DRE are included in this case series. In presurgical evaluations, an apparent epileptogenic zone was not detected in each dog and CC was conducted. Total CC was performed in one dog, whereas the other two received partial CC. One dog recovered from surgery without any complications, but died suddenly by an unknown cause at 10 h after surgery. For the other two dogs, postoperative evaluations including seizure outcomes, complications, and quality of life of the dogs and owners were assessed for at least 12 months. Both dogs showed a remarkable decrease in seizure frequency (averaged 80.3% reduction) and severity after surgery. The antiseizure medications were maintained, and not only the mentation and activity of the dogs, but also the quality of life of dogs and owners were improved postoperatively. Although technical improvement and more large-scale studies are needed, CC is a treatment option for dogs with DRE in veterinary medicine.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Manipulation of G-Protein {gamma}7 Subunit in Mice Provides New Insights into Striatal Control of Motor Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stimulatory coupling of dopamine D<SUB>1</SUB> (D<SUB>1</SUB>R) and adenosine A<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors (A<SUB>2A</SUB>R) to adenylyl cyclase within the striatum is mediated through a specific G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer to ultimately modulate motor behaviors. To dissect the individual roles of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer in different populations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), we produced and characterized conditional mouse models, in which the <I>Gng7</I> gene was deleted in either the D<SUB>1</SUB>R- or A<SUB>2A</SUB>R/D<SUB>2</SUB>R-expressing MSNs. We show that conditional loss of <SUB>7</SUB> disrupts the cell type-specific assembly of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer, thereby identifying its circumscribed roles acting downstream of either the D<SUB>1</SUB>Rs or A<SUB>2A</SUB>Rs in coordinating motor behaviors, including <I>in vivo</I> responses to psychostimulants. We reveal that G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB>/cAMP signal in D<SUB>1</SUB>R-MSNs does not impact spontaneous and amphetamine-induced locomotor behaviors in male and female mice, while its loss in A<SUB>2A</SUB>R/D<SUB>2</SUB>R-MSNs results in a hyperlocomotor phenotype and enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine. Additionally, G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB>/cAMP signal in either D<SUB>1</SUB>R- or A<SUB>2A</SUB>R/D<SUB>2</SUB>R-expressing MSNs is not required for the activation of PKA signaling by amphetamine. Finally, we show that G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> signaling acting downstream of D<SUB>1</SUB>Rs is selectively implicated in the acute locomotor-enhancing effects of morphine. Collectively, these results support the general notion that receptors use specific G&alpha;&beta; proteins to direct the fidelity of downstream signaling pathways and to elicit a diverse repertoire of cellular functions. Specifically, these findings highlight the critical role for the <SUB>7</SUB> protein in determining the cellular level, and hence, the function of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer in several disease states associated with dysfunctional striatal signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dysfunction or imbalance of cAMP signaling in the striatum has been linked to several neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, dystonia, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. By genetically targeting the <SUB>7</SUB> subunit in distinct striatal neuronal subpopulations in mice, we demonstrate that the formation and function of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer, which represents the rate-limiting step for cAMP production in the striatum, is selectively disrupted. Furthermore, we reveal cell type-specific roles for G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB>-mediated cAMP production in the control of spontaneous locomotion as well as behavioral and molecular responses to psychostimulants. Our findings identify the <SUB>7</SUB> protein as a novel therapeutic target for disease states associated with dysfunctional striatal cAMP signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Metaplastic Reinforcement of Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal Area CA2 by Cholinergic Receptor Activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal CA2, an inconspicuously positioned area between the well-studied CA1 and CA3 subfields, has captured research interest in recent years because of its role in social memory formation. However, the role of cholinergic inputs to the CA2 area for the regulation of synaptic plasticity remains to be fully understood. We show that cholinergic receptor activation with the nonselective cholinergic agonist, carbachol (CCh), triggers a protein synthesis-dependent and NMDAR-independent long-term synaptic depression (CCh-LTD) at entorhinal cortical (EC)-CA2 and Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA2 synapses in the hippocampus of adult male Wistar rats. The activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) is critical for the induction of CCh-LTD with the results suggesting an involvement of M3 and M1 mAChRs in the early facilitation of CCh-LTD, while nicotinic AChR activation plays a role in the late maintenance of CCh-LTD at CA2 synapses. Remarkably, we find that CCh priming lowers the threshold for the subsequent induction of persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission at EC-CA2 and the plasticity-resistant SC-CA2 pathways. The effects of such a cholinergic-dependent synaptic depression on subsequent LTP at EC-CA2 and SC-CA2 synapses have not been previously explored. Collectively, the results demonstrate that CA2 synaptic learning rules are regulated in a metaplastic manner, whereby modifications triggered by prior cholinergic stimulation can dictate the outcome of future plasticity events. Moreover, the reinforcement of LTP at EC inputs to CA2 following the priming stimulus coexists with concurrent sustained CCh-LTD at the SC-CA2 pathway and is dynamically scaled by modulation of SC-CA2 synaptic transmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The release of the neuromodulator acetylcholine is critically involved in processes of hippocampus-dependent memory formation. Cholinergic afferents originating in the medial septum and diagonal bands of Broca terminating in the hippocampal area CA2 might play an important role in the modulation of area-specific synaptic plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that cholinergic receptor activation induces an LTD of synaptic transmission at entorhinal cortical- and Schaffer collateral-CA2 synapses. This cholinergic activation-mediated LTD displays a bidirectional metaplastic switch to LTP on a future timescale. This suggests that such bidirectional synaptic modifications triggered by the dynamic modulation of tonic cholinergic receptor activation may support the formation of CA2-dependent memories given the increased hippocampal cholinergic tone during active wakefulness observed in exploratory behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CNS Hypomyelination Disrupts Axonal Conduction and Behavior in Larval Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Myelination is essential for central nervous system (CNS) formation, health and function. As a model organism, larval zebrafish have been extensively employed to investigate the molecular and cellular basis of CNS myelination, because of their genetic tractability and suitability for non-invasive live cell imaging. However, it has not been assessed to what extent CNS myelination affects neural circuit function in zebrafish larvae, prohibiting the integration of molecular and cellular analyses of myelination with concomitant network maturation. To test whether larval zebrafish might serve as a suitable platform with which to study the effects of CNS myelination and its dysregulation on circuit function, we generated zebrafish myelin regulatory factor (<I>myrf</I>) mutants with CNS-specific hypomyelination and investigated how this affected their axonal conduction properties and behavior. We found that <I>myrf</I> mutant larvae exhibited increased latency to perform startle responses following defined acoustic stimuli. Furthermore, we found that hypomyelinated animals often selected an impaired response to acoustic stimuli, exhibiting a bias toward reorientation behavior instead of the stimulus-appropriate startle response. To begin to study how myelination affected the underlying circuitry, we established electrophysiological protocols to assess various conduction properties along single axons. We found that the hypomyelinated <I>myrf</I> mutants exhibited reduced action potential conduction velocity and an impaired ability to sustain high-frequency action potential firing. This study indicates that larval zebrafish can be used to bridge molecular and cellular investigation of CNS myelination with multiscale assessment of neural circuit function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelination of CNS axons is essential for their health and function, and it is now clear that myelination is a dynamic life-long process subject to modulation by neuronal activity. However, it remains unclear precisely how changes to myelination affects animal behavior and underlying action potential conduction along axons in intact neural circuits. In recent years, zebrafish have been employed to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of myelination, because of their relatively simple, optically transparent, experimentally tractable vertebrate nervous system. Here we find that changes to myelination alter the behavior of young zebrafish and action potential conduction along individual axons, providing a platform to integrate molecular, cellular, and circuit level analyses of myelination using this model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid and Bihemispheric Reorganization of Neuronal Activity in Premotor Cortex after Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain injuries cause hemodynamic changes in several distant, spared areas from the lesion. Our objective was to better understand the neuronal correlates of this reorganization in awake, behaving female monkeys. We used reversible inactivation techniques to "injure" the primary motor cortex, while continuously recording neuronal activity of the ventral premotor cortex in the two hemispheres, before and after the onset of behavioral impairments. Inactivation rapidly induced profound alterations of neuronal discharges that were heterogeneous within each and across the two hemispheres, occurred during movements of either the affected or nonaffected arm, and varied during different phases of grasping. Our results support that extensive, and much more complex than expected, neuronal reorganization takes place in spared areas of the bihemispheric cortical network involved in the control of hand movements. This broad pattern of reorganization offers potential targets that should be considered for the development of neuromodulation protocols applied early after brain injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that brain injuries cause changes in several distant, spared areas of the network, often in the premotor cortex. This reorganization is greater early after the injury and the magnitude of early changes correlates with impairments. However, studies to date have used noninvasive brain imaging approaches or have been conducted in sedated animals. Therefore, we do not know how brain injuries specifically affect the activity of neurons during the generation of movements. Our study clearly shows how a lesion rapidly impacts neurons in the premotor cortex of both hemispheres. A better understanding of these complex changes can help formulate hypotheses for the development of new treatments that specifically target neuronal reorganization induced by lesions in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Inputs in the Prelimbic Cortex Curb Fear after Extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>In contrast to easily formed fear memories, fear extinction requires prolonged training. The prelimbic cortex (PL), which integrates signals from brain structures involved in fear conditioning and extinction such as the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) and the basolateral amygdala (BL), is necessary for fear memory retrieval. Little is known, however, about how the vHIP and BL inputs to the PL regulate the display of fear after fear extinction. Using functional anatomy tracing in male rats, we found two distinct subpopulations of neurons in the PL activated by either the successful extinction or the relapse of fear. During the retrieval of fear extinction memory, the dominant input to active neurons in the PL was from the vHIP, whereas the retrieval of fear memory, regardless of the age of a memory and testing context, was associated with greater BL input. Optogenetic stimulation of the vHIP&ndash;PL pathway after one session of fear extinction increased conditioned fear, whereas stimulation of the vHIP inputs after several sessions of extinction decreased the conditioned fear response. This latter effect was, however, transient, as stimulation of this pathway 28 d after extinction increased conditioned fear response again. The results show that repeated fear extinction training gradually changes vHIP&ndash;PL connectivity, making fear suppression possible, whereas in the absence of fear suppression from the vHIP, signals from the BL can play a dominant role, resulting in high levels of fear.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Behavioral therapies of fear are based on extinction learning. As extinction memories fade over time, such therapies produce only a temporary suppression of fear, which constitutes a clinical and societal challenge. In our study, we provide a framework for understating the underlying mechanism by which extinction of fear memories fade by demonstrating the existence of two subpopulations of neurons in the prelimbic cortex associated with low and high levels of fear. Insufficient extinction and exposure to the context in which fear memory was formed promoted high fear neuronal activity in the prelimbic cortex, leading to fear retrieval. Extensive extinction training, on the other hand, boosted low fear neuronal activity and, as a result, extinction memory retrieval. This effect was, however, transient and disappeared with time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Studying Independent Kcna6 Knock-out Mice Reveals Toxicity of Exogenous LacZ to Central Nociceptor Terminals and Differential Effects of Kv1.6 on Acute and Neuropathic Pain Sensation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The potassium channel Kv1.6 has recently been implicated as a major modulatory channel subunit expressed in primary nociceptors. Furthermore, its expression at juxtaparanodes of myelinated primary afferents is induced following traumatic nerve injury as part of an endogenous mechanism to reduce hyperexcitability and pain-related hypersensitivity. In this study, we compared two mouse models of constitutive Kv1.6 knock-out (KO) achieved by different methods: traditional gene trap via homologous recombination and CRISPR-mediated excision. Both Kv1.6 KO mouse lines exhibited an unexpected reduction in sensitivity to noxious heat stimuli, to differing extents: the Kv1.6 mice produced via gene trap had a far more significant hyposensitivity. These mice (<I>Kcna6<sup>lacZ</sup></I>) expressed the bacterial reporter enzyme LacZ in place of Kv1.6 as a result of the gene trap mechanism, and we found that their central primary afferent presynaptic terminals developed a striking neurodegenerative phenotype involving accumulation of lipid species, development of "meganeurites," and impaired transmission to dorsal horn wide dynamic range neurons. The anatomic defects were absent in CRISPR-mediated Kv1.6 KO mice (<I>Kcna6</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) but were present in a third mouse model expressing exogenous LacZ in nociceptors under the control of a Nav1.8-promoted Cre recombinase. LacZ reporter enzymes are thus intrinsically neurotoxic to sensory neurons and may induce pathologic defects in transgenic mice, which has confounding implications for the interpretation of gene KOs using <I>lacZ</I>. Nonetheless, in <I>Kcna6</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice not affected by LacZ, we demonstrated a significant role for Kv1.6 regulating acute noxious thermal sensitivity, and both mechanical and thermal pain-related hypersensitivity after nerve injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In recent decades, the expansion of technologies to experimentally manipulate the rodent genome has contributed significantly to the field of neuroscience. While introduction of enzymatic or fluorescent reporter proteins to label neuronal populations is now commonplace, often potential toxicity effects are not fully considered. We show a role of Kv1.6 in acute and neuropathic pain states through analysis of two mouse models lacking Kv1.6 potassium channels: one with additional expression of LacZ and one without. We show that LacZ reporter enzymes induce unintended defects in sensory neurons, with an impact on behavioral data outcomes. To summarize we highlight the importance of Kv1.6 in recovery of normal sensory function following nerve injury, and careful interpretation of data from LacZ reporter models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Stable Population Code for Attention in Prefrontal Cortex Leads a Dynamic Attention Code in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Attention often requires maintaining a stable mental state over time while simultaneously improving perceptual sensitivity. These requirements place conflicting demands on neural populations, as sensitivity implies a robust response to perturbation by incoming stimuli, which is antithetical to stability. Functional specialization of cortical areas provides one potential mechanism to resolve this conflict. We reasoned that attention signals in executive control areas might be highly stable over time, reflecting maintenance of the cognitive state, thereby freeing up sensory areas to be more sensitive to sensory input (i.e., unstable), which would be reflected by more dynamic attention signals in those areas. To test these predictions, we simultaneously recorded neural populations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortical area V4 in rhesus macaque monkeys performing an endogenous spatial selective attention task. Using a decoding approach, we found that the neural code for attention states in PFC was substantially more stable over time compared with the attention code in V4 on a moment-by-moment basis, in line with our guiding thesis. Moreover, attention signals in PFC predicted the future attention state of V4 better than vice versa, consistent with a top-down role for PFC in attention. These results suggest a functional specialization of attention mechanisms across cortical areas with a division of labor. PFC signals the cognitive state and maintains this state stably over time, whereas V4 responds to sensory input in a manner dynamically modulated by that cognitive state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention requires maintaining a stable mental state while simultaneously improving perceptual sensitivity. We hypothesized that these two demands (stability and sensitivity) are distributed between prefrontal and visual cortical areas, respectively. Specifically, we predicted attention signals in visual cortex would be less stable than in prefrontal cortex, and furthermore prefrontal cortical signals would predict attention signals in visual cortex in line with the hypothesized role of prefrontal cortex in top-down executive control. Our results are consistent with suggestions deriving from previous work using separate recordings in the two brain areas in different animals performing different tasks and represent the first direct evidence in support of this hypothesis with simultaneous multiarea recordings within individual animals.</p>

                <p>Sex steroid hormones act on hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons to regulate reproductive neural circuits in the brain. Kisspeptin neurons start to express estrogen receptors <I>in utero</I>, suggesting steroid hormone action on these cells early during development. Whether neurosteroids are locally produced in the embryonic brain and impinge onto kisspeptin/reproductive neural circuitry is not known. To address this question, we analyzed aromatase expression, a key enzyme in estrogen synthesis, in male and female mouse embryos. We identified an aromatase neuronal network comprising ~6000 neurons in the hypothalamus and amygdala. By birth, this network has become sexually dimorphic in a cluster of aromatase neurons in the arcuate nucleus adjacent to kisspeptin neurons. We demonstrate that male arcuate aromatase neurons convert testosterone to estrogen to regulate kisspeptin neuron activity. We provide spatiotemporal information on aromatase neuronal network development and highlight a novel mechanism whereby aromatase neurons regulate the activity of distinct neuronal populations expressing estrogen receptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sex steroid hormones, such as estradiol, are important regulators of neural circuits controlling reproductive physiology in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Memory Specific to Temporal Features of Sound Is Formed by Cue-Selective Enhancements in Temporal Coding Enabled by Inhibition of an Epigenetic Regulator</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent investigation of memory-related functions in the auditory system have capitalized on the use of memory-modulating molecules to probe the relationship between memory and substrates of memory in auditory system coding. For example, epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate gene expression necessary for memory consolidation, are powerful modulators of learning-induced neuroplasticity and long-term memory (LTM) formation. Inhibition of the epigenetic regulator histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) promotes LTM, which is highly specific for spectral features of sound. The present work demonstrates for the first time that HDAC3 inhibition also enables memory for temporal features of sound. Adult male rats trained in an amplitude modulation (AM) rate discrimination task and treated with a selective inhibitor of HDAC3 formed memory that was highly specific to the AM rate paired with reward. Sound-specific memory revealed behaviorally was associated with a signal-specific enhancement in temporal coding in the auditory system; stronger phase locking that was specific to the rewarded AM rate was revealed in both the surface-recorded frequency following response and auditory cortical multiunit activity in rats treated with the HDAC3 inhibitor. Furthermore, HDAC3 inhibition increased trial-to-trial cortical response consistency (relative to naive and trained vehicle-treated rats), which generalized across different AM rates. Stronger signal-specific phase locking correlated with individual behavioral differences in memory specificity for the AM signal. These findings support that epigenetic mechanisms regulate activity-dependent processes that enhance discriminability of sensory cues encoded into LTM in both spectral and temporal domains, which may be important for remembering spectrotemporal features of sounds, for example, as in human voices and speech.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epigenetic mechanisms have recently been implicated in memory and information processing. Here, we use a pharmacological inhibitor of HDAC3 in a sensory model of learning to reveal the ability of HDAC3 to enable precise memory for amplitude-modulated sound cues. In so doing, we uncover neural substrates for memory's specificity for temporal sound cues. Memory specificity was supported by auditory cortical changes in temporal coding, including greater response consistency and stronger phase locking. HDAC3 appears to regulate effects across domains that determine specific cue saliency for behavior. Thus, epigenetic players may gate how sensory information is stored in long-term memory and can be leveraged to reveal the neural substrates of sensory details stored in memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Multivariate Analysis of Electrophysiological Signals Reveals the Time Course of Precision Grasps Programs: Evidence for Nonhierarchical Evolution of Grasp Control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Current understanding of the neural processes underlying human grasping suggests that grasp computations involve gradients of higher to lower level representations and, relatedly, visual to motor processes. However, it is unclear whether these processes evolve in a strictly canonical manner from higher to intermediate and to lower levels given that this knowledge importantly relies on functional imaging, which lacks temporal resolution. To examine grasping in fine temporal detail here we used multivariate EEG analysis. We asked participants to grasp objects while controlling the time at which crucial elements of grasp programs were specified. We first specified the orientation with which participants should grasp objects, and only after a delay we instructed participants about which effector to use to grasp, either the right or the left hand. We also asked participants to grasp with both hands because bimanual and left-hand grasping share intermediate-level grasp representations. We observed that grasp programs evolved in a canonical manner from visual representations, which were independent of effectors to motor representations that distinguished between effectors. However, we found that intermediate representations of effectors that partially distinguished between effectors arose after representations that distinguished among all effector types. Our results show that grasp computations do not proceed in a strictly hierarchically canonical fashion, highlighting the importance of the fine temporal resolution of EEG for a comprehensive understanding of human grasp control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A long-standing assumption of the grasp computations is that grasp representations progress from higher to lower level control in a regular, or canonical, fashion. Here, we combined EEG and multivariate pattern analysis to characterize the temporal dynamics of grasp representations while participants viewed objects and were subsequently cued to execute an unimanual or bimanual grasp. Interrogation of the temporal dynamics revealed that lower level effector representations emerged before intermediate levels of grasp representations, thereby suggesting a partially noncanonical progression from higher to lower and then to intermediate level grasp control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Roles of Basolateral Amygdala Parvalbumin Neurons in Fear Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is obligatory for fear learning. This learning is linked to BLA excitatory projection neurons whose activity is regulated by complex networks of inhibitory interneurons, dominated by parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic neurons. The roles of these GABAergic interneurons in learning to fear and learning not to fear, activity profiles of these interneurons across the course of fear learning, and whether or how these change across the course of learning all remain poorly understood. Here, we used PV cell-type-specific recording and manipulation approaches in male transgenic PV-Cre rats during pavlovian fear conditioning to address these issues. We show that activity of BLA PV neurons during the moments of aversive reinforcement controls fear learning about aversive events, but activity during moments of nonreinforcement does not control fear extinction learning. Furthermore, we show expectation-modulation of BLA PV neurons during fear learning, with greater activity to an unexpected than expected aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). This expectation-modulation was specifically because of BLA PV neuron sensitivity to aversive prediction error. Finally, we show that BLA PV neuron function in fear learning is conserved across these variations in prediction error. We suggest that aversive prediction-error modulation of PV neurons could enable BLA fear-learning circuits to retain selectivity for specific sensory features of aversive USs despite variations in the strength of US inputs, thereby permitting the rapid updating of fear associations when these sensory features change.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The capacity to learn about sources of danger in the environment is essential for survival. This learning depends on complex microcircuitries of inhibitory interneurons in the basolateral amygdala. Here, we show that parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons in the rat basolateral amygdala are important for fear learning during moments of danger, but not for extinction learning during moments of safety, and that the activity of these neurons is modulated by expectation of danger. This may enable fear-learning circuits to retain selectivity for specific aversive events across variations in expectation, permitting the rapid updating of learning when aversive events change.</p>

                <p>Loss-of-function mutations in endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 6 (NHE6) cause the X-linked neurologic disorder Christianson syndrome. Patients exhibit symptoms associated with both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative abnormalities. While loss of NHE6 has been shown to overacidify the endosome lumen, and is associated with endolysosome neuropathology, NHE6-mediated mechanisms in endosome trafficking and lysosome function have been understudied. Here, we show that NHE6-null mouse neurons demonstrate worsening lysosome function with time in culture, likely as a result of defective endosome trafficking. NHE6-null neurons exhibit overall reduced lysosomal proteolysis despite overacidification of the endosome and lysosome lumen. Akin to Nhx1 mutants in <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>, we observe decreased endosome-lysosome fusion in NHE6-null neurons. Also, we find premature activation of pH-dependent cathepsin D (CatD) in endosomes. While active CatD is increased in endosomes, CatD activation and CatD protein levels are reduced in the lysosome. Protein levels of another mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR)-dependent enzyme, &beta;-N-acetylglucosaminidase, were also decreased in lysosomes of NHE6-null neurons. M6PRs accumulate in late endosomes, suggesting defective M6PR recycling and retromer function in NHE6-null neurons. Finally, coincident with decreased endosome-lysosome fusion, using total internal reflection fluorescence, we also find a prominent increase in fusion between endosomal multivesicular bodies and the plasma membrane, indicating enhanced exosome secretion from NHE6-null neurons. In summary, in addition to overacidification of endosomes and lysosomes, loss of NHE6 leads to defects in endosome maturation and trafficking, including enhanced exosome release, contributing to lysosome deficiency and potentially leading to neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss-of-function mutations in the endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 6 (NHE6) cause Christianson syndrome, an X-linked neurologic disorder. Loss of NHE6 has been shown to overacidify endosomes; however, endosome trafficking mechanisms have been understudied, and the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration are largely unknown. In NHE6-null mouse neurons <I>in vitro</I>, we find worsening lysosome function with days in culture. Notably, pH-dependent lysosome enzymes, such as cathepsin D, have reduced activity in lysosomes yet increased, precocious activity in endosomes in NHE6-null neurons. Further, endosomes show reduced fusion to lysosomes, and increased fusion to the plasma membrane with increased exosome release. This study identifies new mechanisms involving defective endosome maturation and trafficking that impair lysosome function in Christianson syndrome, likely contributing to neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatostatin-Positive Interneurons Contribute to Seizures in SCN8A Epileptic Encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy is a devastating epilepsy syndrome caused by mutant <I>SCN8A</I>, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6. To date, it is unclear if and how inhibitory interneurons, which express Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6, influence disease pathology. Using both sexes of a transgenic mouse model of <I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy, we found that selective expression of the R1872W <I>SCN8A</I> mutation in somatostatin (SST) interneurons was sufficient to convey susceptibility to audiogenic seizures. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments revealed that SST interneurons from mutant mice were hyperexcitable but hypersensitive to action potential failure via depolarization block under normal and seizure-like conditions. Remarkably, GqDREADD-mediated activation of WT SST interneurons resulted in prolonged electrographic seizures and was accompanied by SST hyperexcitability and depolarization block. Aberrantly large persistent sodium currents, a hallmark of <I>SCN8A</I> mutations, were observed and were found to contribute directly to aberrant SST physiology in computational modeling and pharmacological experiments. These novel findings demonstrate a critical and previously unidentified contribution of SST interneurons to seizure generation not only in <I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy, but epilepsy in general.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy is a devastating neurological disorder that results from <I>de novo</I> mutations in the sodium channel isoform Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6. Inhibitory neurons express Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6, yet their contribution to seizure generation in <I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy has not been determined. We show that mice expressing a human-derived <I>SCN8A</I> variant (R1872W) selectively in somatostatin (SST) interneurons have audiogenic seizures. Physiological recordings from SST interneurons show that <I>SCN8A</I> mutations lead to an elevated persistent sodium current which drives initial hyperexcitability, followed by premature action potential failure because of depolarization block. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of WT SST interneurons leads to audiogenic seizure activity. These findings provide new insight into the importance of SST inhibitory interneurons in seizure initiation, not only in <I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy, but for epilepsy broadly.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Composition within and between Languages in the Bilingual Mind: MEG Evidence from Korean/English Bilinguals</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability of the human brain to build complex expressions from simpler parts is fascinating, but the ability of the bilingual brain to do so is perhaps even more remarkable. When highly proficient bilinguals converse, they can fluidly switch from one language to another even inside sentences. Thus, they build expressions using words from more than one language. How are bilinguals able to compose words across different languages in real time? While robust evidence has implicated the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) for the composition of words within one language, we do not know how the LATL, or other regions implicated for composition, operates when the language switches. We also do not know whether prefrontal regions associated with language control are recruited for language switching during composition. We addressed these questions with magnetoencephalography measurements in bilinguals who are fluent in two typologically distant languages, English and Korean. We observed early composition effects in the LATL at ~200 ms that were unaffected by either language or orthography switching, which was also varied (Hangul vs Roman alphabet). Thus, the combinatory mechanism at 200 ms housed in the anterior temporal cortex appears blind to the language in which its input concepts are expressed. However, in later time windows, language and orthography switching interacted both in regions implicated for composition [LATL, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG)] as well as in regions associated with language control (ACC, LIFG). This establishes a starting point for understanding how bilingual brains code switch: words are initially combined without consideration of which language they come from, but language switching affects later processing.</p>

                E. coli strains 4s, F5 and F17, whose O antigens are structurally characterized and shown to effectively shield the cell surface from bacteriophage attack, were used as the hosts to isolate novel RB49-like bacteriophages. Three  novel phage isolates were obtained, and their genomes were sequenced and annotated. Despite high overall identity levels of these genomic sequences, the variants of large distal tail fiber subunit, orthologous to the bacteriophage T2 long tail receptor recognition protein gp38, were unique for each phage, suggesting their role in host range determination. The annotated genomes are available via NCBI Genbank, acc. numbers MZ504876-MZ504878.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Asymptomatic COVID-19 patient with a subtle hypercoagulable state and fluctuating D-dimer level [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: COVID-19 can infect an asymptomatic person silently without any overt symptoms despite diffuse blood clots throughout the body. Clot formation is induced by COVID-19 associated coagulopathy that can cause a high mortality rate. D-dimer, a fairly decisive marker for the coagulopathy event, is physiologically a marker of the fibrinolysis process. The increase of D-dimers in COVID-19 cases must be followed up because it relates to the initiation of a cytokine storm. Case presentation: We report an asymptomatic patient with sudden D-dimer elevation who received anticoagulant therapy. After three days of heparin administration, D-dimer results became normal and anticoagulant therapy was stopped. However, on the 12th day, the D-dimer level rebounded back and was followed by an increase of hs-C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IL-6, although SARS-CoV-2 PCR result became negative. A hyperglycaemic reaction and a sudden increase of HbA1C was observed in the patient. After three weeks D-dimer had returned to normal levels, and so did the other markers. The patient recovered fully and still no symptoms were obvious. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients without symptoms may be at risk of an asymptomatic coagulopathy process. The decreasing level of D-dimer erroneously cannot ensure that the coagulopathy process stops.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Leveraging biochemical reactions to unravel functional impacts of cancer somatic variants affecting protein interaction interfaces [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Considering protein mutations in their biological context is essential for understanding their functional impact, interpretation of high-dimensional datasets and development of effective targeted therapies in personalized medicine. Methods: We combined the curated knowledge of biochemical reactions from Reactome with the analysis of interaction-mediating 3D interfaces from Mechismo. In addition, we provided a software tool for users to explore and browse the analysis results in a multi-scale perspective starting from pathways and reactions to protein-protein interactions and protein 3D structures. Results: We analyzed somatic mutations from TCGA, revealing several significantly impacted reactions and pathways in specific cancer types. We found examples of genes not yet listed as oncodrivers, whose rare mutations were predicted to affect cancer processes similarly to known oncodrivers. Some identified processes lack any known oncodrivers, which suggests potentially new cancer-related processes (e.g. complement cascade reactions). Furthermore, we found that mutations perturbing certain processes are significantly associated with distinct phenotypes (i.e. survival time) in specific cancer types (e.g. PIK3CA centered pathways in LGG and UCEC cancer types), suggesting the translational potential of our approach for patient stratification. Our analysis also uncovered several druggable processes (e.g. GPCR signalling pathways) containing enriched reactions, providing support for new off-label therapeutic options. Conclusions: In summary, we have established a multi-scale approach to study genetic variants based on protein-protein interaction 3D structures. Our approach is different from previously published studies in its focus on biochemical reactions and can be applied to other data types (e.g. post-translational modifications) collected for many types of disease.

                Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) recurrency rate is still high despite patients receiving complete treatment. The response to treatment may vary depending on the type of histopathology and Epstein-Barr virus, however the mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies have found that there is a relationship between response to treatment and the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). CD44+ cancer stem cells may cause cancer cells to be resistant to treatment. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aims to determine the correlation between CD44 + cancer stem cell expression and the histopathological types of NPC. Method: Samples were obtained from NPC biopsies of type I, II, III patients (based on WHO histopathology criteria), who had not received prior treatment. CD44+ expression was examined using immunohistochemistry methods by staining CD44+ monoclonal antibodies. The degree of CD44+ cell membrane expression was based on the immunoreactive score scale or the Remmele index scale. Results: Most histopathological types were WHO type III (21 patients, 50%), followed by type II (18 patients, 42.86%), and type I (3 patients, 7.14%). CD44 + expression on type I showed one patient had moderate positive and two patients had a high-positive expression. In type II, 10 were moderate positive and eight were high-positive. In type III, one patient was low-positive, 11 were moderate positive and nine patients were high-positive. Statistical analysis showed that the CD44+ expression difference between the three histopathology types were not statistically significant. Conclusion: There were no correlations between CD44 + expression and histopathological type of NPC.

     alt="Basal forebrain magnocellular cholinergic systems are damaged in mice following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia"/>
<p>Mouse cholinergic systems: Poor executive function and decreases in memory and learning are seen after neonatal HIE. We examined the cholinergic systems to determine if there is pathology there that could contribute to these functional outcomes. In contrast to normal, after neonatal HI on P10, loss of permanent attrition of ChAT neurons in the MSN, nbM, and striatum is found. ChAT+ neurons are crenated with shorter dystrophic dendrites. Increased and larger lysosomes are also present in the nbM. Within the injured ipsilateral cortex, AChE activity is abnormally increased. We hypothesize that permanent injury to the cholinergic systems after neonatal HI is responsible for these poor neurologic outcomes.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes lifelong neurologic disability. Despite the use of therapeutic hypothermia, memory deficits and executive functions remain severely affected. Cholinergic neurotransmission from the basal forebrain to neocortex and hippocampus is central to higher cortical functions. We examined the basal forebrain by light microscopy and reported loss of choline acetyltransferase-positive (ChAT)+ neurons, at postnatal day (P) 40, in the ipsilateral medial septal nucleus (MSN) after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in mice. There was no loss of ChAT+ neurons in the ipsilateral nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) and striatum. Ipsilateral striatal and nbM ChAT+ neurons were abnormal with altered immunoreactivity for ChAT, shrunken and crenated somas, and dysmorphic appearing dendrites. Using confocal images with 3D reconstruction, nbM ChAT+ dendrites in HI mice were shorter than sham (<i>p</i> = .0001). Loss of ChAT+ neurons in the MSN directly correlated with loss of ipsilateral hippocampal area. In the nbM and striatum, percentage of abnormal ChAT+ neurons correlated with loss of ipsilateral cerebral cortical and striatal area, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity increased in adjacent ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus and the increase was linearly related to loss of cortical and hippocampal area. Numbers and size of cathepsin D+ lysosomes increased in large neurons in the ipsilateral nbM. After neonatal HI, abnormalities were found throughout the major cholinergic systems in relationship to amount of forebrain area loss. There was also an upregulation of cathepsin D+ particles within the nbM. Cholinergic neuropathology may underlie the permanent dysfunction in learning, memory, and executive function after neonatal brain injury.</p>

                A substantial amount of data about the COVID-19 pandemic is generated every day. Yet, data streaming, while considerably visualized, is not accompanied with modelling techniques to provide real-time insights. This study introduces a unified platform, COVIDSpread, which integrates visualization capabilities with advanced statistical methods for predicting the virus spread in the short run, using real-time data. The platform uses time series models to capture any possible non-linearity in the data. COVIDSpread enables lay users, and experts, to examine the data and develop several customized models with different restrictions such as models developed for a specific time window of the data.

<p>We examined sites of isotocin (IT) action throughout an evolutionarily conserved vocal motor network that is shared by nearly all vocal vertebrates. Using the highly vocal plainfin midshipman (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>) fish, we find that IT receptor (R) mRNA and IT-like fibers are widespread throughout the vocal motor network. Next, using a neural activity marker, we show that ITR dense nuclei within forebrain and midbrain nodes are differentially activated during vocal courtship. Midshipman photo credit: Margaret Marchaterre

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptides, including oxytocin-like peptides, are a conserved group of hormones that regulate a wide range of social behaviors, including vocal communication. In the current study, we evaluate whether putative brain sites for the actions of isotocin (IT), the oxytocin (OT) homolog of teleost fishes are associated with vocal courtship and circuitry in the plainfin midshipman fish (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>). During the breeding season, nesting males produce advertisement calls known as “hums” to acoustically court females at night and attract them to nests. We first identify IT receptor (ITR) mRNA in evolutionarily conserved regions of the forebrain preoptic area (POA), anterior hypothalamus (AH), and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), and in two topographically separate populations within the hindbrain vocal pattern generator– duration-coding vocal prepacemaker (VPP) and amplitude-coding vocal motor nuclei (VMN) that also innervate vocal muscles. We also verify that ITR expression overlaps known distribution sites of OT-like immunoreactive fibers. Next, using phosphorylated ribosomal subunit 6 (pS6) as a marker for activated neurons, we demonstrate that ITR-containing neurons in the anterior parvocellular POA, AH, PAG, VPP, and VMN are activated in humming males. Posterior parvocellular and magno/gigantocellular divisions of the POA remain constitutively active in nonhumming males that are also in a reproductive state. Together with prior studies of midshipman fish and other vertebrates, our findings suggest that IT-signaling influences male courtship behavior, in part, by acting on brain regions that broadly influence behavioral state (POA) as well as the initiation (POA and PAG) and temporal structure (VPP and VMN) of advertisement hums.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lightning Behaviour during the COVID-19 Pandemic [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background COVID-19 has drastically dampened human activities since early 2020. Studies have shown that this has resulted in changes in air temperature and humidity. Since lightning activities are dependent on air temperature and humidity, this study is conducted to evaluate the correlation between the intensity of lightning activities with the atmospheric changes, and investigates the changes, in lightning activities due to atmospheric changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The hypothesis was tested through a t-test and Pearson’s correlation study. The variation trend of lightning strikes count (LSC) in Europe and Oceania during the five months COVID-19 lockdown period (March – July) compared to the same period in the previous five years from 2015 to 2019 is investigated. Results Statistical analysis shows the LSC in Europe and Oceania during the lockdown period dropped significantly by more than 50% and 44% respectively compared to the same period in previous five years. Furthermore, LSC was found to be positively correlated with air temperature and relative humidity in Europe. However, in Oceania, LSC seems to be only positively correlated with air temperature but negatively correlated with relative humidity. Conclusions This study seems to suggest that lightning activities have significantly changed during this pandemic due to reduction in human activities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unleashing frugal innovation in private higher education institutions via intellectual capital: a systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Given the persistent challenges to the higher education business model, private higher education institutions (PHEIs) are exploring myriad ways to increase enrolment and income, while aggressively managing spending. Many PHEIs are facing financial distress and struggling because of decreasing budgets and declining revenue. Thus, carving unique strategies that direct the institution to focus on its core competencies, making additional budget cuts without compromising quality, developing new revenue streams, embracing new technology, and offering affordable programs, will ultimately lead to financial success. Frugal innovation (FI) can shed light on these challenges. Methods: This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate and analyse prior research that focused on FI within the sphere of intellectual capital (IC) and information technology capabilities (ITC) research, and their relationships in PHEIs. Transfield’s five phases were employed to extract journal articles published over a thirty-year period (1990 to 2020) from major online databases using keyword searches. Although an initial search generated 76,025 papers, the search for IC and FI yielded 41 papers, and finally only two papers were selected as they clearly related IC with FI. Results: There was a research gap in the literature published from 1990 to 2020 regarding IC applications to achieve FI. This work revealed that IC and ITC research for FI in PHEI remain insufficiently explored.   Conclusions: Further research is required on the evaluation model of IC, ITC and FI, methodologies, empirical analysis, and the development of measurement metrics. A limitation to this study is the number of keywords selected.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Morphological analysis of the cerebellum and its efferent system in a basal actinopterygian fish, Polypterus senegalus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although all vertebrate cerebella contain granule cells, Purkinje cells, and efferent neurons, the cellular arrangement and neural circuitry are highly diverse. In amniotes, cerebellar efferent neurons form clusters, deep cerebellar nuclei, lie deep in the cerebellum, and receive synaptic inputs from Purkinje cells but not granule cells. However, in the cerebellum of teleosts, the efferent neurons, called eurydendroid cells, lie near the cell bodies of Purkinje cells, and receive inputs both from axons of Purkinje cells and granule cell parallel fibers. It is largely unknown how the cerebellar structure evolved in ray-finned fish (actinopterygians). To address this issue, we analyzed the cerebellum of a bichir <i>Polypterus senegalus</i>, one of the most basal actinopterygians. We found that the cell bodies of Purkinje cells are not aligned in a layer; incoming climbing fibers terminate mainly on the basal portion of Purkinje cells, revealing that the <i>Polypterus</i> cerebellum has unique features among vertebrate cerebella. Retrograde labeling and marker analyses of the efferent neurons revealed that their cell bodies lie in restricted granular areas but not as deep cerebellar nuclei in the cerebellar white matter. The efferent neurons have long dendrites like eurydendroid cells, although they do not reach the molecular layer. Our findings suggest that the efferent system of the bichir cerebellum has intermediate features between teleosts and amniote vertebrates, and provides a model to understand the basis generating diversity in actinopterygian cerebella.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Nuclear Factor I in neurons, glia and during the formation of Müller glia‐derived progenitor cells in avian, porcine and primate retinas</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The regenerative potential of Müller glia (MG) is extraordinary in fish, poor in chick and terrible in mammals. In the chick model, MG readily reprogram into proliferating Müller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), but neuronal differentiation is very limited. The factors that suppress the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick are slowly being revealed. Isoforms of Nuclear Factor I (NFI) are cell-intrinsic factors that limit neurogenic potential; these factors are required for the formation of MG in the developing mouse retina (Clark et al., 2019) and deletion of these factors reprograms MG into neuron-like cells in mature mouse retina (Hoang et al., 2020). Accordingly, we sought to characterize the patterns of expression NFIs in the developing, mature and damaged chick retina. In addition, we characterized patterns of expression of NFIs in the retinas of large mammals, pigs and monkeys. Using a combination of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunolabeling we probed for patterns of expression. In embryonic chick, levels of NFIs are very low in early E5 (embryonic day 5) retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), up-regulated in E8 RPCs, further up-regulated in differentiating MG at E12 and E15. NFIs are maintained in mature resting MG, microglia and neurons. Levels of NFIs are reduced in activated MG in retinas treated with NMDA and/or insulin+FGF2, and further down-regulated in proliferating MGPCs. However, levels of NFIs in MGPCs were significantly higher than those seen in RPCs. Immunolabeling for NFIA and NFIB closely matched patterns of expression revealed in different types of retinal neurons and glia, consistent with findings from scRNA-seq. In addition, we find expression of NFIA and NFIB through progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone at the far periphery of the retina. We find similar patterns of expression for NFIs in scRNA-seq databases for pig and monkey retinas. Patterns of expression of NFIA and NFIB were validated with immunofluorescence in pig and monkey retinas wherein these factors were predominantly detected in MG and a few types of inner retinal neurons. In summary, NFIA and NFIB are prominently expressed in developing chick retina and by mature neurons and glia in the retinas of chicks, pigs and monkeys. Although levels of NFIs are decreased in chick, in MGPCs these levels remain higher than those seen in neurogenic RPCs. We propose that the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick retina is suppressed by NFIs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">Mortimer Mishkin (1926–2021): A life of science with humility and grace</a></h4>

              
                Mort Mishkin’s career started in Donald Hebb’s office in 1947. Hebb was a newly appointed assistant professor at McGill University, having just arrived from the Yerkes primate research institute in Orange Park, Florida, where he had worked with Karl Lashley. Mort, along with another graduate student, Brenda Milner, attended Hebb’s lectures. In Hebb’s class, they studied his book, The Organization of Behavior, chapter by chapter. At that time, there was only a single tattered manuscript copy of the book that was passed around the class.

                In this issue of Neuron, Stern et al. (2021) demonstrate that cell-type-specific ablation of RhoA differentially affects axon regeneration outcomes in spinal cord injury models. Their findings highlight the importance of considering cell-type-specific strategies to promote axon regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">Superfood for axons: Glial exosomes boost axonal energetics by delivery of SIRT2</a></h4>

              
                Axon integrity depends on support by glia facilitating axonal maintenance and energy homeostasis, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this issue of Neuron, Chamberlain et al. (2021) provide evidence that oligodendrocyte-to-axon transfer of SIRT2 via extracellular vesicles (exosomes) enables deacetylation of mitochondrial proteins, enhancing axonal energy production.

                In this issue of Neuron, Ibrahim et al.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Feedforward mechanisms of cross-orientation interactions in mouse V1</a></h4>

              
                Cross-orientation interactions result in diverse effects in mouse V1. Barbera et al. use a combination of calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and modeling to reveal that this heterogeneity can be explained by a single feedforward mechanism: plaids can drive facilitation or suppression depending on alignment with the neurons’ receptive fields.

                <p>Nature, Published online: 03 November 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04050-9">doi:10.1038/s41586-021-04050-9</a></p>Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) has provided significant understanding of time-resolved processes of various systems in biology, for example, rhodopsin, which underlies our vision. The approach involves femtosecond-length X-ray pulses directed at protein crystals and has been used to study various photoactive proteins. However, the function of proteins such as rhodopsin requires trans–cis isomerization of a chromophore, which involves crossing of a conical intersection—a funnel separating potential energy surfaces—at timescales faster than what can be achieved experimentally. Here, Ourmazd and colleagues report a machine learning analysis of SFX data of photoactive yellow protein, which resolves the protein passing through a conical intersection, providing information about the potential energy surfaces involved and achieving time resolution of less than 10 fs. This approach offers an opportunity to understand some of the fastest processes in biology by extracting even more information from SFX datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rotational dynamics in motor cortex are consistent with a feedback controller</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have identified rotational dynamics in motor cortex (MC) which many assume arise from intrinsic connections in MC. However, behavioural and neurophysiological studies suggest that MC behaves like a feedback controller where continuous sensory feedback and interactions with other brain areas contribute substantially to MC processing. We investigated these apparently conflicting theories by building recurrent neural networks that controlled a model arm and received sensory feedback from the limb. Networks were trained to counteract perturbations to the limb and to reach towards spatial targets. Network activities and sensory feedback signals to the network exhibited rotational structure even when the recurrent connections were removed. Furthermore, neural recordings in monkeys performing similar tasks also exhibited rotational structure not only in MC but also in somatosensory cortex. Our results argue that rotational structure may also reflect dynamics throughout the voluntary motor system involved in online control of motor actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Population receptive fields in non-human primates from whole-brain fMRI and large-scale neurophysiology in visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Population receptive field (pRF) modeling is a popular fMRI method to map the retinotopic organization of the human brain. While fMRI-based pRF-maps are qualitatively similar to invasively recorded single-cell receptive fields in animals, it remains unclear what neuronal signal they represent. We addressed this question in awake non-human primates comparing whole-brain fMRI and large-scale neurophysiological recordings in areas V1 and V4 of the visual cortex. We examined the fits of several pRF-models based on the fMRI BOLD-signal, multi-unit spiking activity (MUA) and local field potential (LFP) power in different frequency bands. We found that pRFs derived from BOLD-fMRI were most similar to MUA-pRFs in V1 and V4, while pRFs based on LFP gamma power also gave a good approximation. FMRI-based pRFs thus reliably reflect neuronal receptive field properties in the primate brain. In addition to our results in V1 and V4, the whole-brain fMRI measurements revealed retinotopic tuning in many other cortical and subcortical areas with a consistent increase in pRF-size with increasing eccentricity, as well as a retinotopically specific deactivation of default-mode network nodes similar to previous observations in humans.
