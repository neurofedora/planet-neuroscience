              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90713">Translational regulation enhances distinction of cell types in the nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Multicellular organisms are composed of specialized cell types with distinct proteomes. While recent advances in single-cell transcriptome analyses have revealed differential expression of mRNAs, cellular diversity in translational profiles remains underinvestigated. By performing RNA-seq and Ribo-seq in genetically defined cells in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain, we here revealed substantial post-transcriptional regulations that augment the cell-type distinctions at the level of protein expression. Specifically, we found that translational efficiency of proteins fundamental to neuronal functions, such as ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, was maintained low in glia, leading to their preferential translation in neurons. Notably, distribution of ribosome footprints on these mRNAs exhibited a remarkable bias toward the 5′ leaders in glia. Using transgenic reporter strains, we provide evidence that the small upstream open-reading frames in the 5’ leader confer selective translational suppression in glia. Overall, these findings underscore the profound impact of translational regulation in shaping the proteomics for cell-type distinction and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving cell-type diversity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-855/v2?src=rss">Comparative evaluation and correlation of variations in articular disc morphology as assessed by automated segmentation using deep learning on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images in Class II (vertical) TMD cases, Class II (horizontal) TMD cases and Cl</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) encompasses several clinical manifestations, which are characterized by temporomandibular joint and masticatory muscle discomfort and dysfunction (TMJ). The best imaging technique for evaluating TMJ is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which makes it possible to see the anatomical and pathological characteristics of every joint component. In recent years, convolutional neural networks -based deep learning algorithms have been favoured because of their outstanding capability in recognizing objects in medical images. The objective of this study is to assess, compare and co-rrelate articular disc morphology by automated segmentation using deep learning on MRI images in skeletal Class II (vertical growth pattern) TMD cases as compared to skeletal Class II (horizontal growth pattern) TMD cases and Class I non-TMD cases Methods: Grading of skeletal Class II (vertical growth pattern) cases and skeletal Class II (horizontal growth pattern) cases based on severity of TMD will be carried out using diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders. Bilateral sagittal as well as coronal MRI images will be obtained. A convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder-decoder named U-Net will be used to segment the articular disc on MRI. Understanding the nature of variations between Class I and both types of Class IIs will help orthodontists to better predict the potential risk for the development of TMDs and accordingly take precautions while doing treatment in such cases. Moreover, it can be used to automate TMD diagnosis and other smart applications. Conclusions: This study will aid in identifying articular disc morphology on MRI. The deep learning algorithms with effective data augmentation may perform better in MRI readings than human clinicians when using the same data, which will be advantageous for TMD diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1574/v2?src=rss">Factors contributing to moral distress among intensive care nurses: A scoping review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The intensive care unit (ICU) is a busy and complex workplace, and several work-related and personal factors are known to make ICU nurses more vulnerable to moral distress than other healthcare professionals. It is crucial to identify these factors to guide future studies and preventive strategies. This scoping review explores such factors to present current knowledge on the factors that trigger moral distress and to guide future research by reviewing studies to explore and summarize factors that trigger moral distress in ICU nurses. Methods: The PubMed, EBSCO, and CINAHL Plus databases were searched to identify potentially relevant studies published between 2011 to 2022. Inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed studies published in English that provided results regarding factors causes or correlated to moral distress in ICU nurses. After removing 618 duplicates, 316 papers were excluded after title and abstract screening, leaving 71 articles for full-text screening. A further 54 articles were excluded as their outcomes did not include factors that caused moral distress, or were not specific to ICU nurses, so 17 studies were eventually analysed using qualitative content analysis through an inductive approach. The findings of the articles were extracted and coded independently by two authors, and data were grouped and categorized. Results: The content categories of factors contributing to ICU nurses' moral distress were organized into themes and subthemes. Four major themes were identified: Powerlessness, end-of-life care, ineffective teamwork, and personal characteristics of ICU nurses. Conclusions: This review highlights the factors that contribute to moral distress in critical care nurses, which are mainly attributable to the organizational climate and the nature of the ICU clinical environment. Descriptive and intervention studies (experimental or action research) must investigate causality between identified variables to inform management strategies to improve support for ICU nurses’ coping relative to moral distress.

                Background: First line (1L) TP-Ex-like regimen followed by 2nd-line (2L) immunotherapy represents one of the standards of care in platinum-sensitive recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (R/M SCCHN). We report our experience from 2 tertiary care institutions of India. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients of platinum-sensitive R/M SCCHN treated with 1L weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab (PCC) regimen followed by cetuximab maintenance (if non-progressive) or 2L nivolumab or oral metronomic chemotherapy (OMCT) on progression. Overall response rates (ORR), progression-free survival after 1L and 2L (PFS-1 & PFS-2), overall survival (OS), and safety were evaluated. Results: The study included 54 patients; median age 56.5 years; 89% men; 11% had cardiac dysfunction; 13% had renal dysfunction. After 1L PCC, ORR was 59.3%; median PFS-1 was 7.031 months; 61% had progression; 35% were treated with nivolumab and 18% with OMCT. The ORR was 26.3% (nivolumab) and 10% (OMCT). Median PFS-2 was 6.5 months (nivolumab) and 2 months (OMCT). The median OS was 15.01 months (entire cohort), 20.6 months (nivolumab), and 7 months (OMCT). Grade III/IV adverse events on PCC included neutropenia (31.4%), anaemia (35.1%), thrombocytopenia (7.4%), febrile neutropenia (11.1%), and skin reaction (16.6%); no Grade-III/IV treatment-related toxicities on 2L. Conclusions: 1L weekly PCC is an effective regimen for palliative therapy of platinum- sensitive R/MSCCHN with an acceptable toxicity profile. The addition of 2L nivolumab on progression further improves the outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-796/v1?src=rss">Diagnostic and Prognostic Values of miRNAs in High-Grade Gliomas: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, have grim prognoses, necessitating early diagnostic and prognostic indicators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), influential in cancer research, show potential as glioma biomarkers. This systematic review aimed to examine the efficacy of miRNAs in the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies published from 2013 to 2023. The eligibility criteria included high-grade glioma, histopathological confirmation, miRNA samples from cerebrospinal fluid or plasma, and relevant outcome data. Studies were excluded if they were experimental or reviews and not in English. Results Of the 1120 initial results, 8 studies involving 660 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Several studies have assessed miRNA expression and its association with diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade gliomas. Overexpression of miR-221, miR-222, miR-210, miR-21, miR-125b, and miR-223 and under-expression of miR-15b and miR-124-3p showed significant potential in differentiating high-grade glioma patients from controls. Additionally, miRNAs are associated with distinct tumorigenic pathways. Conclusion Elevated or depressed expression levels of specific circulating miRNAs hold significant promise as noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. These miRNAs offer valuable insights into disease progression and patient outcome. Further validation through extensive clinical trials and in-depth mechanistic studies is essential to realize their full clinical utility.

Chromatin is a polymer complex of DNA and proteins that regulates gene expression. The three-dimensional (3D) structure and organization of chromatin controls DNA transcription and replication. High-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques generate Hi-C maps that can provide insight into the 3D structure of chromatin. Hi-C maps can be represented as a symmetric matrix A i j, where each element represents the average contact probability or number of contacts between chromatin loci <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. Previous studies have detected topologically associating domains (TADs), or self-interacting regions in A i j within which the contact probability is greater than that outside the region. Many algorithms have been developed to identify TADs within Hi-C maps. However, most TAD identification algorithms are unable to identify nested or overlapping TADs and for a given Hi-C map there is significant variation in the location and number of TADs identified by different methods. We develop a novel method to identify TADs, KerTAD, using a kernel-based technique from computer vision and image processing that is able to accurately identify nested and overlapping TADs. We benchmark this method against state-of-the-art TAD identification methods on both synthetic and experimental data sets. We find that the new method consistently has higher true positive rates (TPR) and lower false discovery rates (FDR) than all tested methods for both synthetic and manually annotated experimental Hi-C maps. The TPR for KerTAD is also largely insensitive to increasing noise and sparsity, in contrast to the other methods. We also find that KerTAD is consistent in the number and size of TADs identified across replicate experimental Hi-C maps for several organisms. Thus, KerTAD will improve automated TAD identification and enable researchers to better correlate changes in TADs to biological phenomena, such as enhancer-promoter interactions and disease states.

Converting cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data into high-quality structural models is a challenging problem of outstanding importance. Current refinement methods often generate unbalanced models in which physico-chemical quality is sacrificed for excellent fit to the data. Furthermore, these techniques struggle to represent the conformational heterogeneity averaged out in low-resolution regions of density maps. Here we introduce EMMIVox, a Bayesian inference approach to determine single-structure models as well as structural ensembles from cryo-EM maps. EMMIVox automatically balances experimental information with accurate physico-chemical models of the system and the surrounding environment, including waters, lipids, and ions. Explicit treatment of data correlation and noise as well as inference of accurate B-factors enable determination of structural models and ensembles with both excellent fit to the data and high stereochemical quality, thus outperforming state-of-the-art refinement techniques.

The abundance of distractors in the world poses a major challenge to our brain’s limited processing capacity, but little is known about how selective attention modulates stimulus representations in the brain to reduce interference and support durable target memory. Here, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in a selective attention task in which target and distractor pictures of different visual categories were simultaneously presented. Participants were asked to selectively process the target according to the effective cue, either before the encoding period (i.e., perceptual attention) or the maintenance period (i.e., reflective attention). On the next day, participants were asked to perform a memory recognition task in the scanner in which the targets, distractors, and novel items were presented in a pseudorandom order. Behavioral results showed that perceptual attention was better at enhancing target memory and reducing distractor memory than reflective attention, although the overall memory capacity (memory for both target and distractor) was comparable. Using multiple-voxel pattern analysis of the neural data, we found more robust target representation and weaker distractor representation in working memory for perceptual attention than for reflective attention. Interestingly, perceptual attention partially shifted the regions involved in maintaining the target representation from the visual cortex to the parietal cortex. Furthermore, the targets and distractors simultaneously presented in the perceptual attention condition showed reduced pattern similarity in the parietal cortex during retrieval compared to items not presented together. This neural pattern repulsion positively correlated with individuals’ recognition of both targets and distractors. These results emphasize the critical role of selective attention in transforming memory representations to reduce interference and improve long-term memory performance.

                <p>by Aude Bernheim, Jean Cury, Enzo Z. Poirier</p>

Immune defence mechanisms exist across the tree of life in such diversity that prokaryotic antiviral responses have historically been considered unrelated to eukaryotic immunity. Mechanisms of defence in divergent eukaryotes were similarly believed to be largely clade specific. However, recent data indicate that a subset of modules (domains and proteins) from prokaryote defence systems are conserved in eukaryotes and populate many stages of innate immune pathways. In this Essay, we propose the notion of ancestral immunity, which corresponds to the set of immune modules conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. After offering a typology of ancestral immunity, we speculate on the selective pressures that could have led to the differential conservation of specific immune modules across domains of life. The exploration of ancestral immunity is in its infancy and appears full of promises to illuminate immune evolution, and also to identify and decipher immune mechanisms of economic, ecological, and therapeutic importance.

Heterologous sensitization of adenylyl cyclase (AC) results in elevated cAMP signaling transduction that contributes to drug dependence. Inhibiting cullin3-RING ligases by blocking the neddylation of cullin3 abolishes heterologous sensitization, however, the modulating mechanism remains uncharted. Here, we report an essential role of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) protein 2, 5, and 17, especially the dominant isoform KCTD5 in regulating heterologous sensitization of AC1 and morphine dependence via working with cullin3 and the cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) protein. In cellular models, we observed enhanced association of KCTD5 with Gβ and cullin3, along with elevated dissociation of Gβ from AC1 as well as of CAND1 from cullin3 in heterologous sensitization of AC1. Given binding of CAND1 inhibits the neddylation of cullin3, we further elucidated that the enhanced interaction of KCTD5 with both Gβ and cullin3 promoted the dissociation of CAND1 from cullin3, attenuated the inhibitory effect of CAND1 on cullin3 neddylation, ultimately resulted in heterologous sensitization of AC1. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) plays an important role in mediating morphine dependence. Through pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we then demonstrated that KCTD5/cullin3 regulates morphine dependence via modulating heterologous sensitization of AC, likely AC1 in PVT in mice. In summary, the present study revealed the underlying mechanism of heterologous sensitization of AC1 mediated by cullin3 and discovered the role of KCTD proteins in regulating morphine dependence in mice.

Mutagenesis is responsive to many environmental factors. Evolution therefore depends on the environment not only for selection but also in determining the variation available in a population. One such environmental dependency is the inverse relationship between mutation rates and population density in many microbial species. Here, we determine the mechanism responsible for this mutation rate plasticity. Using dynamical computational modelling and in culture mutation rate estimation, we show that the negative relationship between mutation rate and population density arises from the collective ability of microbial populations to control concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. We demonstrate a loss of this density-associated mutation rate plasticity (DAMP) when <i>Escherichia coli</i> populations are deficient in the degradation of hydrogen peroxide. We further show that the reduction in mutation rate in denser populations is restored in peroxide degradation-deficient cells by the presence of wild-type cells in a mixed population. Together, these model-guided experiments provide a mechanistic explanation for DAMP, applicable across all domains of life, and frames mutation rate as a dynamic trait shaped by microbial community composition.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated entorhinal cortex (EC) tau in low beta-amyloid individuals can predict accumulation of pathology and cognitive decline. We compared the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived locus coeruleus integrity, neocortical beta-amyloid burden by positron emission tomography (PET), and hippocampal volume in identifying elevated entorhinal tau signal in asymptomatic individuals who are considered beta-amyloid PET-negative.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 188 asymptomatic individuals (70.78 ± 11.51 years, 58% female) who underwent 3T-MRI of the locus coeruleus, Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB), and Flortaucipir (FTP) PET. Associations between elevated EC tau and neocortical PiB, hippocampal volume, or locus coeruleus integrity were evaluated and compared using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses in the PiB− sample with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0. Associations with clinical progression (CDR-sum-of-boxes) over a time span of 6 years were evaluated with Cox proportional hazard models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 26 (21%) individuals with high EC FTP in the CDR = 0/PiB− sample. Locus coeruleus integrity was a significantly more sensitive and specific predictor of elevated EC FTP (area under the curve [AUC] = 85%) compared with PiB (AUC = 77%) or hippocampal volume (AUC = 76%). Based on the Youden-index, locus coeruleus integrity obtained a sensitivity of 77% and 85% specificity. Using the resulting locus coeruleus Youden cut-off, lower locus coeruleus integrity was associated with a two-fold increase in clinical progression, including mild cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Locus coeruleus integrity has promise as a low-cost, non-invasive screening instrument to detect early cortical tau deposition and associated clinical progression in asymptomatic, low beta-amyloid individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Maternal obesity before or during pregnancy has been associated previously in offspring with a wide range of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and mental health problems. The effects of maternal obesity on offspring brain structure and function that may be responsible for these poor outcomes are not well understood. We, therefore, undertook a systematic review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies that have assessed the associations of maternal obesity with brain measures in offspring. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycINFO on August 20, 2023. Of 15 eligible studies, seven employed functional MRI (fMRI), five diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and four anatomical MRI (one used both DTI and anatomical MRI) in the offspring. The ages of offspring varied widely: one was a study of fetuses in utero, five of neonates, one of infants, five of school-aged children, two of both neonates and infants, and one of both children and adults. Collectively, 12 studies reported significant associations of maternal obesity with structural or functional alterations of the offspring's brain, most frequently in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. In conclusion, maternal obesity appears to have a profound influence on offspring brain development, particularly within the prefrontal and limbic networks that regulate emotion and behavior. Further studies are needed to identify how changes in brain structure and function mediate the effects of maternal obesity on long-term emotional and behavioral outcomes, as well as the molecular pathways through which maternal obesity alters offspring brain development.</p>

It makes activity more susceptible to perturbation. This is due to excess inhibition in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93204">Glutamate neurotransmission from leptin receptor cells is required for typical puberty and reproductive function in female mice</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamic ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv) is a glutamatergic nucleus essential for the metabolic control of reproduction. However, conditional deletion of leptin receptor long form (LepRb) in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) expressing neurons results in virtually no reproductive deficits. In this study, we determined the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission from leptin responsive PMv neurons on puberty and fertility. We first assessed if stimulation of PMv neurons induces luteinizing hormone (LH) release in fed adult females. We used the stimulatory form of designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in <i>Lepr<sup>Cre</sup></i> (LepRb-Cre) mice. We collected blood sequentially before and for 1 hr after intravenous clozapine-<i>N</i>-oxide injection. LH level increased in animals correctly targeted to the PMv, and LH level was correlated to the number of Fos immunoreactive neurons in the PMv. Next, females with deletion of <i>Slc17a6</i> (Vglut2) in LepRb neurons (<i>Lepr</i><sup>ΔVGlut2</sup>) showed delayed age of puberty, disrupted estrous cycles, increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) concentration in the axon terminals, and disrupted LH secretion, suggesting impaired GnRH release. To assess if glutamate is required for PMv actions in pubertal development, we generated a Cre-induced reexpression of endogenous LepRb (<i>Lepr<sup>loxTB</sup></i>) with concomitant deletion of <i>Slc17a6</i> (Vglut2<i><sup>flox</sup></i>) mice. Rescue of <i>Lepr</i> and deletion of <i>Slc17a6</i> in the PMv was obtained by stereotaxic injection of an adeno-associated virus vector expressing Cre recombinase. Control <i>Lepr<sup>loxTB</sup></i> mice with PMv LepRb rescue showed vaginal opening, follicle maturation, and became pregnant, while <i>Lepr<sup>loxTB</sup></i>;Vglut2<i><sup>flox</sup></i> mice showed no pubertal development. Our results indicate that glutamatergic neurotransmission from leptin sensitive neurons regulates the reproductive axis, and that leptin action on pubertal development via PMv neurons requires Vglut2.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89656">Enrichment of rare codons at 5' ends of genes is a spandrel caused by evolutionary sequence turnover and does not improve translation</a></h4>

              
                Previously, Tuller et al. found that the first 30–50 codons of the genes of yeast and other eukaryotes are slightly enriched for rare codons. They argued that this slowed translation, and was adaptive because it queued ribosomes to prevent collisions. Today, the translational speeds of different codons are known, and indeed rare codons are translated slowly. We re-examined this 5’ slow translation ‘ramp.’ We confirm that 5’ regions are slightly enriched for rare codons; in addition, they are depleted for downstream Start codons (which are fast), with both effects contributing to slow 5’ translation. However, we also find that the 5’ (and 3’) ends of yeast genes are poorly conserved in evolution, suggesting that they are unstable and turnover relatively rapidly. When a new 5’ end forms de novo, it is likely to include codons that would otherwise be rare. Because evolution has had a relatively short time to select against these codons, 5’ ends are typically slightly enriched for rare, slow codons. Opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al., we show by direct experiment that genes with slowly translated codons at the 5’ end are expressed relatively poorly, and that substituting faster synonymous codons improves expression. Direct experiment shows that slow codons do not prevent downstream ribosome collisions. Further informatic studies suggest that for natural genes, slow 5’ ends are correlated with poor gene expression, opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al. Thus, we conclude that slow 5’ translation is a ‘spandrel’--a non-adaptive consequence of something else, in this case, the turnover of 5’ ends in evolution, and it does not improve translation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95191">Emerging role of oncogenic ß-catenin in exosome biogenesis as a driver of immune escape in hepatocellular carcinoma</a></h4>

              
                Immune checkpoint inhibitors have produced encouraging results in cancer patients. However, the majority of ß-catenin-mutated tumors have been described as lacking immune infiltrates and resistant to immunotherapy. The mechanisms by which oncogenic ß-catenin affects immune surveillance remain unclear. Herein, we highlighted the involvement of ß-catenin in the regulation of the exosomal pathway and, by extension, in immune/cancer cell communication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We showed that mutated ß-catenin represses expression of <i>SDC4</i> and <i>RAB27A</i>, two main actors in exosome biogenesis, in both liver cancer cell lines and HCC patient samples. Using nanoparticle tracking analysis and live-cell imaging, we further demonstrated that activated ß-catenin represses exosome release. Then, we demonstrated in 3D spheroid models that activation of β-catenin promotes a decrease in immune cell infiltration through a defect in exosome secretion. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that oncogenic ß-catenin plays a key role in exosome biogenesis. Our study gives new insight into the impact of ß-catenin mutations on tumor microenvironment remodeling, which could lead to the development of new strategies to enhance immunotherapeutic response.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88838">Emotional vocalizations alter behaviors and neurochemical release into the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain center of emotional expression, contributes to acoustic communication by first interpreting the meaning of social sounds in the context of the listener’s internal state, then organizing the appropriate behavioral responses. We propose that modulatory neurochemicals such as acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) provide internal-state signals to the BLA while an animal listens to social vocalizations. We tested this in a vocal playback experiment utilizing highly affective vocal sequences associated with either mating or restraint, then sampled and analyzed fluids within the BLA for a broad range of neurochemicals and observed behavioral responses of adult male and female mice. In male mice, playback of restraint vocalizations increased ACh release and usually decreased DA release, while playback of mating sequences evoked the opposite neurochemical release patterns. In non-estrus female mice, patterns of ACh and DA release with mating playback were similar to males. Estrus females, however, showed increased ACh, associated with vigilance, as well as increased DA, associated with reward-seeking. Experimental groups that showed increased ACh release also showed the largest increases in an aversive behavior. These neurochemical release patterns and several behavioral responses depended on a single prior experience with the mating and restraint behaviors. Our results support a model in which ACh and DA provide contextual information to sound analyzing BLA neurons that modulate their output to downstream brain regions controlling behavioral responses to social vocalizations.

">Coordinated Response Modulations Enable Flexible Use of Visual Information</a></h4>

              
                We use sensory information in remarkably flexible ways. We can generalize by ignoring task-irrelevant features, report different features of a stimulus, and use different actions to report a perceptual judgment. These forms of flexible behavior are associated with small modulations of the responses of sensory neurons. While the existence of these response modulations is indisputable, efforts to understand their function have been largely relegated to theory, where they have been posited to change information coding or enable downstream neurons to read out different visual and cognitive information using flexible weights. Here, we tested these ideas using a rich, flexible behavioral paradigm, multi-neuron, multi-area recordings in primary visual cortex (V1) and mid-level visual area V4. We discovered that those response modulations in V4 (but not V1) contain the ingredients necessary to enable flexible behavior, but not via those previously hypothesized mechanisms. Instead, we demonstrated that these response modulations are precisely coordinated across the population such that downstream neurons have ready access to the correct information to flexibly guide behavior without making changes to information coding or synapses. Our results suggest a novel computational role for task-dependent response modulations: they enable flexible behavior by changing the information that gets out of a sensory area, not by changing information coding within it.

">Physical Exercise Improves Working Memory through Ripple-Spindle Coupling</a></h4>

              
                Spindle-ripple coupling enhances memory consolidation during sleep. Ripples, representing the compressed reactivation of environmental information, provide a mechanism for retaining memory information in chronological order and are also crucial for working memory (WM) during wakefulness. Brief sessions of physical exercise (PE) are proposed to boost WM. In concurrent EEG/MEG sessions, we investigated the role of PE in WM performance and high-frequency-ripple to spindle coupling. Ripples, identified in MEG sensors covering the medial temporal lobe (MTL) region, predicted individual WM performance. Ripples were locked to robust oscillatory patterns in the EEG defined spindle band. Spindle activity and ripples decrease during initial stimulus presentation and rebound after 1 sec. Behaviorally, PE enhanced WM performance. Neurophysiologically, PE scaled the ripple rate with the number of items to be kept in WM and strengthened the coupling between ripple events and spindle oscillations. These findings reveal that PE enhances WM by coordinating ripple-spindle interaction.

">Structure of the Femoral Chordotonal Organ in the Oleander hawkmoth, Daphnis nerii</a></h4>

              
                Insect legs serve as crucial organs for locomotion and also act as sensory probes into the environment. They are involved in several complex movements including walking, jumping, prey capture, manipulation of objects, and self-grooming. These behaviours require continuous modulation of motor output through mechanosensory feedback which is provided by numerous mechanosensors located on the cuticle and within the soft tissue. A key mechanosensory organ in the insect leg, the femoral chordotonal organ (FeCO), detects movements of the femoro-tibial joint. This organ is multifunctional and senses both self-generated movements (proprioception) and external stimuli (exteroception). Movements of the tibia alter the length of FeCO, which activates the embedded mechanosensory neurons. Due to the mechanical nature of these stimuli, the structure and material properties of the FeCO are crucial for their function, alongside neural encoding properties. Here, as a first step towards understanding how its structure modulates its function, we characterized the morphology and anatomy of FeCO in the hawkmoth Daphnis nerii. Using a combination of computed micro-tomography, neuronal dye fills and confocal microscopy, we describe the structure of FeCO and the location, composition and central projections of FeCO neurons. FeCO is located in the proximal half of the femur and is composed of the ventral (vFeCO) and dorsal scoloparia (dFeCO) which vary vastly in their sizes and the number of neurons they house. The arrangement of neurons within dFeCO follows a decreasing size gradient in the proximo-distal axis. The characteristic accessory structures of chordotonal organs, the scolopales, significantly differ in their sizes when compared between the two scoloparia. FeCO neurons project to the central nervous system and terminate in the respective hemiganglia. Using these morphological data, we propose a mechanical model of FeCO, which can help us understand several FeCO properties relating to its physiological function.

">Longitudinal Multi-Tensor Analysis of Neocortical Microstructure in an Animal Model of Cortical Dysplasia</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex is a highly organized structure, with region-specific spatial patterns of cells and fibers constituting cyto- and myelo-architecture, respectively. These architectural features are modulated during neurodevelopment, aging, and disease. While invasive techniques have contributed significantly to our understanding of cortical patterning, the task remains challenging through non-invasive methods. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has advanced to improve sensitivity in identifying cortical features, yet most methods focus on capturing macrostructural characteristics, often overlooking critical microscale components. Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) offers an opportunity to extract quantitative information reflecting microstructural changes. Here we investigate whether advanced multi-tensor dMRI methods can detect microstructural characteristics related to the orientational organization of the myelo- and cyto-architecture in an animal model of cortical dysplasia, a malformation of cortical development. We scanned 32 animals (n=16 experimental; n=16 control) at four different time points (30, 60, 120, and 150 post-natal days) using both structural and multi-shell dMRI. Our dMRI metrics were sampled using a 2D curvilinear system of coordinates as a common anatomical descriptor across animals. Diffusion tensors were labeled according to their orientation with respect to the cortical surface, and derived metrics were analyzed separately. We identified abnormalities in the perpendicular and parallel diffusion components in deeper cortical areas, consistent with histological findings of neuronal and fiber disorganization in animals with dysplasia. Although our methodology is tailored for small species, our protocol shows promise for clinical applications.

">Induction and characterisation of Abeta and tau pathology in AppNL-F/NL-F mice following inoculation with Alzheimer's disease brain homogenate</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated Tau and plaques containing Amyloid-beta (Abeta). The aggregation of these two proteins is considered central to the disease. The lack of animal models that can recapitulate Abeta and tau pathologies without overexpressing these proteins has hindered AD research. Accelerating pathology by inoculating Abeta and tau seeds has helped to understand their prion-like propagation in the brain. Previous studies failed to characterise both Abeta and tau pathologies in vivo upon inoculating AD brain homogenates. Here we present a longitudinal and systematic study; we inoculated the AppNL-F/NL-F knockin mice, which express humanised Abeta and murine wild-type tau, with extracts from diseased human brains to analyse the contribution of Abeta and tau assemblies to AD pathogenesis. We found that mice inoculated with AD brain extracts evinced early and prominent amyloid deposition, while those injected with control brain extracts or vehicle did not. Parenchymal and vascular amyloid accumulated in the same brain regions affected in control-inoculated AppNL-F/NL-F mice. However, the extent of vascular amyloid far exceeded that seen in AppNL-F/NL-F mice injected with control brain extracts, and parenchymal deposits extended to a previously untargeted brain region - the cerebellum. An end-point titration of an AD brain homogenate in AppNL-F/NL-F mice demonstrated that human Abeta seeds can be titrated in a prion-like fashion, which is useful for sample comparison, diagnostic and risk studies. Notably, the inoculation of AppNL-F/NL-F mice with AD brain homogenate induced intense tau phosphorylation, and provides more detailed context for the inoculation of AppNL-F/NL-F mice with human samples to study temporal and mechanistic relationships between Abeta and tau pathology, vascular amyloid deposition and bioactivity of Abeta seeds.

	<p>The issue of literacy challenges among dyslexic adults remains a significant concern. This study investigates spelling deficits among highly educated adults with dyslexia learning a transparent orthography. Thirty-eight Italian dyslexic university students were examined and compared to a group of age- and education-matched typical readers. Firstly, we analyzed spelling performance using a Passage Dictation Test. Additionally, lists of words varying in length and word frequency were dictated under two experimental conditions: a normal condition (NC) and an articulatory suppression condition (ASC). The ASC assessed the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to spell with interference to the phonological (sublexical) spelling procedure, i.e., the most likely compensated spelling strategy of Italian dyslexic spellers. The results clearly indicated that, in spelling the meaningful passage, dyslexic participants underperformed compared to the controls, with a prevalence of lexical errors, despite the comparison with the normative reference data showing only mild spelling difficulties. In spelling isolated words in normal conditions, dyslexic participants performed within the reference norms and as accurately as control participants across all stimuli (short words, high- and low-frequency words), except for long words, where their spelling difficulties were evident. Articulatory suppression significantly impaired dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; performance on short stimuli, reducing the usual sublexical advantage associated with them, and exacerbated misspellings on long words.

	<p>The global population has been significantly affected by the pandemic in terms of physical and mental health. According to transactional theory, individuals have undergone an adaptation process influenced by cognitive control abilities. Emotional responses to COVID-19-related stimuli may interfere with top-down attentional processes, thereby hindering adaptation. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19-related stimuli on attentional processing and to determine whether psychological factors could modulate these effects. A sample of 96 healthy undergraduate students participated in an emotional Stroop task in which they were presented with a series of stimuli, including both neutral and negative COVID-19-related as well as non-COVID-19 stimuli. COVID-19-related PTSD, as an index of distress (PTSS), and trait anxiety were evaluated. Results showed that participants were more accurate in identifying COVID-19-related stimuli compared to non-COVID-19 stimuli. Being female and having higher retrospective PTSS scores related to COVID-19 were predictive of faster reaction times for both neutral and negative COVID-19-related stimuli. This heightened attentional bias toward COVID-19-related stimuli suggests that individuals may be more sensitive to stimuli associated with the pandemic. The results suggest that the association between COVID-19 stimuli and attentional biases extends beyond emotional valence, being retrospectively influenced by mental health, suggesting potential pathways to future mental health challenges.</p>

	<p>Schizophrenia is associated with changes in white matter (WM) integrity and with reduced life expectancy, in part because of the cardiometabolic side effects of antipsychotics. Physical activity (PA) has emerged as a candidate lifestyle intervention that is safe and effective. The study aimed to assess how an adapted PA program delivered remotely by web (e-APA) improved WM integrity in patients with schizophrenia (SZPs) and healthy controls (HCs) and to evaluate associations among WM integrity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and symptom severity. This longitudinal study was conducted over 16 weeks with 31 participants (18 SZPs and 13 HCs). Diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics were employed to assess WM integrity. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), and assessments for clinical symptoms included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Self-evaluation of Negative Symptoms and the Brief Negative Syndrome Scale (BNSS). Only the SZPs had significantly increased WM integrity after the e-APA program, with increased fractional anisotropy and decreased radial diffusivity in fasciculi involved in motor functions and language process. Furthermore, decreased negative symptoms assessed with BNSS were associated with greater WM integrity following the program. These findings suggest that e-APA may improve WM integrity abnormalities and support e-APA as a promising therapeutic strategy.</p>

	<p>Background: Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) improved communicative skills in adults with post-stroke aphasia demonstrating the effectiveness in speech disorders and consequent improvement of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; communication skills. This study aimed to report the efficacy of AAC in the rehabilitation of cognitive disorders and to estimate how the changes in cognitive and communicative functions could enhance the quality of life in patients affected by severe acquired brain injury. Methods: Three patients with pontine cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and meningioma expressed in the posterior cranial fossa, respectively, were submitted to rehabilitative training with AAC for 6 months. Patients underwent to neuropsychological and mood evaluations at the beginning of AAC treatment (T0) and after rehabilitative training (T1). Results: The results support the efficacy of AAC in the improvement of cognitive functions, particularly in memory, attention, and language domains. In addition, we described also an improvement in the quality of life and a decrease in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The AAC seems to be an important rehabilitative technique for the recovery of cognitive functions with a consequent effect in improvement of psychological aspects and quality of life in patients with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).</p>

	<p>Sexual dimorphism in temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and their comorbidity with migraine are important phenomena observed in clinics. TMDs are the most prevalent orofacial pain conditions with jaw joint and masseter muscle dysfunction. Migraine is the predominant headache commonly associated with TMDs. Women much more often suffer from this orofacial pain than men. However, currently, there is no gender-specific therapy for such pain conditions. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms behind sex differences in TMDs as well as their comorbidity with migraines is essential for developing novel approaches for gender-specific treatment of TMDs and related orofacial pain comorbidity. In this review, we summarize recent research progress regarding sex differences in TMDs, focusing on the underlying mechanisms including craniofacial anatomy, hormonal regulation, and roles of opioids, transient receptor potential channels, and endocannabinoid systems. We also discuss the mechanisms of comorbid TMDs and migraine. The information covered in this review will provide mechanistic insights into sex differences in TMDs and their comorbidity with migraine, which could aid in developing effective treatment strategies for the overlapping orofacial pain condition.</p>

                Gutierrez-Morton et al. demonstrate cell-cycle-regulated nucleolar localization and protein abundance of Tof2, a SUMO substrate that anchors Cdc14 phosphatase to the nucleolus. Tof2 polySUMOylation triggers its ubiquitination by STUbL, extraction by Cdc48, and degradation by the proteasome, which promotes the nucleolar release of Cdc14 for mitotic exit.

                Adipose tissue is a major source of circulating exosomal miRNAs. Here, Lino et al. demonstrate that adipocyte secretion of miRNAs is regulated by insulin and this process involves the interaction of RNA-binding proteins, leading to the secretion of miRNAs enriched in those controlling metabolism in distant tissues, including hepatocytes. Thus, extracellular miRNAs are a new layer of endocrine regulation by insulin.

">Directed fMRI-based Functional Connectivity Estimation using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Estimating directed functional connectivity (dFC) within the brain is crucial for comprehending neural interactions. However, conventional methodologies encounter constraints in accuracy, scalability, and interpretation. The method presented here harnesses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to amalgamate the governing physical principles of brain dynamics, thereby improving dFC estimation from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data. In particular, during the training phase, we derive the input weights from a long-short term memory (LSTM) network, which, within our framework, represent the influence of all other brain areas on the specific region under consideration. These input weights are then integrated into the nonlinear differential equation that models the rsfMRI time series within the specific brain area. Through the training of the PINN model, we simultaneously estimate, for each brain area, the biophysical parameters of the model, including the dFC parameters from all the remaining areas. We applied this methodology to both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurotypical data, revealing significant sex-specific differences in connectivity patterns. These findings underscore the potential of PINNs in advancing our understanding of neural dynamics and emphasize the significance of directionality in brain connectivity research.

">Spurious correlations in surface-based functional brain imaging</a></h4>

              
                The study of functional MRI data is increasingly performed after mapping from volumetric voxels to surface vertices. Processing pipelines commonly used to achieve this mapping produce meshes with uneven vertex spacing, with closer neighbours in sulci compared to gyri. Consequently, correlations between the fMRI time series of neighbouring sulcal vertices are stronger than expected. However, the causes, extent, and impacts of this bias are not well understood or widely appreciated. We explain the origins of these biases, and using in-silico models of fMRI data, illustrate how they lead to spurious results. The bias leads to leakage of anatomical cortical folding information into fMRI time series. We show that many common analyses can be affected by this gyral bias, including test-retest reliability, fingerprinting, functional parcellations, regional homogeneity, and brain-behaviour associations. Finally, we provide recommendations to avoid or remedy this spatial bias.

">Connectome predictive modeling of trait mindfulness</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Trait mindfulness refers to one's disposition or tendency to pay attention to their experiences in the present moment, in a non-judgmental and accepting way. Trait mindfulness has been robustly associated with positive mental health outcomes, but its neural underpinnings are poorly understood. Prior resting-state fMRI studies have associated trait mindfulness with within- and between- network connectivity of the default-mode (DMN), fronto-parietal (FPN), and salience networks. However, it is unclear how generalizable the findings are, how they relate to different components of trait mindfulness, and how other networks and brain areas may be involved. Methods: To address these gaps, we conducted the largest resting-state fMRI study of trait mindfulness to-date, consisting of a pre-registered connectome predictive modeling analysis in 367 adults across three samples collected at different sites. Results: In the model-training dataset, we did not find connections that predicted overall trait mindfulness, but we identified neural models of two mindfulness subscales, Acting with Awareness and Non-judging. Models included both positive networks (sets of pairwise connections that positively predicted mindfulness with increasing connectivity) and negative networks, which showed the inverse relationship. The Acting with Awareness and Non-judging positive network models showed distinct network representations involving FPN and DMN, respectively. The negative network models, which overlapped significantly across subscales, involved connections across the whole brain with prominent involvement of somatomotor, visual and DMN networks. Only the negative networks generalized to predict subscale scores out-of-sample, and not across both test datasets. Predictions from both models were also negatively correlated with predictions from a well-established mind-wandering connectome model. Conclusions: We present preliminary neural evidence for a generalizable connectivity models of trait mindfulness based on specific affective and cognitive facets. However, the incomplete generalization of the models across all sites and scanners, limited stability of the models, as well as the substantial overlap between the models, underscores the difficulty of finding robust brain markers of mindfulness facets.

">AgRP1 modulates breeding season-dependent feeding behavior in female medaka</a></h4>

              
                Feeding and reproduction are known to be closely correlated with each other, and the seasonal breeders show breeding season-dependent feeding behavior. However, most model animals do not have definite breeding seasonality, and the mechanisms for such feeding behavior remain unclear. Here, we focused on female medaka (Oryzias latipes); they show breeding season-dependent feeding behavior, and their condition of breeding season can be experimentally controlled by day-length. We first demonstrated that, among previously reported feeding-related peptides (neuropeptides involved in feeding), agouti-related peptide 1 (agrp1) and neuropeptide y b (npyb) show higher brain expression under the breeding condition than under the non-breeding one. Combined with analysis of agrp1 knockout medaka, we obtained results to suggest that long day-induced sexually mature condition, especially ovarian estrogenic signals, increase the expressions of agrp1 in the brain, which results in increased food intake to promote reproduction. Our findings advance the understanding of neural mechanisms of feeding behavior for reproductive success.

	<p>Lack of sleep has been found to be associated with cognitive impairment in children, yet the neural mechanism underlying this relationship remains poorly understood. To address this issue, this study utilized the data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (n = 4930, aged 9&amp;amp;ndash;10), involving their sleep assessments, cognitive measures, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotional n-back task. Using partial correlations analysis, we found that the out-of-scanner cognitive performance was positively correlated with sleep duration. Additionally, the activation of regions of interest (ROIs) in frontal and parietal cortices for the 2-back versus 0-back contrast was positively correlated with both sleep duration and cognitive performance. Mediation analysis revealed that this activation significantly mediated the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive function at both individual ROI level and network level. After performing analyses separately for different sexes, it was revealed that the mediation effect of the task-related activation was present in girls (n = 2546). These findings suggest that short sleep duration may lead to deficit in cognitive function of children, particularly in girls, through the modulation of frontoparietal activation during working memory load.</p>

	<p>This study determines the sensitivity and specificity of a screening test to detect perceptual abnormalities and whether there are differences between gender. Vision is a complex process involving visual perception. Any alterations can affect learning, so having a screening test in Spanish that is easy to use and reliable for timely diagnosis will reduce the percentage of visuo-perceptual interference during learning process. A total of 200 subjects participated, aged between 8 and 15 years old, with good visual acuity, and no strabismus, amblyopia, ocular pathology, or neurological damage. The Petrosyan questionnaire (screening test) was employed to identify symptoms associated with perceptual impairment, and a subsequent assessment was conducted to evaluate perceptual abilities. The mean age was 11.5 years (57% male; 44% female). The screening test indicated that 30% of the subjects were suspected of having perceptual alteration, while 24% were diagnosed with a real alteration in perceptual abilities. The sensitivity was 1 and the specificity was 0.92. The Spanish version of the Petrosyan questionnaire has high sensitivity and specificity values and is therefore considered very accurate for identifying the need for a perceptual assessment. There are statistically significant differences in perceptual abilities according to gender. The female group shows more symptomatology and a higher percentage of alteration in perceptual skills.</p>

	<p>This study aims to assess oculomotor and vestibular endurance by utilizing the Oculomotor and Vestibular Endurance Screening (MoVES) assessment in athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; pre-season and post-season and after a suspected head injury to detect impairment. Athletes (N = 311, 19.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3 years) were recruited to perform the following seven tasks: (1) horizontal saccades, (2) vertical saccades, (3) vergence jumps, (4) horizontal vestibular-oculomotor reflex (VOR), (5) vertical VOR, (6) amplitude of accommodation (AoA), and (7) near point of convergence (NPC). At pre-season, the observed number of eye movements in 60 s are horizontal saccades (74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13 initial 30 s; 67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11 latter 30 s), vertical saccades (70 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13; 66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10), vergence jumps (48 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12; 45 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13), horizontal VOR (38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11; 38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11), and vertical VOR (8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11; 38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11). These results establish a normative database for eye movements within the MoVES assessment and show consistency in the number of movements from pre-season to post-season. The initial results show a trending decrease in the number of eye movements in the initial days post-head injury, which improves to pre-season measures 14&amp;amp;ndash;21 days post-injury. This foundation can be used by future studies to explore the extent of binocular and vestibular endurance dysfunctions caused by head injuries that subside within two weeks.</p>

<p>Ventral subiculum is shown to be involved in learning and memory and mediate affective behaviors. The present study demonstrated the critical role of ventral subiculum in maintaining arousal and sleep, as its lesion caused a profound disturbance of sleep–wake behaviors. Exposure to SPR reversed the VSL-induced alterations in sleep–wakefulness behavior.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ventral subiculum regulates emotion, stress responses, and spatial and social cognition. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated anxiety- and depression-like symptoms, deficits in spatial and social cognition in ventral subicular lesioned (VSL) rats, and restoration of affective and cognitive behaviors following photoperiod manipulation (short photoperiod regime, SPR; 6:18 LD cycle). In the present study, we have studied the impact of VSL on sleep–wake behavioral patterns and the effect of SPR on sleep–wakefulness behavior. Adult male Wistar rats subjected to VSL demonstrated decreased wake duration and enhanced total sleep time due to increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Power spectral analysis indicated increased delta activity during NREMS and decreased sigma band power during all vigilance states. Light is one of the strongest entrainers of the circadian rhythm, and its manipulation may have various physiological and functional consequences. We investigated the effect of 21-day exposure to SPR on sleep–wakefulness (S–W) behavior in VSL rats. We observed that SPR exposure restored S–W behavior in VSL rats, resulting in an increase in wake duration and a significant increase in theta power during wake and REMS. This study highlights the crucial role of the ventral subiculum in maintaining normal sleep–wakefulness patterns and highlights the effectiveness of photoperiod manipulation as a non-pharmacological treatment for reversing sleep disturbances reported in mood and neuropsychiatric disorders like Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, which also involve alterations in circadian rhythm.</p>

">Does pre-speech auditory modulation reflect processes related to feedback monitoring or speech movement planning?</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have revealed that auditory processing is modulated during the planning phase immediately prior to speech onset. To date, the functional relevance of this pre-speech auditory modulation (PSAM) remains unknown. Here, we investigated whether PSAM reflects neuronal processes that are associated with preparing auditory cortex for optimized feedback monitoring as reflected in online speech corrections. Combining electroencephalographic PSAM data from a previous data set with new acoustic measures of the same participants' speech, we asked whether individual speakers' extent of PSAM is correlated with the implementation of within-vowel articulatory adjustments during /b/-vowel-/d/ word productions. Online articulatory adjustments were quantified as the extent of change in inter-trial formant variability from vowel onset to vowel midpoint (a phenomenon known as centering). This approach allowed us to also consider inter-trial variability in formant production and its possible relation to PSAM at vowel onset and midpoint separately. Results showed that inter-trial formant variability was significantly smaller at vowel midpoint than at vowel onset. PSAM was not significantly correlated with this amount of change in variability as an index of within-vowel adjustments. Surprisingly, PSAM was negatively correlated with inter-trial formant variability not only in the middle but also at the very onset of the vowels. Thus, speakers with more PSAM produced formants that were already less variable at vowel onset. Findings suggest that PSAM may reflect processes that influence speech acoustics as early as vowel onset and, thus, that are directly involved in motor command preparation (feedforward control) rather than output monitoring (feedback control).

">Synchronous theta networks characterize successful memory retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Memory retrieval activates regions across the brain, including not only the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe (MTL), but also frontal, parietal, and lateral temporal cortical regions. How these regions communicate to organize retrieval-specific processing, however, remains unclear. Here, we elucidate the role of theta (3--8 Hz) synchronization, broadly implicated in memory function, during the spontaneous retrieval of episodic memories. Analyzing a dataset of 413 neurosurgical patients implanted with intracranial electrodes who completed a free recall task, we find that synchronous networks of theta phase synchrony span the brain in the moments before spontaneous recall, in comparison to periods of deliberation and incorrect recalls. Network hubs, which systematically synchronize with other regions, appear throughout the prefrontal cortex and lateral and medial temporal lobes, as well as other areas. The recall accuracy network, derived from a correct recall--intrusion contrast, includes synchronous hubs concentrated in the temporal lobe and desynchronous hubs in the parietal lobe. Theta synchrony increases appear more prominently for slow (3 Hz) theta than for fast (8 Hz) theta in the recall--deliberation contrast, but not in the encoding or recall--intrusion contrast, and theta power and synchrony positively correlate throughout the theta band. These results implicate diffuse brain-wide synchronization of theta rhythms, especially slow theta, in episodic memory retrieval.

">Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention</a></h4>

              
                Across diverse organisms, the temporal dynamics of spiking responses between neurons, the neural synchrony, is crucial for encoding different stimuli. Neural synchrony is especially important in the insect antennal (olfactory) lobe (AL). Previous studies on synchronization, however, rely on pair-wise synchronization metrics including the cross-correlogram and cos-similarity between kernelized spikes train. These pair-wise analyses overlook an important aspect of synchronization which is the interaction at the population neuron level. There are also limited modeling techniques that incorporate the synchronization between neurons in modeling population spike trains. Inspired by recent advancements in machine learning, we leverage a modern attention mechanism to learn a generative normalizing flow that captures neuron population synchronization. Our method not only reveals the spiking mechanism of neurons in the AL region but also produces semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize neuron interactions over time. These automatically learned attention weights allow us to elucidate the known principles of neuron synchronization and further shed light on the functional roles of different cell types (the local interneurons (LNs), and projection neurons (PNs)) in the dynamic neural network in the AL. By varying the balance of excitation and inhibition in this neural circuit, our method further uncovers the pattern between the strength of synchronization and the ratio of an odorant in the mixture.

">From histology to macroscale function in the human amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala is a subcortical region in the mesiotemporal lobe that plays a key role in emotional and sensory functions. Conventional neuroimaging experiments treat this structure as a single, uniform entity, but there is ample histological evidence for subregional heterogeneity in microstructure and function. The current study characterized subregional structure-function coupling in the human amygdala, integrating post mortem histology and in vivo MRI at ultrahigh fields. Core to our work was a novel neuroinformatics approach that leveraged multiscale texture analysis as well as non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to identify salient dimensions of microstructural variation in a 3D post mortem histological reconstruction of the human amygdala. We observed two axes of subregional variation in the human amygdala, describing inferior-superior as well as medio-lateral trends in microstructural differentiation that in part recapitulated established atlases of amygdala subnuclei. We then translated our approach to in vivo MRI data acquired at 7 Tesla, and could demonstrate generalizability of these spatial trends across 10 healthy adults. We then cross-referenced microstructural axes with functional blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal analysis obtained during task-free conditions, and demonstrated a close association of structural axes with macroscale functional network embedding, notably the temporo-limbic, default mode, and sensory-motor networks. Our novel multiscale approach consolidates descriptions of amygdala anatomy and function obtained from histological and in vivo imaging techniques.

                Deriving human neural responses to natural speech is now possible, but the responses to male- and female-uttered speech have been shown to differ. These talker differences may complicate interpretations or restrict experimental designs geared toward more realistic communication scenarios. This study found that when a male and female talker had the same fundamental frequency, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were very similar. Those responses became smaller and later with increasing fundamental frequency, as did click ABRs with increasing stimulus rates. Modeled responses suggested that the speech and click ABR differences were reasonably predicted by peripheral and brainstem processing of stimulus acoustics.

">Enhancing Retrieval Capacity of the Predictive Brain through Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Intervention</a></h4>

              
                The ability to extract spatial or temporal regularities across experiences is crucial for skill development and predictive processes. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in modulating competitive memory systems, supporting declarative/episodic memory as opposed to statistical learning. This regulatory role may explain findings of improved acquisition and consolidation of statistical regularities following the suppression of dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This raises a key question: Is access to models and prior statistical knowledge also modulated by the DLPFC? This preregistered study provides new insights by examining the role of the DLPFC in retrieving pre-existing knowledge of temporally distributed statistical regularities. Using a probabilistic learning task, healthy participants engaged in implicit statistical learning for 25 minutes. After a 24-hour consolidation period, participants received either 1 Hz rTMS or sham stimulation over the left, right, or bilateral DLPFC for 10 minutes before retesting. We found more effective access to statistical regularities in the bilateral DLPFC group compared to the sham group. Our results suggest that DLPFC suppression enhances the retrieval of statistical knowledge, particularly when interhemispheric compensatory mechanisms are prevented. These findings contribute to understanding competitive memory systems and offer implications for cognitive enhancement strategies.

">Post-weaning social isolation alters sociability in a sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a critical period for brain development in humans and stress exposure during this time can have lasting effects on behavior and brain development. Social isolation and loneliness are particularly salient stressors that lead to detrimental mental health outcomes particularly in females, although most of the preclinical work on social isolation has been done in male animals. Our lab has developed a model of post-weaning adolescent social isolation that leads to increased drug reward sensitivity and altered neuronal structure in limbic brain regions. The current study utilized this model to determine the impact of adolescent social isolation on a three-chamber social interaction task both during adolescence and adulthood. We found that while post-weaning isolation does not alter social interaction during adolescence (PND45), it has sex-specific effects on social interaction in adulthood (PND60), potentiating social interaction in male mice and decreasing it in female mice. As early life stress can activate microglia leading to alterations in neuronal pruning, we next examined the impact of inhibiting microglial activation with daily minocycline administration during the first three weeks of social isolation on these changes in social interaction. During adolescence, minocycline dampened social interaction in male mice, while having no effect in females. In contrast, during adulthood, minocycline did not alter the impact of adolescent social isolation in males, with socially isolated males exhibiting higher levels of social interaction compared to their group housed counterparts. In females, adolescent minocycline treatment reversed the effect of social isolation leading to increased social interaction in the social isolation group, mimicking what is seen in naive males. Taken together, adolescent social isolation leads to sex-specific effects on social interaction in adulthood and adolescent minocycline treatment alters the effects of social isolation in females, but not males.

">HDAC4 Inhibits NMDA Receptor-Mediated Stimulation of Neurogranin Expression</a></h4>

              
                The coordination of neuronal wiring and activity within the central nervous system (CNS) is crucial for cognitive function, particularly in the context of aging and neurological disorders. Neurogranin (Ng), an abundant forebrain protein, modulates calmodulin (CaM) activity and deeply influences synaptic plasticity and neuronal processing. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms of Ng expression, a critical but underexplored area for combating cognitive impairment. Utilizing both in vitro and in vivo hippocampal models, we show that Ng expression arises during late developmental stages, coinciding with synaptic maturation and neuronal circuit consolidation of. We observed that Ng expression increases in neuronal networks with heightened synaptic activity and identified GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as key drivers of this expression. Additionally, we discovered that nuclear-localized HDAC4 inhibits Ng expression, establishing a regulatory axis that is counteracted by NMDA receptor stimulation. Analysis of the Ng gene promoter activity revealed regulatory elements between the -2.4 and -0.85 Kbp region, including a binding site for RE1-Silencing Transcription factor (REST), which may mediate HDAC4 repressive effect on Ng expression. Further analysis of the promoter sequence revealed conserved binding sites for the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) transcription factor, a target of HDAC4-mediated transcription regulation. Our findings elucidate the interplay between synaptic activity, NMDAR function, and transcriptional regulation in controlling Ng expression, offering insights into synaptic plasticity mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies to prevent cognitive dysfunction.

">Engineering Microglial Cells to Promote Spinal Cord Injury Recovery</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) can result in irreversible damage, leading to lifelong paralysis for affected individuals. Microglia's dual impact on neuronal regeneration after SCI, driven by their distinct roles at different stages, merits further study. We conducted a bioinformatic analysis of single-cell transcriptomes (scRNA), spatial transcriptomic (ST) data, and bulk RNA-seq data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. The data were processed using R packages such as "Seurat", "DESeq2" ,limma; and "GSVA." Additionally, we utilized Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and the Enrichr web servers. Analysis of single-cell data and spatial transcriptomics has revealed notable changes in the microglial cell landscape in SCI. These changes encompass the inhibition of innate microglial cells, while reactive microglial cells exhibit pronounced reactive hyperplasia. Moreover, the TGFbeta signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the migration of innate microglial cells to enhance SCI recovery. However, reactive microglial cells exhibiting high Trem2 expression contribute to the neuroinflammatory response and can effectively modulate neural cell death in SCI. In particular, inhibiting Trem2 in reactive microglial cells not only reduces inflammation but also mitigates spinal cord injury, and enhancing the TGFbeta signaling pathway. What's more, the use of iPSC-derived microglial cells, which have demonstrated their capacity to augment the potential for replacing the functions of naive microglial cells, iPSC-derived microglia have the potential to replace the functions of naive microglial cells, holds significant promise in addressing SCI. Therefore, we posit that the engineering of microglial cells to promote the SCI recovery. The approach of inhibiting Trem2-mediated neuroinflammatory responses and transplanting iPSC-derived microglia with long-term TGFbeta stimulation may offer potential improvements in SCI recovery.

">Msh3 and Pms1 Set Neuronal CAG-repeat Migration Rate to Drive Selective Striatal and Cortical Pathogenesis in HD Mice</a></h4>

              
                Modifiers of Huntington disease (HD) include mismatch repair (MMR) genes; however, their underlying disease-altering mechanisms remain unresolved. Knockout (KO) alleles for 9 HD GWAS modifiers/MMR genes were crossed to the Q140 Huntingtin (mHtt) knock-in mice to probe such mechanisms. Four KO mice strongly (Msh3 and Pms1) or moderately (Msh2 and Mlh1) rescue a triad of adult-onset, striatal medium-spiny-neuron (MSN)-selective phenotypes: somatic Htt DNA CAG-repeat expansion, transcriptionopathy, and mHtt protein aggregation. Comparatively, Q140 cortex also exhibits an analogous, but later-onset, pathogenic triad that is Msh3-dependent. Remarkably, Q140/homozygous Msh3-KO lacks mHtt aggregates in the brain, even at advanced ages (20-months). Moreover, Msh3-deficiency prevents striatal synaptic marker loss, astrogliosis, and locomotor impairment in HD mice. Purified Q140 MSN nuclei exhibit highly linear age-dependent mHtt DNA repeat expansion (i.e. repeat migration), with modal-CAG increasing at +8.8 repeats/month (R2=0.98). This linear rate is reduced to 2.3 and 0.3 repeats/month in Q140 with Msh3 heterozygous and homozygous alleles, respectively. Our study defines somatic Htt CAG-repeat thresholds below which there are no mHtt nuclear (at 150-CAG) or neuropil aggregates (at 192-CAG). Mild transcriptionopathy can still occur in Q140 mice with stabilized Htt 140-CAG repeats, but the majority of transcriptomic changes are due to somatic repeat expansion. Our analysis reveals 479 genes with expression levels highly correlated with modal-CAG length in MSNs. Thus, our study mechanistically connects HD GWAS genes to selective neuronal vulnerability in HD, in which Msh3 and Pms1 set the linear rate of neuronal mHtt CAG-repeat migration to drive repeat-length dependent pathogenesis; and provides a preclinical platform for targeting these genes for HD suppression across brain regions.

">Mitigating sTNF/TNFR1 activation on VGluT2+ spinal cord interneurons improves immune function after mid-thoracic spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury, SCI, is a devastating condition with 250,000 to 500,000 new cases globally each year. Respiratory infections, e.g., pneumonia and influenza are the leading cause of death after SCI.Unfortunately, there is a poor understanding of how altered neuro-immune communication impacts an individuals outcome to infection. In humans and rodents, SCI leads to maladaptive changes in the spinal-sympathetic reflex, SSR, circuit which is crucial to sympathetic function. The cause of the impaired immune function may be related to harmful neuroinflammation which is detrimental to homeostasis neuronal function, aberrant plasticity, and hyper excitable circuits. Soluble tumor necrosis factor, sTNF, is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is elevated in the CNS after SCI and remains elevated for several months after injury. By pharmacologically attenuating sTNF in the CNS after SCI we were able to demonstrate improved immune function. Furthermore, when we investigated the specific cellular population which may be involved in altered neuro-immune communication we reported that excessive TNFR1 activity on excitatory INs promotes immune dysfunction. Furthermore, this observation is NF-kB dependent in VGluT2+ INs. Our data is the first report of a target within the CNS, TNFR1, that contributes to SCI-induced immune dysfunction after T9-SCI and is a potential avenue for future therapeutics.

">Sulfonylurea receptor coupled conductances alter the performance of two central pattern generating circuits in Cancer borealis</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity and energy supply must maintain a fine balance for neuronal fitness. Various channels of communication between the two could impact network output in different ways. Sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) are a modification of ATP-binding cassette proteins (ABCs) that confer ATP-dependent gating on their associated ion channels. They are widely expressed and link metabolic states directly to neuronal activity. The role they play varies in different circuits, both enabling bursting and inhibiting activity in pathological conditions. The crab, Cancer borealis, has central patterns generators (CPGs) that fire in rhythmic bursts nearly constantly and it is unknown how energy availability influences these networks. The pyloric network of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and cardiac ganglion (GC) control rhythmic contractions of the foregut and heart respectively. Pharmacological manipulation of SURs results in opposite effects in the two CPGs. Neuronal firing completely stops in the STG when SUR-associated channels are open, and firing increases when the channels are closed. This results from a decrease in the excitability of pyloric dilator (PD) neurons, which are a part of the pacemaker kernel. The neurons of the CG, paradoxically, increase firing within bursts when SUR-associated channels are opened, and bursting slows when SUR-associated channels are closed. The channel permeability and sensitivities analyses present novel SUR-conductance biophysics, which nevertheless change activity in ways reminiscent of the predominantly studied mammalian receptor/channels. We suggest that SUR-associated conductances allow different neurons to respond to energy states in different ways through a common mechanism.

">Influence of asymmetric microchannels in the structure and function of engineered neuronal circuits</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the intricate structure-function relationships of neuronal circuits is crucial for unraveling how the brain sustains efficient information transfer. In specific brain regions, like the hippocampus, neurons are organized in layers and form unidirectional connectivity, which is thought to help ensure controlled signal flow and information processing. In recent years, researchers have tried emulating these structural principles by providing cultured neurons with asymmetric environmental cues, namely microfluidics' microchannels that promote directed axonal growth. Even though a few reports have claimed achieving unidirectional connectivity of in vitro neuronal circuits, given the lack of functional characterization, whether this structural connectivity correlates with functional connectivity remains unknown. We have replicated and tested the performance of asymmetric microchannel designs previously reported in the literature to be successful in the promotion of directed axonal growth, as well as other custom variations. A new variation of "Arrowhead", termed "Rams", was the best-performing motif with a ~76% probability per microchannel of allowing strictly unidirectional connections at 14 days in vitro. Importantly, we assessed the functional implications of these different asymmetric microchannel designs. For this purpose, we combined custom microfluidics with microelectrode array (MEA) technology to record the electrophysiological activity of two segregated populations of hippocampal neurons ("Source" and "Target"). This functional characterization revealed that up to ~94% of the spiking activity recorded along microchannels with the "Rams" motif propagates towards the "Target" population. Moreover, our results indicate that these engineered circuits also tended to exhibit network-level synchronizations with defined directionality. Overall, this characterization of the structure-function relationships promoted by asymmetric microchannels has the potential to provide insights into how neuronal circuits use specific network architectures for effective computations. Moreover, the here-developed devices and approaches may be used in a wide range of applications, such as disease modeling or preclinical drug screening.

">Chronic β3 adrenergic agonist treatment improves brain microvascular                   endothelial function and cognition in aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Microvascular endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired neurovascular coupling, reduced glucose uptake, blood-brain barrier disruption, and microvascular rarefaction, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of age-related vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Emerging evidence points to non-cell autonomous mechanisms mediated by adverse circulating milieu (an increased ratio of pro-geronic to anti-geronic circulating factors) in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction leading to impaired cerebral blood flow and cognitive decline in the aging population. In particular, age-related adipose dysfunction contributes, at least in part, to an unfavorable systemic milieu characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and altered adipokine profile, which together contribute to microvascular endothelial dysfunction. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to test whether thermogenic stimulation, an intervention known to improve adipose and systemic metabolism by increasing cellular energy expenditure, could mitigate brain endothelial dysfunction and improve cognition in the aging population. Eighteen-month-old old C57BL/6J mice were treated with saline or CL ({beta}3-adrenergic agonist) for 6 weeks followed by functional analysis to assess endothelial function and cognition. CL treatment improved neurovascular coupling responses and rescued brain glucose uptake in aged animals. In addition, CL treatment also attenuated blood-brain barrier leakage and associated neuroinflammation in the cortex of aged animals. More importantly, these beneficial changes in microvascular function translated to improved cognitive performance in radial arm water maze and Y-maze tests. Our results suggest that {beta}3-adrenergic agonist treatment improves multiple aspects of brain microvascular endothelial function and can be potentially repurposed for treating age-associated cognitive decline.

                Beyond the vast array of functional roles attributed to serotonin (5-HT) in the brain, changes in 5-HT levels have been shown to accompany changes in behavioral states, including WAKE, NREM and REM sleep. Whether 5-HT dynamics at shorter time scales can be seen to delineate substates within these larger brain states remains an open question. Here, we performed simultaneous recordings of extracellular 5-HT using a recently-developed G Protein-Coupled Receptor-Activation-Based 5-HT sensor (GRAB5-HT3.0) and local field potential (LFP) in the hippocampal CA1, which revealed the presence of prominent ultraslow (<0.05 Hz) 5-HT oscillations both during NREM and WAKE states. Interestingly, the phase of these ultraslow 5-HT oscillations was found to distinguish substates both within and across larger behavioral states. Hippocampal ripples occurred preferentially on the falling phase of ultraslow 5-HT oscillations during both NREM and WAKE, with higher power ripples concentrating near the peak specifically during NREM. By contrast, hippocampal-cortical coherence was strongest and microarousals and EMG peaks were most prevalent during the rising phase in both wake and NREM. Overall, ultraslow 5-HT oscillations delineate substates within the larger behavioral states of NREM and WAKE, thus potentially temporally segregating internal memory consolidation processes from arousal-related functions.

">On the validity of electric brain signal predictions based on population firing rates</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity at the population level is commonly studied experimentally through measurements of electric brain signals like local field potentials (LFPs), or electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To allow for comparison between observed and simulated neural activity it is therefore important that simulations of neural activity can accurately predict these brain signals. Simulations of neural activity at the population level often rely on point-neuron network models or firing-rate models. While these simplified representations of neural activity are computationally efficient, they lack the explicit spatial information needed for calculating LFP/EEG signals. Different heuristic approaches have been suggested for overcoming this limitation, but the accuracy of these approaches has not fully been assessed. One such heuristic approach, the so-called kernel method, has previously been applied with promising results and has the additional advantage of being well-grounded in the biophysics underlying electric brain signal generation. It is based on calculating rate-to-LFP/EEG kernels for each synaptic pathway in a network model, after which LFP/EEG signals can be obtained directly from population firing rates. This amounts to a massive reduction in the computational effort of calculating brain signals because the brain signals are calculated for each population instead of for each neuron. Here, we investigate how and when the kernel method can be expected to work, and present a theoretical framework for predicting its accuracy. We show that the relative error of the brain signal predictions is a function of the single-cell kernel heterogeneity and the spike-train correlations. Finally, we demonstrate that the kernel method is most accurate for the dominating brain signal contributions. We thereby further establish the kernel method as a promising approach for calculating electric brain signals from large-scale neural simulations.

">"Micro-offline gains" convey no benefit for motor skill learning</a></h4>

              
                While practising a new motor skill, resting for a few seconds can improve performance immediately after the rest. This improvement has been interpreted as rapid offline learning1,2 ('micro-offline gains', MOG), supported by neural replay of the trained movement sequence during rest3. Here, we provide evidence that MOG reflect transient performance benefits, partially mediated by motor planning, and not replay-mediated offline learning. In five experiments, participants trained to produce a sequence of finger movements as many times as possible during fixed-duration practice periods. When participants trained during 10-second practice periods, each followed by a 10-second rest period, they produced more correct keypresses during training than participants who trained without taking breaks. However, this benefit vanished within seconds after the end of training, when both groups performed under comparable conditions, revealing similar levels of skill acquisition. This challenges the idea that MOG reflect offline learning, which, if present, should result in sustained performance benefits, compared to training without breaks. Furthermore, sequence-specific replay was not necessary for MOG, given that we observed persistent MOG when participants produced sequences that never repeated, preventing any effect of (sequence-specific) replay on the performance of subsequent (novel) sequences. Importantly, we observed diminished MOG when participants could not pre-plan the first few movements of an upcoming practice period. We conclude that 'micro-offline gains' represent short-lived performance benefits that are partially driven by motor pre-planning, rather than replay-mediated offline learning.

">A systematic evaluation of dynamic functional connectivity methods using simulation data</a></h4>

              
                Numerous dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) methods have been proposed to study time-resolved network reorganization in rest and task fMRI. However, a comprehensive comparison of their performance is lacking. In this study, we compared the efficacy of seven dFC methods (and their enhanced versions) to track transient network reconfiguration using simulation data. The seven methods include flexible least squares (FLS), dynamic conditional correlation (DCC), general linear Kalman filter (GLKF), multiplication of temporal derivatives (MTD), sliding-window functional connectivity with L1-regularization (SWFC), hidden Markov models (HMM), and hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM). Multiple datasets of non-fMRI-BOLD and fMRI-BOLD signals with predefined covariance structures, signal-to-noise ratio levels, and sojourn time distributions were simulated. We adopted inter-subject analysis to eliminate the effects of signals of non-interest, resulting in enhanced methods: ISSWFC, ISMTD, ISDCC, ISFLS, ISKF, ISHMM, and ISHSMM. Efficacy was defined as the spatiotemporal association between simulated and estimated data. We found that all enhanced dFC methods outperformed their original versions. Efficacies depend on several factors, such as considering the neurovascular effect in simulated data, the covariance structure between two time series, state sojourn distribution, and signal-to-noise ratio levels. These results highlight the importance of selecting appropriate dFC methods in fMRI study.

">Exploring For Gloss: The Role of Active Exploration in Visual Material Perception</a></h4>

              
                Image motion has been found to contribute to the perception of visual material properties, and motion signals are generated while actively exploring objects. Yet, little is known about the specific visual cues produced through exploration and how exploration, in turn, impacts visual material perception. Using virtual reality and real-time hand tracking, we investigated the influence of material on exploratory hand motion and vice versa. Participants either observed or actively explored objects varying in gloss or in lightness while performing a matching task. We compared the perceptual judgments of actively exploring and observing participants and analysed their manual exploration patterns during the two material judgment tasks in the interactive condition. Results showed systematic variation in exploration patterns based on visual task and material property: participants spent more time exploring objects when judging gloss than when judging lightness, and glossier objects were explored longer. This increased exploration during gloss judgments could suggest a strategic prioritisation of relevant cues for gloss judgments, with observers actively generating highlight movements through larger movements and object rotation to facilitate their gloss judgements. Our study demonstrates that visual material properties impact how individuals interact with objects, and that active exploration influences the perception of visual material properties.

">Identification of whole-body reaching movement phenotypes in young and older active adults: an unsupervised machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                Studies reported age-related motor control modifications in whole-body movement in several aspects of spatiotemporal movement organization by comparing young and older adults. However, studies on motor control involve high complexity and high-dimensional data of different natures, in which machine learning has proved to be effective. Furthermore, conventional studies focus on comparisons of movement parameters based on a priori grouping, whereas unsupervised machine learning allows the identification of inherent groupings within the dataset. The current investigation was carried out by using the unsupervised machine learning on motor control features across age-groups. An important question was whether we could identify different movement patterns based on motor control features and whether they were age-dependent or independent. We investigated motor control parameters variations in a whole-body reaching movement across young and active older adults including woman and man (n=19). We applied the K-means clustering algorithm to segment the kinematic data (21 features) of all individuals. We propose a methodology applying the latest recommendations for clustering methods in the field of whole-body movement motor control. Analysis revealed two distinct motor control patterns which were age independent. The first pattern exhibited higher shoulder, ankle and knee angular excursions, along with a higher vertical velocity of center of mass (CoM), compared to the second pattern, which had higher hip and back angular excursions, along with a lower vertical velocity CoM. The clustering methodology demonstrated its effectiveness to identify distinct motor patterns based solely on motor control features independently of age-grouping.

">Taming a behavioral monster: Resonant song recognition and the evolution of acoustic communication in crickets</a></h4>

              
                Rare behavioral phenotypes---behavioral monsters---can challenge hypotheses about the evolution of the neural networks that drive behavior. In crickets, the diversity of song recognition behaviors is thought to be based on the modification of a shared neural network. We here report on a cricket with a novel resonant song recognition pattern that challenges this hypothesis. Females of the species Anurogryllus muticus respond to pulse patterns with the period of the male song, but also to song at twice the period. To identify the mechanisms underlying this multi-peaked recognition, we first explored minimal models of resonant behaviors. Though all of the three simple models tested (autocorrelation, rebound, resonate and fire) produced some kind of resonant behavior, only a single-neuron model with an oscillating membrane qualitatively matched the Anurogryllus behavior with regard to both period and duty cycle tuning. Surprisingly, the rebound model, a minimal model of the core mechanism for song recognition in crickets, fails to reproduce the preference for higher duty cycles observed in the behavior, questioning the universality of the core algorithm. However, the behavior is reproduced with a network model that contains all computations from the song recognition network of crickets, revealing the importance of an additional computation not part of the core mechanism: Following the core rebound mechanism in which post-inhibitory rebounds give rise to the resonant period tuning, feed-forward inhibition further shapes the tuning, resulting in the observed behavioral profile. Overall, this shows how unusual behavioral phenotypes can evolve by combining different nonlinear computations at the level of single cells and networks.

	<p>Several therapies have been developed to reduce cognitive decline associated with aging. Aquatic exercises, which are widely used to enhance functional capacity, may play a role in stimulating cognitive functions. This study investigated the effects of a 3-month aquatic exercise program on cognitive functions in community-dwelling older adults. In this prospective, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial, 31 participants were allocated to either the experimental (aquatic exercises) or control (no-exercise) group. The intervention program consisted of exercises conducted twice a week in a 1.2 m deep indoor pool. The main outcome measures were cognitive functions, assessed using Raven&amp;amp;rsquo;s Progressive Matrices test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess the impact of the exercise program. The effect sizes (&amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p) were reported when a level of significance was achieved (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, the participants who underwent aquatic exercises showed positive outcomes in Raven&amp;amp;rsquo;s Progressive Matrices test (p = 0.046; &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.131) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.589). Complementary analyses of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test indicated that the benefits of the aquatic exercise were observed in terms of the number of trials (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.478), number of errors (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.458), and number of non-perseverative errors (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.302). The results indicate that a period of three months of aquatic exercise was beneficial for stimulating specific aspects of the cognitive function of community-dwelling older individuals. Aquatic exercise should be prescribed to this population.</p>

	<p>In the pediatric population, epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders that often results in cognitive dysfunction. It affects patients&amp;amp;rsquo; life quality by limiting academic performance and self-esteem and increasing social rejection. There are several interventions for the neurohabilitation of cognitive impairment, including LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy (LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T), which promotes neuronal connectivity and cortical plasticity through the use of assembly sets and robotic programming. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T on cognitive processes in pediatric patients with epilepsy. Eligible patients were identified; in the treatment group, an initial evaluation was performed with the NEUROPSI and BANFE-2 neuropsychological tests. Then, the interventions were performed once a week, and a final test was performed. In the control group, after the initial evaluation, the final evaluation was performed. An overall improvement was observed in the LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T patients, with a significant increase in BANFE-2 scores in the orbitomedial, anterior prefrontal, and dorsolateral areas. In addition, in the gain score analysis, the orbitomedial and memory scores were significantly different from the control group. LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T neurohabilitation is a remarkable option for epilepsy patients, who are motivated when they observe improvements.</p>

	<p>Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) display many cognitive and physiological alterations resulting from renal failure and physical inactivity. Caffeine intake has been reported to improve cognitive/physical performance in several studies. However, whether the benefits of caffeine intake apply to patients with ESRD remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of caffeine intake on postural balance, cognitive function and functional capacity in patients with ESRD. In a randomized order, 12 patients with ESRD (age: 33.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.57 years; Female: 45.5%) performed a battery of tests after either caffeine (CF) (400 mg) or placebo (PLA) ingestion. Postural balance was evaluated using a stabilometric platform. Functional capacity was assessed with the sit-to-stand and up-and-go tests, and for cognitive performances, reaction time test and a vigilance test were used. Results showed a significant improvement in up-and-go test (p = 0.01) and sit-to-stand test performances with CF compared to PLA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Time of reaction test and vigilance test (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) performances were significantly higher with CF. No significant difference was observed in postural balance between CF and PLA. The results of this study suggest that acute caffeine ingestion positively enhances cognitive function and functional capacity in patients with ESRD.</p>

                Abstract* Background The level of liver fibrosis is the basis for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and it is necessary to adapt non-invasive liver fibrosis modalities. We aimed to investigate the use of M2BPGi as a single or combined diagnostic modality for liver fibrosis in CHB patients through a stepwise diagnostic analysis. Methods Cross-sectional data were taken from patients between October 2021 and August 2022. Demographic data, blood profile, liver function, and liver stiffness were measured in CHB patients over 18 years old, willing to take part in the research, and had complete data. APRI, FIB-4, and AAR were calculated using the well-known formulas. Serum M2BPGi-levels were converted into a cut-off index (COI). The patients were divided into low-risk (LR) and high-risk fibrosis (HR) groups. A cut-off for each predictor variable to differentiate between the LR and HR groups was determined. The obtained cut-off was assessed for its association with the grouping of liver elastography results. Models to diagnose the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥8 kPa were created and compared through multivariate and ROC analyses. Results The number of patients that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria was 143 (HR = 65, LR = 78). The cut-off for diagnosing LSM ≥8kPa was 0.311, 0.742, 0.635, and 1.434 for APRI, FIB-4, AAR, and M2BPGi, respectively. This cut-off was significantly associated with the results of the HR and LR groupings. A multivariate analysis found that FIB4, AAR, and M2BPGi added significantly to the model. Statistically, the most optimal use of M2BPGi was combined with FIB-4, with an AUC of 0.835. Conclusions The optimal cut-off of M2BPGi for diagnosing high-risk liver fibrosis in this study was 1.434. M2BPGi should be used with FIB-4 as a diagnostic tool for diagnosing liver fibrosis, especially in the absence of a liver biopsy or elastography.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health threat. Understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions within TB granulomas will assist in identifying what leads to the successful elimination of infection. <i>In vitro</i> TB models provide a controllable environment to study these granuloma dynamics. Previously we developed a biomimetic 3D spheroid granuloma model that controls bacteria better than a traditional monolayer culture counterpart. We used agent-based simulations to predict the mechanistic reason for this difference. Our calibrated simulations were able to predict heterogeneous bacterial dynamics that are consistent with experimental data. In one group of simulations, spheroids are found to have higher macrophage activation than their traditional counterparts, leading to better bacterial control. This higher macrophage activation in the spheroids was not due to higher counts of activated T cells, instead fewer activated T cells were able to activate more macrophages due to the proximity of these cells to each other within the spheroid. In a second group of simulations, spheroids again have more macrophage activation but also more T cell activation, specifically CD8+ T cells. This higher level of CD8+ T cell activation is predicted to be due to the proximity of these cells to the cells that activate them. Multiple mechanisms of control were predicted. Simulations removing individual mechanisms show that one group of simulations has a CD4+ T cell dominant response, while the other has a mixed/CD8+ T cell dominant response. Lastly, we demonstrated that in spheroids the initial structure and movement rules work synergistically to reduce bacterial load. These findings provide valuable insights into how the structural complexity of <i>in vitro</i> models impacts immune responses. Moreover, our study has implications for engineering more physiologically relevant <i>in vitro</i> models and advancing our understanding of TB pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions.

Emerging infectious diseases with zoonotic potential often have complex socioecological dynamics and limited ecological data, requiring integration of epidemiological modeling with surveillance. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has advanced considerably since its detection in late 2019, the factors influencing its introduction and transmission in wildlife hosts, particularly white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>), remain poorly understood. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemiological model to investigate the spillover risk and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in wild and captive white-tailed deer populations across various simulated scenarios. We found that captive scenarios pose a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 introduction from humans into deer herds and subsequent transmission among deer, compared to wild herds. However, even in wild herds, the transmission risk is often substantial enough to sustain infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of introduction from humans influences outbreak characteristics only to a certain extent. Transmission among deer was frequently sufficient for widespread outbreaks in deer populations, regardless of the initial level of introduction. We also explore the potential for fence line interactions between captive and wild deer to elevate outbreak metrics in wild herds that have the lowest risk of introduction and sustained transmission. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be introduced and maintained in deer herds across a range of circumstances based on testing a range of introduction and transmission risks in various captive and wild scenarios. Our approach and findings will aid One Health strategies that mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in white-tailed deer populations and potential spillback to humans.

                <p>by Pascal Grobecker, Thomas Sakoparnig, Erik van Nimwegen</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a popular experimental method to study variation of gene expression within a population of cells. However, obtaining an accurate picture of the diversity of distinct gene expression states that are present in a given dataset is highly challenging because the sparsity of the scRNA-seq data and its inhomogeneous measurement noise properties. Although a vast number of different methods is applied in the literature for clustering cells into subsets with ‘similar’ expression profiles, these methods generally lack rigorously specified objectives, involve multiple complex layers of normalization, filtering, feature selection, dimensionality-reduction, employ <i>ad hoc</i> measures of distance or similarity between cells, often ignore the known measurement noise properties of scRNA-seq measurements, and include a large number of tunable parameters. Consequently, it is virtually impossible to assign concrete biophysical meaning to the clusterings that result from these methods. Here we address the following problem: Given raw unique molecule identifier (UMI) counts of an scRNA-seq dataset, partition the cells into subsets such that the gene expression states of the cells in each subset are statistically indistinguishable, and each subset corresponds to a distinct gene expression state. That is, we aim to partition cells so as to maximally reduce the complexity of the dataset without removing any of its meaningful structure. We show that, given the known measurement noise structure of scRNA-seq data, this problem is mathematically well-defined and derive its unique solution from first principles. We have implemented this solution in a tool called Cellstates which operates directly on the raw data and automatically determines the optimal partition and cluster number, with zero tunable parameters. We show that, on synthetic datasets, Cellstates almost perfectly recovers optimal partitions. On real data, Cellstates robustly identifies subtle substructure within groups of cells that are traditionally annotated as a common cell type. Moreover, we show that the diversity of gene expression states that Cellstates identifies systematically depends on the tissue of origin and not on technical features of the experiments such as the total number of cells and total UMI count per cell. In addition to the Cellstates tool we also provide a small toolbox of software to place the identified cellstates into a hierarchical tree of higher-order clusters, to identify the most important differentially expressed genes at each branch of this hierarchy, and to visualize these results.

Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves has been used in various pathological contexts for rehabilitation purposes or to alleviate the symptoms of neuropathologies, thus improving the overall quality of life of patients. However, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is still a challenging issue requiring extensive <i>in vivo</i> experimental campaigns and technical development. To facilitate the design of new stimulation strategies, we provide a fully open source and self-contained software framework for the <i>in silico</i> evaluation of peripheral nerve electrical stimulation. Our modeling approach, developed in the popular and well-established Python language, uses an object-oriented paradigm to map the physiological and electrical context. The framework is designed to facilitate multi-scale analysis, from single fiber stimulation to whole multifascicular nerves. It also allows the simulation of complex strategies such as multiple electrode combinations and waveforms ranging from conventional biphasic pulses to more complex modulated kHz stimuli. In addition, we provide automated support for stimulation strategy optimization and handle the computational backend transparently to the user. Our framework has been extensively tested and validated with several existing results in the literature.

                <p>by Mani Erfanian Abdoust, Monja Isabel Froböse, Alfons Schnitzler, Elisabeth Schreivogel, Gerhard Jocham</p>

In everyday life, we encounter situations that require tradeoffs between potential rewards and associated costs, such as time and (physical) effort. The literature indicates a prominent role for dopamine in discounting of both delay and effort, with mixed findings for delay discounting in humans. Moreover, the reciprocal antagonistic interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic transmission in the striatum suggests a potential opponent role of acetylcholine in these processes. We found opposing effects of dopamine D2 (haloperidol) and acetylcholine M1 receptor (biperiden) antagonism on specific components of effort-based decision-making in healthy humans: haloperidol decreased, whereas biperiden increased the willingness to exert physical effort. In contrast, delay discounting was reduced under haloperidol, but not affected by biperiden. Together, our data suggest that dopamine, acting at D2 receptors, modulates both effort and delay discounting, while acetylcholine, acting at M1 receptors, appears to exert a more specific influence on effort discounting only.

Over-generalized fear is a maladaptive response to harmless stimuli or situations characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders. The dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) contains engram cells that play a crucial role in accurate memory retrieval. However, the coordination mechanism of neuronal subpopulations within the dDG network during fear generalization is not well understood. Here, with the Tet-off system combined with immunostaining and two-photon calcium imaging, we report that dDG fear engram cells labeled in the conditioned context constitutes a significantly higher proportion of dDG neurons activated in a similar context where mice show generalized fear. The activation of these dDG fear engram cells encoding the conditioned context is both sufficient and necessary for inducing fear generalization in the similar context. Activities of mossy cells in the ventral dentate gyrus (vMCs) are significantly suppressed in mice showing fear generalization in a similar context, and activating the vMCs-dDG pathway suppresses generalized but not conditioned fear. Finally, modifying fear memory engrams in the dDG with “safety” signals effectively rescues fear generalization. These findings reveal that the competitive advantage of dDG engram cells underlies fear generalization, which can be rescued by activating the vMCs-dDG pathway or modifying fear memory engrams, and provide novel insights into the dDG network as the neuronal basis of fear generalization.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1583/v3?src=rss">Depression, anxiety, and stress among urban and rural adolescents in Shivamogga, Karnataka [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Currently there are 1.3 billion adolescents worldwide, which makes up 16% of the world population. Over 20% of adolescents around the world are thought to have behavioural or mental health issues. Addressing mental health issues is very important for the promotion of positive health in adolescents. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among adolescents in urban and rural areas of Shivamogga. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 350 adolescents aged 16 to 19 years each from urban and rural areas of Shivamogga. Results Depression, anxiety and stress were found to be 23.1%, 29.4% and 26.6% in urban areas and 19.1%, 24% and 21.1% in rural areas respectively. Depression was more common among females in both urban and rural settings, with a significant difference observed in rural areas. Anxiety and stress were also more prevalent among females, with anxiety significantly higher in urban females. Urban adolescents exhibited higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress compared to their rural counterparts. Conclusions About a quarter of the adolescent population suffers from depression anxiety and stress. Adopting and implementing better education and health policies are necessary to enhance adolescent mental health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-459/v2?src=rss">Statistical data transformation in agrarian sciences for variance analysis: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                In statistical analyses, a common practice for enhancing the validity of variance analysis is the application of data transformation to convert measurements into a different mathematical scale. This technique was first employed in 1898 by Edgeworth and remains relevant in current scientific publications despite the proliferation of more modern and advanced techniques that obviate the need for certain assumptions. Data transformations, when appropriately used, can make the model error terms approximate a normal distribution. It is also possible to use the technique to correct the heterogeneity of variances or to render an additive model, ensuring the validity of the analysis of variances. Given that this technique can be hastily applied, potentially leading to erroneous or invalid results, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies in the field of agrarian sciences that utilized data transformations for the validation of analysis of variances. The aim was to check the transformations employed by the scientific community, the motivation behind their use, and to identify possible errors and inconsistencies in applying the technique in publications. In this study, we identified shortcomings and misconceptions associated with using this method, and we observed incomplete and inadequate utilization of the technique in 94.28 % of the analysed sample, resulting in misguided and erroneous conclusions in scientific research outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-785/v4?src=rss">Records of antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to COVID-19: A systematic review [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby’s immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022340859, 23 June 2022).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-357/v3?src=rss">A detailed methodology for a three-dimensional, self-structuring bone model that supports the differentiation of osteoblasts towards osteocytes and the production of a complex collagen-rich mineralised matrix [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approve</a></h4>

              
                Background There are insufficient in vitro bone models that accommodate long-term culture of osteoblasts and support their differentiation to osteocytes. The increased demand for effective therapies for bone diseases, and the ethical requirement to replace animals in research, warrants the development of such models. Here we present an in-depth protocol to prepare, create and maintain three-dimensional, in vitro, self-structuring bone models that support osteocytogenesis and long-term osteoblast survival (>1 year). Methods Osteoblastic cells are seeded on a fibrin hydrogel, cast between two beta-tricalcium phosphate anchors. Analytical methods optimised for these self-structuring bone model (SSBM) constructs, including RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining and XRF, are described in detail. Results Over time, the cells restructure and replace the initial matrix with a collagen-rich, mineralising one; and demonstrate differentiation towards osteocytes within 12 weeks of culture. Conclusions Whilst optimised using a secondary human cell line (hFOB 1.19), this protocol readily accommodates osteoblasts from other species (rat and mouse) and origins (primary and secondary). This simple, straightforward method creates reproducible in vitro bone models that are responsive to exogenous stimuli, offering a versatile platform for conducting preclinical translatable research studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-794/v1?src=rss">Antecedents of entrepreneurial networking behavior and its impact on business performance - a systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review the existing research on the antecedents of entrepreneurial networking behavior namely motivational factors and personality factors and its impact on business performance. Design/methodology/approach This study employs a systematic review methodology, adhering to PRISMA guidelines.. Using the SCOPUS database, the search involved Boolean operators to narrow down relevant articles published in English between 2000 and 2024. Following a meticulous screening process, 32 articles were selected for review after removing duplicates and excluding non-English articles. Methodological quality assessment ensuring focused research questions, precise subject selection methods, representative samples, and reliable measurement instruments was carried out. Findings The results demonstrate that entrepreneurs who are self-reliant and extroverted have fewer partners, however, these traits positively impact networking activities. The Big Five personality traits predict business creation and success of ventures. Desire for financial gain, risk-taking propensity, self-confidence, and the need for achievement influences networking behavior. Implications The insights given in this paper can be used for establishing valuable connections, investing in resources, and preparing effective strategies for businesses. Policymakers who aim to promote entrepreneurial behavior among experienced individuals must emphasize the motivations for starting a business and the role of personalities in harnessing and leveraging individual entrepreneurial expertise. Originality The existing literature on antecedents of entrepreneurial networking Behavior and the relationship of these antecedents together with business performance is limited. Further, this review article also offers avenues for future researchers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-793/v1?src=rss">Neurotoxicity of nanoplastics: A review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                With the increase in plastic waste in the environment, it is undeniable that humans and most organisms are exposed to plastic particles of various sizes, including nanoplastics (NPs). Humans are at risk owing to various routes of entry, including ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. While the toxicity of NPs is still debatable due to the scarcity of resources and research, most studies have concluded that NPs may exert toxicity, which exacerbates their neurotoxicity potential. Earlier studies concluded that NPs can cause oxidative stress, which results in apoptosis of neuronal cells. Some studies have shown that NPs can affect fundamental cell functions by inducing physical stress through deposition. Furthermore, studies on in vivo models exposed to NPs have demonstrated behavioral changes that are presumably due to alterations in acetylcholinesterase activity and neurotransmitter levels. This review discusses studies conducted on the neurotoxic potential of NPs and their effects, which are dependent on several parameters, including size and type of NPs, exposure concentration, duration, and various models at risk of NP exposure. Furthermore, speculations on how NPs are related to neurotoxicity are also discussed.

                Meng et al. show that 1% oxygen results in cell cycle re-entry in macrophages. Mechanistically, this is triggered by an HIF2α-directed transcriptional program and accompanied by reversible activation of the canonical MEK/ERK proliferation pathway. CDK1-associated SAMHD1 phosphorylation at T592 in hypoxic macrophages renders them more susceptible to lentiviral transduction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89032">Vacuolar H+-ATPase determines daughter cell fates through asymmetric segregation of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) generate two daughter cells with identical genetic information but distinct cell fates through epigenetic mechanisms. However, the process of partitioning different epigenetic information into daughter cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell rather than the apoptotic one during ACDs in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The absence of NuRD triggers apoptosis via the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 pathway, while an ectopic gain of NuRD enables apoptotic daughter cells to survive. We identify the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>–adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) complex as a crucial regulator of NuRD’s asymmetric segregation. V-ATPase interacts with NuRD and is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell. Inhibition of V-ATPase disrupts cytosolic pH asymmetry and NuRD asymmetry. We suggest that asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase may cause distinct acidification levels in the two daughter cells, enabling asymmetric epigenetic inheritance that specifies their respective life-versus-death fates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95318">RBM7 deficiency promotes breast cancer metastasis by coordinating MFGE8 splicing switch and NF-kB pathway</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant alternative splicing is well-known to be closely associated with tumorigenesis of various cancers. However, the intricate mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis driven by deregulated splicing events remain largely unexplored. Here, we unveiled that RBM7 is decreased in lymph node and distant organ metastases of breast cancer as compared to primary lesions and low expression of RBM7 is correlated with the reduced disease-free survival of breast cancer patients. Breast cancer cells with RBM7 depletion exhibited an increased potential for lung metastasis compared to scramble control cells. The absence of RBM7 stimulated breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, RBM7 controlled the splicing switch of MFGE8, favoring the production of the predominant isoform of MFGE8, MFGE8-L. This resulted in the attenuation of STAT1 phosphorylation and alterations in cell adhesion molecules. MFGE8-L exerted an inhibitory effect on the migratory and invasive capability of breast cancer cells, while the truncated isoform MFGE8-S, which lack the second F5/8 type C domain had the opposite effect. In addition, RBM7 negatively regulates the NF-κB cascade and an NF-κB inhibitor could obstruct the increase in HUVEC tube formation caused by RBM7 silencing. Clinically, we noticed a positive correlation between RBM7 expression and MFGE8 exon7 inclusion in breast cancer tissues, providing new mechanistic insights for molecular-targeted therapy in combating breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91931">The components of an electrical synapse as revealed by expansion microscopy of a single synaptic contact</a></h4>

              
                Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell-cell communication, known as 'chemical' and 'electrical' synapses, respectively. Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components. Electrical synapses are, on the other hand, generally defined by the presence of a 'gap junction' (a cluster of intercellular channels) between two neuronal processes. However, while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism, it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures. We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells, at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse. Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures. Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components. Remarkably, most of the synaptic contact's surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. Thus, our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one, but multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95397">Uncovering the BIN1-SH3 interactome underpinning centronuclear myopathy</a></h4>

              
                Truncation of the protein-protein interaction SH3 domain of the membrane remodeling Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1, Amphiphysin 2) protein leads to centronuclear myopathy. Here, we assessed the impact of a set of naturally observed, previously uncharacterized BIN1 SH3 domain variants using conventional <i>in vitro</i> and cell-based assays monitoring the BIN1 interaction with dynamin 2 (DNM2) and identified potentially harmful ones that can be also tentatively connected to neuromuscular disorders. However, SH3 domains are typically promiscuous and it is expected that other, so far unknown partners of BIN1 exist besides DNM2, that also participate in the development of centronuclear myopathy. In order to shed light on these other relevant interaction partners and to get a holistic picture of the pathomechanism behind BIN1 SH3 domain variants, we used affinity interactomics. We identified hundreds of new BIN1 interaction partners proteome-wide, among which many appear to participate in cell division, suggesting a critical role of BIN1 in the regulation of mitosis. Finally, we show that the identified BIN1 mutations indeed cause proteome-wide affinity perturbation, signifying the importance of employing unbiased affinity interactomic approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93194">Evolutionary adaptation of an HP1-protein chromodomain integrates chromatin and DNA sequence signals</a></h4>

              
                Members of the diverse heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family play crucial roles in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Despite the similar affinities of their chromodomains for di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), different HP1 proteins exhibit distinct chromatin-binding patterns, likely due to interactions with various specificity factors. Previously, we showed that the chromatin-binding pattern of the HP1 protein Rhino, a crucial factor of the <i>Drosophila</i> PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, is largely defined by a DNA sequence-specific C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein named Kipferl (Baumgartner et al., 2022). Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction between Rhino and its guidance factor Kipferl. Through phylogenetic analyses, structure prediction, and in vivo genetics, we identify a single amino acid change within Rhino’s chromodomain, G31D, that does not affect H3K9me2/3 binding but disrupts the interaction between Rhino and Kipferl. Flies carrying the <i>rhino<sup>G31D</sup></i> mutation phenocopy <i>kipferl</i> mutant flies, with Rhino redistributing from piRNA clusters to satellite repeats, causing pronounced changes in the ovarian piRNA profile of <i>rhino<sup>G31D</sup></i> flies. Thus, Rhino’s chromodomain functions as a dual-specificity module, facilitating interactions with both a histone mark and a DNA-binding protein.

	<p>Emotion dysregulation has long been considered a key symptom in multiple psychiatric disorders. Difficulties in emotion regulation have been associated with neural dysregulation in fronto-limbic circuits. Real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NFB) has become increasingly popular as a potential treatment for emotional dysregulation in psychiatric disorders, as it is able to directly target the impaired neural circuits. However, the clinical impact of these rt-fMRI-NFB protocols in psychiatric populations is still largely unknown. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of primary studies from 2010 to 2023 that used rt-fMRI-NFB to target emotion regulation. We assessed 41 out of 4001 original studies for methodological quality and risk of bias and synthesised concerning the frequency of significant rt-fMRI-NFB-related effects on the neural and behaviour level. Successful modulation of brain activity was reported in between 25 and 50 percent of study samples, while neural effects in clinical samples were more diverse than in healthy samples. Interestingly, the frequency of rt-fMRI-NFB-related behavioural improvement was over 75 percent in clinical samples, while healthy samples showed behavioural improvements between 0 and 25 percent. Concerning clinical subsamples, rt-fMRI-NFB-related behavioural improvement was observed in up to 100 percent of major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) samples. Substance use samples showed behavioural benefits ranging between 50 and 75 percent. Neural effects appeared to be less frequent than behavioural improvements: most neural outcomes ranged between 25 and 50 percent for MDD and substance use and between 0 and 25 percent for PTSD. Using multiple individualised regions of interest (ROIs) for rt-fMRI-NFB training resulted in more frequent behavioural benefits than rt-fMRI-NFB solely based on the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex. While a significant improvement in behavioural outcomes was reported in most clinical studies, the study protocols were heterogeneous, which limits the current evaluation of rt-fMRI-NFB as a putative treatment for emotional dysregulation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Schizophrenia is a chronic and progressive neuropsychiatric illness. Apart from positive and negative symptoms, 98% of the population diagnosed with schizophrenia have impaired cognitive functioning, which significantly influences the quality of life. The correlation between lipids and cognitive functioning has been well established. Our study aimed to investigate correlations between cognitive functions, the severity of schizophrenia symptoms, and lipid profiles. (2) Methods: Fifty-two women diagnosed with schizophrenia participated in this study. Cognitive functioning was measured using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) was used. The serum lipid profile, including low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), and triglycerides was measured. (3) Results: Better cognitive functions were associated with normal HDL levels, while low HDL levels correlated with worse WSCT scores. Only the PANSS negative subscale showed a correlation with HDL levels. Correlations with chronicity of schizophrenia and the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s age with poorer cognitive functions, but not with symptom severity, were detected. Early/late age at onset did not influence WSCT scores. (4) Conclusions: Our results suggest high HDL levels might be a protective factor against cognitive impairment. The influences of age and illness duration also play a vital role in cognitive performance.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the significance of baseline measurements for amateur team athletes playing contact and collision team sports with a specific focus on the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) to improve concussion management. Symptoms of sports-related concussions (SRCs) can be diverse and long-lasting and include cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, and vestibular dysfunction. Therefore, comprehensive baseline data are essential to preventing recurrent concussions and secondary injuries. This study was conducted during the 2023 off-season and evaluated the baseline condition of 65 male university rugby players using the SCAT5, which includes self-reported symptoms, and the modified Balance Error Scoring System (mBESS). The athletes were assessed for the presence or absence of SRC, and the mean values were compared using the Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test. Among the participants, 35.38% (23/65) reported symptoms, with an average of 1.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.8 symptoms per player and an average symptom score of 2.66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.93. In the mBESS, no errors were observed in the tandem stance test; however, 72.31% (47/65) made errors in the single-leg stance test on the non-dominant foot, with an average of 1.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.5 errors. Many athletes self-reported symptoms and balance errors, even during asymptomatic periods before experiencing concussion, indicating unresolved issues. In the injury history survey, the baseline evaluations and injury histories of the participants classified into the SRC and non-SRC groups were compared. In the mBESS single-leg stance test (non-dominant foot), 84.21% (32/38) of the SRC group participants made errors, with an average score of 2.13 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.52, whereas 55.55% (15/27) of the non-SRC group participants made errors, with an average score of 1.15 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.35, showing a significant difference (p = 0.007). Additionally, significant differences were observed in the average number of ankle sprains (p = 0.027) and fractures (p = 0.048) between patients with and without a history of SRC. These findings indicate that athletes may have underlying issues even during normal periods before concussion. Moreover, the results highlighted the impact of previous concussions on motor control and injury risk. This underscores the importance of preseason baseline measurements using the SCAT to identify at-risk athletes and implement preventive measures. These findings align with the recommendations of the 6th International Conference on Concussion in Sport and suggest further refinement of concussion assessment tools.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a significant concern as it is a risk factor for AD progression, and early detection is vital in order to delay dementia onset and enable potential therapeutic interventions. Olfactory impairment is recognized as a predictive biomarker in neurodegenerative processes. The aims of this study were to explore the degree of entorhinal cortical atrophy (ERICA) and the severity of MCI symptoms; to analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results for the entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, peri entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellar tentorium; and to perform a comprehensive neuropsychological and psychophysical assessment. The main results highlighted that in our sample&amp;amp;mdash;multidomain amnesic MCI patients with hyposmic symptomatology&amp;amp;mdash;we found that ERICA scores were associated with the severity of anxiety symptomatology. One possible hypothesis to explain this observation is that anxiety may contribute to neurodegenerative processes by inducing chronic stress and inflammation. Future research should consider the longitudinal development of neuropsychological scores, anxiety disorders, and brain atrophy to determine their potential predictive value for MCI progression. These findings suggest the importance of psychological factors in MCI progression and the utility of neuropsychological assessment alongside neuroimaging techniques for early detection and follow-up in MCI patients.</p>

	<p>Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF)-induced illusion of hand movements produces beneficial effects in patients with chronic pain. However, neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly known. In this preliminary study, we test the novel hypothesis that such an MVF-induced movement illusion may exert its effects by changing the activity in midline cortical areas associated with pain processing. Electrical stimuli with individually fixed intensity were applied to the left hand of healthy adults to produce painful and non-painful sensations during unilateral right-hand movements with such an MVF illusion and right and bilateral hand movements without MVF. During these events, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded from 64 scalp electrodes. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG alpha rhythms (8&amp;amp;ndash;12 Hz) indexed the neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms inducing cortical activation. Compared to the painful sensations, the non-painful sensations were specifically characterized by (1) lower alpha ERD estimated in the cortical midline, angular gyrus, and lateral parietal regions during the experimental condition with MVF and (2) higher alpha ERD estimated in the lateral prefrontal and parietal regions during the control conditions without MVF. These preliminary results suggest that the MVF-induced movement illusion may affect nociception and neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms, reducing the activation in cortical limbic and default mode regions.</p>

	<p>Over the past three decades, substantial advancements have occurred in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). These developments encompass various non-invasive techniques aimed at modulating brain function. Among the most widely utilized methods today are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), which include direct- or alternating-current transcranial stimulation (tDCS/tACS). In addition to these established techniques, newer modalities have emerged, broadening the scope of non-invasive neuromodulation approaches available for research and clinical applications in movement disorders, particularly for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and, to a lesser extent, atypical Parkinsonism (AP). All NIBS techniques offer the opportunity to explore a wide range of neurophysiological mechanisms and exert influence over distinct brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinsonism. This paper&amp;amp;rsquo;s first aim is to provide a brief overview of the historical background and underlying physiological principles of primary NIBS techniques, focusing on their translational relevance. It aims to shed light on the potential identification of biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, by summarising available experimental data on individuals with Parkinsonism. To date, despite promising findings indicating the potential utility of NIBS techniques in Parkinsonism, their integration into clinical routine for diagnostic or therapeutic protocols remains a subject of ongoing investigation and scientific debate. In this context, this paper addresses current unsolved issues and methodological challenges concerning the use of NIBS, focusing on the importance of future research endeavours for maximizing the efficacy and relevance of NIBS strategies for individuals with Parkinsonism.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) increases primary motor cortex (M1) excitability and improves motor performance when applied unilaterally to the dominant hemisphere. However, the influence of tDCS on contralateral M1 excitability both during and after application has not been quantified. The purpose was to determine the influence of tDCS applied to the dominant M1 on the excitability of the contralateral non-dominant M1. This study employed a double-blind, randomized, SHAM-controlled, within-subject crossover experimental design. Eighteen young adults performed two experimental sessions (tDCS, SHAM) in counterbalanced order separated by a one-week washout. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to quantify the excitability of the contralateral M1 to which anodal tDCS was applied for 20 min with a current strength of 1 mA. Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were assessed in 5 TMS test blocks (Pre, D5, D10, D15, and Post). The Pre and Post TMS test blocks were performed immediately before and after tDCS application, whereas the TMS test blocks performed during tDCS were completed at the 5, 10, and 15 min stimulation timepoints. MEPs were analyzed with a 2 condition (tDCS, SHAM) &amp;amp;times; 5 test (Pre, D5, D10, D15, Post) within-subject ANOVA. The main effect for condition (p = 0.213), the main effect for test (p = 0.502), and the condition &amp;amp;times; test interaction (p = 0.860) were all not statistically significant. These results indicate that tDCS does not modulate contralateral M1 excitability during or immediately after application, at least under the current set of common tDCS parameters of stimulation.</p>

                <p>Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) triggers glaucoma by damaging the output neurons of the retina called retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This leads to the loss of RGC signaling to visual centers of the brain such as the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which is critical for processing and relaying information to the cortex for conscious vision. In response to altered levels of activity or synaptic input, neurons can homeostatically modulate postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor numbers, allowing them to scale their synaptic responses to stabilize spike output. While prior work has indicated unaltered glutamate receptor properties in the glaucomatous dLGN, it is unknown whether glaucoma impacts dLGN inhibition. Here, using DBA/2J mice, which develop elevated IOP beginning at 6&ndash;7&nbsp;months of age, we tested whether the strength of inhibitory synapses on dLGN thalamocortical relay neurons is altered in response to the disease state. We found an enhancement of feedforward disynaptic inhibition arising from local interneurons along with increased amplitude of quantal inhibitory synaptic currents. A combination of immunofluorescence staining for the -aminobutyric acid (GABA)<SUB>A</SUB>-&alpha;1 receptor subunit, peak-scaled nonstationary fluctuation analysis, and measures of homeostatic synaptic scaling pointed to an ~1.4-fold increase in GABA receptors at postsynaptic inhibitory synapses, although several pieces of evidence indicate a nonuniform scaling across inhibitory synapses within individual relay neurons. Together, these results indicate an increase in inhibitory synaptic strength in the glaucomatous dLGN, potentially pointing toward homeostatic compensation for disruptions in network and neuronal function triggered by increased IOP.</p>

                <p>Individuals exhibit significant variability in their ability to adapt locomotor skills, with some adapting quickly and others more slowly. Differences in brain activity likely contribute to this variability, but direct neural evidence is lacking. We investigated individual differences in electrocortical activity that led to faster locomotor adaptation rates. We recorded high-density electroencephalography while young, neurotypical adults adapted their walking on a split-belt treadmill and grouped them based on how quickly they restored their gait symmetry. Results revealed unique spectral signatures within the posterior parietal, bilateral sensorimotor, and right visual cortices that differ between fast and slow adapters. Specifically, fast adapters exhibited lower alpha power in the posterior parietal and right visual cortices during early adaptation, associated with quicker attainment of steady-state step length symmetry. Decreased posterior parietal alpha may reflect enhanced spatial attention, sensory integration, and movement planning to facilitate faster locomotor adaptation. Conversely, slow adapters displayed greater alpha and beta power in the right visual cortex during late adaptation, suggesting potential differences in visuospatial processing. Additionally, fast adapters demonstrated reduced spectral power in the bilateral sensorimotor cortices compared with slow adapters, particularly in the theta band, which may suggest variations in perception of the split-belt perturbation. These findings suggest that alpha and beta oscillations in the posterior parietal and visual cortices and theta oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex are related to the rate of gait adaptation.</p>

                Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a G-coupled protein receptor that induces crucial biological processes when bound by sphingosine 1-phosphate. Here, we have characterized nine S1PR1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                One of the factors causing rice production disturbance in Indonesia is that farmers lack knowledge of early symptoms of rice plant diseases. These diseases are increasingly rampant because of the lack of experts. This study aimed to overcome this problem by providing an Expert System that helps farmers to make an early diagnosis of rice plant diseases. Data of rice plant pests and diseases in 2016 were taken from Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia using an in-depth survey, and rice experts from the Department of Food Crops and Horticulture of East Kalimantan Province were recruited for the project. The Expert System for Rice Plant Disease Diagnosis, ESforRPD2, was developed based on the pest and disease experiences of the rice experts and uses a Waterfall Paradigm and Unified Modeling Language. This Expert System can detect 48 symptoms and 8 types of diseases of rice plants from 16 data tests with a sensitivity of 87.5%. The system can also provide recommendations for the treatment of identified diseases. ESforRPD2 is available in Indonesian at http://esforrpd2.blog.unmul.ac.id

                Abstract* Background Large Language Models (LLMs), as in the case of OpenAITM ChatGPT-4TM Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalised through a fine-tuning process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI launched the possibility of fine-tuning their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the creation of customised GPT versions deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. Methods This preliminary research aims to assess the potential of the customised GPTs. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behaviour was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Firstly, each professor collected 15-30 genuine student questions from “Statistics and Probability” and “Business Statistics” courses across seven degrees, primarily from second-year courses. These questions, often ambiguous and imprecise, were posed to ChatGPT-4 Turbo and BSVP, with their initial responses recorded without follow-ups. In the third stage, professors blindly evaluated the responses on a 0-10 scale, considering quality, depth, and personalization. Finally, a statistical comparison of the systems’ performance was conducted. Results The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP responded in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, when explicitly asked for something like, “I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,” BSVP could provide a far superior response. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Conclusions It appears that customised assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

                Purpose The objective of this research was to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in online students. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, CINAHL plus with full text, and Wiley InterScience databases. A total of 3,749 studies were identified between January 2020 and December 2023. The Joanna Briggs Tool for studies reporting prevalence was used to assess the quality of studies. Jamovi 2.4 was used in the meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies were included and used for the meta-analysis. There were 6 studies of high quality, 9 studies of medium quality and 1 study of low quality. The areas with the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal pain were the neck (51%, 95% CI = 36–66%), lower back (51%, 95% CI = 42–59%) and shoulder (36%, 95% CI = 26–47%). Conclusions The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a potential factor influencing musculoskeletal pain in students. Educational institutions should study the duration of online learning that begins to impact student injury outcomes.

                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Candida lambica (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Candida krusei (24.4%), Candida kefyr (22.2%), Candida lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Candida guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, most isolates of C. lambica C. krusei, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

                <p>by Ziyan Guo, Jialu Yu, Wenxin Wang, Patricia Lockwood, Zhen Wu</p>

Altruistic punishment is key to establishing cooperation and maintaining social order, yet its developmental trends across cultures remain unclear. Using computational reinforcement learning models, we provided the first evidence of how social feedback dynamically influences group-biased altruistic punishment across cultures and the lifespan. Study 1 (<i>n</i> = 371) found that Chinese participants exhibited higher learning rates than Americans when socially incentivized to punish unfair allocations. Additionally, Chinese adults showed slower learning and less exploration when punishing ingroups than outgroups, a pattern absent in American counterparts, potentially reflecting a tendency towards ingroup favoritism that may contribute to reinforcing collectivist values. Study 2 (<i>n</i> = 430, aged 12–52) further showed that such ingroup favoritism develops with age. Chinese participants’ learning rates for ingroup punishment decreased from adolescence into adulthood, while outgroup rates stayed constant, implying a process of cultural learning. Our findings highlight cultural and age-related variations in altruistic punishment learning, with implications for social reinforcement learning and culturally sensitive educational practices promoting fairness and altruism.

                <p>by Vinoth Manivannan, Mandar M. Inamdar, Ranjith Padinhateeri</p>

Cells switch genes ON or OFF by altering the state of chromatin via histone modifications at specific regulatory locations along the chromatin polymer. These gene regulation processes are carried out by a network of reactions in which the histone marks spread to neighboring regions with the help of enzymes. In the literature, this spreading has been studied as a purely kinetic, non-diffusive process considering the interactions between neighboring nucleosomes. In this work, we go beyond this framework and study the spreading of modifications using a reaction-diffusion (RD) model accounting for the diffusion of the constituents. We quantitatively segregate the modification profiles generated from kinetic and RD models. The diffusion and degradation of enzymes set a natural length scale for limiting the domain size of modification spreading, and the resulting enzyme limitation is inherent in our model. We also demonstrate the emergence of confined modification domains without the explicit requirement of a nucleation site. We explore polymer compaction effects on spreading and show that single-cell domains may differ from averaged profiles. We find that the modification profiles from our model are comparable with existing H3K9me3 data of <i>S. pombe</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011953">An integrative approach to protein sequence design through multiobjective optimization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lu Hong, Tanja Kortemme</p>

With recent methodological advances in the field of computational protein design, in particular those based on deep learning, there is an increasing need for frameworks that allow for coherent, direct integration of different models and objective functions into the generative design process. Here we demonstrate how evolutionary multiobjective optimization techniques can be adapted to provide such an approach. With the established Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) as the optimization framework, we use AlphaFold2 and ProteinMPNN confidence metrics to define the objective space, and a mutation operator composed of ESM-1v and ProteinMPNN to rank and then redesign the least favorable positions. Using the two-state design problem of the foldswitching protein RfaH as an in-depth case study, and PapD and calmodulin as examples of higher-dimensional design problems, we show that the evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach leads to significant reduction in the bias and variance in RfaH native sequence recovery, compared to a direct application of ProteinMPNN. We suggest that this improvement is due to three factors: (i) the use of an informative mutation operator that accelerates the sequence space exploration, (ii) the parallel, iterative design process inherent to the genetic algorithm that improves upon the ProteinMPNN autoregressive sequence decoding scheme, and (iii) the explicit approximation of the Pareto front that leads to optimal design candidates representing diverse tradeoff conditions. We anticipate this approach to be readily adaptable to different models and broadly relevant for protein design tasks with complex specifications.

                <p>by David R. Penas, Meysam Hashemi, Viktor K. Jirsa, Julio R. Banga</p>

The Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) refers to a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities. It is capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG data, allowing for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach. The approach utilizes SaCeSS, a cooperative metaheuristic capable of parallel computation, to yield high-quality solutions without requiring excessive computational time. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic data, our proposal successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating better scalability and superior performance against other parallel solvers. These results were further enhanced using a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning, with significant gains in terms of both accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, we added a scalable uncertainty quantification phase after model calibration, and used it to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems. Overall, this study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby to inform the clinical decision-making process.

                <p>by Maud Delattre, Yusuke Toda, Jessica Tressou, Hiroyoshi Iwata</p>

The evaluation of plant and animal growth, separately for genetic and environmental effects, is necessary for genetic understanding and genetic improvement of environmental responses of plants and animals. We propose to extend an existing approach that combines nonlinear mixed-effects model (NLMEM) and the stochastic approximation of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (SAEM) to analyze genetic and environmental effects on plant growth. These tools are widely used in many fields but very rarely in plant biology. During model formulation, a nonlinear function describes the shape of growth, and random effects describe genetic and environmental effects and their variability. Genetic relationships among the varieties were also integrated into the model using a genetic relationship matrix. The SAEM algorithm was chosen as an efficient alternative to MCMC methods, which are more commonly used in the domain. It was implemented to infer the expected growth patterns in the analyzed population and the expected curves for each variety through a maximum-likelihood and a maximum-a-posteriori approaches, respectively. The obtained estimates can be used to predict the growth curves for each variety. We illustrate the strengths of the proposed approach using simulated data and soybean plant growth data obtained from a soybean cultivation experiment conducted at the Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University. In this experiment, plant height was measured daily using drones, and the growth was monitored for approximately 200 soybean cultivars for which whole-genome sequence data were available. The NLMEM approach improved our understanding of the determinants of soybean growth and can be successfully used for the genomic prediction of growth pattern characteristics.

                <p>by Katherine S. Yanagi, Briar Jochim, Sheikh Omar Kunjo, Peter Breen, Gary Ruvkun, Nicolas Lehrbach</p>

The conserved SKN-1A/Nrf1 transcription factor regulates the expression of proteasome subunit genes and is essential for maintenance of adequate proteasome function in animal development, aging, and stress responses. Unusual among transcription factors, SKN-1A/Nrf1 is a glycoprotein synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). N-glycosylated SKN-1A/Nrf1 exits the ER and is deglycosylated in the cytosol by the PNG-1/NGLY1 peptide:N-glycanase. Deglycosylation edits the protein sequence of SKN-1A/Nrf1 by converting N-glycosylated asparagine residues to aspartate, which is necessary for SKN-1A/Nrf1 transcriptional activation of proteasome subunit genes. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the peptide:N-glycanase (NGLY1) gene cause NGLY1 deficiency, a congenital disorder of deglycosylation. There are no effective treatments for NGLY1 deficiency. Since SKN-1A/Nrf1 is a major client of NGLY1, the resulting proteasome deficit contributes to NGLY1 disease. We sought to identify targets for mitigation of proteasome dysfunction in NGLY1 deficiency that might indicate new avenues for treatment. We isolated mutations that suppress the sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors caused by inactivation of the NGLY1 ortholog PNG-1 in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We identified multiple suppressor mutations affecting 3 conserved genes: <i>rsks-1</i>, <i>tald-1</i>, and <i>ent-4</i>. We show that the suppressors act through a SKN-1/Nrf-independent mechanism and confer proteostasis benefits consistent with amelioration of proteasome dysfunction. <i>ent-4</i> encodes an intestinal nucleoside/nucleotide transporter, and we show that restriction of nucleotide availability is beneficial, whereas a nucleotide-rich diet exacerbates proteasome dysfunction in PNG-1/NGLY1-deficient <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. Our findings suggest that dietary or pharmacological interventions altering nucleotide availability have the potential to mitigate proteasome insufficiency in NGLY1 deficiency and other diseases associated with proteasome dysfunction.

                <p>by Jae-Hong Kim, Nakamura Michiko, In-Sun Choi, Yujung Kim, Ji-Young Jeong, Maan-Gee Lee, Il-Sung Jang, Kyoungho Suk</p>

Reactive astrocytes are associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in diverse neuropathologies; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We used optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to identify the crucial roles of the hippocampal CA1 astrocytes in cognitive decline. Our results showed that repeated optogenetic stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 astrocytes induced cognitive impairment in mice and decreased synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP), which was accompanied by the appearance of inflammatory astrocytes. Mechanistic studies conducted using knockout animal models and hippocampal neuronal cultures showed that lipocalin-2 (LCN2), derived from reactive astrocytes, mediated neuroinflammation and induced cognitive impairment by decreasing the LTP through the reduction of neuronal NMDA receptors. Sustained chemogenetic stimulation of hippocampal astrocytes provided similar results. Conversely, these phenomena were attenuated by a metabolic inhibitor of astrocytes. Fiber photometry using GCaMP revealed a high level of hippocampal astrocyte activation in the neuroinflammation model. Our findings suggest that reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus are sufficient and required to induce cognitive decline through LCN2 release and synaptic modulation. This abnormal glial–neuron interaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of cognitive disturbances in neuroinflammation-associated brain conditions.

Tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) are model systems for global biodiversity science, but continuing data gaps, limited data standardisation, and ongoing flux in taxonomic nomenclature constrain integrative research on this group and potentially cause biased inference. We combined and harmonised taxonomic, spatial, phylogenetic, and attribute data with phylogeny-based multiple imputation to provide a comprehensive data resource (TetrapodTraits 1.0.0) that includes values, predictions, and sources for body size, activity time, micro- and macrohabitat, ecosystem, threat status, biogeography, insularity, environmental preferences, and human influence, for all 33,281 tetrapod species covered in recent fully sampled phylogenies. We assess gaps and biases across taxa and space, finding that shared data missing in attribute values increased with taxon-level completeness and richness across clades. Prediction of missing attribute values using multiple imputation revealed substantial changes in estimated macroecological patterns. These results highlight biases incurred by nonrandom missingness and strategies to best address them. While there is an obvious need for further data collection and updates, our phylogeny-informed database of tetrapod traits can support a more comprehensive representation of tetrapod species and their attributes in ecology, evolution, and conservation research.

                <p>by George A. Schaible, Zackary J. Jay, John Cliff, Frederik Schulz, Colin Gauvin, Danielle Goudeau, Rex R. Malmstrom, S. Emil Ruff, Virginia Edgcomb, Roland Hatzenpichler</p>

Consortia of multicellular magnetotactic bacteria (MMB) are currently the only known example of bacteria without a unicellular stage in their life cycle. Because of their recalcitrance to cultivation, most previous studies of MMB have been limited to microscopic observations. To study the biology of these unique organisms in more detail, we use multiple culture-independent approaches to analyze the genomics and physiology of MMB consortia at single-cell resolution. We separately sequenced the metagenomes of 22 individual MMB consortia, representing 8 new species, and quantified the genetic diversity within each MMB consortium. This revealed that, counter to conventional views, cells within MMB consortia are not clonal. Single consortia metagenomes were then used to reconstruct the species-specific metabolic potential and infer the physiological capabilities of MMB. To validate genomic predictions, we performed stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments and interrogated MMB consortia using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). By coupling FISH with bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), we explored their in situ activity as well as variation of protein synthesis within cells. We demonstrate that MMB consortia are mixotrophic sulfate reducers and that they exhibit metabolic differentiation between individual cells, suggesting that MMB consortia are more complex than previously thought. These findings expand our understanding of MMB diversity, ecology, genomics, and physiology, as well as offer insights into the mechanisms underpinning the multicellular nature of their unique lifestyle.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1492/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Disseminated hydatid cyst: Unusual presentation and therapeutic challenges [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, is a parasitic disease prevalent in endemic regions. CE frequently leads to the formation of hydatid cysts in various organs, with the liver being the most commonly affected site. Involvement of the spleen has been rarely reported in the literature. Managing disseminated hydatid cyst disease presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Case presentation: A 40-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism presented with sudden onset shortness of breath, dry cough, and chest pain for 3 days. She had a recent travel history to Egypt. Physical examination revealed mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count with eosinophilia and increased inflammatory markers. Chest X-ray and pan-computed tomography (Pan-CT) scans identified multiple cystic lesions in the lung, liver and spleen. Serological tests confirmed the presence of anti-Echinococcus antibodies, leading to a diagnosis of disseminated hydatid cyst disease. The patient was managed medically and surgically by a multidisciplinary team. Conclusion: Disseminated hydatid cyst disease, though rare, presents complex diagnostic and management challenges. Timely recognition, supported by clinical, radiological, and serological assessments, is essential. Surgical intervention should be considered in a patient when multiple extrahepatic cysts are present, and rupture is evident, as this approach can significantly reduce patient morbidity and mitigate life-threatening complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1154/v2?src=rss">Severe meibomian gland loss in polycystic ovarian syndrome patients on estrogen-progesterone therapy: A case series [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To report the ocular surface and meibomian gland changes in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women taking hormone supplementation. Methods: Case series. Results: Three women (27 ± 11 years) already diagnosed with PCOS presented with dry eye symptoms (mean OSDI, 37.5) for a mean duration of 13 months and were taking hormonal supplements for a mean duration of 60 ± 11 months. The hormonal supplements included oral estrogen (n=3), oral progesterone (n=3), antiandrogen cyproterone (n=1) and isotretinoin (n=1). Ocular surface evaluation revealed mean NIBUT of 9.9 ± 1.6 seconds and mean TMH of 0.27 ± 0.05 mm, assessed non-invasively using Oculus keratograph 5M (K5M). Meibography (K5M) showed near total loss of all meibomian glands (n=8/12 eyelids) with residual ghost glands in all four eyelids of two patients, and gland shortening alone in one patient. The gland morphology did not change following intense thermal pulsation treatment or cessation of hormonal therapy. Conclusions: Near-total irreversible meibomian gland loss was seen in two young PCOS women taking hormonal supplements. Collaboration between ophthalmologists and gynecologists is advisable for early detection and better understanding of dry eye disease (DED) progression in these patients.
