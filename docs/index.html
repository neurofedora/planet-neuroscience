                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The dentate gyrus subfield of the hippocampus is thought to be critically involved in the disambiguation of similar episodic experiences and places in a context-dependent manner. However, most empirical evidence has come from lesion and gene knock-out studies in rodents, in which the dentate gyrus is permanently perturbed and compensation of affected functions via other areas within the memory circuit could take place. The acute and causal role of the dentate gyrus herein remains therefore elusive. The present study aimed to investigate the acute role of the dorsal dentate gyrus in disambiguation learning using reversible inhibitory DREADDs. Rats were trained on a location discrimination task and learned to discriminate between a rewarded and unrewarded location with either small (similar condition) or large (dissimilar condition) separation. Reward contingencies switched after applying a reversal rule, allowing us to track the temporal engagement of the dentate gyrus during the task. Bilateral DREADD modulation of the dentate gyrus impaired the initial acquisition learning of place-reward associations, but performance rapidly recovered to baseline levels within the same session. Modeling of the behavioral patterns revealed that reward sensitivity and alternation behavior were temporally associated with the DG-dependent impairment during acquisition learning. Our study thus provides novel evidence that the dorsal dentate gyrus is acutely engaged during the initial acquisition learning of place-reward associations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01545">Burstiness and interpersonal foraging between human infants and caregivers in the vocal domain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vocal responses from caregivers are believed to promote more frequent and more advanced infant vocalizations. However, studies that examine this relationship typically do not account for the fact that infant and adult vocalizations are distributed in hierarchical clusters over the course of the day. These bursts and lulls create a challenge for accurately detecting the effects of adult input at immediate turn-by-turn timescales within real-world behavior, as adult responses tend to happen during already occurring bursts of infant vocalizations. Analyzing daylong audio recordings of real-world vocal communication between human infants (ages 3, 6, 9, and 18 months) and their adult caregivers, we first show that both infant and caregiver vocalization events are clustered in time, as evidenced by positive correlations between successive inter-event intervals (IEIs). We propose an approach informed by flight time analyses in foraging studies to assess whether the timing of a vocal agent's next vocalization is modified by inputs from another vocal agent, controlling for the first agent's previous IEI. For both infants and adults, receiving a social response predicts that the individual will vocalize again sooner than they would have in the absence of a response. Overall, our results are consistent with a view of infant-caregiver vocal interactions as an 'interpersonal foraging' process with inherent multi-scale dynamics wherein social responses are among the resources the individuals are foraging for. The analytic approaches introduced here have broad utility to study communication in other modalities, contexts, and species.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02038">Bell's Inequalities and Entanglement in Corpora of Italian Language</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.02038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the results of three information retrieval tests on conceptual combinations that we have recently performed using corpora of Italian language. The tests have the form of a 'Bell-type test' and were aimed at identifying 'quantum entanglement' in the combination, or composition, of two concepts. In the first two tests, we studied the Italian translation of the combination 'The Animal Acts', while in the third test, we studied the Italian translation of the combination 'The Animal eats the Food'. We found a significant violation of Bell's inequalities in all tests. Empirical patterns confirm the results obtained with corpora of English language, which indicates the existence of deep structures in concept formation that are language-independent. The systematic violation of Bell's inequalities suggests the presence of entanglement and, indeed, we elaborate here a 'quantum model in Hilbert space' for the collected data. This investigation supports our theoretical hypothesis about entanglement as a phenomenon of 'contextual updating', independently of the nature, micro-physical or conceptual linguistic, of the entities involved. Finally, these findings allow us to further clarify the mutual relationships between entanglement, Cirel'son's bound, and no-signaling in Bell-type situations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02541">A comprehensive framework for statistical testing of brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive statistical framework for analysing brain dynamics and testing their associations with behavioural, physiological and other non-imaging variables. Based on a generalisation of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) - the Gaussian-Linear HMM - our open-source Python package supports multiple experimental paradigms, including task-based and resting-state studies, and addresses a wide range of questions in neuroscience and related scientific fields. Inference is carried out using permutation-based methods and structured Monte Carlo resampling, and the framework can easily handle confounding variables, multiple testing corrections, and hierarchical relationships within the data. The package includes tools for intuitive visualisation of statistical results, along with comprehensive documentation and step-by-step tutorials to make it accessible for users of varying expertise. Altogether, it provides a broadly applicable, end-to-end pipeline for analysis and statistical testing of functional neural data and its dynamics.

                arXiv:2505.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced neural interfaces are transforming applications ranging from neuroscience research to diagnostic tools (for mental state recognition, tremor and seizure detection) as well as prosthetic devices (for motor and communication recovery). By integrating complex functions into miniaturized neural devices, these systems unlock significant opportunities for personalized assistive technologies and adaptive therapeutic interventions. Leveraging high-density neural recordings, on-site signal processing, and machine learning (ML), these interfaces extract critical features, identify disease neuro-markers, and enable accurate, low-latency neural decoding. This integration facilitates real-time interpretation of neural signals, adaptive modulation of brain activity, and efficient control of assistive devices. Moreover, the synergy between neural interfaces and ML has paved the way for self-sufficient, ubiquitous platforms capable of operating in diverse environments with minimal hardware costs and external dependencies. In this work, we review recent advancements in AI-driven decoding algorithms and energy-efficient System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms for next-generation miniaturized neural devices. These innovations highlight the potential for developing intelligent neural interfaces, addressing critical challenges in scalability, reliability, interpretability, and user adaptability.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06143">The Integrated Information Theory needs Attention</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.06143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) might be our current best bet at a scientific explanation of phenomenal consciousness. IIT focuses on the distinctively subjective and phenomenological aspects of conscious experience. Currently, it offers the fundaments of a formal account, but future developments shall explain the qualitative structures of every possible conscious experience. But this ambitious project is hindered by one fundamental limitation. IIT fails to acknowledge the crucial roles of attention in generating phenomenally conscious experience and shaping its contents. Here, we argue that IIT urgently needs an account of attention. Without this account, IIT cannot explain important informational differences between different kinds of experiences. Furthermore, though some IIT proponents celebratedly endorse a double dissociation between consciousness and attention, close analysis reveals that such as dissociation is in fact incompatible with IIT. Notably, the issues we raise for IIT will likely arise for many internalist theories of conscious contents in philosophy, especially theories with primitivist inclinations. Our arguments also extend to the recently popularized structuralist approaches. Overall, our discussion highlights how considerations about attention are indispensable for scientific as well as philosophical theorizing about conscious experience.

                arXiv:2503.02636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we implement a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate multi-channel resting-state EEG data and assess the quality of the synthesized signals through both visual and feature-based evaluations. Our results indicate that the model effectively captures the statistical and spectral characteristics of real EEG data, although challenges remain in replicating high-frequency oscillations in the frontal region. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Critic's learned representations can be reused for gender classification task, achieving an out-of-sample accuracy, significantly better than a shuffled-label baseline and a model trained directly on EEG data. These findings suggest that generative models can serve not only as EEG data generators but also as unsupervised feature extractors, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. This study highlights the potential of GAN-based unsupervised learning for EEG analysis, suggesting avenues for more data-efficient deep learning applications in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06432">Joint-Embedding Masked Autoencoder for Self-supervised Learning of Dynamic Functional Connectivity from the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.06432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning dynamic functional connectivity for distinguishing phenotypes from human brain networks. However, obtaining extensive labeled clinical data for training is often resource-intensive, making practical application difficult. Leveraging unlabeled data thus becomes crucial for representation learning in a label-scarce setting. Although generative self-supervised learning techniques, especially masked autoencoders, have shown promising results in representation learning in various domains, their application to dynamic graphs for dynamic functional connectivity remains underexplored, facing challenges in capturing high-level semantic representations. Here, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Joint Embedding Masked Autoencoder (ST-JEMA), drawing inspiration from the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) in computer vision. ST-JEMA employs a JEPA-inspired strategy for reconstructing dynamic graphs, which enables the learning of higher-level semantic representations considering temporal perspectives, addressing the challenges in fMRI data representation learning. Utilizing the large-scale UK Biobank dataset for self-supervised learning, ST-JEMA shows exceptional representation learning performance on dynamic functional connectivity demonstrating superiority over previous methods in predicting phenotypes and psychiatric diagnoses across eight benchmark fMRI datasets even with limited samples and effectiveness of temporal reconstruction on missing data scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of our approach as a robust representation learning method for leveraging label-scarce fMRI data.

                arXiv:2505.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do non-neural organisms, such as the slime mould \textit{Physarum polycephalum}, anticipate periodic events in their environment? We present a minimal, biologically inspired reservoir model that demonstrates simple temporal anticipation without neurons, spikes, or trained readouts. The model consists of a spatially embedded hexagonal network in which nodes regulate their energy through local, allostatic adaptation. Input perturbations shape energy dynamics over time, allowing the system to internalize temporal regularities into its structure. After being exposed to a periodic input signal, the model spontaneously re-enacts those dynamics even in the absence of further input -- a form of unsupervised temporal pattern completion. This behaviour emerges from internal homeodynamic regulation, without supervised learning or symbolic processing. Our results show that simple homeodynamic regulation can support unsupervised prediction, suggesting a pathway to memory and anticipation in basal organisms.

                arXiv:2505.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16933">Backpropagation through space, time, and the brain</a></h4>

Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.

                arXiv:2505.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from single-objective evolutionary algorithms, where non-elitism is an established concept, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms almost always select the next population in a greedy fashion. In the only notable exception, Bian, Zhou, Li, and Qian (IJCAI 2023) proposed a stochastic selection mechanism for the SMS-EMOA and proved that it can speed up computing the Pareto front of the bi-objective jump benchmark with problem size $n$ and gap parameter $k$ by a factor of $\max\{1,2^{k/4}/n\}$. While this constitutes the first proven speed-up from non-elitist selection, suggesting a very interesting research direction, it has to be noted that a true speed-up only occurs for $k \ge 4\log_2(n)$, where the runtime is super-polynomial, and that the advantage reduces for larger numbers of objectives as shown in a later work. In this work, we propose a different non-elitist selection mechanism based on aging, which exempts individuals younger than a certain age from a possible removal. This remedies the two shortcomings of stochastic selection: We prove a speed-up by a factor of $\max\{1,\Theta(k)^{k-1}\}$, regardless of the number of objectives. In particular, a positive speed-up can already be observed for constant $k$, the only setting for which polynomial runtimes can be witnessed. Overall, this result supports the use of non-elitist selection schemes, but suggests that aging-based mechanisms can be considerably more powerful than stochastic selection mechanisms.

                arXiv:2505.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been put forward as an energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) since they perform sparse Accumulate operations instead of the power-hungry Multiply-and-Accumulate operations. ANN-SNN conversion is a widely used method to realize deep SNNs with accuracy comparable to that of ANNs.~\citeauthor{bu2023optimal} recently proposed the Quantization-Clip-Floor-Shift (QCFS) activation as an alternative to ReLU to minimize the accuracy loss during ANN-SNN conversion. Nevertheless, SNN inferencing requires a large number of timesteps to match the accuracy of the source ANN for real-world datasets. In this work, we propose PASCAL, which performs ANN-SNN conversion in such a way that the resulting SNN is mathematically equivalent to an ANN with QCFS-activation, thereby yielding similar accuracy as the source ANN with minimal inference timesteps. In addition, we propose a systematic method to configure the quantization step of QCFS activation in a layerwise manner, which effectively determines the optimal number of timesteps per layer for the converted SNN. Our results show that the ResNet-34 SNN obtained using PASCAL achieves an accuracy of $\approx$74\% on ImageNet with a 64$\times$ reduction in the number of inference timesteps compared to existing approaches.

                arXiv:2505.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in Meta-Black-Box-Optimization (MetaBBO) has demonstrated that using RL to learn a meta-level policy for dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) over an optimization task distribution could significantly enhance the performance of the low-level BBO algorithm. However, the online learning paradigms in existing works makes the efficiency of MetaBBO problematic. To address this, we propose an offline learning-based MetaBBO framework in this paper, termed Q-Mamba, to attain both effectiveness and efficiency in MetaBBO. Specifically, we first transform DAC task into long-sequence decision process. This allows us further introduce an effective Q-function decomposition mechanism to reduce the learning difficulty within the intricate algorithm configuration space. Under this setting, we propose three novel designs to meta-learn DAC policy from offline data: we first propose a novel collection strategy for constructing offline DAC experiences dataset with balanced exploration and exploitation. We then establish a decomposition-based Q-loss that incorporates conservative Q-learning to promote stable offline learning from the offline dataset. To further improve the offline learning efficiency, we equip our work with a Mamba architecture which helps long-sequence learning effectiveness and efficiency by selective state model and hardware-aware parallel scan respectively. Through extensive benchmarking, we observe that Q-Mamba achieves competitive or even superior performance to prior online/offline baselines, while significantly improving the training efficiency of existing online baselines. We provide sourcecodes of Q-Mamba at https://github.com/MetaEvo/Q-Mamba.

                arXiv:2505.01685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a brain-inspired generative (BIG) model that merges an impulsive-attention neural network and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for identifying cognitive states based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. A hybrid learning method is presented for training the model by integrating gradient-based learning and heteroassociative memory. The BIG model is capable of achieving multi-task objectives: classification, generating new EEG, and brain network interpretation, alleviating the limitations of excessive data training and high computational cost in conventional approaches. Experimental results on two public EEG datasets demonstrate that the BIG model achieves a classification accuracy above 89\%, comparable with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational cost by nearly 11\% over the baseline EEGNet. Incorporating the generated EEG data for training, the BIG model exhibits comparative performance in a few-shot pattern.Ablation studies justify the poised brain-inspired characteristic regarding the impulsive-attention module and the hybrid learning method. Thanks to the performance advantages with interpretable outputs, this BIG model has application potential for building digital twins of the brain.

                arXiv:2505.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge, particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter, the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.

Abstract: Guiding biological systems toward desired states, such as morphogenetic outcomes, remains a fundamental challenge with far-reaching implications for medicine and synthetic biology. While large language models (LLMs) have enabled natural language as an interface for interpretable control in AI systems, their use as mediators for steering biological or cellular dynamics remains largely unexplored.
  In this work, we present a functional pipeline that translates natural language prompts into spatial vector fields capable of directing simulated cellular collectives. Our approach combines a large language model with an evolvable neural controller (Prompt-to-Intervention, or P2I), optimized via evolutionary strategies to generate behaviors such as clustering or scattering in a simulated 2D environment.
  We demonstrate that even with constrained vocabulary and simplified cell models, evolved P2I networks can successfully align cellular dynamics with user-defined goals expressed in plain language. This work offers a complete loop from language input to simulated bioelectric-like intervention to behavioral output, providing a foundation for future systems capable of natural language-driven cellular control.

                arXiv:2405.00318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological nervous systems constitute important sources of inspiration towards computers that are faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient. Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.

                arXiv:2308.04369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event camera-based pattern recognition is a newly arising research topic in recent years. Current researchers usually transform the event streams into images, graphs, or voxels, and adopt deep neural networks for event-based classification. Although good performance can be achieved on simple event recognition datasets, however, their results may be still limited due to the following two issues. Firstly, they adopt spatial sparse event streams for recognition only, which may fail to capture the color and detailed texture information well. Secondly, they adopt either Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for energy-efficient recognition with suboptimal results, or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for energy-intensive, high-performance recognition. However, seldom of them consider achieving a balance between these two aspects. In this paper, we formally propose to recognize patterns by fusing RGB frames and event streams simultaneously and propose a new RGB frame-event recognition framework to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed method contains four main modules, i.e., memory support Transformer network for RGB frame encoding, spiking neural network for raw event stream encoding, multi-modal bottleneck fusion module for RGB-Event feature aggregation, and prediction head. Due to the scarce of RGB-Event based classification dataset, we also propose a large-scale PokerEvent dataset which contains 114 classes, and 27102 frame-event pairs recorded using a DVS346 event camera. Extensive experiments on two RGB-Event based classification datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We hope this work will boost the development of pattern recognition by fusing RGB frames and event streams. Both our dataset and source code of this work will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/SSTFormer

                <p>Seizures affect a large proportion of the global population and occur due to abnormal neuronal activity in the brain. Unfortunately, widespread genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity contributes to insufficient treatment options. It is critical to identify the genetic underpinnings of how seizures occur to better understand seizure disorders and improve therapeutic development. We used the <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> model to identify that IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (Imp) is linked to the onset of this phenotype. Specific reduction of Imp in neurons causes seizures after mechanical stimulation. Importantly, gross motor behavior is unaffected, showing Imp loss does not affect general neuronal activity. Developmental loss of Imp is sufficient to cause seizures in adults; thus, Imp-modulated neuron development affects mature neuronal function. Since Imp is an RNA-binding protein, we sought to identify the mRNA target that Imp regulates in neurons to ensure proper neuronal activity after mechanical stress. We find that the Imp protein binds <I>Syndecan</I> (<I>Sdc</I>) mRNA, and the reduction of Sdc also causes mechanically induced seizures. Expression of Sdc in <I>Imp</I>-deficient neurons rescues seizure defects, showing that Sdc is sufficient to restore normal behavior after mechanical stress. We suggest that the Imp protein binds <I>Sdc</I> mRNA in neurons, and this functional interaction is important for normal neuronal biology and animal behavior in a mechanically induced seizure model. Since Imp and Sdc are conserved, our work highlights a neuronal-specific pathway that might contribute to seizure disorder when mutated in humans.</p>

                <p>Research that combines advanced technological devices with complex behavioral tasks has enabled investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying brain and behavioral states. Freely moving rodent experiments often require a tether&mdash;a wired connection between an implanted device and an external power supply or data acquisition system. Traditionally, these experiments have used passive commutators to manage tethers, but such setups are often inadequate for reducing twisting and mechanical strain during behavioral tasks. Existing motorized commutators have extended the range of motion for these experiments but generally rely on stepper motors that produce auditory noise, potentially interfering with behavior. To address these limitations, we developed the Motor Assisted Commutator to Harness Electronics in Tethered Experiments (MACHETE), a motor-assisted commutator featuring a low-noise brushless motor. MACHETE dynamically adjusts tethers based on mouse movement, reducing torque and mechanical strain, and minimizing the animal's physical exertion during behavioral assays. Its onboard microcontroller provides customizable controls and seamless integration with custom electronic devices. The design includes a central through-hole to accommodate wires or fibers from external devices such as head-mounted miniature microscopes, electrophysiology probes, and optogenetics systems. We validated MACHETE across standard behavioral assays, including the open field test, the splash test, and the three-chamber social test. Our results showed no significant changes in mobility or behavior compared with untethered controls. By combining precise motor control, low auditory noise equipment, and accessibility, MACHETE can be used to support research that aims to adapt tools for use in freely moving behavior experiments.</p>

                <p>by William Gilpin</p>

Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. In high-dimensional biological networks like ecosystems, long transients arise from the separate timescales of interactions within versus among subcommunities. Here, we use tools from computational complexity theory to frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in an ecosystem produce difficult, ill-conditioned problems, which physically manifest as transient chaos. We find that the recent success of dimensionality reduction methods in describing ecological dynamics arises due to preconditioning, in which fast relaxation decouples from slow solving timescales. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state species diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using scaling relations originally derived for numerical analysis of complex optimization problems. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.

                <p>by Fenglian Pan, You Zhou, Carolina Vivas-Valencia, Nan Kong, Carol Ott, Mohammad S Jalali, Jian Liu</p>

Substance use disorder, particularly opioid-related, is a serious public health challenge in the U.S. Accurately predicting opioid overdose events and stratifying the risk of having such an event are critical for healthcare providers to deliver effective interventions in patients with opioid overdose. Despite a large body of literature investigating various risk factors for the prediction, the existing research to date has not explicitly investigated and quantitatively modeled how an individual’s past opioid overdose events affect future occurrences. In this paper, we proposed a covariate-adjusted triggering point process to simultaneously model the effect of various risk factors on opioid overdose events and the triggering mechanism among opioid overdose events. The prediction performance was assessed by the U.S. state-wise Medicaid reimbursement claims data. Compared with commonly used prediction models, the proposed model achieved the lowest Mean Absolute Errors and Mean Absolute Percentage Errors on 30-, 60-, 90, 120-, 150-, and 180-day-ahead predictions. In addition, our results showed the statistical significance of considering the triggering mechanism for recurrent opioid overdose events prediction. On average, around 47% of the event recurrence were explained by the triggering mechanism.

                <p>by Lenka Kopfová, Josef Tkadlec</p>

Moran Birth-death process is a standard stochastic process that is used to model natural selection in spatially structured populations. A newly occurring mutation that invades a population of residents can either fixate on the whole population or it can go extinct due to random drift. The duration of the process depends not only on the total population size <i>n</i>, but also on the spatial structure of the population. In this work, we consider the Moran process with a single type of individuals who invade and colonize an otherwise empty environment. Mathematically, this corresponds to the setting where the residents have zero reproduction rate, thus they never reproduce. The spatial structure is represented by a graph. We present two main contributions. First, in contrast to the Moran process in which residents do reproduce, we show that the colonization time is always at most a polynomial function of the population size <i>n</i>. Namely, we show that colonization always takes at most 12n3−12n2 expected steps, and for each <i>n</i>, we identify the slowest graph where it takes exactly that many steps. Moreover, we establish a stronger bound of roughly n2.5 steps for undirected graphs and an even stronger bound of roughly n2 steps for so-called regular graphs. Second, we discuss various complications that one faces when attempting to measure fixation times and colonization times in spatially structured populations, and we propose to measure the real duration of the process, rather than counting the steps of the classic Moran process.

                <p>by Peter Methys Degen, Matúš Medo</p>

The high-dimensional and heterogeneous nature of transcriptomics data from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments poses a challenge to routine downstream analysis steps, such as differential expression analysis and enrichment analysis. Additionally, due to practical and financial constraints, RNA-Seq experiments are often limited to a small number of biological replicates. In light of recent studies on the low replicability of preclinical cancer research, it is essential to understand how the combination of population heterogeneity and underpowered cohort sizes affects the replicability of RNA-Seq research. Using 18’000 subsampled RNA-Seq experiments based on real gene expression data from 18 different data sets, we find that differential expression and enrichment analysis results from underpowered experiments are unlikely to replicate well. However, low replicability does not necessarily imply low precision of results, as data sets exhibit a wide range of possible outcomes. In fact, 10 out of 18 data sets achieve high median precision despite low recall and replicability for cohorts with more than five replicates. To assist researchers constrained by small cohort sizes in estimating the expected performance regime of their data sets, we provide a simple bootstrapping procedure that correlates strongly with the observed replicability and precision metrics. We conclude with practical recommendations to alleviate problems with underpowered RNA-Seq studies.

                <p>by Elaine A. Ferguson, Ahmed Lugelo, Anna Czupryna, Danni Anderson, Felix Lankester, Lwitiko Sikana, Jonathan Dushoff, Katie Hampson</p>

Vaccination programs are the mainstay of control for many infectious diseases. Heterogeneous coverage is hypothesized to reduce vaccination program effectiveness, but this impact has not been quantified in real systems. We address this gap using fine-scale data from two decades of rabies contact tracing and dog vaccination campaigns in Serengeti district, Tanzania. We also aimed to identify drivers of the continued circulation of rabies in the district despite annual vaccination campaigns. Using generalized linear mixed models, we find that current focal (village-level) dog rabies incidence decreases with increasing recent focal vaccination coverage. However, current focal incidence depends most on recent incidence, both focally and in the wider district, consistent with high population connectivity. Removing the masking effects of prior non-focal incidence shows that, for the same average prior non-focal (wider-district) vaccination coverage, increased heterogeneity in coverage among the non-focal villages leads to increased focal incidence. These effects led to outbreaks following years when vaccination campaigns missed many villages, whereas when heterogeneity in coverage was reduced, incidence declined to low levels (<0.4 cases/1,000 dogs annually and no human deaths) and short vaccination lapses thereafter did not lead to resurgence. Through transmission-tree reconstruction, we inferred frequent incursions into the district each year (mean of 7). Inferred incursions substantially increased as a percentage of all cases in recent years, reaching 50% in 2022, suggesting regional connectivity is driving residual transmission. Overall, we empirically demonstrate how population connectivity and spatial heterogeneity in vaccination can impact disease outcomes, highlighting the importance of fine-scale monitoring in managing vaccination programs.

Hepcidin deficiency and associated iron overload result in inexorable fungal growth and unrestricted hyphal transformation with exposed 1,3-β-glucan to drive organ pathology independent of candidalysin. This is rescued by a synthetic hepcidin mimetic.

">Differential Astrocyte-supplied NMDAR Co-Agonist for CA1 versus Dentate Gyrus Long-term Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                In the hippocampus, there is a region and synapse-specific N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist preference for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses, enriched in GluN2A-containing NMDARs, favor D-serine, while medial perforant path (MPP) to dentate gyrus (DG) synapses that are rich in GluN2B-containing NMDARs prefer glycine for LTP induction. This study investigated the role of astrocytes in providing these co-agonists. We confirmed in rat hippocampal slices that exogenous D-serine (10 M) is sufficient to restore LTP at SC-CA1 synapses blocked under astrocyte calcium (Ca2+) -clamp conditions, consistent with previous findings. However, exogenous glycine (10 M) also rescued the LTP. In contrast, at MPP-DG synapses, 100 M exogenous glycine, but not 10 M nor 100 M D-serine, restored the LTP blocked by astrocyte Ca2+-clamping. Our findings support the view that, as for serine in CA1, astrocytes are the cellular source of the glycine required for LTP induction at MPP-DG synapses.

">Distinct roles of neuronal phenotypes during neurofeedback adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Learning adaptation allows the brain to refine motor patterns in response to changing environments rapidly. While population-level neural dynamics and single-neuron activity in motor learning have been widely studied, the contributions of individual neuron types remain poorly understood. Here, we employed a brain-machine interface (BMI) task with perturbations of varying difficulty to investigate single-neuron dynamics underlying neurofeedback adaptation in two rhesus macaques. Cortical neurons were classified based on waveform shape into narrow waveform (NW) and broad waveform (BW) categories, representing putative inhibitory interneurons and excitatory pyramidal neurons, respectively. Compared to BW neurons, NW neurons were more active and more strongly involved in the learning process. Moreover, task difficulty modulated neural responsiveness and coordination within both neuron groups, highlighting differential neuron engagement during motor learning. Our findings provide novel insights into single-neuron mechanisms underlying neurofeedback adaptation and emphasize the distinct functional roles of neuronal phenotypes in rapid learning processes.

">Dynamics of auditory word form encoding in human speech cortex</a></h4>

              
                When we hear continuous speech, we perceive it as a series of discrete words, despite the lack of clear boundaries in the acoustic signal. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) encodes phonetic elements like consonants and vowels, but how it extracts whole words as perceptual units remains unclear. Using high-density cortical recordings, we investigated how the brain represents auditory word forms - integrating acoustic-phonetic, prosodic, and lexical features - while participants listened to spoken narratives. Our results show that STG neural populations exhibit a distinctive reset in activity at word boundaries, marked by a brief, sharp drop in cortical activity. Between these resets, the STG consistently encodes distinct acoustic-phonetic, prosodic, and lexical information, supporting the integration of phonological features into coherent word forms. Notably, this process tracks the relative elapsed time within each word, independent of its absolute duration, providing a flexible temporal scaffolding for encoding variable word lengths. We observed similar word form dynamics in the deeper layers of a self-supervised artificial speech network, suggesting a potential convergence with computational models. Additionally, in a bistable word perception task, STG responses were aligned with participants' perceived word boundaries on a trial-by-trial basis, further emphasizing the role of dynamic encoding in word recognition. Together, these findings support a new dynamical model of auditory word forms, highlighting their importance as perceptual units for accessing linguistic meaning.

">Age-specific regulation of sociability by hypothalamic Agrp neurons</a></h4>

              
                Social isolation enhances sociability, suggesting that social behavior is maintained through a homeostatic mechanism. Further, mammalian social needs shift dramatically from infancy through adolescence into adulthood, raising the question of whether the neural mechanisms governing this homeostatic regulation evolve across developmental stages. Here, we show that agouti-related peptide (Agrp) neurons, which regulate hunger in adults, are activated by social isolation from weaning through adolescence but not in adulthood. Importantly, the activity of these neurons is critical for social behavior during adolescence: inhibiting Agrp neurons reduced isolation-induced sociability in juveniles but not in adults, and Agrp neuron activation promoted sociability only in young mice. After isolation, reunion with siblings or other conspecifics, but not unfamiliar adult males, rapidly decreased neuronal activity in juveniles, an effect requiring intact olfaction. These findings identify Agrp neurons as a key component of the circuitry governing age-specific social homeostasis.

">Nociceptin Orphanin F/Q Pathways are Dysregulated by Stress and Modulate Reward Learning and Motivation Across Species</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptin orphanin F/Q has been implicated in stress-related depressive phenotypes. Specifically, exposure to chronic stressors upregulates nociceptin receptors (NOPR), whereas NOPR antagonism has anti-depressant/anti-anhedonic effects. The mechanisms underlying these effects remain, however, unclear. Here, we investigated the role of NOPR in depressive phenotypes alongside potentially prohedonic effects of NOPR antagonism across species. In Study 1, we evaluated whether exposure to early-life adversity (ELA) upregulated ventral tegmental area (VTA) and striatal prepronociceptin (Pnoc) gene expression in adult mice. In Study 2, we tested whether chronic social defeat altered Pnoc gene expression in reward-related regions. To establish whether direct NOPR modulation is implicated in reward-related behaviors, in Study 3, we assessed whether NOPR antagonism alters reward learning in rats. Finally, in Study 4, we tested whether NOPR antagonism boosts motivation among depressed humans. ELA induced anhedonic behavior and increased Pnoc expression in the VTA; in females (but not males), ELA increased Pnoc expression in the dorsal striatum (Study 1). Furthermore, chronic stress reduced Pnoc-expressing cells in the VTA, dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex and susceptible rats showed reduced VTA NOPR gene (Oprl1)-expressing cells (Study 2). In a behavioral assay, a single 30-mg dose of a NOPR antagonist (BTRX-246040) boosted reward learning in rats (Study 3). Finally, in depressed humans, relative to placebo, 8-week treatment with BTRX-246040 increased incentive motivation (Study 4). Collectively, our findings indicate that chronic stressors alter Pnoc and mRNA levels of Pnoc-expressing cells in a sex-selective and region-specific manner impacting reward structures, and that NOPR antagonism shows anti-anhedonic properties.

">Development of Auditory and Spontaneous Movement Responses to Music over the First Year of Life</a></h4>

              
                Humans across cultures not only share the ability to recognise music but also respond to it through movement. While the sensory encoding of music is well-studied, when and how infants naturally start moving to music is largely unexplored. This study simultaneously investigates infants neural (auditory) responses and spontaneous movements to music during the first year of life. Neural activity (EEG) and body kinematics (markerless pose estimation) were recorded from 79 infants (aged 3, 6, and 12 months) listening to refrains of childrens music, along with shuffled, high-pitched, and low-pitched versions of the same songs. Neural data revealed that, across all ages, infants exhibit enhanced auditory responses to music compared to shuffled music, indicating that auditory encoding of music emerges early in development. Movement data revealed a different outcome. While coarse auditory-motor coupling is present at all ages, more complex structured movement patterns emerge in response to music only by 12 months. Notably, no age group demonstrated evidence of coordinated movements to music. Additionally, enhanced auditory responses to high vs low pitch were only evident at 6 months, while infants movements were better predicted by high-pitched compared to low-pitched music at all ages. This study provides initial insights into how the developing brain gradually transforms music into spontaneous movements of increasing complexity.

">Hyper-Glycosylation as a Central Metabolic Driver of Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by devastating degenerative decline. Metabolic disruptions are widely observed, yet their involvement in the molecular etiology of AD remains underexplored. Utilizing spatial metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics in both mouse models and human post-mortem samples, we identified a hyper-glycosylation phenotype as a hallmark of AD. To investigate the underlying mechanisms and whether the observed effect was a driver of the observed decline, we developed an advanced spatial isotopic tracing pulse-chase method to study the dynamics of N-linked glycans. Our analysis revealed enhanced glycan biosynthesis in AD mouse models. Based on these findings, we performed genetic and dietary interventions to modulate glycan biosynthesis. Genetic knockdown of glycan biosynthetic enzymes ameliorated the hyper-glycosylation and improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes in AD mice. In contrast, oral glucosamine supplementation drove hyper-glycosylation and exacerbated cognitive and behavioral deficits. To assess the clinical relevance of these findings, we conducted a retrospective analysis of a large population of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) stratified by glucosamine use, leveraging electronic health records. Consistently, glucosamine supplementation was associated with increased mortality in AD and ADRD patient cohorts, and significantly elevated progression from MCI to AD compared to age-matched controls. Collectively, our findings establish hyper-glycosylation as a pathological driver of AD and highlight glycan metabolism as an actional target in the fight against AD.

">Brain glucodynamic variability is an essential feature of the metabolism-cognition relationship</a></h4>

              
                Variability ensures that complex biological systems, including the brain, are capable of responding to changing environmental demands. While the importance of neural variability in electrophysiological and haemodynamic aspects of brain activity is beginning to be understood, little is known about how variability in molecular activity influences brain function. Here we examine how temporal variability in glucodynamics, or time-varying glucose use, is related to cognition in 35 younger and 43 older adults. Stationary metabolic rates of glucose were not directly associated with cognition. Rather, higher glucodynamic variability, and its coherence into metabolic networks, was associated with better cognitive performance. Lower glucodynamic variability in ageing was associated with altered metabolic network efficiency and reduced cognitive performance. Our results demonstrate for the first time that variability in cerebral glucose metabolism is biologically and functionally relevant to cognition and the network architecture of the brain. Cognition is influenced by time-varying glucose metabolism and its coherent fluctuations in metabolic networks. A loss of glucodynamics in ageing reduces the efficiency of the metabolic connectome and contributes to reduced cognitive performance. The study of glucodynamics significantly advances our understanding of metabolic brain changes in health, ageing and disease.

">State and trait measures of attention predict performance in video-based learning</a></h4>

              
                Impaired academic performance is often attributed to attentional deficits, but it remains unclear whether these reflect long-term traits or momentary fluctuations in attention. This study investigated how acute attention during engaging educational videos and trait measures of attention influenced test taking performance. Short-term retention was assessed in 152 students across four experiments using short-form educational videos. Behavioral trait measures of inattention, hyperactivity, and working memory capacity were also obtained. Acute attention, measured by EEG during video viewing, was a strong predictor of test scores. In contrast, self-reported trait measures of attention were not significant predictors. Working memory capacity and GPA positively predicted test scores. Inattention traits predicted GPA, suggesting a negative effect on overall academic performance. These results suggest that attentional traits only weakly and indirectly affect student performance. Modifying teaching methods, may help address learning deficits in inattentive students, who seem to have no problem attending to, and retaining the content of short, engaging educational videos.

">Vascular dysfunction in Huntington's disease is located at the blood-CSF barrier and is rescued by sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist</a></h4>

              
                Brain vascular barriers are dysfunctional in many neurological disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), but which vessels are affected and how remains unclear. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy in R6/2 HD-model mice, we reveal a striking divergence in barrier dysfunction. Surface vessels of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) drive pathology by paracellular leakage, while parenchymal vessels of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) exhibit increased transport via adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT), with arterioles being the most susceptible segment. The pathology of both barriers coincided with astrocyte activation localized to affected vessels in R6/2 mice, as well as post-mortem HD human brains. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) agonist treatment rescued BCSFB leakage but only partially restored BBB function, selectively reducing AMT in arterioles, with no effect in capillaries and venules. These findings redefine HD vascular pathology, demonstrating heterogeneous, vessel-type-specific barrier failure beyond generalized "disruption," uncovering mechanistic vulnerabilities and the therapeutic potential of S1PR1 modulation.

">Episodic events are flexibility encoded in both integrated and separated neural representations</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates how the brain encodes episodic events to support diverse memory functions. Thirty-six participants viewed movies simulating real-life interactions while EEG was recorded. They first watched movies featuring two characters (AB), followed by scenes where one original character interacted with a new one (BC). Memory was assessed for direct (AB and BC), indirect (AC) associations, and source memory about whether two characters had appeared together. Source memory was more accurate when participants correctly inferred indirect associations. Time-resolved representational similarity analysis (RSA) of EEG data revealed both neural pattern similarities and dissimilarities during AB and BC encoding. Pattern similarities, indicating memory integration across episodes, predicted successful indirect associations. Conversely, dissimilarities predicted accurate source memory, indicating the preservation of distinct memory traces. These findings suggest that episodic events are flexibly encoded through both integrated and segregated neural representations, enabling the brain to support multiple memory functions depending on task demands.

">Alpha activity during verbal working memory retention depends on the stimulus presentation mode</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies of verbal working memory (WM) have reported inconsistent changes in alpha power during retention, with both increases and decreases observed. We asked whether these discrepancies arise from how stimuli are presented. Thirty adults memorized seven digits presented in four modes: Simultaneous (all digits for 2800 ms) or sequential presentations at Fast (400 ms per digit), Slow (1000 ms per digit), and Fast+delay (400 ms per digit plus a 600 ms free time in between). We analyzed EEG during encoding and a 6 s retention period in theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (18-24 Hz) frequency bands. Recall accuracy was highest in the Simultaneous mode and lowest in the Fast mode, yet these two conditions did not differ in any frequency band during encoding or retention. Encoding produced parametric load-related theta increase and beta decrease, possibly reflecting growing executive control demands and motor program formation, respectively. Alpha power did not scale with load during encoding. During retention, theta and beta during retention were unaffected by presentation mode. Alpha power did not differ significantly when all sequential modes were grouped together compared to the simultaneous mode. However, the Fast+delay mode uniquely showed below-baseline alpha in the first half of the retention. Our findings suggest that alpha dynamics are sensitive to the temporal structure of encoding and retention periods, particularly the presence or absence of free intervals between stimulus presentations. We propose that alpha modulation during WM retention may reflect processes beyond the simple gating of irrelevant sensory information.

">Predicting individual differences of fear and cognitive learning and extinction</a></h4>

              
                The abilities to acquire new information and to modify previously learned knowledge are critical in an ever-changing world. However, the efficacy of learning is notably variable among individuals, with extinction learning being the epitome of such variability. Abundant studies have identified a core network of brain regions including amygdala, hippocampus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and, more recently, the cerebellum, as key players in learning and extinction. Yet, the precise interactions within this network and their relationship to individual learning abilities and extinction have remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we examined how functional (FC), effective (EC), and structural (SC) connectivity patterns in the core learning network allow predicting individual differences in the efficacy of learning, extinction, and renewal. Analysing a large dataset of over 500 participants across a multitude of paradigms, our results revealed that FC predicted better acquisition, with a central role of ACC and hippocampus, whereas SC, involving ACC and amygdala, predicted higher levels of extinction learning. EC results suggested a predominantly inhibitory coupling among core learning network nodes, with paradigm-specific EC connectivity patterns predicting learning. Our predictions not only generalised between fear and cognitive predictive learning paradigms but were also successful in predicting learning from task-related FC and simulated data. Together, these results describe the multimodal neural determinants of learning, extinction, and renewal, and may inform individualised interventions for affective disorders based on neural connectivity patterns.

">Capturing individual variation in children's oscillatory brain activity during nREM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Human brain dynamics are highly unique between individuals: functional neuroimaging studies have recently described functional features that can be used as neural fingerprints. As such studies have generally been performed on adults, it is unclear if the results are applicable during brain development. Here we applied Bayesian reduced-rank regression (BRRR), to extract low-dimensional representations of electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra measured from normally developing children at different ages. The clinical EEG recordings represented different sleep stages in a pediatric population (N=782) of ages varying from 6 weeks to 19 years. The representations learned within specific sleep stages successfully separated between the subjects. Furthermore, a model trained with data across sleep stages generalized to unseen data, suggesting that informative neural fingerprints could be extracted. Fingerprint stability increased with the age of the subjects. In comparison to correlation-based measures in differentiating individuals from each other, the BRRR model performed better, highlighting the usefulness of the dimensionality reduction for data obtained in demanding clinical settings. While further studies are needed to address the possible non-linear maturation effects over developmental periods, our results demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of stable within-session neurofunctional fingerprints in pediatric populations.

">Function of the auditory cortex characterized by its intrinsic dynamic coactivation patterns estimated in individuals</a></h4>

              
                Determining the functional organization of the auditory cortex (AC) has been difficult with conventional task-based approaches due to the broad responsiveness of auditory subregions to various acoustic properties. Moreover, most studies have investigated functional organization of AC with static methods, although brain has shown to be organized into dynamic networks. Here, we investigated dynamically varying coactivation patterns of the local networks in the auditory cortex (AC) determined from 7T fMRI data with a novel individualized network-based algorithm. An eight-pattern solution was selected for closer examination based on its high reproducibility of the occurrence rates (r=0.86) and the spatial topography (r=0.79) between sessions. Dynamic AC patterns successfully captured interindividual variability, as indicated by significantly higher variability between than within individuals for the AC pattern occurrence rates and spatial topographies. The coactivation patterns shared similarities between resting-state and auditory-task data, as indicated by the group-level similarity of 0.84 and individual-level similarity of 0.71 in the spatial topographies. Furthermore, the occurrence rates of AC patterns identified in the task data, using pattern templates derived from resting-state data, correlated with specific task contrast regressors. Our results indicate that the AC function can be characterized by a set of dynamically varying coactivation patterns that are consistently observed during resting state and auditory stimulation, and that get synchronized with auditory input. These findings enhance our understanding of the relationship between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity in the AC and support the development of more time-efficient paradigms for studying its functional organization.

">From single scenes to extended scenarios: the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the construction of imagery-rich events</a></h4>

              
                Mental events are fundamental to daily cognition, including the recollection of past experiences, the anticipation of future scenarios, and engagement in imaginative, fictitious thought. Typically, these temporally extended mental events unfold within coherent spatial contexts, rich in naturalistic scenes and objects. However, there remains a significant gap in understanding how these events are represented in the brain. This study aimed to investigate the neural patterns involved in the construction of temporally extended mental events. Using ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined brain regions previously implicated in this cognitive process, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus, and posterior neocortex. We employed a novel experimental paradigm in which participants engaged in three forms of mental imagery: single objects (e.g., "a black espresso"), single scenes (e.g., "a busy cafe"), and extended scenarios (e.g., "meeting a friend for coffee"). We identified a shared neural network - comprising the vmPFC, hippocampus, and posterior neocortex - engaged across all forms of mental imagery. However, we observed a hierarchical organization in their contributions: the posterior neocortex supported the construction of objects, scenes, and scenarios, while the hippocampus primarily contributed to scenes and scenarios. The vmPFC exhibited a stepwise increase in activation, peaking during scenario construction. These findings suggest that the construction of mental events emerges from the close interaction of perceptual details provided by the posterior neocortex, spatial coherence from the hippocampus, and the integration of those elements into a coherent, temporally extended mental event by the vmPFC - the "movies" of the mind.

">Holistic Motor Control of Zebra Finch Song Syllable Sequences</a></h4>

              
                How brain circuits are organized to skillfully produce learned sequences of behaviors is still poorly understood. Here, we functionally examine how the cortical song premotor region HVC, which is necessary for zebra finch song, controls the sequential production of learned song syllables. We find that HVC can generate the complete sequence of learned song syllables independently of its main synaptic input pathways. Thalamic input to HVC is permissive for song initiation but it is not required for transitions between syllables or completing song. We show that excitation of HVC neurons during song reliably causes vocalizations to skip back to the beginning of song, reminiscent of a skipping record. This restarting of syllable sequences can be induced at any moment in song and depends on local circuits within HVC. We identify and computationally model a synaptic network including intratelencephalic premotor and corticostriatal neurons within HVC that are essential for completing song syllable sequences. Together, our results show that the learned zebra finch song is controlled by a cortical sequence-generating network in HVC that, once started, can sustain production of all song syllables independent of major extrinsic input pathways. Thus, sequential neuronal activity can be organized to fuse well-learned vocal-motor sequences, ultimately achieving holistic control of this naturally learned behavior.

">Characterisation of putative retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) chemoreceptor neurons in the adult human brainstem</a></h4>

              
                The retrotrapezoid nucleus of rodents (RTN) is located ventral to the facial motor nucleus (7N) and consists of acid-sensitive neurons that activate breathing and mediate the central component of the ventilatory response to hypercapnia (HCVR). In rats and mice RTN neurons can be histologically identified by the presence of paired-like homeobox 2B positive nuclei (Phox2b+) and the absence of cytoplasmic choline acetyltransferase (ChAT-) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH-). Furthermore, up to 50% of rodent RTN neurons synthesise galanin, and 100% express pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) and neuromedin B (NMB). The human RTN (hRTN) has been tentatively identified in two infant studies and one adult study, but it was not mapped. This study aimed to map the location and cytoarchitecture of the adult hRTN and compare the findings to the literature of rodents, macaque and human infants. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from two adult cases, spanning the medulla-pons, were serially sectioned (10m thick) and every four in thirty sections were immunohistochemically stained with ChAT, and double stained Phox2b/TH, Phox2b/galanin and Phox2b/PACAP. Immunostained sections were scanned and analysed using QuPath software. hRTN neurons were identified by their Phox2b positive (Phox2b+) nucleus and negative cytoplasm for TH and ChAT (Phox2b+/TH-/ChAT-). Such neurons were identified ventral to 7N, lateral to the superior olive, overlapped with the C1 catecholaminergic population and extended rostrocaudally from Obex +13 mm to Obex +17 mm. hRTN neurons comprised 90% of Phox2b+ neurons in the parafacial area, totaling around 5000 bilaterally, and were surrounded by numerous TH-ir fibers. Galanin and PACAP immunoreactivity was identified in 43% and 38% of Phox2b+ parafacial neurons, respectively. This is the first study to characterise and quantitatively map the adult human RTN using a series of neurochemical markers.

">Pharmacological restoration of deficits in mitochondrial trafficking rescues aberrant axonal activity in tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative tauopathies are associated with impairments in both active axonal trafficking and presynaptic function. Deficits in axonal trafficking reduce the supply of mitochondria to presynaptic sites, where they provide a local source of energy production and calcium homeostasis, and may therefore contribute to the progressive synaptic impairment. Using in vivo two-photon imaging of mitochondrial dynamics and axonal calcium activity in the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy, we show an age- and genotype-dependent decrease in mitochondrial trafficking which is correlated to disrupted presynaptic activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate a rescue in aberrant activity with pharmacological upregulation of axonal trafficking. The presented work reveals the disruptive influence of tau-induced trafficking impairments on presynaptic function in the early stages of the disease and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting axonal trafficking as a strategy to confer synaptic resilience in a pathogenic environment.

">Compensating Cortical Thickness for Cortical Folding-Related Variation</a></h4>

              
                Cortical thickness is a widely used biomarker of brain morphology and health, yet it is dependent on local cortical folding. Because gyral crowns are consistently thicker than sulcal fundi and cortical folds vary widely across individuals, these fluctuations introduce unmodeled nuisance variance that can obscure meaningful biological effects of interest. Previous global methods of folding compensation incompletely compensate for folding effects on cortical thickness and the spatial smoothing that is typically used to reduce these effects in the literature also markedly degrades spatial localization precision. To address these limitations, we developed a novel method for folding-compensated cortical thickness estimation that uses nonlinear local multiple regression with five folding measures to model and more completely remove folding-related variance from cortical thickness. This approach estimates what cortical thickness would have been in the absence of folding, yielding a more biologically interpretable measure of cortical architecture. We applied this new approach to data from the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (HCP-YA) and Aging Human Connectome Project (HCA), demonstrating substantial reductions in intra-areal and inter-individual variability, substantially increasing standardized effect sizes of age on cortical thickness while preserving the neurobiologically expected patterns, and avoiding the loss of spatial precision that occurs with the spatial smoothing that has traditionally been used in the literature. The method has been integrated into the HCP pipelines, facilitating its widespread use. By attenuating folding-induced variability, this technique enhances cortical thickness as a structural phenotype and may support more accurate cortical parcellation, longitudinal tracking, and biomarker discovery in brain health and disease.

">Recycling of prefrontal subspaces dynamically multiplexes information</a></h4>

              
                Cortical spiking activity in areas like prefrontal cortex (PFC) encodes information only along a small number of dimensions, a subspace of the full space of population activity patterns. PFC often uses distinct subspaces to represent incoming sensory information and to maintain it in working memory. However, it's generally assumed that a subspace carries specific information within a specific time frame. Here, in two datasets, we show that neither assumption is correct. The same subspace used during initial encoding was later reactivated during the behavioral response. We also found that subspaces ostensibly dedicated to processing sensory information were recycled to represent behavioral response information later in a trial. We further found a consistent spatial mapping between the original subspace usage and its later recycling. These results demonstrate previously unknown flexibility of PFC subspace coding, both in the deployment of subspaces across time and in their multiplexing of information. This flexibility suggests that PFC subspaces function more like "workspaces" into which different types of information can be written.

">Hippocampal-prelimbic coupling during context-dependent extinction retrieval in rats</a></h4>

              
                After fear conditioning, repeated presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS) alone produces a context-dependent extinction of learned fear. The hippocampus has a critical role in this process, but the mechanism by which contextual information encoded by the hippocampus leads to fear suppression is unknown. We hypothesize that contextual information encoded by the dorsal hippocampus supports the recall of extinction memory by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the oscillatory coherence and directional coupling of the hippocampus and mPFC during context-dependent extinction retrieval in a previously published experiment. In this experiment, male and female rats were subjected to auditory fear conditioning followed by fear extinction and extinction retrieval procedures. Previous analyses focused on oscillatory coupling during the CS; here, we performed new analyses to assess hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in the context in which extinction occurred. We found that, after extinction, re-exposing the animals to the extinction context produces a marked increase in dorsal hippocampal theta (6-8 Hz) oscillations. This increase was associated with enhanced coherence with the prelimbic (PL), but not the infralimbic (IL), division of the mPFC. Moreover, Granger causality analyses revealed that hippocampal theta oscillations preceded theta in the PL throughout the extinction retrieval session. This effect emerged during exposure to the extinction context and persisted during the presentation of the CSs and the expression of freezing behavior. Interestingly, this pattern of coherence was not observed in the IL. These results reveal that oscillatory coupling between the dorsal hippocampus and PL facilitates the context-dependent retrieval of the extinguished fear memory.

">Empowering multitrait brain phenotypes GWAS</a></h4>

              
                Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data are now becoming available in human genetic cohorts including thousands of participants, providing a powerful mean to decipher the genetic architecture of brain phenotypes. Univariates genome-wide association screenings (GWAS) are typically applied as a baseline approach, but there are increasing interest for multitrait approaches to both increase statistical power and uncover shared structure underlying those phenotypes. However, there are limited guidelines on how to select phenotypes to be analyzed jointly and optimize power. Here we investigated factors impacting variant discoverability of state-of-the art multitrait GWAS using 1,010 MRI-derived phenotypes measured in 32,947 participants from the UK Biobank. Our study shows that the expected gain of multitrait approaches over univariate GWAS is highly predictable. We further propose data-driven strategy to define optimize sets and compare its performances with biologically driven approaches.

">Afferent-specific modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission by acetylcholine and serotonin in the prelimbic cortex</a></h4>

              
                Acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) differentially regulate the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the mouse prelimbic (PL) cortex according to their long-distance projections. We tested for afferent- and/or target-specific modulation of glutamate release by these neuromodulators in two key afferents to the PL cortex: commissural (COM) projections from the contralateral hemisphere and projections from the mediodorsal nucleus (MDN) of the thalamus. Using an ex-vivo optogenetic approach, we mapped the connectivity of COM and MDN afferents in intratelencephalic (IT) and extratelencephalic (ET) layer 5 projection neurons and tested for afferent-selective neuromodulation of synaptic transmission. Dual whole-cell recordings in pairs of IT and ET neurons found that COM afferents monosynaptically target both IT and ET neurons, but that MDN afferents selectively target IT neurons. Both afferents exhibited similar, and target-independent, short-term synaptic plasticity (facilitation), but were differentially modulated by ACh and 5-HT. COM transmission was suppressed strongly by ACh and moderately by 5-HT, while MDN inputs to IT neurons were largely unaffected by either neuromodulator. Cholinergic suppression of COM transmission was blocked by atropine or the M4-preferring antagonist VU602841, but enhanced by the M4 positive allosteric modulator VU0467154. Serotonergic suppression of COM transmission was mildly reduced in the presence of SB216691, a 5-HT1B receptor antagonist. Chemogenetic inhibition of hM4Di-expressing COM terminals mimicked the suppressive effects of ACh and 5-HT on synaptic transmission. These data demonstrate that, while ACh and 5-HT differentially regulate IT and ET excitability, they are similarly selective in regulating COM synaptic transmission in the PL cortex.

                Human cellular models of disease developed using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have enabled wide-ranging research from investigation of human disease mechanisms to phenotypic drug screens. Pain disorders such as neuropathic pain and headache remain areas of considerable unmet need and are considered high risk by pharma. Human iPSC-derived sensory neurons have already been used to accelerate translational research but the current differentiation protocols produce non-peptidergic nociceptors. We demonstrate for the first time the robust differentiation of hiPSC into peptidergic nociceptor lineage with high yield. These nociceptors express CGRP and TRPV1 whilst the non-peptidergic marker RET was completely absent. Functionally, the nociceptors show functional maturity including the expression of TTX-resistant currents and responding to TRPV1 and TRPA1 agonists. Importantly, they were able to release CGRP basally and upon stimulation by an inflammatory soup, which was inhibited upon the application of the 5-HT1B/1D/1F agonist, sumatriptan and topiramate, a migraine prophylactic drug. Overall, we report the successful generation of a novel in vitro functional peptidergic nociceptor model which will allow investigation of disease mechanisms in pain and for the development of new effective pain therapies.

To investigate these interactions, we recorded and are releasing a dataset from N=178 participants across five experiments featuring short online educational videos. This dataset comprises approximately 110 hours of multimodal data including electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, respiration, breathing rate, pupil size, electrooculogram (EOG), gaze position, saccades, blinks, fixations, head movement, and electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants viewed 3-6 videos (mean total duration: 28{+/-}5 min) to test attentional states (attentive vs. distracted), memory retention (multiple-choice questions), learning scenarios (incidental vs. intentional), and an intervention (monetary incentive). Demographic data, ADHD self-report (ASRS), and working memory assessments (digit span) were collected. Basic statistics and noteworthy effects: increased alpha power in a distracted condition, broadband EEG power increases from posterior to anterior scalp, increased blink-rate, and decreased saccade-rate in distracted and intervention conditions. All modalities are time-aligned with stimuli and standardized using BIDS, making the dataset valuable for researchers investigating attention, memory, and learning in naturalistic settings.

">Spontaneous Dynamics Predict the Effects of Targeted Intervention in Hippocampal Neuronal Cultures</a></h4>

              
                Dissociated neuronal cultures on High-Density Multi-Electrode Arrays (HD-MEAs) provide a controllable in vitro platform to systematically investigate the formation, development, and functioning of neural circuits, as well as their response to a wide array of electrical and pharmacological manipulations. Yet, this potential cannot be fully exploited without a a reliable characterization of the intricate web of causal interconnections within the culture. In this work, we present a protocol to map the network-wide impact of focal stimulation by sequentially stimulating individual sites and recording the evoked responses across the culture. We demonstrate that evoked responses are consistent and replicable across stimulation trials, allowing us to map causal links in terms of the strength of stimulus-response effects, termed Interventional Connectivity (IC). However, this time-consuming protocol may be inconvenient for experimental settings that demand rapid recordings or no perturbation, such as analyses of spontaneous plasticity. We thus investigate whether IC can be predicted from the network`s ongoing activity by comparing it to Effective Connectivity (EC) estimates derived from relatively short (10 minutes) recordings of spontaneous, unperturbed activity. We show that EC is strongly informative of IC, regardless of the specific metric used for EC inference (Transfer Entropy, Signed Cross-Correlation, or Cross-Covariance), proving that spontaneous activity can reliably reveal key aspects of the culture`s causal architecture. Our findings open the way to robust network analyses of in vitro neuronal systems, and the design of effective, targeted stimulation experiments exploiting the culture`s strongest connections or most highly connected sites.

">A combined neuroanatomy, ex vivo imaging and immunohistochemistry defined MRI mask for the human paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is an evolutionarily conserved midline thalamic structure known to contribute to arousal, interoceptive states, and motivated behaviors. Yet, a consensus anatomical definition of the human PVT across tissue-based and MRI-based approaches remains elusive, thereby limiting reliable translation between its cellular characteristics and in vivo functional connectivity. To address this challenge, we describe a histologically-informed PVT segmentation compatible with standard 3T MR imaging pipelines. We performed postmortem anatomical MRI scans on an intact whole brain and an excised thalamic block, manually segmented the PVT at high resolution using ex vivo calretinin staining and neuroanatomical landmarks, registered the resulting image-label pair to a commonly used MRI template space (Montreal Neurological Institute's MNI152), and performed a comparative reanalysis using this newly defined mask. This tissue-grounded PVT mask largely overlaps spatially with existing MRI-based PVT masks, with the exception of additional voxels posteriorly. Importantly, the functional connectivity patterns of this tissue-grounded mask are highly consistent with those previously reported. Collectively, this multimodal definition of the human PVT balances tissue-based ground truth with in vivo MRI features, providing a valuable resource for advancing translation between cellular level features identified by histology and in vivo functional connectivity at the meso/macro scale in the understudied human PVT.

">Adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure induces sex-specific and time-dependent changes in affective behaviors and metabolomic profiles.</a></h4>

              
                Given the adverse effects of adolescent binge alcohol consumption in humans, the present work explores the lasting behavioral and metabolomic impacts following adolescent binge ethanol exposure. Here we determine short- and long-term changes in affective behaviors and metabolomic profiles in male and female adolescent binge ethanol-exposed mice. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) as a model of binge ethanol exposure using intermittent vapor inhalation from postnatal day (PND) 28-42. Mice were tested in a battery of behavioral tests and metabolomic analyses were conducted following short-term and long-term withdrawal from AIE exposure. Mice were tested for affective behaviors using the open field test (OFT), the light/dark test (LDT), and the tail suspension test (TST) one week following AIE exposure from PND 49-53 and again from PND 91-95. Serum samples were collected on PND 43, corresponding to 24 hours after the last exposure, fecal samples were collected during each OFT, and liver samples were collected approximately 80 days after AIE exposure for metabolomic analysis. We show modest incubation of behavioral differences in anxiety-like behavior in males after adolescent binge ethanol exposure; an effect that was absent in female mice. In contrast, metabolomic differences in male mice that were more pronounced shortly after adolescent binge ethanol exposure waned as time progressed since last exposure. Male mice appear to be more susceptible to the persistent changes in adolescent binge ethanol exposure that varies over time. It is possible that short-term metabolomic changes may predict long-term behavioral changes in affective behaviors.

">TBK1 eliminates aggregation-prone monomeric TDP-43 through the IFNβ-immunoproteasome pathway</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function mutations in TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) are genetically linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and induce cytoplasmic aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), known as TDP-43 pathology. Although TBK1 deficiency is thought to contribute to TDP-43 pathology primarily through impaired autophagy, the full spectrum of its pathological impact remains unclear. Given the multifunctional nature of TBK1, alternative pathways beyond autophagy are possibly involved in TDP-43 pathology. Here, we found that TBK1 alleviates TDP-43 pathology in neuronal cells via induction of interferon-beta (IFN{beta}), and that the IFN{beta} receptor is downregulated in spinal motor neurons from ALS patients with TDP-43 pathology. We further demonstrated that IFN{beta} induces the immunoproteasome by upregulating its subunits, thereby promoting the degradation of aggregation-prone monomeric TDP-43. Furthermore, heterozygous deletion of Tbk1 in SOD1G93A ALS model mice resulted in reduced immunoproteasome induction and increased polyubiquitinated protein accumulation in the spinal cord. These findings suggest that impairment of the TBK1-IFN{beta}-immunoproteasome axis may contribute to the development of TDP-43 pathology in ALS and FTD.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Infants’ electroencephalography (EEG) dominant rhythm oscillates between 6 and 9 Hz. The desynchronization of this rhythm from baseline to the processing of visual stimuli is used as an index to better understand the development of visual attention. However, development trajectories of desynchronization remain underexplored. Additionally, it is unclear whether development of desynchronization is sensitive to task demands or if it reflects broader developmental changes. To investigate these questions, EEG data were collected from infants aged 6, 9, and 12 months while they passively viewed a fixation cross followed by 10-s trials of a female face or novel object tracked down the screen. Dominant rhythm desynchronization was calculated by subtracting power during the fixation period from power during each task condition. The results revealed significant desynchronization in response to faces at occipital electrodes for all age groups. The magnitude of the desynchronization also increased from 6 to 9 to 12 months of age in response to faces over right occipital electrodes. No significant desynchronization was observed for object stimuli. These findings suggest that dominant rhythm desynchronization develops across infancy and is sensitive to stimulus type. The increased desynchronization for faces compared to objects highlights infants’ general preference for faces relative to objects.</span>

The relationship between WMT-induced changes in PC and the density of specific neurotransmitter receptors was examined. Seventy-six healthy participants were randomly assigned to either a WMT group or a control group. After 8 wks of training, the WMT group exhibited significant cognitive improvements, especially in near and far transfer tasks. These behavioral improvements were accompanied by specific changes in brain connectivity, including a reduction in PC within the sensorimotor network and node-specific alterations in the left prefrontal cortex, temporo-occipital-parietal junction, and parietal operculum. Moreover, changes in PC were significantly correlated with the density of dopamine D2 receptors, mu-opioid receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5. These findings enhance our understanding of how WMT influences cognitive function and brain network connectivity, highlighting the potential for targeting specific networks and neurotransmitter systems in cognitive training interventions.</span>

                <p>Despite its central role in the proper functioning of the motor system, sensation has been less studied than motor outputs in sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. This is likely due to the difficulty of measuring sensation non-invasively: while motor outputs have easily observable consequences, sensation is inherently an internal variable of the motor system. In this study, we investigated how well participants can sense relevant sensory stimuli that induce locomotor adaptation. We addressed this question with a split-belt treadmill, which moves the legs at different speeds. We used a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm with multiple repetitions of various speed differences considering the probabilistic nature of perceptual responses. We found that the participants correctly identified a speed difference of 49.7 mm/s in 75% of the trials when walking at 1.05 m/s (i.e., 4.7% Weber Fraction). To gain insight into the perceptual process in walking, we applied a drift-diffusion model (DDM) relating the participants&rsquo; identification of speed difference (i.e., stimulus identification) and their response time during walking. The implemented DDM was able to predict participants&rsquo; stimulus identification for all speed differences by simply using the recorded reaction times (RTs) to fit a single set of model parameters. Taken together, our results indicate that individuals can accurately identify smaller speed differences than previously reported and that participants&rsquo; stimulus perception follows the evidence accumulation process outlined by drift diffusion models, conventionally used for short-latency, static sensory tasks, rather than long-latency, and motor tasks such as walking.</p>

                <p>by Neda Shahidi, Fernando Rozenblit, Mohammad H. Khani, Helene M. Schreyer, Matthias Mietsch, Dario A. Protti, Tim Gollisch</p>

The dichotomy of excitation and suppression is one of the canonical mechanisms explaining the complexity of neural activity. Computational models of the interplay of excitation and suppression in single neurons aim at investigating how this interaction affects a neuron’s spiking responses and shapes the encoding of sensory stimuli. Here, we compare the performance of three filter-based stimulus-encoding models for predicting retinal ganglion cell responses recorded from axolotl, mouse, and marmoset retina to different types of temporally varying visual stimuli. Suppression in these models is implemented via subtractive or divisive interactions of stimulus filters or by a response-driven feedback module. For the majority of ganglion cells, the subtractive and divisive models perform similarly and outperform the feedback model as well as a linear-nonlinear (LN) model with no suppression. Comparison between the subtractive and the divisive model depends on cell type, species, and stimulus components, with the divisive model generalizing best across temporal stimulus frequencies and visual contrast and the subtractive model capturing in particular responses for slow temporal stimulus dynamics and for slow axolotl cells. Overall, we conclude that the divisive and subtractive models are well suited for capturing interactions of excitation and suppression in ganglion cells and perform best for different temporal regimes of these interactions.

                <p>by Di Wu, Qi Ouyang, Hongli Wang, Youdong Mao</p>

Despite high-resolution structural studies on the USP14-proteasome-substrate complexes, time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) results on USP14-regulated allostery of the 26S proteasome are still very limited and a quantitative understanding of substrate degradation dynamics remains elusive. In this study, we propose a mean field model of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for USP14 regulated substrate degradation in 26S proteasome. The kinetic model incorporates recent cryo-EM findings on the allostery of 26S proteasome and generates results in good agreement with time-resolved experimental observations. The model elucidates that USP14 typically reduces the substrate degradation rate and reveals the functional dependence of this rate on the concentrations of substrate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of the substrate for different ATP concentrations is predicted. When multiple substrates are present, the model suggests that substrates that are easier to insert into the OB-ring and disengage from the proteasome, or less likely to undergo deubiquitination would be more favored to be degraded by the USP14-bound proteasome. The mean field model proposed here quantitatively considers the process of proteasomal substrate degradation from the perspective of chemical kinetics, and provides a quantitative framework to decode the dynamic interplay between USP14 and the proteasome.

                <p>by Romani Osbourne, Kelly M. Thayer</p>

The link between p53 tumor suppressive functions and organismal lifespan is multifaceted. Its DNA-repair mechanism is longevity-enhancing while its role in cellular senescence pathways induces pro-aging phenotypes. To understand how p53 may regulate organismal lifespan, cross-species genotype-phenotype (GP) studies of the p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD) have been used to assess the correlation of amino acid changes to lifespan. Amino acid changes in non-DNA-binding regions such as the transactivation (TAD), proline-rich (PRD), regulatory (REG), and tetramerization (TET) are largely unexplored. In addition, existing GP correlation tools such as SigniSite do not account for phylogenetic relationships between aligned sequences in correlating genotypic differences to phenotypes such as lifespan. To identify phylogenetically significant, longevity-correlated residues in full-length p53 alignments, we developed a Python- and R-based workflow, Relative Evolutionary Scoring (RES). While RES-predicted longevity-associated residues (RPLARs) are concentrated primarily in the DBD, the PRD, TET, and REG domains also house RPLARs. While yeast functional assay enrichment reveals that RPLARs may be dispensable for p53-mediated transactivation, PEPPI and Rosetta-based protein-protein interaction prediction suggests a role for RPLARs in p53 stability and interaction interfaces of tumor suppressive protein-protein complexes. With experimental validation of the RPLARs’ roles in p53 stability, transactivity, and involvement in senescence-regulatory pathways, we can gain crucial insights into mechanisms underlying dysregulated tumor suppression and accelerated aging.

                <p>by Anastasia Galperina, Gabriele Andrea Lugli, Christian Milani, Willem M. De Vos, Marco Ventura, Anne Salonen, Bonnie Hurwitz, Alise Jany Ponsero</p>

The growing interest in the role of the gut virome in human health and disease, has led to several recent large-scale viral catalogue projects mining human gut metagenomes each using varied computational tools and quality control criteria. Importantly, there has been to date no consistent comparison of these catalogues’ quality, diversity, and overlap. In this project, we therefore systematically surveyed nine previously published human gut viral catalogues. While these catalogues collectively screened >40,000 human fecal metagenomes, 82% of the recovered 345,613 viral sequences were unique to one catalogue, highlighting limited redundancy between the ressources and suggesting the need for an aggregated resource bringing these viral sequences together. We further expanded these viral catalogues by mining 7,867 infant gut metagenomes from 12 large-scale infant studies collected in 9 different countries. From these datasets, we constructed the Aggregated Gut Viral Catalogue (AVrC), a unified modular resource containing 1,018,941 dereplicated viral sequences (449,859 species-level vOTUs). Using computational inference tools, annotations were obtained for each vOTU representative sequence quality, viral taxonomy, predicted viral lifestyle, and putative host. This project aims to facilitate the reuse of previously published viral catalogues by the research community and follows a modular framework to enable future expansions as novel data becomes available.

Sensory thresholds enable animals to regulate their behavioral responses to environmental threats. Despite the importance of sensory thresholds for animal behavior and human health, we do not yet have a full appreciation of the underlying molecular-genetic and circuit mechanisms. The larval zebrafish acoustic startle response provides a powerful system to identify molecular mechanisms underlying establishment of sensory thresholds and plasticity of thresholds through mechanisms like habituation. Using this system, we identify Cadherin-16 as a previously undescribed regulator of sensory gating. We demonstrate that Cadherin-16 regulates sensory thresholds via an endocrine organ, the corpuscle of Stannius (CS), which is essential in zebrafish for regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. We further show that Cadherin-16 regulates whole-body calcium and ultimately behavior through the hormone Stanniocalcin 1l (Stc1l), and the IGF-regulatory metalloprotease, Papp-aa. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of the CS through ablation experiments that reveal its role in promoting normal acoustic sensory gating. Together, our results uncover a previously undescribed brain non-autonomous pathway for the regulation of behavior and underscore Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis as a critical process underlying sensory gating <i>in vivo.</i>

Agricultural diseases are a major threat to sustainable food production. Yet, for many pathogens we know exceptionally little about their epidemiological and population dynamics, and this knowledge gap is slowing the development of efficient control strategies. Here we study the population genomics and molecular epidemiology of wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the biotrophic fungus <i>Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici</i> (Bgt). We sampled Bgt across two consecutive years, 2022 and 2023, and compiled a genomic dataset of 415 Bgt isolates from 22 countries in Europe and surrounding regions. We identified a single epidemic unit in the north of Europe, consisting of a highly homogeneous population. Conversely, the south of Europe hosts smaller local populations which are less interconnected. In addition, we show that the population structure can be largely predicted by the prevalent wind patterns. We identified several loci that were under selection in the recent past, including fungicide targets and avirulence genes. Some of these loci are common between populations, while others are not, suggesting different local selective pressures. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of one of these loci, <i>AvrPm17</i>, coding for an effector recognized by the wheat receptor Pm17. We found evidence for a soft sweep on standing genetic variation. Multiple <i>AvrPm17</i> haplotypes, which can partially escape recognition by Pm17, spread rapidly throughout the continent upon its introduction in the early 2000s. We also identified a new virulent variant, which emerged more recently and can evade <i>Pm17</i> resistance altogether. Overall, we highlight the potential of genomic surveillance in resolving the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of agricultural pathogens, as well as in guiding control strategies.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><i>T</i>ubulin <i>P</i>olymerization <i>P</i>romoting <i>P</i>roteins (TPPPs) are highly conserved across species but remain poorly understood. There are three <i>TPPP</i> genes in humans, with only one homologous <i>TPPP</i> gene in invertebrates, such as <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>C. elegans</i>. The human TPPP (TPPP1/p25/p25α) is enriched in the brain and shares sequence similarities with the invertebrate TPPPs. TPPP/p25 associates with microtubules and plays a pivotal role in microtubule dynamics, bundling, and polymerization, thereby stabilizing the microtubular network. This is essential for cytoskeletal organization and proper functioning of neurons and glial cells, including axonal growth, regeneration, migration, trafficking, synapse formation, and myelination of axons. However, studies have also uncovered that besides its cytoplasmic/microtubular localization, TPPP/p25 is present in other subcellular compartments, including the mitochondria and nucleus, underscoring the presence of additional novel functions. At the molecular level, TPPP/p25 is predicted to exist as an intrinsically disordered protein and is implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's and related disorders and Multiple Sclerosis. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of TPPP/p25, highlighting its evolutionary conservation, cellular and subcellular localization, established and emerging functions in the nervous system, interacting partners, potential clinical relevance to human neurological disorders, and conclude with unresolved questions and future areas of study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1089/v3?src=rss">Predicting gene expression changes upon epigenomic drug treatment [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Tumors are characterized by global changes in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that are functionally linked to tumor progression. Accordingly, several drugs targeting the epigenome have been proposed for cancer therapy, notably, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as vorinostat and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such as zebularine. However, a fundamental challenge with such approaches is the lack of genomic specificity, i.e., the transcriptional changes at different genomic loci can be highly variable, thus making it difficult to predict the consequences on the global transcriptome and drug response. For instance, treatment with DNMTi may upregulate the expression of not only a tumor suppressor but also an oncogene, leading to unintended adverse effect. Methods Given the pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenomic profile of a sample, we assessed the extent of predictability of locus-specific changes in gene expression upon treatment with HDACi using machine learning. Results We found that in two cell lines (HCT116 treated with Largazole at eight doses and RH4 treated with Entinostat at 1µM) where the appropriate data (pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenome as well as post-treatment transcriptome) is available, our model distinguished the post-treatment up versus downregulated genes with high accuracy (up to ROC of 0.89). Furthermore, a model trained on one cell line is applicable to another cell line suggesting generalizability of the model. Conclusions Here we present a first assessment of the predictability of genome-wide transcriptomic changes upon treatment with HDACi. Lack of appropriate omics data from clinical trials of epigenetic drugs currently hampers the assessment of applicability of our approach in clinical setting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-238/v2?src=rss">Relationship between the perception of oral health and the quality of life of hospital staff [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Hospital staff’s perception of oral health directly impacts their overall oral health-related well-being (OHRQoL) and their job performance. This study seeks to analyze the relationship between these two dimensions, providing information for designing strategies that promote a healthier work environment. Aim To determine the relationship between oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and oral health perceptions in the staff of a level II-1 hospital located in northern Peru. Methods The study had a quantitative approach, with a cross-sectional, applied, and correlational design. Seventy-two participants participated. The validated OHIP-14 and HU-DBI questionnaires were used, with reliability coefficients of 0.847 and 0.804, respectively. Spearman’s correlation coefficient, appropriate for ordinal variables, was used for data analysis. Results A statistically significant association was found between health-related quality of life and subjective perception of oral status (Rho = 0.391, p < 0.05), with an explained variance of 19.8% according to Nagelkerke’s pseudo R-squared. The most frequently associated quality of life dimensions were physical disability (Rho = 0.319; p < 0.05) and social disability (Rho = 0.242; p < 0.05). Excellent quality of life was the most prevalent (38.9%), while poor oral health was the most common (52.8%). Conclusion The findings show a significant relationship between self-perceived oral health and oral health-related quality of life in this group of professionals. Promoting oral health strategies tailored to the hospital setting is recommended to improve workplace well-being.

                Anterior communicating artery (ACOM) aneurysms represent 23-40% of cerebral aneurysms and 12-15% of unruptured aneurysms, with a higher risk of rupture compared to other cerebral aneurysms. This case report presents a 56-year-old female admitted to a private hospital with acute headache and nausea, subsequently diagnosed with an ACOM aneurysm. The patient had no significant medical history, belonged to an intergenerational family, and maintained good mental health. Physical examination revealed a woman of thin frame (152 cm, 51 kg) with normal vital signs. Laboratory findings indicated low hemoglobin (7.5 g/dl), elevated sodium (19.1 mcg/dl), high creatinine (5.4 mcg), and elevated calcium (11.5 mcg/dl). Treatment included ondansetron, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium citrate, and alpha-blockers. The case highlights the importance of prompt intervention for ACOM aneurysms regardless of size, along with the necessity of comprehensive postoperative monitoring to detect complications such as bleeding and neurological impairments. Postoperative imaging is crucial to assess clipping effectiveness and monitor for potential complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1378/v2?src=rss">Decoding Investor Sentiments in the Indian Stock Market: A Structural Equation Modelling Approach [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study This research examines how psychological and social biases affect individual investors’ investing decisions. Investor sentiment significantly influences financial markets, frequently causing stock prices to deviate from their intrinsic values. In rising economies such as India, where retail investors are significantly affected by psychological factors, comprehending these attitudes is crucial. Methods This study analyses data from a comprehensive questionnaire that was conducted throughout the nation and included 552 retail investors. The investigation employed structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the elements that influence the decision-making of individuals who invest in the Indian stock market. Findings The research offers insight on the influence that investor attitude has on investment decision-making as well as the factors that precede it. The study demonstrates that investors make financial decisions based on sentiment. In addition to assessing the efficacy of the Indian financial market, this study sought to ascertain the rationality of investors’ choices by exploring the factors that influence their decision-making process. Conclusion The outcome of the study shows that information seeking, anchoring, herding, representativeness, and overconfidence all have a big impact on investors. Moreover, the study has proven investors’ irrationality and stock market inefficiency. The findings may be employed to further examine the trading practices of international investors and encourage further study in the field of behavioural finance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-473/v1?src=rss">Overcoming Data Barriers: Digital Inclusion and Equitable Public Services for People with Disabilities in Thailand [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Ensuring equitable access to public services for people with disabilities remains a persistent challenge in digital governance. Despite advancements in data governance frameworks, disparities in accessibility continue to exclude marginalized populations. While government-led digital initiatives f ocus on efficiency and compliance, their impact on vulnerable groups remains underexplored. This study examines the causal factors influencing audit data governance in Thailand’s public sector, with a particular focus on the contrasting perspectives between government officials, who are responsible for delivering public services, and people with disabilities, who rely on these services. Methods This research employs Multi-Group Structural Equation Modeling (MG-SEM) to analyze survey responses from 711 participants, including policymakers, policy implementers, auditors, and people with disabilities (specifically individuals with visual and physical impairments). The study utilizes a quantitative approach, ensuring that all analyses are based on structured survey data. Key constructs examined include public service delivery for people with disabilities (measured by perception of public service, enablers for access to data, citizen-oriented policy, and fair & efficient administrative procedures), data-driven culture, which ultimately influence audit data governance. Results The findings reveal significant disparities in how data governance is perceived. Government officials emphasize efficiency, compliance, and regulatory adherence, whereas people with disabilities prioritize accessibility, usability, and inclusivity in digital public services. These contrasting perspectives highlight systemic barriers that hinder the equitable implementation of digital governance frameworks, exacerbating the digital divide in public service accessibility. Conclusions To address these challenges, the study proposes targeted policy interventions, including the integration of AI-driven auditing mechanisms, the establishment of universal digital accessibility standards, and the implementation of participatory governance strategies. These recommendations provide valuable insights for policymakers, auditors, and public administrators aiming to foster transparency, trust, and inclusivity in digital public services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1299/v2?src=rss">A causality investigation into stock prices and macroeconomic indicators in the Indian stock market [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study The systematic impact of macroeconomic variables on stock market returns makes it crucial to comprehend the link between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. Stock prices are closely linked to macroeconomic indicators, a crucial aspect for investors, policymakers, and researchers in emerging markets like India, influencing investment decisions and policy formulation. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used in this study to examine the causal links between specific macroeconomic factors and Indian stock prices from April 2009 to March 2023. Results The outcomes of the research suggest that macroeconomic variables exert influence on the Indian stock market, across the short and long term. Moreover, the results of the paired Granger causality test suggest that the domestic macroeconomic variables possess predictive significance for stock prices in the Indian stock market. Conclusion The study reveals that macroeconomic variables significantly impact the Indian stock market, highlighting the need for investors and portfolio managers to monitor these conditions to optimize returns and mitigate risks. The Reserve Bank of India should maintain an optimal money supply to prevent inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, while bolstering the export sector and facilitating imports through initiatives like Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India. Policies focusing on productivity, infrastructure, and a favourable business environment are also crucial. Therefore, it is crucial for investors and portfolio managers to consistently analyse the current macroeconomic conditions in order to maximize their profits and minimize risks. This research has extensive significance for comprehending the intricate connections between the stock market and macroeconomic issues.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.70041?af=R">A Novel H2S Donor Alleviates Neuroinflammation and Seizures by Inhibiting the C3‐C3aR Pathway</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Both astrocytes and microglia are activated in the epileptic brain. There is an interaction between them through the complement 3 (C3)-C3a receptor (C3aR) pathway, which plays a detrimental role in seizures. Our self-developed novel H<sub>2</sub>S donor has been found to have anti-seizure effects. However, its mechanism remains to be explored. In the present study, we showed that the novel H<sub>2</sub>S donor can inhibit the activation of astrocytes and microglia and their interaction through C3-C3aR signaling, which contributed to alleviating microglial neuroinflammation and seizures. In LPS-treated astrocytes and pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice, the H<sub>2</sub>S donor reduced C3 production in astrocytes and regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-10 in microglia. The H<sub>2</sub>S donor also reduced the EEG amplitude of hippocampal epileptic waves and relieved seizures in epileptic mice. These effects of the H<sub>2</sub>S donor can be reversed by intranasal C3 treatment and mimicked by a C3aR antagonist. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the anti-seizure effects of the H<sub>2</sub>S donor. Therefore, the H<sub>2</sub>S donor has the potential to be used as a candidate for antiepileptic drugs.</p>

                The appropriate and rapid encoding of stimuli bearing a negative valence enables behaviors that are essential for survival. Recent advances in neuroscience using rodents as a model system highlight the relevance of cell type-specific neuronal activities in diverse brain networks for the encoding of aversion, as well as their importance for subsequent behavioral strategies. Within these networks, neuromodulators influence cell excitability, adjust fast synaptic neurotransmission, and affect plasticity, ultimately modulating behaviors. In this review we first discuss contemporary findings leveraging the use of cutting-edge neurotechnologies to define aversion-related neural circuits. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the release of neuromodulators and neuropeptides upon exposure to aversive stimuli are described within defined brain circuits. Together, these mechanistic insights update the present neural framework through which aversion drives motivated behaviors.

                Eubanks et al. found that gene expression networks that are specific for brain regions that develop high degrees of alpha-synuclein pathology carry an increased frequency of rare risk variants in patients with Parkinson’s disease. This dysregulates alpha-synuclein homeostasis, in particular its liquid-liquid phase separation and association with lipids in inclusions.

                Feeding is a fundamental requirement for the survival of host and gut microbiota. Here, Pan et al. discovered how gut microbiota influences feeding behavior through KYNA. During fasting, increased KYNA levels stimulate food intake by inhibiting vagal afferent nerves and activating AgRP neurons, demonstrating a mechanism of microbiota-mediated appetite regulation.

                Aguilar-Gómez et al. find evidence of evolutionary adaptation with potential relevance to breath-hold diving in the Haenyeo divers of Korea. Genetic variants under selection in this population may help mitigate the physiological strain of repeated diving during pregnancy. Additionally, long-term training appears to enhance the diving response through pronounced bradycardia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100870">The neuropeptide sulfakinin is a peripheral regulator of insect behavioral switch between mating and foraging</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral strategies for foraging and reproduction in the oriental fruit fly (<i>Bactrocera dorsalis</i>) are alternative options for resource allocation and are controlled by neuropeptides. Here, we show that the behavioral switch between foraging and reproduction is associated with changes in antennal sensitivity. Starved flies became more sensitive to food odors while suppressing their response to opposite-sex pheromones. The gene encoding sulfakinin receptor 1 (<i>SkR1</i>) was significantly upregulated in the antennae of starved flies, so we tested the behavioral phenotypes of null mutants for the genes encoding the receptor (<i>skr1</i><sup>–/–</sup>) and its ligand sulfakinin (<i>sk</i><sup>–/–</sup>). In both knockout lines, the antennal responses shifted to mating mode even when flies were starved. This suggests that sulfakinin signaling via SkR1 promotes foraging while suppressing mating. Further analysis of the mutant flies revealed that sets of odorant receptor (OR) genes were differentially expressed. Functional characterization of the differentially expressed ORs suggested that sulfakinin directly suppresses the expression of ORs that respond to opposite-sex hormones while enhancing the expression of ORs that detect food volatiles. We conclude that sulfakinin signaling via SkR1, modulating OR expressions and leading to altered antenna sensitivities, is an important component in starvation-dependent behavioral change.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90309">Interdependence of plasma membrane nanoscale dynamics of a kinase and its cognate substrate underlies Arabidopsis response to viral infection</a></h4>

              
                Plant viruses represent a risk to agricultural production and as only a few treatments exist, it is urgent to identify resistance mechanisms and factors. In plant immunity, plasma membrane (PM)-localized proteins play an essential role in sensing the extracellular threat presented by bacteria, fungi, or herbivores. Viruses are intracellular pathogens and as such the role of the plant PM in detection and resistance against viruses is often overlooked. We investigated the role of the partially PM-bound Calcium-dependent protein kinase 3 (CPK3) in viral infection and we discovered that it displayed a specific ability to hamper viral propagation over CPK isoforms that are involved in immune response to extracellular pathogens. More and more evidence supports that the lateral organization of PM proteins and lipids underlies signal transduction in plants. We showed here that CPK3 diffusion in the PM is reduced upon activation as well as upon viral infection and that such immobilization depended on its substrate, Remorin (REM1.2), a scaffold protein. Furthermore, we discovered that the viral infection induced a CPK3-dependent increase of REM1.2 PM diffusion. Such interdependence was also observable regarding viral propagation. This study unveils a complex relationship between a kinase and its substrate that contrasts with the commonly described co-stabilisation upon activation while it proposes a PM-based mechanism involved in decreased sensitivity to viral infection in plants.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98033">Semantical and geometrical protein encoding toward enhanced bioactivity and thermostability</a></h4>

              
                Protein engineering is a pivotal aspect of synthetic biology, involving the modification of amino acids within existing protein sequences to achieve novel or enhanced functionalities and physical properties. Accurate prediction of protein variant effects requires a thorough understanding of protein sequence, structure, and function. Deep learning methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in guiding protein modification for improved functionality. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on protein sequences, which face challenges in efficiently encoding the geometric aspects of amino acids’ local environment and often fall short in capturing crucial details related to protein folding stability, internal molecular interactions, and bio-functions. Furthermore, there lacks a fundamental evaluation for developed methods in predicting protein thermostability, although it is a key physical property that is frequently investigated in practice. To address these challenges, this article introduces a novel pre-training framework that integrates sequential and geometric encoders for protein primary and tertiary structures. This framework guides mutation directions toward desired traits by simulating natural selection on wild-type proteins and evaluates variant effects based on their fitness to perform specific functions. We assess the proposed approach using three benchmarks comprising over 300 deep mutational scanning assays. The prediction results showcase exceptional performance across extensive experiments compared to other zero-shot learning methods, all while maintaining a minimal cost in terms of trainable parameters. This study not only proposes an effective framework for more accurate and comprehensive predictions to facilitate efficient protein engineering, but also enhances the in silico assessment system for future deep learning models to better align with empirical requirements. The PyTorch implementation is available at <a href="https://github.com/ai4protein/ProtSSN">https://github.com/ai4protein/ProtSSN</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100918">Temporal dynamics analysis reveals that concurrent working memory load eliminates the Stroop effect through disrupting stimulus-response mapping</a></h4>

              
                Concurrent verbal working memory task can eliminate the color-word Stroop effect. Previous research, based on specific and limited resources, suggested that the disappearance of the conflict effect was due to the memory information preempting the resources for distractors. However, it remains unclear which particular stage of Stroop conflict processing is influenced by working memory loads. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with event-related potential (ERP) analyses, time-frequency analyses, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPAs), and representational similarity analyses (RSAs) were applied to provide an in-depth investigation of the aforementioned issue. Subjects were required to complete the single task (the classical manual color-word Stroop task) and the dual task (the Sternberg working memory task combined with the Stroop task), respectively. Behaviorally, the results indicated that the Stroop effect was eliminated in the dual-task condition. The EEG results showed that the concurrent working memory task did not modulate the P1, N450, and alpha bands. However, it modulated the sustained potential (SP), late theta (740–820 ms), and beta (920–1040 ms) power, showing no difference between congruent and incongruent trials in the dual-task condition but significant difference in the single-task condition. Importantly, the RSA results revealed that the neural activation pattern of the late theta was similar to the response interaction pattern. Together, these findings implied that the concurrent working memory task eliminated the Stroop effect through disrupting stimulus-response mapping.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101420">Aberration correction in long GRIN lens-based microendoscopes for extended field-of-view two-photon imaging in deep brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon (2P) fluorescence imaging through gradient index (GRIN) lens-based endoscopes is fundamental to investigate the functional properties of neural populations in deep brain circuits. However, GRIN lenses have intrinsic optical aberrations, which severely degrade their imaging performance. GRIN aberrations decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution of fluorescence signals, especially in lateral portions of the field-of-view (FOV), leading to restricted FOV and smaller number of recorded neurons. This is especially relevant for GRIN lenses of several millimeters in length, which are needed to reach the deeper regions of the rodent brain. We have previously demonstrated a novel method to enlarge the FOV and improve the spatial resolution of 2P microendoscopes based on GRIN lenses of length &lt;4.1 mm (Antonini et al., 2020). However, previously developed microendoscopes were too short to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. In this study, we combined optical simulations with fabrication of aspherical polymer microlenses through three-dimensional (3D) microprinting to correct for optical aberrations in long (length &gt;6 mm) GRIN lens-based microendoscopes (diameter, 500 µm). Long corrected microendoscopes had improved spatial resolution, enabling imaging in significantly enlarged FOVs. Moreover, using synthetic calcium data we showed that aberration correction enabled detection of cells with higher SNR of fluorescent signals and decreased cross-contamination between neurons. Finally, we applied long corrected microendoscopes to perform large-scale and high-precision recordings of calcium signals in populations of neurons in the olfactory cortex, a brain region laying approximately 5 mm from the brain surface, of awake head-fixed mice. Long corrected microendoscopes are powerful new tools enabling population imaging with unprecedented large FOV and high spatial resolution in the most ventral regions of the mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103413">Disruption of the novel nested gene Aff3ir mediates disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Disturbed shear stress-induced endothelial atherogenic responses are pivotal in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, contributing to the uneven distribution of atherosclerotic lesions. This study investigates the role of <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i>, a novel nested gene variant, in disturbed flow-induced endothelial cell activation and atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that disturbed shear stress significantly reduces <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> expression in athero-prone regions. Using three distinct mouse models with manipulated <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> expression, we demonstrate that <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> exerts potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in <i>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. RNA sequencing revealed that interferon regulatory factor 5 (<i>Irf5</i>), a key regulator of inflammatory processes, mediates inflammatory responses associated with <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> deficiency. <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> interacts with <i>Irf5</i>, promoting its retention in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the <i>Irf5</i>-dependent inflammatory pathways. Notably, <i>Irf5</i> knockdown in <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> deficient mice almost completely rescues the aggravated atherosclerotic phenotype. Moreover, endothelial-specific <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> supplementation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system significantly ameliorated endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. These findings elucidate a novel role for <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> in mitigating endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis by acting as an inhibitor of <i>Irf5</i>, highlighting its potential as a valuable therapeutic approach for treating atherosclerosis.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The organization of the cingulate cortex has been the subject of intensive studies, concluding to its central role in motor control, cognition, and arousal. One of the key anatomical pathways through which the cingulate cortex influences behavior is its efferent connection to the locus coeruleus (LC). This brainstem region is responsible for noradrenaline (NA) release and is critical for various cognitive and behavioral functions. However, the specific impact of cingulate subregions on the LC-NA system remains unexplored. This study investigated how the different cingulate cortex areas affect LC-NA activity by measuring pupil-evoked responses (PERs) as an index of LC-NA activity. Using intra-cortical stimulation across the eight cingulate areas in rats, we found that anterior cingulate cortex and midcingulate cortex subregions evoked rare autonomic responses but significant pupil dilations whose amplitude increased along the caudo-rostral and dorso-ventral axes. By using the DSP-4, a neurotoxin-selective ablation of the LC-NA system, we suppressed PER and confirmed the role of LC-NA activity in this response. The differential influence of cortical areas on the PER demonstrates that each subregion of the rat cingulate cortex has the potential to differentially activate the LC-NA system, suggesting a clear parcellation of the rodent cingulate cortex, likely corresponding to functional specialization.</span>

Endomembrane breaching is a crucial strategy employed by intracellular pathogens enclosed within vacuoles to access the nutrient-rich cytosol for intracellular replication. While bacteria use various mechanisms to compromise host membranes, the specific processes and factors involved are often unknown. <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, a major human pathogen, accesses the cytosol relying on the Type Three Secretion System (T3SS) and secreted effectors. Using in-cell correlative light and electron microscopy, we tracked the sequential steps of <i>Shigella</i> host cell entry. Moreover, we captured the T3SS, which projects a needle from the bacterial surface, in the process of puncturing holes in the vacuolar membrane. This initial puncture ensures disruption of the vacuole. Together this introduces the concept of mechanoporation via a bacterial secretion system as a crucial process for bacterial pathogen-induced membrane damage.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There are limited population-based data regarding the prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and associated risks of mortality and incident cerebrovascular events.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a retrospective cohort study using inpatient and outpatient claims from 2008 to 2022 from a 5% national sample of Medicare beneficiaries. CAA and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were identified using validated International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. We ascertained CAA from October 1, 2015 through 2022, and used data from 2008 through September 30, 2015 to ascertain comorbidities including prevalent stroke. We used Cox regression to examine the association of CAA with subsequent death and incident stroke subtypes after adjustment for demographics, vascular risk factors, and Charlson comorbidities.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 1,920,312 Medicare beneficiaries in our sample, 2,161 (11.3 per 10,000) had a diagnosis of CAA. In adjusted Cox regression analysis, there was an association between CAA and subsequent mortality (HR 4.9; 95% CI 4.6–5.2). Among 1,872,474 patients without prevalent stroke, including 900 of the CAA patients, there was a significant association between CAA and an increased risk of any stroke (HR 8.0; 95% CI 6.7–9.6), ischemic stroke (HR 4.6; 95% CI 3.6–6.0), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR 26.9; 95% CI 20.3–35.6), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR 21.6; 95% CI 12.2–38.1). After a diagnosis of CAA, absolute risks of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage were broadly similar.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In a large, nationwide cohort of Medicare beneficiaries, the prevalence of clinically diagnosed CAA was approximately 11 per 10,000. CAA was associated with an increased risk of mortality and incident stroke, both hemorrhagic and ischemic. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Acinetobacter baumannii infection (ABI) is a concerning worldwide public health matter with high levels of morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. This study aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of ABI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. Methods A retrospective review was performed on pediatric patients admitted to the PICU over an 8-year period. Demographic characteristics, infection risk factors, and clinical outcomes were compared and analyzed between patients with ABI, determined to be the case group, and patients without ABI, determined to be the control group. The study also assessed the prevalence of ABI and its antimicrobial resistance profile. Results Between June 2014 and May 2022, a total of 82 cases of ABI were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.02%. After applying the exclusion criteria, 12 cases were excluded. Consequently, 70 ABI cases in total and 140 cases in a control group were included in the study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis identified chronic respiratory disease, mechanical ventilation lasting 5 days or more, and the use of piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks as independent risk factors associated with ABI. The rate of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) was notably high at 94.26%. Cases of ABI were associated with higher mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization compared to non-ABI cases. Conclusion ABI remains a critical pathogen in the PICU. The presence of chronic respiratory disease, use of mechanical ventilation for at least five days, and a history of receiving piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks are significant risk factors for ABI. The high level of antibiotic resistance, especially to carbapenems, highlights the emphasis for more stringent infection control practices and the creation of novel antimicrobial therapies.

                Background Xylene, a common solvent in painting, printing, and shoemaking, enters the body through inhalation of vapors. Methods This observational analytic study, conducted in 2019, aimed to examine the relationship between xylene concentration, xylene RQ, and liver function in industrial workers in Surabaya, especially in shoe industries. The chi-square method was utilized for data analysis. To ensure the validity and reliability of the study results, air and blood sampling procedures were implemented. Air sampling was conducted to measure xylene concentrations in the workplace environment, while blood samples were collected from workers to assess Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels. The study was conducted in five regions in Surabaya, namely Kalijudan, Ketintang, Jemursari, AUP, and Romokalisari. Participants were between 16 and 65 years old, provided informed consent, had no history of medically diagnosed liver disease, and submitted complete and accurate questionnaire responses. Confounding factors (physical activity, nutrition, smoking) were controlled through participant questionnaires and statistical adjustments. The population includes a total of 90 workers with 77 of them taken as samples using the accidental sampling method. Results The results show that there is a relationship between xylene concentration and Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = 0,65) and there is no relationship between xylene concentrations and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = -0,12). There was no relationship between RQ and SGOT levels (p> 0.05) and there was no relationship between RQ and SGPT levels (p> 0.05). However, from the calculation of the prevalence ratio, workers with unsafe RQ (RQ>1) have a 7.09x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGOT levels and a 1.06x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGPT levels. Conclusions Xylene exposure (concentration & RQ) affects liver enzyme levels (SGOT/SGPT) in workers. Industries should consider providing nutritious food to aid xylene removal and stricter safety policies are needed. This study highlights the importance of a holistic approach to worker health and safety when dealing with hazardous chemicals.

                Background Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critical care. Despite extensive preclinical research on sepsis pathophysiology, the development of effective therapies has been largely unsuccessful. Key obstacles include limited construct validity of animal models, insufficient methodological rigor and the lack of collaborative frameworks akin to clinical trials. These issues plague not only sepsis research, but preclinical research in general. The National Preclinical Sepsis Platform (NPSP), an interdisciplinary network under Sepsis Canada, addresses these challenges in sepsis research through multilaboratory, randomized, controlled preclinical studies. NPSP-01 will establish baseline conditions for future investigations using an acute fecal-induced peritonitis model of sepsis. Methods This randomized, controlled study will evaluate the effect of standard sepsis therapy in a mouse model of sepsis across six centres. Interlaboratory variability and the interaction of biological sex on outcomes will also be examined. C57BL/6 mice of both sexes will be randomized into sham (healthy control) + treatment, sepsis, or sepsis + treatment groups. Sepsis will be induced via intraperitoneal injection of fecal slurry, while sham mice will receive vehicle control. Antibiotics and fluids will be administered to treatment groups at 4 hours post-induction, and mice with be euthanized at 8 hours post-induction. The primary outcome is plasma interleukin-6 levels. Secondary outcomes include biological (blood gas and chemistry, white blood cell count, bacterial load), clinical (body weight, core temperature, sepsis score, mortality as measured by surrogate humane endpoints), and feasibility measures. Conclusions NPSP-01 will be the first multilaboratory study of sepsis and represents a shift in preclinical critical illness research, mirroring the rigor of clinical multicenter trials. By addressing procedural standardization, interlaboratory variability, and sex-based differences, this study aims to enhance the reliability and translational relevance of preclinical findings. The outcomes of NPSP-01 will establish foundational data for future investigations and provide a roadmap for rigorous collaborative preclinical studies to accelerate the evaluation of novel sepsis therapies.

                Background Indonesia is currently implementing educational reforms to enhance university teaching and learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected Indonesian universities, requiring lecturers to implement various changes. The phenomenon of online learning communication at various universities in Indonesia is critical considering today’s increasingly fierce competition due to digital disruption coupled with the impact of the pandemic. Therefore, lecturers must implement appropriate methods to conduct online learning communication effectively. Methods This qualitative method with phenomenological approach was designed to explore lecturers’ understanding of the implementation of changes in online learning communication at Indonesian universities. In-depth interviews and field observations were conducted with lecturers who were efficient in online learning using a specific measurement standard. The research participants were identified using purposive sampling with a snowball approach. The study comprised 10 lecturers who were experienced and efficiently delivered online lectures. Results The results provide a review of factors identified by the phenomenological and qualitative study that contribute to online learning communication, such as chemistry, lecturer preparation, and learning materials. The results of this study revealed several themes. Each section centres on the major themes that emerged from the datasets. Finding Our findings aid in a better understanding of the benefits and constraints of using online learning communication in the classroom. These findings are crucial for university lecturers developing methods for enhancing the implementation of online learning communication. Moreover, the findings revealed that lecturers should engage in and create trusting interactions with their students. Providing technical support to keep both teachers and students engaged can be useful. More crucially, multimedia support and learning systems are essential for properly addressing lecturers’ tasks and learning materials. This study improves the understanding of online learning communications implemented by lecturers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-113/v2?src=rss">Financial literacy among young college students: Advancements and future directions  [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Financial literacy is one of the most important skills that people need in the 21st century, particularly for younger generations, such as college students and who must master personal finance skills. This topic has gained importance in recent years in the field of scientific research. The objective of this study was to identify the most relevant factors related to financial education among young university students. A systematic literature review was conducted based on the parameters established by the PRISMA statement. A total of 44 datasets were analyzed to identify the most recurring factors in the literature. Finally, the validity of the most relevant issues related to the subject of study was confirmed. The analysis revealed two key themes that remain prevalent and are the most frequently discussed in the literature on financial literacy among university students: financial behavior and financial knowledge. The study concludes that financial Inclusion, Budgeting, Financial Attitude, and Adolescents are other topics with a promising future in future research. The findings provide a structured guide for future studies and help identify research gaps that can be addressed in subsequent investigations.
