                Background Head and neck cancer (HNCs) is a major health issue worldwide, and India has contributed to approximately 2.4 lakh new cases in 2022. Definitive chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced disease but carries a risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) that add to morbidity, hospitalization, cost, and possible delay in treatment. The increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has also contributed to management burden. This study aimed to assess the microbiological profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns of lower respiratory tract infections in patients with head and neck cancer receiving chemoradiation. Methods Patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and who developed LRTIs were included in the study. Sputum and tracheostomy suction tip cultures were obtained and processed using standard microbiological techniques such as Gram staining, biochemical tests, and VITEK-2 automated systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and EUCAST recommendations. Clinical and treatment-related factors were documented and compared using SPSS version 23.0, with descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression models. Results Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen (35.0%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.7%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%). The pathogens were strongly resistant to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins but were susceptible to carbapenems and aminoglycosides in the majority of isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent pathogen in all age groups and chemotherapy regimens (p<0.001). Conclusion LRTIs in patients with HNC treated with chemoradiation were mainly caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance patterns are crucial for directing empirical antibiotic therapy, minimizing treatment delays, and enhancing clinical outcomes.

">Learning in nonstationary environments with minimal neuralcircuitry</a></h4>

              
                Animals inhabit continually changing environments where it is not always possible to infer causes of relevant changes, such as the appearance of a new threat. In such nonstationary settings, learning a predictive model is challenging because a surprising observation could be due to chance, or due to systematic but uninferrable causes. This issue magnifies for short-lived animals with small nervous systems and limited opportunity to explore. To understand how the nervous system negotiates these challenges, we derived a new learning principle, Hetlearn (Heterologous Learners), based on the physiology and multi-compartmental architecture of the Drosophila mushroom body, a key associative learning circuit. Hetlearn circumvents learning full causal models of the environment, making it less fragile to nonstationarity. In stationary settings, Hetlearn is efficient and outperforms Bayesian inference when data are limited. Hetlearn predicts observed learning behaviour in Drosophila across multiple tasks and provides new, testable predictions about circuit interactions during learning.

">Fixel-Based Analysis reveals microstructural visual pathway changes associated with retinal remodeling in retinitis pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy, traditionally considered a photoreceptor degenerative disorder. However, the relationship between retinal degeneration and structural alterations along central visual pathways remains poorly understood. We investigated possible structural links across the retinocortical pathway in 15 genetically characterized RP patients (RHO, PDE6A, PDE6B mutations) compared with 22 healthy controls, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) combined with diffusion-weighted MRI and fixel-based analysis (FBA). Retinal segmentation revealed marked outer layer thinning (outer nuclear layer: -55% foveal, -77% parafoveal) with significant inner layer thickening at the fovea (inner plexiform layer +29%, inner nuclear layer +40%). Parafoveal regions showed near-complete photoreceptor loss but inner retinal thickness approaching normal values. FBA demonstrated significant fiber density reductions in optic tracts and optic radiations, without corresponding macrostructural changes in tract cross-section, suggesting early microstructural disruption preceding atrophy. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between parafoveal inner plexiform layer thickness and fiber density in both optic tracts (r=0.856) and radiations (r=0.768), with no correlations observed at the foveal level. These findings demonstrate complex, region-specific retinal remodeling in RP, likely reflecting Muller cell gliosis rather than mechanical compensation. The fiber density reduction without tract atrophy suggests trans-synaptic degeneration along visual pathways. This multimodal framework provides insights into structural propagation in inherited retinal dystrophies and may serve as a biomarker for evaluating therapeutic interventions aimed at photoreceptor restoration.

">Trial-Level Sequence Modeling Reveals Hidden Dynamics of Dual-Task Interference</a></h4>

              
                Theories of dual-task interference assume that the same cognitive operations underlie multitasking regardless of stimulus timing, yet this core assumption has remained untested due to methodological limitations of behavioral averaging. Here, we combine hidden multivariate pattern (HMP) analysis with deep spatiotemporal sequence modeling of single-trial EEG to uncover the neural dynamics of multitasking in the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm. Using a deep spatiotemporal sequence model trained on Long stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) trials, we identify Encoding, Central, and Response operations and show that these same operations occur in the Short SOA condition, demonstrating shared cognitive processes across interference conditions. Additionally, trial-level decoding reveals multiple distinct sequences of cognitive operations across both tasks during interference, varying both within and across individuals. These sequences predict behavioral differences in reaction time and accuracy, revealing how interference timing within the cognitive operation sequence influences performance. In other words, we found trial-by-trial variability related to individual strategies directly affecting accuracy and reaction time (RT). Our findings challenge static bottleneck accounts and establish trial-level sequence modeling as a powerful tool to investigate the hidden dynamics of multitasking.

                The increasing prevalence of vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus (WNV) highlights the critical need for predictive modeling tools that can guide public health decision-making, particularly given the absence of effective vaccines. We developed a modular computational framework that simulates and analyzes WNV transmission dynamics through compartmental models capturing the intricate ecological interactions among avian hosts, mosquito vectors, and human populations. Our system integrates epidemiological parameters with customizable intervention mechanisms, facilitating the assessment of scenario-specific mitigation approaches. Distinguishing itself from conventional static models, this framework enables users to model dynamic, time-sensitive interventions including targeted mosquito control and strategic bird population management—the two principal containment strategies currently employed against WNV. Using simulations that reflect realistic outbreak scenarios, we evaluated how varying intervention intensities and implementation timings affect epi- demic progression. Our findings reveal that early implemented, dual-target strategies addressing both vector populations and avian reservoirs can substantially reduce transmission dynamics and minimize human exposure risk. This framework serves as a comprehensive decision-support platform for policymakers and vector control agencies, delivering mechanistic insights into the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions against zoonotic pathogens within complex ecological systems. The tool’s modular design and scenario-testing capabilities make it particularly valuable for proactive outbreak preparedness and evidence-based intervention planning.

                Background Antibiotic resistance in oral pathogens such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Enterococcus faecalis necessitates alternative antimicrobial strategies. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising approach that utilizes a photosensitizer (PS), light, and oxygen to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. This study evaluated the efficacy of two natural photosensitizers, curcumin and chlorophyll (from Medicago sativa L.), for the photodynamic inactivation of these bacteria. Methods Planktonic cultures of A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis were subjected to PDI using a 405 nm diode laser at various energy densities. The bacteria were treated with either curcumin (1.6 mg/mL) or chlorophyll (1.6 mg/mL) prior to laser irradiation. Bacterial viability was assessed using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. Groups without PS and without light served as controls. Results At an energy density of 1.59 J/cm2, laser irradiation resulted in a reduction of 35.8% and 36.7% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis, respectively. The addition of chlorophyll significantly enhanced bacterial reduction to 64.4% and 69.3%. Curcumin demonstrated superior efficacy, achieving bacterial reduction of 89.8% and 89.4% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis, respectively. The differences between the PS groups and the control groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusions Curcumin is a significantly more effective natural photosensitizer than chlorophyll from Medicago sativa L. for the photodynamic inactivation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis. These findings point to the prospect of curcumin-based PDI as a potent therapeutic alternative for combating resistant oral infections.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1257/v1?src=rss">Effect of Eccentric Control Exercises on Patients with Frozen Shoulder and Mild to Moderate Disability: A Single-Group Pre-Post Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Frozen shoulder (FS) is a common musculoskeletal condition characterized by inflammatory contracture of the glenohumeral joint capsule, leading to restricted active and passive range of motion, particularly in external rotation. Eccentric control exercises have demonstrated effectiveness in managing various upper limb disorders, including subacromial impingement, tennis elbow, and rotator cuff tendinopathy. However, there is limited evidence on their efficacy in individuals with frozen shoulder. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of eccentric control exercises on pain, functional disability, range of motion, psychosocial outcomes, and patient satisfaction in individuals with FS and mild to moderate disability. Methods A single-group pre-post design was used. Twenty patients with clinically diagnosed FS and mild to moderate disability participated. All underwent 20 sessions of supervised eccentric control exercises over four weeks. Outcome measures included the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), shoulder range of motion (flexion, abduction, hand-behind-back, and external rotation), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention (4 weeks), and follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. A 6-point Likert scale was used to measure patient satisfaction post-intervention. Data were analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA. Results All outcome measures showed statistically significant improvement post-intervention (p < 0.05), with the benefits maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Effect size indices at 4 weeks demonstrated a large treatment effect across all variables, suggesting strong clinical relevance. Conclusions Eccentric control exercises significantly improved pain, functional disability, range of motion, kinesiophobia, pain self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction in individuals with frozen shoulder and mild to moderate disability. These findings support the incorporation of eccentric training in rehabilitation programs for frozen shoulder.

                Background Networking plays a pivotal role in achieving business success and mitigating startup failures. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the networking experience of startup entrepreneurs for the growth of their businesses. Methods A qualitative semi-structured interview was conducted mainly in Bangalore and the Delhi regions of India. Using a cluster sampling method, interviews were held with 36 startup entrepreneurs. These startup owners were mainly from Bangalore and Delhi. The age group, gender, demographic profile, and popular startup sector of these startup owners have also been analyzed in this study. The data were analyzed using Atlas. Ti software. Results The qualitative findings revealed four overall themes related to networking, namely, the “role of networking for the success of the startups”, “supportive environment for networking”, “crucial stages of networking” and “role of past working experience of entrepreneurs”. It was found that most entrepreneurs leverage prior work experience to interact effectively in business, utilizing skills such as communication, leadership, and market intelligence. Conclusion Entrepreneurs mainly prefer networking with colleagues and their ex-bosses in building and creating formal networking. During crises, network members provide expert advice, moral support, and connections to specialists, which helps them solve problems and access new opportunities. Networking is crucial mainly in the early stage of a startup, where connections and relationship structures are needed for navigating upcoming challenges.

                This study employs a meta-analytic approach to synthesize empirical evidence on the psychological and behavioral determinants of fast fashion consumption. Integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with brand-related constructs—perceived scarcity, perceived quality, and self-congruity—this research examines how these factors shape consumer attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, consumption intentions, brand loyalty, and word-of-mouth. Using studies published between 2004 and 2024, a random-effects meta-analysis reveals that brand attitude is the strongest predictor of purchase intention, while self-congruity with fashion brands significantly enhances all TPB components. Perceived quality exerts a cross-cutting influence on both cognitive and social evaluations, reinforcing the multidimensional nature of consumer judgments. The findings extend the TPB framework by embedding symbolic and perceptual brand dimensions, offering a more comprehensive explanatory model of fashion consumption. From a managerial perspective, the results suggest that marketing strategies emphasizing authentic scarcity cues and alignment with consumers’ self-identity can strengthen emotional attachment, perceived control, and loyalty. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications for designing culturally sensitive and identity-driven branding strategies in the fast fashion sector.

                A diffuse and heavily calcified coronary lesion represents a complex clinical scenario, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. The optimal management, whether percutaneous coronary intervention, surgery, or medical treatment, remains debatable. A 64-year-old male was referred to our outpatient clinic with persistent typical chest pain. Coronary angiography revealed diffuse and heavily calcified lesions with 75% stenosis at the proximal to middle LAD. A physiological assessment was performed using a hybrid approach of resting full-cycle ratio (RFR) and fractional flow reserve (FFR). Initial RFR was inconclusive (0.91). Follow-up FFR measurement supported the indication for stenting. Lesion characterization using intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a thick, long, and heavily calcified lesion with an OCT Calcium score of 4. The minimal lumen area (MLA) was only 1.78 cm2 and indicative of stent deployment since the MLA was less than 3 mm2. Three runs of rotational atherectomy were performed, followed by non-compliant balloon dilatation and two DES implantations. The procedure was successful with TIMI flow grade 3 and optimal OCT evaluation. The combination of hybrid physiological assessment and intravascular imaging is an effective and efficient strategy for managing complex diffuse-calcified coronary lesions.

                Background Adrenal pseudocysts are rare and usually asymptomatic lesions of the adrenal gland, often discovered incidentally during imaging or post-mortem examination. When large, they may cause compressive symptoms. We report a case of a giant adrenal pseudocyst presenting with flank pain and dysuria. Case presentation A 70-year-old man presented with left flank pain, upper abdominal pressure, and dysuria for three months. Imaging revealed a large left retroperitoneal cystic mass displacing adjacent organs. The patient underwent surgical excision with left adrenalectomy. Histopathology confirmed a giant adrenal pseudocyst. Discussion Adrenal pseudocysts are uncommon and often misdiagnosed preoperatively. Symptoms are typically related to mass effect when lesions are large. CT imaging helps localize the lesion, but definitive diagnosis relies on histopathology. Surgical excision is recommended for symptomatic or large lesions. Conclusion Giant adrenal pseudocysts are rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retroperitoneal cystic masses. Surgery is indicated in symptomatic or uncertain cases to relieve symptoms and confirm the diagnosis.

                Background Women’s financial empowerment remains a critical component of inclusive development in sub-Saharan Africa, yet its realization is often constrained by socio-cultural factors. In Uganda, Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) play a pivotal role in improving women’s access to credit, savings, and financial literacy. However, the influence of cultural norms on the effectiveness of SACCO strategies has not been adequately explored. This study therefore examined the mediating role of cultural factors in the relationship between SACCO strategies financial training, savings, credit access, and government policy and women’s financial empowerment in Masaka District, Uganda. Methods The study adopted a mixed-methods descriptive cross-sectional design under the pragmatic paradigm. Data were collected from 340 women SACCO members and 10 managers using structured questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and hierarchical multiple regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed. Instrument reliability (Cronbach’s α ≥ 0.70) and validity were confirmed, and ethical approval was obtained from the Kampala International University Research Ethics Committee. Findings Results indicated that SACCO strategies significantly enhance women’s financial empowerment (R2 = 0.304, F(4,335) = 36.526, p < 0.001). Financial training exerted the strongest positive influence, while access to credit showed mixed outcomes due to high interest rates and repayment pressures. Cultural factors partially mediated these effects, strengthening the impact of financial training but constraining credit and savings outcomes through patriarchal norms and spousal control. Conclusions SACCO strategies are instrumental in promoting women’s empowerment when implemented within supportive cultural environments. Policymakers and SACCO managers should adopt gender-sensitive training, flexible credit terms, and culturally responsive community engagement to ensure equitable and sustainable empowerment outcomes.

                Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving differential equations, yet their efficiency is often hindered by the need for intricate and computationally costly loss-balancing techniques to address residual term imbalance. This paper introduces a direct differential equation term scaling framework that removes the loss-balancing bottleneck entirely. By scaling each term in the governing equations using characteristic physical dimensions, the proposed method ensures numerical consistency across all contributions, eliminating the need for adaptive weighting during training. This not only simplifies the PINN formulation but also improves stability and convergence. The approach is validated on challenging nonlinear one-dimensional elasticity problems, demonstrating that high-accuracy solutions can be obtained with compact neural network architectures and reducing floating-point operations by at least two orders of magnitude. A reverse scaling step restores the solution to the original physical domain, preserving physical interpretability. The results demonstrate that direct term scaling transforms PINN training into an efficient, and easily deployable process, paving the way for broader adoption in computational mechanics and other physics-driven domains.

<p>The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) in zebrafish plays a pivotal role in directional decision-making, social conflict, and fear responses. The anterograde and retrograde connections of the dorsal and intermediate IPN are revealed through the use of monosynaptic and trans-synaptic viral tracers.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is an evolutionarily conserved brain nucleus that receives direct input from the habenula (Hb). In zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>), it is involved in decision-making dependent on the idiothetic perception of the status of the body, such as head direction and posture. It is also known that the potentiation of the Hb–IPN–griseum centrale (GC) circuit makes fish resilient to stress in coping with fear and social conflict. To address why the same neural circuit controls these two distinctive physiological aspects, we performed anterograde and retrograde trans-synaptic viral tracing, retrograde mono-synaptic viral tracing, and lipophilic dye tracing to map the connectivity from the dorsal and intermediate IPN. We revealed reciprocal connections of d/iIPN and GC neurons with multiple brain regions for sensory inputs, including interoceptive systems that receive proprioception and the perception of balance and water flow, autonomic nervous systems for visceral control, and exteroceptive systems that receive vision and olfaction through the Hb. The positively labeled signals also cover the emotional regulatory system (i.e., serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine neurons) and the motor control system that administers the presentation of behaviors. Our anatomical results imply that multimodal sensorimotor information may converge in the Hb–IPN–GC circuit, hinting at its possible involvement in integrating inner states for responses to upcoming external challenges and in regulating allostasis through anticipatory biological reactions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-31/v3?src=rss">Expression status transition of NOTCH1 accompanies chromatin remodeling in human early retinal progenitor cells [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The regulation of receptor expression is crucial for fine-tuned signal transduction. Notch signaling is a key signaling pathway involved in retinal development. Compared to the knowledge on this signaling pathway in the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells, less is known about its involvement in earlier stages of retinal progenitor cell differentiation and its regulation, although NOTCH1, and probably NOTCH3, are involved in earlier stage differentiation. We aimed to clarify the timing of Notch receptor expression in undifferentiated retinal progenitor cells and elucidate the possible involvement of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of Notch receptor expressions. Methods We re-analyzed publicly available human fetal retina single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data (GSE183684) using Seurat/Signac pipelines. Results On days 59, 74 and 78, we observed NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 mRNA expressions in early retinal progenitor cells, which diminished at later stages of differentiation. Integration of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed that chromatin remodeling in part of the NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 loci were accompanied by transitions in their mRNA expressions. Importantly, the NOTCH1 locus, which showed chromatin remodeling, contained multiple binding motifs for transcription factors important in early retinal progenitor cell differentiation. Since genome-wide investigation of transcription factor binding motifs showed enrichment of such motifs for the early retinal progenitor cell-associated transcription factors (LHX2, RAX and VSX2), the motifs in the NOTCH1 locus might be of biological significance rather than observed by chance. Indeed, footprinting analysis suggested actual binding of those transcription factors (LHX2, RAX and VSX2) and their motifs in the whole genome, strengthening potential involvement of these transcription factor activities in early retinal progenitor cell differentiation. Conclusions These results suggest that chromatin remodeling may be involved in the differential expression of NOTCH1, although another type of Notch mRNA expression regulations may also exist.

Introduction <p>Influenza continuously evolves to escape population immunity, which makes formulating a vaccine challenging. Antigenic differences between vaccine strains and circulating strains can affect vaccine effectiveness (VE). Quantifying the antigenic difference between vaccine strains and circulating strains can aid interpretation of VE, and several antigenic distance metrics have been discussed in the literature. Here, we compare how the predicted breadth of vaccine-induced antibody response varies when different metrics are used to calculate antigenic distance.</p> Methods <p>We analyzed data from a seasonal influenza vaccine cohort that collected serum samples from 2013/14 – 2017/18 at three study sites. The data include pre- and post-vaccination HAI titers to the vaccine strains and a panel of heterologous strains. We used that data to calculate four different antigenic distance measures between assay strains and vaccine strains: difference in year of isolation (temporal), <i>p</i>-Epitope (sequence), Grantham’s distance (biophysical), and antigenic cartography distance (serological). We analyzed agreement between the four metrics using Spearman’s correlation and intraclass correlation. We then fit Bayesian generalized additive mixed-effects models to predict the effect of antigenic distance on post-vaccination titer after controlling for confounders and analyzed the pairwise difference in predictions between metrics.</p> Results <p>The four antigenic distance metrics had low or moderate correlation for influenza subtypes A(H1N1), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. A(H3N2) distances were highly correlated. We found that after accounting for pre-vaccination titer, study site, and repeated measurements across individuals, the predicted post-vaccination titers conditional on antigenic distance and subtype were nearly identical across antigenic distance metrics, with A(H1N1) showing the only notable deviation between metrics.</p> Discussion <p>Despite moderate correlation among metrics, we found that different antigenic distance metrics generated similar predictions about breadth of vaccine response. Costly titer assays for antigenic cartography may not be needed when simpler sequence-based metrics suffice for quantifying vaccine breadth.</p>

Close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods have recently been used to infer demographic parameters for several aquatic and terrestrial species. For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and genetic biocontrol strategies. Close-kin methods have advantages over traditional mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with movement behavior. Here, we extend CKMR methods to accommodate spatial structure alongside life history for mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for parent-offspring and full-sibling pairs in a spatial context, where an individual in each pair may be a larva or adult. Using the dengue vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i> as a case study, we use an individual-based model of mosquito life history to test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating parameters such as mean dispersal distance, daily staying probability, and the strength of a barrier to movement. Considering a simulated population of 9,025 adult mosquitoes arranged on a 19-by-19 grid, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased and precise estimates of mean dispersal distance given a total of 2,500 adult females sampled over a three-month period using 25 traps evenly spread throughout the landscape. The CKMR approach is also able to estimate parameters of more complex dispersal kernels, such as the daily staying probability of a zero-inflated exponential kernel, or the strength of a barrier to movement, provided the magnitude of these parameters is greater than 0.5. These results suggest that CKMR provides an insightful characterization of mosquito dispersal that is complementary to conventional MRR methods.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in cancer progression, invasion, and response to treatment, particularly in regulating anticancer drug resistance and sensitivity. Identifying potential human miRNA-drug associations (MDAs) that manifest as resistance or sensitivity relationships offers valuable insights for cancer treatment and drug development. With the growing availability of biological data, computational methods have emerged as powerful tools to complement experimental approaches. However, limited attention has been paid to computational prediction of MDAs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically rely on known MDA information, overlooking the valuable insights available from multi-source data related to miRNAs and drugs. In this study, we present a multi-view fusion-based graph convolutional network with attention mechanism (MGCNA) to predict miRNA-associated drug resistance/sensitivity. Specifically, MGCNA integrates macro- and micro- level information of miRNAs and drugs to construct multi-view node features from different perspectives. The proposed multi-view graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder obtains miRNA and disease features from different views and learns adaptive importance weights of the embedding using an attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on manually curated benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGCNA outperforms existing baseline methods. Case studies of two common drugs further establish MGCNA’s effectiveness in discovering novel MDAs.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Intense electrical activity modifies the cellular properties of neurons to enable the nervous system to store information. The dentate gyrus (DG) plays a role in learning and memory and its principal cell type, the granule cell (GC), can fire vigorously during behavior. To explore how experience modifies GC electrophysiology, we harnessed the immediate early gene, Fos, to target a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor to neurons that are activated by experience and are hypothesized to encode information. Voltage imaging from these engram GCs in mouse hippocampal slices revealed distinct patterns of stimulation-evoked spiking that depended on prior experience. Compared to unchallenged mice, engram GCs from mice exposed to novelty burst more often, and have longer inter-spike intervals following the blockade of inhibition. Voltage imaging from randomly targeted non-engram GCs revealed distinct firing patterns that did not depend on novelty. Thus, experience modifies the firing of both engram and non-engram GCs in distinctly different ways. The altered bursting will tune the facilitation of transmission from engram GCs to their various postsynaptic targets, and thus redirect the flow of information through the hippocampus. The pattern of GC firing constitutes a substrate for the encoding of information and will alter how the DG processes sensory inputs.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Growing evidence underscores the importance of host-response/secondary-injury—likely influenced by genetics—in outcome variability post-traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intracranial hypertension and hemorrhage progression are critical secondary injuries in severe TBI; these are mediated by the SUR1-TRPM4 channel (a target in clinical trials). We aimed to deconstruct the complex network surrounding SUR1-TRPM4 and define the cumulative impact of key genetic variants on mechanistically connected secondary injuries/outcomes after severe TBI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This exploratory study analyzed 492 prospectively enrolled patients with severe TBI. A network of regulators, mediators, and effectors upstream/downstream of SUR1-TRPM4 was bioinformatically constructed. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were evaluated for multivariable model association with intracranial pressure, intraparenchymal hemorrhage progression, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. Weighted/unweighted polygenic-risk scores (PRS) were constructed and interrogated. Spatial modeling and functional predictions were determined. Single-cell cortical transcriptomic differences were assessed in a parallel murine TBI model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ninety-seven genes (625 SNVs) were analyzed. Nineteen genes contained variants associated with all outcomes (intracranial pressure, hemorrhage progression, and GOS score; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Twenty-two genes (42 SNVs) retained significance for ≥ 1 outcome, with overlap across outcomes. Functions included Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport/signaling, glutamate-clearance, neuroinflammation, and cell death. Single-cell analyses revealed cell-specific gene-expression differences. SNVs were brain-specific cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTLs)/missense/frameshift mutations suggesting high likelihood of biological impact. PRSs were associated with all outcomes with large effects, and markedly improved model explanatory power/performance (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>, receiver operating characteristic [ROC]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Polygenic variability in key nodes linked to SUR1-TRPM4 were associated with mechanistically related secondary injuries and outcome after severe TBI; findings suggest a major role of heritability. Functional implications indicate biological plausibility and identify novel targets. The data, whereas requiring validation, support a shift toward incorporating biologically relevant genetics in advancing precision medicine. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Bankruptcy prediction is crucial for financial stability, and sector-specific Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI-ML) models have proven superior in performance. However, a significant gap exists, as most models are designed for advanced economies, leaving their efficacy in emerging markets like India unexplored. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the applicability of these advanced models to predict bankruptcy within India’s dynamic trade services sector. Methods The research utilized a substantial sample of 5,527 Indian companies. To counter the challenge of having far fewer bankrupt firms than solvent ones, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed. The study then leveraged a comprehensive suite of eight popular AI-ML models, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. To add practical context, business rules based on key financial metrics—liquidity, profitability, and asset size—were integrated. Results The findings robustly demonstrate that AI-ML models can accurately predict bankruptcy in Indian trade services firms. A critical discovery was the variation in early warning signals between an analysis of the entire dataset (aggregate) and segmented groups of companies. This indicates that a one-size-fits-all approach obscures important, segment-specific risk factors. The segmented analysis successfully uncovered hidden risks that were not apparent at the aggregate level. Conclusions The study concludes that AI-ML models are highly effective for bankruptcy prediction in India’s trade services sector. For stakeholders like investors and creditors, the key takeaway is the superior value of a segmented analytical approach. This strategy maintains high predictive accuracy while revealing nuanced, specific risks. Ultimately, it provides a powerful, tailored tool for safeguarding financial interests in an emerging market context.

                Background In an increasingly competitive healthcare sector, delivering exceptional services is crucial for enhancing patient satisfaction and fostering long-term loyalty. However, the direct impact of leadership and governance on patient experience and retention remains underexplored. This study examines the relationships between corporate governance, service quality, patient satisfaction, and loyalty, with a particular focus on entrepreneurial leadership in healthcare organizations in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 384 executive patients across hospitals in Indonesia. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), with p-values reported to indicate statistical significance. Results The findings reveal that entrepreneurial leadership significantly enhances both corporate governance and service quality. Corporate governance positively influences patient satisfaction and loyalty. Service quality was found to moderately influence patient satisfaction, but had a stronger, direct effect on patient loyalty. Additionally, patient satisfaction emerged as a critical mediator in the development of patient loyalty. Conclusions This study provides valuable insights for healthcare managers and policymakers seeking to improve organizational performance and patient retention. Theoretically, it advances the understanding of how leadership and governance frameworks impact patient retention and service quality in the Indonesian context. Practically, the study offers actionable recommendations for hospital administrators to enhance patient satisfaction and loyalty by implementing entrepreneurial leadership, robust governance practices, and continuous service improvement.

                Introduction Hospitals are intended to serve as healing environments; however, they are frequently characterized by high levels of environmental noise pollution that can contradict their therapeutic purpose. This study aimed to investigate the complex relationships among hospital noise pollution, individual noise sensitivity, and significant patient-centered outcomes, including acoustic comfort, noise annoyance, and intention to leave the hospital. Methods This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 2024 at a public hospital in Saveh, Iran. A stratified random sampling method with proportional allocation was used to select a sample of 226 hospitalized adult patients. Objective day-evening-night noise levels (Lden) were measured over 24 hours, while subjective data on noise sensitivity, acoustic comfort, noise annoyance, and intention to leave the hospital were collected using standardized questionnaires. Bayesian Network modeling combined with delta-p sensitivity analysis was applied to examine the relationships among the variables. Results The mean Lden in the studied hospital was found to be 57.95 dB (±6.61). The Bayesian Network analysis revealed that under conditions of high Level Lden, the probability of high annoyance, low acoustic comfort and high intention to leave increased by 12.4%, 6.3% and 5%, respectively. Under conditions of high-Level Sensitivity, the probability of these variables increased by 9.1%, 6.2 and 4.7 %, respectively. While these two variables are at high level, the most substantial positive variations occurred in high annoyance, low acoustic comfort and high intention to leave, with increases of 26.1%, 13.1% and 10.6%. Conclusion Noise levels in the hospital exceed international standards, negatively affecting acoustic comfort, increasing annoyance, and influencing individuals’ intent to leave. Personal noise sensitivity further intensifies these effects.

                Apathy is a common symptom across a wide range of neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, characterised by a loss of goal-directed action. It is associated with faster rates of cognitive and functional decline, poor prognosis, and high caregiver burden. Effective treatments remain elusive. In this article, we propose that apathy is not merely the result of actions becoming undesirable due to insufficient reward or an inflated sense of cost. Instead, actions become unnecessary due to a loss of prior precision on action outcomes in the context of the ‘Bayesian brain’. We outline the theoretical background and current evidence to support this framework and propose testable hypotheses regarding the behaviour, neuroanatomy, and neuropharmacology of apathy.

                Hypertension is a major cause of cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Using scRNA-seq in an angiotensin II mouse model, Schaeffer and Pacholko identify early endothelial, interneuron, and oligodendrocyte vulnerability linked to angiotensin II signaling, revealing molecular pathways that drive later neurovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment in hypertension.

                This study positions intermediate filaments (IFs) as functional drivers and molecular markers of glioblastoma invasion. van Bodegraven et al. reveal that vimentin expression correlates with pro-invasive markers in patients. They show that while IFs reduce glioblastoma cell deformability, they promote matrix degradation via MMP14 expression, which facilitates 3D invasion.

The proposed mechanism could inform therapeutic strategies for inducing undetectable levels of HIV without antiretroviral therapy.

                Deprivation amblyopia can be reversed by the temporary inactivation of one eye after the critical period. Here, Echevarri-Leet et al. show that this is caused by increased burst firing in the neurons that relay information from the retina to the visual cortex. Even inactivation of the amblyopic eye can drive recovery.

                Gastruloids derived from ES cells mimic embryonic patterning through robust self-organization. Mayran et al. uncover that this competence depends on a cadherin switch regulated by Snai1-driven E-cadherin repression and pluripotency exit. Unexpectedly, N-cadherin inactivation enhances morphogenesis, enabling proper rostro-caudal somite patterning without exogenous extracellular matrix, linking differentiation dynamics to self-organization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101613">Membrane potential modulates ERK activity and cell proliferation in human cells</a></h4>

              
                Plasma membrane potential has been linked to cell proliferation for over 40 years in vertebrate cells. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated that membrane depolarization promotes mitosis and that this process depends on the voltage-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in human cells. Notably, ERK activity showed a clear dependence on the membrane potential, independent of growth factor stimulation. This voltage dependence was observed even near the resting membrane potential, indicating that small shifts in the resting potential can influence proliferative activity. Voltage-dependent ERK activity is derived from the altered dynamics of phosphatidylserine and is not mediated by calcium influx from the extracellular space. These findings suggest that fundamental biological processes such as cell proliferation are regulated by the physicochemical properties of membrane lipids. This study highlights the broader physiological roles of membrane potentials beyond action potentials, which are well-established in neural systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105537">Relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health as represented by cognitive abilities at the neural and genetic levels of analysis</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive abilities are closely tied to mental health from early childhood. This study explores how neurobiological units of analysis of cognitive abilities—multimodal neuroimaging and polygenic scores (PGS)—represent this connection. Using data from over 11,000 children (ages 9–10) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we applied multivariate models to predict cognitive abilities from mental health, neuroimaging, PGS, and environmental factors. Neuroimaging included 45 MRI-derived features (e.g. task/resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, diffusion imaging). Environmental factors encompassed socio-demographics (e.g. parental income/education), lifestyle (e.g. sleep, extracurricular activities), and developmental adverse events (e.g. parental use of alcohol/tobacco, pregnancy complications). Cognitive abilities were predicted by mental health (r = 0.36), neuroimaging (r = 0.54), PGS (r = 0.25), and environmental factors (r = 0.49). Commonality analyses showed that neuroimaging (66%) and PGS (21%) explained most of the cognitive–mental health link. Environmental factors accounted for 63% of the cognitive–mental health link, with neuroimaging and PGS explaining 58% and 21% of this environmental contribution, respectively. These patterns remained consistent over two years. Findings highlight the importance of neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities in understanding the cognitive–mental health connection and its overlap with environmental factors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99191">Elevated DNA damage without signs of aging in the short-sleeping Mexican cavefish</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulated sleep has widespread health consequences, including the accumulation of DNA damage. The Mexican tetra, <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i>, provides a powerful model to study the evolution and consequences of sleep loss. Multiple cave-adapted populations of this species have independently evolved reduced sleep compared to surface populations, yet show no obvious decline in healthspan or longevity. To examine whether evolved sleep loss is associated with DNA damage, we compared DNA damage response (DDR) and oxidative stress across populations. Cavefish exhibited elevated γH2AX in the brain and increased gut oxidative stress, consistent with chronic sleep deprivation. Following acute UV exposure, surface fish, but not cavefish, increased sleep and activated the photoreactivation repair pathway. Fibroblast cell lines derived from both populations confirmed diminished DDR and repair in cavefish, supporting an attenuated acute DNA damage response. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many genes differentially expressed with aging in surface fish remain unchanged in cavefish, suggesting altered regulation of aging-related pathways. Together, these findings indicate that cavefish experience elevated cellular hallmarks of sleep deprivation yet exhibit resilience to its long-term consequences, highlighting an evolutionary model to investigate the mechanisms underlying sleep, DNA repair, and healthy aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92120">Growth inhibitory factor/metallothionein-3 is a sulfane sulfur-binding protein</a></h4>

              
                Cysteine-bound sulfane sulfur atoms in proteins have received much attention as key factors in cellular redox homeostasis. However, the role of sulfane sulfur in zinc regulation has been underinvestigated. In this study, we identified growth inhibitory factor (GIF)/metallothionein-3 (MT-3) as a sulfane sulfur-binding protein from mouse brain. We also report here that cysteine-bound sulfane sulfur atoms serve as ligands to hold and release zinc ions in GIF/MT-3 with an unexpected C–S–S–Zn structure. Oxidation of such a zinc/persulfide cluster in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 results in the release of zinc ions, and intramolecular tetrasulfide bridges in apo-GIF/MT-3 efficiently undergo S–S bond cleavage by thioredoxin to regenerate Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3. Three-dimensional molecular modeling confirmed the critical role of the persulfide group in the thermostability and Zn-binding affinity of GIF/MT-3. The present discovery raises the fascinating possibility that the function of other Zn-binding proteins is controlled by sulfane sulfur.

                Trained immunity is reshaping our understanding of host defense by demonstrating that innate immune cells once thought to lack memory can be reprogrammed to mount heightened responses to subsequent challenges. Unlike tolerance, differentiation, or priming, trained immunity relies on epigenetic and metabolic rewiring of resident myeloid cells, particularly in mucosal barriers such as the skin, gut, and lungs, where these cells provide continuous protection against toxins and pathogens. Here, we review recent advances showing how an initial stimulus endows monocytes and macrophages with long-lasting functional changes that can be either protective or maladaptive upon re-exposure. We highlight therapeutic opportunities that harness trained immunity to boost vaccine efficacy and discuss strategies to modulate this program in cancer and hyper-inflammatory disorders. Finally, we propose new directions for enhancing or dampening trained immunity to promote human health.

">Context-specific configuration of orthogonal integrator dynamics for flexible foraging decisions</a></h4>

              
                The capacity to adapt behavior across different contexts is a fundamental feature of intelligence and is crucial for animal life, yet the mechanisms by which neural circuits are contextually reconfigured to alter their function are poorly understood. As a universal, ecological behavior, foraging provides a natural window into the neural basis of decision making and cognitive flexibility. We developed complementary free-moving and virtual tasks in which mice make foraging decisions and switch between context-specific decision strategies by toggling distinct configurations of integrator dynamics for evidence accumulation. Neural recordings reveal brain-wide activity states recruited by foraging environments which organize divergent dynamics subspaces and orthogonal coding of context-specific decision variables in separate neural subpopulations. In the dorsal frontal cortex, this coding structure is preserved across experimental settings, supports rapid dynamics reconfiguration for volitional mode switching, and is functionally necessary for decision flexibility.

                The timing of spikes dictates a neuron's impact on downstream circuits and behavior, and spike timing is determined by the membrane potential (Vm). However, due to technical challenges, it has been impossible to analyze the relative timing of Vm dynamics between neurons during behavior. Using large scale membrane voltage imaging, we simultaneously recorded Vm from many individual hippocampal neurons in animals engaged in a virtual spatial task. We found that relative phase of Vm theta oscillations across neurons exhibit gradual or discrete shifts depending on spatial position. This finding extends beyond previous studies showing Vm dynamics in single neurons or spiking activity in multiple neurons, revealing previously unknown evidence for consistent coding of space by spike-independent relative phase of Vm theta dynamics between neurons.

">Dysregulation of transcription networks regulating oligodendrogenesis in age-related decline in CNS remyelination</a></h4>

              
                In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), efficient remyelination is critical for functional recovery. Remyelination efficiency declines with age, and is linked to progressive disability. The gene regulatory network underlying remyelination, and how it is altered with aging, remains unclear. Here we present a comparative single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing analysis of remyelination in young and aged mice. We identified gene modules dynamically expressed throughout oligodendrocyte differentiation, revealing age-dependent changes in key processes related to myelination. Multi-omic analysis allowed us to map the regulatory network driving efficient remyelination within oligodendrocyte lineage cells in young mice. We highlight key transcription factors in the network dysregulated with age, and we describe similar dysregulations in MS lesions. Modifying the expression of these transcription factors in primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells impacts differentiation. These findings provide a foundational understanding of this regenerative process in the context of aging and in chronic demyelinating diseases.

">The Role of TCF7L2 in Regulating Energy Metabolism in Thalamocortical Circuitry and its Broader Impact on Social Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Psychiatric and metabolic disorders often co-occur. While shared genetic factors and cellular dysfunctions are implicated, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. TCF7L2, a risk gene for type 2 diabetes and autism spectrum disorder, is highly expressed in the thalamus a brain region extensively interconnected with the cortex, playing a key role in sensory processing, motor control, and behavioral regulation. Given its known role as a transcription factor regulating systemic energy metabolism, we explored its potential contribution to brain metabolism and behavior. To this end, we used a conditional knockout model with postnatal TCF7L2 loss in the thalamus and partial deficiency in the pancreas. Tcf7l2 knockout mice exhibited social deficits and reduced motor habituation. In parallel, they also developed systemic glucose intolerance, modelling the psychiatric-metabolic comorbidity. Thalamic depletion of TCF7L2 resulted in elevated inhibitory phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase an enzymatic gatekeeper for pyruvate utilization in energy production in the thalamus and cortex. This was accompanied by altered thalamic and cortical metabolism, characterized by reduced efficiency of pyruvate oxidation alongside enhanced oxidation of fatty acids and ketone bodies. Notably, a ketogenic diet alleviated metabolic dysregulation in the brain and normalized the approach to social novelty in knockout mice. These findings suggest that impaired energy metabolism in the thalamocortical circuitry may represent one of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric symptoms.

">A Context-Sensitive Neural Hierarchy for Evaluating Temporal Structure in Primate Vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain encodes temporal order in communication is central to explaining how complex interactions are perceived as coherent events. In humans, disrupting the sequence of words or scenes abolishes characteristic activity in higher-order networks, but whether similar mechanisms exist in nonhuman primates remains unknown. Here we used ultra-high-field fMRI (9.4 T) in awake marmosets to test how the marmoset brain evaluates temporal structure in natural conspecific vocalizations. Animals heard vocal sequences from three social contexts (angry, conversational, food-related) presented in intact, reversed, or randomized order, with call identity held constant. Disrupting sequence order altered responses across a distributed cortical-subcortical network. Contrast to reversed order, intact sequences drove stronger activation in prefrontal, cingulate, parietal, and somatosensory regions, whereas randomization produced the most widespread disruptions, additionally recruiting motor, insular, hippocampal, and thalamic territories. Uni- and multivariate analyses revealed a core network - including prefrontal area 8, cingulate areas 24/32, somatosensory cortex, and parietal Tpt - consistently sensitive to temporal coherence, with broader recruitment under severe disruption. Network-level dynamics further varied by context: conversation elicited earlier sensitivity to sequence disruptions, angry peaked later, and food built more gradually. These findings provide the first whole-brain evidence that marmosets engage hierarchically organized, context-sensitive networks to evaluate multi-agent vocal sequence structure, establishing a cross-species bridge to human narrative processing.

">Functional Genomic Profiling of Schizophrenia-Associated Genes Reveals Key Microglial Regulators</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are increasingly recognized as key regulators of neural circuit development and putative contributors to the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ). However, the functional impact of SCZ-associated genes in microglia remains largely unexplored. Here, we performed an arrayed CRISPR targeting screen of 30 schizophrenia-associated genes predicted to be differentially expressed in human microglia-like cells. Target genes were prioritized based on post-mortem transcriptomic relevance and predicted ontology-based roles in phagocytosis pathways. We quantified phagocytic activity and morphological changes following gene targeting using high-content confocal imaging. Key targets, including CYFIP1, MSR1, TREM2, SYK, ITGB2, ITGAM and IRF8, modulated phagocytosis and altered morphological properties consistent with activation states, validating their functional roles in microglia. To elucidate transcriptional impact, we further applied a multiplexed RNA sequencing platform across gene targets. These analyses revealed gene-specific transcriptional signatures, implicating divergent pathways related to phagocytic, activation, cytoskeletal, and lysosomal function. Together, these findings demonstrate the utility of CRISPR-based functional genomics in characterizing microglia function and identifying new target genes and mechanisms that may underlie their contributions to schizophrenia pathophysiology.

">The extracellular ATP/P2X7R signaling axis drives early neuroinflammation and neuronal hyperexcitability in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction are emerging as early and potentially causative events in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet their molecular triggers remain elusive. Here, we identify extracellular ATP (eATP), a major damage-associated molecular pattern, and its purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) as pivotal drivers of early pathology in AD mice. In vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed a significant cortical accumulation of eATP in AD mice as early as 2 months of age--before amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive impairment. This increase is associated with inflammasome activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, microglia reactivity, aberrant synaptic pruning and perineuronal net degradation. Strikingly, genetic deletion of P2X7R rescues these alterations. Two-photon calcium imaging further demonstrates that P2X7R knockout counteracts AD-related neuronal hyperactivity. These findings set the eATP-P2X7R signaling axis as an early driver of AD pathology, linking neuroinflammation to synaptic remodeling and circuit dysfunction, and suggest P2X7R inhibition as a compelling strategy to counteract AD progression.

">Dephosphorylation of YES kinase-mediated co-chaperone DNAJB6b phosphorylation attenuates tau protein aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual deterioration of memory. Here, we examine the biological consequences of phosphorylation-mediated chaperone activity in AD-associated tau aggregates. Increased phosphorylation of DNAJB6b at Y53 is observed in the brain lysates of AD patients. Our research found that an activated Src family kinase, YES, phosphorylates Y53 within the J-domain of DNAJB6b and enhances the binding between DNAJB6b and Hsp70. The strengthened association between DNAJB6b and Hsp70 may lead to the accumulation of tau aggregates. These findings suggest that the up-regulation of YES kinase modifies DNAJB6b, and that the resulting alteration of DNAJB6b-dependent tau disaggregation may contribute to an increased risk of developing AD. Additionally, phosphor-DNAJB6b at Y53 may serve as a biomarker for the prognosis and diagnosis of AD.

">Inherited retinal degenerations: PARP regulates calpain activation via TRPM2 channels in rd1 mouse photoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                Inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) refers to untreatable blinding diseases characterized by progressive photoreceptor loss. Photoreceptor degeneration is often associated with an excessive activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Ca2+-dependent calpain-type proteases. To explore the interplay between PARP and calpain activity, we employed organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from wild-type mice and from the rd1 mouse model for IRD. Retinae were treated with the PARP inhibitors INO1001 or Olaparib, the poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitor JA2131, or the transient receptor potential channel M2 (TRPM2) blocker 8-Br-ADPR. Readouts included the TUNEL assay to detect cell death, in situ activity assays for histone-deacetylases (HDAC), PARP, and calpain, as well as immunostaining for activated calpain-2, and poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR). PARP, PARG, and TRPM2 inhibition reduced calpain activity and calpain-2 activation. PARP activity was decreased by PARP and TRPM2 inhibitors but not by PARG inhibition. Remarkably, the PARP inhibitor INO1001 increased HDAC activity unlike any of the other compounds. When combined with the PARG inhibitor JA2131, INO1001 reduced photoreceptor cell death in a synergistic fashion, although such synergy was not observed for calpain or PARP activity. Moreover, synergistic photoreceptor preservation was not observed when JA2131 was combined with the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. Overall, these results indicate that in rd1 photoreceptors, PARP controls calpain activity via PARG and TRPM2-induced Ca2+ influx. We also characterize INO1001 as potentially more beneficial for IRD treatment than Olaparib. Our study details the complexity of PARP-signalling in photoreceptors and identifies PARG and TRPM2 as new targets for IRD therapy development.

">Traces of parenthood but not pregnancy loss in UK Biobank structural brain MRI data</a></h4>

              
                Pregnancy induces neuroanatomical changes in the human brain. Earlier studies detected traces of motherhood decades after childbirth. It is unclear whether these reflect persisting traces of pregnancy or effects of parenthood. We investigated effects of past birth and of pregnancy loss in women, and effects of fatherhood in men, using univariate and machine learning analyses on 205 regional brain volumes. A group of mothers and an age-matched sample of nulliparous women (N=4357 per group, mean age 63 years) from the UK Biobank, with no past pregnancy losses, showed significant volumetric group differences in 14 regions at Bonferroni-adjusted =.05. Likewise, we identified 18 significant group differences between age-matched samples of fathers and non-fathers of the same size (mean age 63.4), with 9 regions overlapping between sexes. Brain-wide association statistics for past live birth in mothers and those for fatherhood correlated (r = 0.55). XGBoost machine learning models trained to classify parenthood status separately in both datasets showed performance that was low, but significantly above chance (10-fold cross validation: AUC=0.56, p<1e-5 Motherhood classifier, AUC=0.54, p<1e-5, Fatherhood classifier, 10k permutations). We tested the motherhood classification model on an independent test sample comprising of four age-matched groups: 1. women who have never been pregnant, 2. women with past pregnancy loss but no live births, 3. women with live births but no pregnancy loss, and 4. women who experienced both. Class probability was significantly associated with live births, but not past loss. These findings may suggest that neuroanatomical patterns of past childbirth partly also reflect traces of parenthood and not solely persisting traces of past pregnancy, although a more detailed characterization of pregnancy loss data would be needed for full confirmation of this interpretation. Therefore, further research is needed to quantify the extent and understand the nature of these changes, particularly considering the known vulnerability for mental disorders associated with reproductive events.

                Synaptic pruning by glial cells is critical for refining neural circuits, yet which glial populations mediate this process in hypothalamic networks controlling energy balance remains poorly understood. Here, using 3D-ultrastructural analyses and molecular approaches, we show that tanycytes, specialized glial cells lining the third ventricle, actively engulf excitatory synapses in the mediobasal hypothalamus during a defined postnatal window. This phagocytic activity relies on tanycytic MFG-E8 and phosphatidylserine exposure on synaptic elements. Disruption of this pathway reduces synapse uptake in vitro and alters body weight control around weaning and glucose homeostasis in adulthood. These findings identify tanycytes as previously unrecognized glial mediators of synaptic pruning in hypothalamic circuits, establishing their active role in shaping neural networks underlying energy balance.

">Working Memory Selectively Modulates Subjective Perception: A Pilot Study</a></h4>

              
                This study aimed to investigate how working memory interacts with perception at the behavioral level. We examined whether working memory modulates subjective perception when the general capacity for perceptual processing is kept constant. This possibility is in part motivated by the neuropsychological phenomenon of blindsight, in which subjective perception and general perceptual capacity are dissociated. To test this, in this pilot study (n = 8), we manipulated the congruency between perceptual and working memory content and examined its effects on sensitivity in a Yes/No (Y/N) detection task. To match perceptual processing capacity across conditions, we titrated stimulus contrast in a two-interval forced choice (2-IFC) task. There was a trend that working memory selectively modulated subjective perception, as measured by detection sensitivity (d) in the Y/N task, even though processing capacity in the 2-IFC task was matched. Specifically, when the working memory content was categorically incongruent with the perceptual stimulus, Y/N sensitivity was selectively impaired. These preliminary findings suggest that working memory modulates subjective perception in ways that are less general than some other manipulations, such as visual masking, which generally impairs both objective and subjective aspects of perception. We hereby treat this preprint as a form of pre-registration, specifying our hypotheses, experimental designs, and analysis methods before examining whether the preliminary results will be confirmed in a larger sample.

                Affective empathy is defined as individual percept and respond to another emotion appropriately, an essential building block for human society. Historically, aberrant empathy was considered as major characteristics of autistic individuals but recently it has been challenged. It required mechanistic understanding of the empathy process, especially how autistic individual percept other emotion. By evaluating the social fear transfer response, we reported a critical role of Shank3 gene, one of the most replicated causative autism genes, in cortico-amygdala circuit in balancing and integrating affective empathy process using preclinical mouse models. We found that Shank3 knock-out mouse exhibited unexpected exaggerated affective responses, which was encoded by defective neural dynamics of Shank3-deficient cingulate projecting amygdala circuit. This work for the first time showcased an interplay between gene and affective empathy responses in mouse and laid the groundwork for modeling emapthy in autism and other neuropsychiatric disease.

">Exercise remodels hippocampal extracellular matrix to alleviate chondroitin-4-sulphate-induced memory impairment.</a></h4>

              
                Research utilising exercise therapeutically to enhance neuroplasticity mainly reports enhanced expression of neurotrophic (neural growth) factors which are associated with increased neurogenesis, structural changes, and improved memory. However, these neural changes are tightly regulated by both promotors and inhibitors of neuroplasticity, and the effect of exercise on inhibitory pathways is currently understudied. We show that exercise also modulates inhibitors of neuroplasticity. Six weeks of treadmill training reduced the gene expression of aggrecan, a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG), and altered the composition of CSPG containing structures, perineuronal nets, in the rodent hippocampus. Genetically manipulating chondroitin-4-sulphation of CSPGs by overexpressing hippocampal Chst11 impaired memory performance, which was mitigated by treadmill training. We provide evidence that hippocampal CSPGs are involved in object recognition memory, and that there is a link between exercise, modulating hippocampal inhibitors of neuroplasticity, and memory performance.

">MyeliMAP: Studying Oligodendrocyte Function in Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia of the central nervous system (CNS), essential for rapid signal propagation, metabolic support, and neuronal health. While rodent-based cultures and organoid systems have provided insights into oligodendrocyte biology, they fall short of capturing human-specific features of myelination or integrating structural and functional readouts. Here, we present MyeliMAP (Myelination MAPping), a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) -derived microphysiological and electrophysiological platform that enables robust modeling of CNS myelination. The system combines inducible hPSC-derived neurons and oligodendrocytes in a custom-engineered microfluidic microstructure designed to mimic the developing brain microenvironment, promoting spatially organized axon-glia interactions and controlled myelin sheath formation. Within six weeks, we demonstrate myelin formation and maturation by immunofluorescence and ultrastructural validation using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confirming compact multilayered wrapping of human axons. Importantly, the microstructure is directly integrated with a high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA), enabling real-time, long-term functional assessment of network activity and myelin-dependent changes in signal conduction. This allowed us to demonstrate that oligodendrocyte-based myelinated neurons display enhanced conduction velocity of action potentials compared to neuron monocultures. Moreover, the presence of oligodendrocytes stabilized the temporal neuronal network activity by reducing variability in firing patterns and enhancing synchrony across the culture. This dual structure-function approach surpasses static end-point analyses by coupling morphological validation with dynamic, quantitative measurements of maturing circuit physiology. MyeliMAP provides a reproducible, human-relevant platform to dissect neuron-glia interactions and accelerate discovery of remyelination-promoting strategies for CNS disease.

">Context-dependent benefits of training and reminders in visual skill learning</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies using a visual texture discrimination task (TDT) have demonstrated that performance enhancements resulting from extensive daily training (full training condition) remained intact after replacing all training, except for the first and last session, with a few daily reminder trials (reminder condition). Omitting reminders (control condition) yielded only limited learning, supporting their crucial contribution. We first confirmed these findings and excluded gaze position differences among conditions as a contributing factor. Next, we tested whether the reminders effectiveness is specific to a context of limited attention to the peripheral target caused by simultaneously performing a demanding fixation task. Removing the fixation task yielded performance levels in the first session matching those normally reached after lengthy daily training, suggesting that learning in the standard TDT involves the redeployment of attention. After changing texture parameters to increase the difficulty of the task, performing the TDT without a fixation task yielded learning in all three conditions. This indicates that in a dual-task, reminders can produce learning outcomes comparable to full training. In contrast, when the TDT is performed with full attention to the target, consolidation of the initial session alone can yield improvements equivalent to those observed in reminder and full training conditions.

">Predictive Networks Generate Motion-Induced Color Illusions</a></h4>

              
                Subjective color (SC) refers to chromatic perception induced by achromatic stimuli, as classically demonstrated using Benham's top. Despite nearly two centuries of investigation, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. We developed artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural videos using predictive learning to investigate SC generation. These models successfully reproduced artificial subjective color (ASC) despite the absence of explicit color information in the training stimuli. Critically, ASC characteristics were systematically influenced by the colors of moving objects in the training videos. Using progressively simplified stimuli, ranging from natural scenes to 3D computer graphics to 2D animations, we demonstrated that the colors of moving objects are the primary determinant of ASC properties. We propose that predictive learning establishes color associations with motion patterns, causing the arcs on Benham's top to be perceived as moving objects with their corresponding colors. These findings suggest that cortical predictive mechanisms may complement retinal processes in generating subjective color phenomena.

">Rho signaling promotes cell excitability and synaptic transmission</a></h4>

              
                Gq signaling through Trio RhoGEF and Phospholipase C effectors promotes neurotransmitter release at synapses. Whether activated Rho and Phospholipase C signaling acts through shared or independent pathways remains unclear. We use the egg-laying circuit of C. elegans, which is regulated positively by Gq signaling and negatively by Go signaling, to determine the role of Rho GTPase in G-protein regulation of neural circuit excitability. We previously showed that Trio signals in both the presynaptic Hermaphrodite-Specific command Neurons (HSNs) and the postsynaptic egg-laying vulval muscles they innervate to promote egg laying. Here we show that its effector Rho similarly signals both pre- and post-synaptically. Expression of constitutively active Rho-1(G14V) in either the HSNs or vulval muscles increased their Ca2+ activity and stimulated egg laying. Conversely, reducing Rho signaling in the HSNs via expression of Rho-1(T19N) or C3 transferase expression inhibited HSN Ca2+ activity and egg laying. Animals lacking Rho function in HSN still had vulval muscle Ca2+ activity that supported contraction and egg release, although this Ca2+ activity lacked the enhancement associated with HSN neurotransmitter release, suggesting it was largely driven by stretch-dependent feedback. Together, these results show that Rho signals in both the HSNs and vulval muscles to promote excitability and egg laying.

">Identification of gingipains in glioblastoma tumors and evidence that P. gingivalis infection drives IL-6 and PD-L1 expression in glioma cells</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor that accounts for approximately 60% of all gliomas and 48% of primary central nervous system malignancies, is incurable and poorly understood, with a median survival of only 15 months after diagnosis. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand GBM pathogenesis in order to develop an effective treatment. Recent research has revealed frequent Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the brains of patients with GBM, i.e., amyloid beta (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), indicating that GBM and AD may share some unknown environmental risk. Since chronic periodontitis (CP), and specifically Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a keystone bacterial pathogen in CP, have emerged as risk factors for both AD and GBM, we investigated whether P. gingivalis gingipain virulence factors could be identified in GBM tissue samples and whether P. gingivalis infection affects glioma cell behavior. Using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (70 GBM cores from 35 patients; 34 cerebral tissue cores from 17 patients), we quantified the presence of arginine-gingipain B (RgpB) and lysine-gingipain (Kgp) antigens. Both gingipains showed significantly elevated staining in GBM samples compared to controls (**p < .01, ****p < .0001, respectively), with Kgp levels notably higher than RgpB within GBM tissue (****p < .0001). In functional assays using U251 glioma cells, P. gingivalis infection induced robust, dose-dependent IL-6 secretion (peaking at MOI 5), increased PD-L1 expression by 30% (*p = .036), and significantly enhanced cell invasiveness (**p < .01) in a viability-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that P. gingivalis gingipains are present at elevated levels in GBM tissue and that P. gingivalis infection reprograms glioma cells to adopt an immunosuppressive, invasive phenotype through upregulation of the IL-6/PD-L1 axis, suggesting a potential microbial contribution to GBM pathogenesis and immune evasion.

">The retinal light response is modulated by an mGluR5-mediated retrograde signal from ON-bipolar cells to photoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                The ON visual pathway is initiated by the deactivation of mGluR6, coupled to the opening of TRPM1 channels in retinal ON-bipolar cell dendrites. Here, we show that a second metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, is localized with TRPM1 and mGluR6 in the dendrites of ON-bipolar cells. To examine the function of mGluR5, we performed electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and found that the amplitude of the b-wave, which is primarily a measure of ON-bipolar cell light-driven activity, is reduced in mGluR5 knock-out mice compared to wild type. In the mGluR5-/- retina, we observed weaker mGluR6 immunofluorescence in the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells that could explain the smaller ERG b-wave. To observe the effect of mGluR5 without perturbing mGluR6 expression, wild type mice were injected with MTEP, an allosteric antagonist of mGluR5. MTEP increased the amplitude of the b-wave in response to dim stimuli and caused an inflection in the intensity-response plot for flashes in the mesopic range. In the brain, postsynaptic mGluR5 regulates presynaptic glutamate release via endocanabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Therefore, we tested the effect of the CB1 receptor antagonist, SR1417A, on the ERG and found that the b-wave was affected as by MTEP, including an inflection in the intensity-response. We further showed that the CB1 receptor agonist, ACEA, reversed the effects of MTEP. Together, our results indicate that mGluR5 plays a role in gain-control at the photoreceptor to ON-bipolar cell synapses, likely via an endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde feedback.

">Contrast and pattern adaptation in visual cortex share a common gain control mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal populations in primary visual cortex adjust their responses to the statistical structure of the environment, including both stimulus contrast and the probability of occurrence of visual patterns. Here we show that, across a wide range of adaptation states, the distribution of population responses is well described by a zero-inflated log-normal model with three parameters: the probability of "silence" P0, the log-response mean , and its variance {sigma}2. Adaptation produces coordinated changes in P0 and , whereas {sigma}2 remains approximately invariant. These coordinated shifts collapse the family of response distributions onto a one-dimensional manifold, consistent with the existence of a common gain mechanism underlying both contrast and pattern adaptation. We further demonstrate that  obeys power-law relationships with stimulus contrast and with orientation probability, and that P0 varies linearly with . Finally, we show that these empirical relations arise naturally in a population of linear-nonlinear neurons driven by Gaussian inputs whose mean, but not variance, is modulated by the environment. Together, these results suggest that contrast and pattern adaptation rely on a shared mechanism that adjusts the mean input to cortical populations while preserving the overall structure of their response distribution.

                A central challenge in overcoming diseases resulting from defects in the cellular nanoscale multiprotein porosome complexes, is the consequent alteration of other proteins within the complex. By exploiting the distinct porosomes present in different tissues, Porosome Therapeutics, Inc., has developed a clinically relevant approach to incorporate (reconstitute) functional wild type porosomes into the plasma membrane of diseased cells to overcome secretory defects. In a combinatorial strategy of reprogramming the neuronal secretory and metabolic components, we established a dual-target therapeutic framework that repairs synaptic and metabolic defects to counteract neurodegeneration in Alzheimers. Utilizing iPSC derived human brain organoids, as recommended by the NIH and FDA, we demonstrate both the morphological and functional reversal of Alzheimers following porosome-apigenin treatment. Using the UHD-CMOS-MEA System developed jointly by Sony Semiconductor Solutions (Sony), SCREEN Holdings (SCREEN) and VitroVo, we were able to monitor thousands of neuronal firing in the brain organoids, helping in assessing the restoration of neuronal function in Alzheimers following porosome-apigenin therapy.

">Simultaneous stomach-brain electrophysiology reveals dynamic coupling in human sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sleep involves continuous communication between the brain and body, yet the dynamics of peripheral signals during human sleep remain poorly understood. Here we tested whether gastric electrophysiology exhibits infraslow structure and coordinated fluctuations with cortical rhythms indicative of sleep physiology. Simultaneous high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and electrogastrography (EGG) were recorded across sixty participants and three nights. Gastric power was consistently higher during NREM than REM sleep and declined across successive cycles, consistent with stage-dependent autonomic modulation of visceral activity. For the first time, we show that the gastric rhythm itself exhibits intrinsic infraslow amplitude modulations (~0.007 Hz), which are selectively amplified during NREM sleep and temporally aligned with infraslow fluctuations in cortical sigma power, strongest during N3 sleep. Event-locked analyses further revealed transient increases in gastric amplitude following cortical slow wave oscillations, particularly when accompanied by sleep spindles. Across nights, variance in gastric infraslow amplitude predicted subjective sleep quality beyond standard polysomnographic and cardiac measures. Together, these findings position the human stomach as a peripheral oscillator whose infraslow dynamics track thalamocortical activity during sleep and predict subjective sleep quality, extending the interoceptive regulatory loop into the sleeping brain.

">Decoding hidden goal-directed navigational states and their neuronal representations using a novel labyrinth paradigm and probabilistic modeling framework</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed navigation involves a sequence of planned actions aimed at achieving long-term goals through reinforcement, but detecting hidden states that support this process and their neuronal substrates remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we developed a complex labyrinth test that mimics naturalistic foraging and implemented a novel hierarchical probabilistic modeling framework, Cognitive Mapping of Planned Actions with State Spaces (CoMPASS). This framework infers a nested state structure, comprising short-term surveillance and ambulation states (Level 1) and long-term goal-oriented navigational states (Level 2). Using CoMPASS, we show that successful navigation in wild-type mice is marked by increased recruitment of both surveillance and goal-oriented states specifically at decision nodes, revealing how sequential behavioral decisions culminate in long-term goals. In contrast, the humanized AppSAA mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited navigational impairments marked by diminished surveillance during decisions, reduced goal-directed states, and increased navigation stochasticity. Importantly, we show that gamma oscillations in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region involved in spatial navigation planning, encode these CoMPASS behavioral states and their dynamic operating modes linking spatial locations to long-term goals. Our findings provide a novel paradigm for assessing hidden goal-directed navigational states and identify gamma oscillations in the PPC as their neural substrates.

">Infraslow histaminergic dynamics govern priming states to gate moment-to-moment memory accessibility</a></h4>

              
                Memory expression fluctuates even in response to identical cues, suggesting that ongoing brain states bias memory accessibility. However, the cellular and circuit principles governing these state-dependent fluctuations remain unclear. Here, we show that spontaneous pre-cue activity of histaminergic neurons in the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) modulates the expression of reward-associative memory in mice. TMN histaminergic activity exhibited infraslow dynamics (0.05-0.1 Hz) that closely tracked an integrated brain-body state. Closed-loop cue delivery during high histaminergic states enhanced memory expression. Brief optogenetic activation or inhibition of these neurons before the cue bidirectionally modulated memory expression, and direct activation of histaminergic terminals in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was sufficient to enhance memory expression. Furthermore, histaminergic inhibition before the cue impaired the cue-evoked BLA population response. Thus, ongoing histaminergic activity exerts an infraslow, state-setting influence that primes BLA circuits for robust cue responses, and in turn, modulates moment-to-moment memory accessibility.

">Comparative Evaluation of Assumption Lean Community Detection Methods for Human Connectome Networks</a></h4>

              
                Community detection provides a principled lens on mesoscale organization in functional brain networks, yet many widely used methods presume assortative structure and depend on arbitrary thresholding, which complicates the selection of the community count K. We conducted a systematic benchmark of three assumption lean approaches that operate directly on weighted functional connectivity matrices: the Weighted Stochastic Block Model, Spectral Clustering, and K-means. Performance was assessed on synthetic networks with known ground truth and on three neuroimaging cohorts spanning development, namely the Human Connectome Project, Washington University 120, and the Baby Connectome Project. We compared strategies for choosing K, including post hoc indices such as silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, C index, modularity, variation of information, Normalized Mutual Information, and zRand, together with a likelihood-based criterion for the Weighted Stochastic Block Model that uses bootstrap confidence intervals for differences in log likelihood between successive values of K. In simulations all methods recovered stable partitions, but the post hoc indices favored incorrect values of K under weak signal and nonassortative mixing. In adult datasets the indices do not yield a unique optimum, whereas the likelihood-based criterion selects a parsimonious range centered near K=11, which is consistent with established sensory and association systems. In infants and toddlers, the same procedure supports a larger K around 15 and reveals developmentally distinct mesoscale architecture, including anterior and posterior subdivisions within default mode and fronto parietal systems. A consensus relabeling scheme based on Hungarian matching with Hamming distance further stabilizes solutions across runs and across values of K. Overall, threshold free weighted methods mitigate assortative bias and the likelihood-based comparison provides a reproducible path to selecting K.

">The DNA methylation enzymatic machinery in substance use disorders: a systematic review</a></h4>

              
                Substance use disorders (SUD) are chronic affections defined by similar symptoms across a variety of psychoactive drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, opioids, or methamphetamine. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation represent key candidates to help explain the long-lasting effect of these drugs, as well as inter-individual variation in vulnerability. Here, we systematically reviewed current knowledge on the role of DNA methylation and the related enzymatic machinery in rodent models of SUD. Using a prospectively registered methodology, 99 articles were prioritized. A first set of studies manipulated the expression or activity of methylation or demethylation pathways. Depending on the brain region or drug considered, SUD-related behavioral and molecular manifestations were bidirectionally modulated, suggesting both pathogenic and protective roles for drug-induced methylomic plasticity. A second set of articles focused on candidate genes. Although significant heterogeneity across experimental models, brain regions or gene targets resulted in an absence of replicated findings, available data nevertheless support the notion that drugs of abuse trigger DNA methylation changes at discrete loci. Third, recent genome-wide studies have started to demonstrate that these drugs recruit widespread reprogramming. Strikingly, most adaptations occur outside promoter regions, highlighting an important challenge toward their functional interpretation. Finally, studies of drug exposure during gestation or adolescence suggest long-lasting consequences, with the potential for early intervention.

                <p>The progressive ratio (PR) schedule is a popular test of motivation. Despite its popularity, the PR task hinges on a low-dimensional behavioral readout&mdash;breakpoint or the maximum work requirement subjects are willing to complete before abandoning the task. Here, we show that with a simple modification, the PR task can be transformed into an optimization problem reminiscent of the patch-leaving foraging scenario, which has been analyzed extensively by behavioral ecologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. In the PR with reset (PRR) task, male and female rats performed the PR task on one lever but could press a second lever to reset the current ratio requirement back to its lowest value at the cost of enduring a reset delay, during which both levers were retracted. Rats used the reset lever adaptively on the PRR task, and their ratio reset decisions were sensitive to the cost of the reset delay. We derived an approach for computing the optimal bout length&mdash;the number of rewards to earn before pressing the reset lever that produces the greatest long-term rate of reward&mdash;and found that rats flexibly changed their behavior to approximate the optimal strategy. However, rats showed a systematic bias for bout lengths that exceeded the optimal length, an effect reminiscent of "overharvesting" in patch-leaving tasks. The PRR task thus represents a novel means of testing how rats adapt to the cost&ndash;benefit structure of the environment in a way that connects deeply to the broader literature on associative learning and optimal foraging theory.</p>

                <p>Imagine yourself in a car race waiting for the traffic light to go green. Impulsivity could push you to accelerate when the light is still red. In contrast, temporally guided anticipation could lead you to accelerate at the time the light goes green. Whether these two types of early responses rely on the same or different neural processes is an open question. This question was investigated using an oculomotor task where the delay between a warning and an imperative visual stimuli was predictable. The spatial uncertainty of the "go" signal was also varied. On average, 10% of experimental trials were associated with a response before the "go" signal ("early saccade"). After the offset of the warning stimulus, the latency distribution of early saccades was bimodal, with a first mode peaking after 200&nbsp;ms (1st mode saccades) and a second one starting to build-up after 375&nbsp;ms (2nd mode saccades). With increasing delay duration: the number of 1st mode responses decreased whereas the number of 2nd mode responses remained approximately constant; the latency and variance of 2nd mode saccades increased; the maximum velocity of 2nd mode responses decreased. In general, the amplitude of 2nd mode responses was larger. These results show that there are probably two independent processes taking place before an expected event: an unintentional release of inhibition evoking an impulsive 1st mode saccade and an anticipatory process leading to a 2nd mode saccade.</p>

                Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves summarising trends within a dataset to help uncover data quality issues and generate hypotheses. However, identifying relationships between multiple features often requires extensive coding, manual inspection and statistical modelling. Here, we introduce the ggEDA R package, which streamlines multidimensional data exploration by providing two turnkey and complementary visualisation strategies. ggEDA generates interactive parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) well suited for examining large datasets with mostly quantitative features, and introduces tiled one-dimensional plots that more effectively show missingness and reveal categorical relationships in smaller datasets. ggEDA reduces the amount of code and time required to detect multi-feature relationships that may otherwise require statistical modelling or thorough manual review to identify. To make ggEDA visualisations accessible to a wider audience we also developed interactiveEDA, a web app that enables non-programmers to explore and interpret data patterns interactively. ggEDA and interactiveEDA are available at https://github.com/CCICB/ggEDA and https://github.com/CCICB/interactiveEDA respectively.

                Background Antimicrobial drug resistance is of great concern today. Infections by the antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli, including enteropathogenic as well as enterotoxigenic strains have been reported as a major cause of deaths, especially among young children in low- and middle-income countries. This has been augmented by antimicrobial misuse, over the counter availability and poor sanitation especially in low income areas. This study aimed at characterizing antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli isolated from sanitation environments of the Majengo slum in Meru County, Kenya Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 61 samples from soil, water and drains swabs. These were tested against five antimicrobial drugs by the Kirby disk diffusion method. Results A total of 42 (69%) of the samples had Escherichia coli.These recorded antimicrobial drug susceptibility as follows: Out of the five antimicrobial agents used, ceftazidime 28 (66.67%) showed the highest sensitivity followed by ciprofloxacin 26 (61.90%) and imepenem 25 (59.52%) respectively. cefotaxime and cefoxitin showed least sensitivity at 14 (33.33%) and 13 (30.95%) respectively. In intermediate imepenem and ciprofloxacin were the highest with 12 (28.57%) followed by cefotaxime 10 (23.81%). The least intermediate was observed in ceftazidime and cefoxitin both at 7 (16.67%). The highest resistance was observed in cefoxitin 22 (52.38%), followed by cefotaxime at 18 (42.86%). Ciprofloxacin, imepenem and ceftazidime had the lowest resistance 4 (9.52%), 5 (11.91%) and 7 (16.67%) respectively. The p-value <0.05 was considered significant to the study. Conclusions This study showed that Escherichia coli isolated from Majengo is pathogenic and resistant to antibiotics. Detection of Escherichia coli poses a great risk in the spread of resistant strains in human. Proper sanitation and hygiene awareness practices should be provided through education to the residents of this area.

                Background Access to justice, enshrined as a fundamental human right in international conventions, includes the right to a fair trial and to just compensation. This dimension of justice is particularly crucial in contexts of armed conflict, where victims of military aggression require effective reparation mechanisms. Historically, both judicial and quasi-judicial bodies have been created to address mass claims, from restitution in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Kuwait to processes in post-authoritarian or post-communist states. Such mechanisms highlight the need for specialised institutions, as ordinary courts are often unable to manage the volume and complexity of conflict-related claims. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, reparations have become central to legal and political debate. Methods This study employed an empirical approach, combining systematic data collection with comparative legal analysis. Sources included UN and Council of Europe acts, reports by international organisations (CoE, OSCE), NGO publications, and scholarly works. Three compensation models were examined in depth: the UN Compensation Commission, Kosovo property claims mechanisms, and Bosnia’s Commission for Real Property Claims. These were selected for their effectiveness, European relevance, and addressed harms. Comparative analysis evaluated their procedures, accessibility, and recognition of harm, contrasted with Ukraine’s emerging compensation mechanism. Results The study highlights lessons from the UNCC, Kosovo, and Bosnia, focusing on mandates, procedures, accessibility, and types of harm recognised. It identifies best practices and challenges, offering comparative insights for designing Ukraine’s future compensation system. Conclusions International commissions share key features: defined jurisdiction, politically sensitive and lengthy processes, and reliance on transparent procedures to ensure legitimacy. For Ukraine, enabling direct individual claims is essential to uphold the right to reparation. Yet enforcement challenges and risks of duplicative proceedings remain. Adapting global experience to Ukraine’s context is crucial for developing an effective and trusted compensation mechanism.

                Background HER2-positive breast carcinomas are a heterogeneous group with various clinicopathological characteristics depending on hormone receptor (HR) status. This study aimed to analyze and compare the clinical and histopathological features of HER2-positive breast carcinomas across three subgroups: Group 1: Triple-positive (ER+/PR+/HER2+), Group 2:ER-positive only (ER+/PR-/HER2+), and Group 3: HER2-enriched (ER-/PR-/HER2+). Methods This was a single-institution, retrospective, cross-sectional study conducted over 42 months (January 2021–June 2024) at a tertiary care center comprising of 117 HER2-positive breast carcinoma cases. The demographic, clinical, and histopathological parameters were studied retrospectively. Statistical analysis was performed via SPSS Version 29.0, employing ANOVA and chi-square tests, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results Among 117 HER2-positive breast cancer patients, left and right breast involvement was nearly equal. Most were diagnosed via core biopsy (83.8%), with the upper outer quadrant most commonly affected (42.9%). Invasive breast carcinoma of no special type was the predominant subtype. The HER2-enriched group (Group 3) had the highest mean age (57.28 years; p = 0.001) and the most Grade 3 tumors (36.1%; p = 0.005). Although Group 2 (ER-positive) had the largest mean tumor size (4.31 cm), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.143). Lymphovascular invasion, necrosis, Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and skin involvement showed no significant differences across groups. ANOVA showed significant variation in age and grade, and post-hoc analysis confirmed that Group 1 vs Group 3 differed significantly in both age (p = 0.001) and grade (p = 0.004). Conclusion HER2-positive breast carcinomas show variability by HR status. The HER2-enriched subtype is associated with older age, higher histological grade, and advanced nodal stage, suggesting a more aggressive phenotype. Recognizing these patterns aids in accurate prognostication and guiding individualized therapy.

                <p>by Sankarasubramanian Jagadesan, Chittibabu Guda</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized biological research by enabling a through exploration of cellular heterogeneity. However, the complexity of data processing pipelines and the need for programming expertise create barriers for many biologists to explore scRNA-seq data. To address this, we developed Single-cell RNA Data Analysis and Visualization (ScRDAVis), an interactive, browser-based R Shiny application tailored for biologists with no programming expertise. ScRDAVis integrates widely used analysis packages, such as <i>Seurat</i>, <i>CellChat</i>, <i>Monocle3</i>, <i>clusterProfiler</i> and <i>hdWGCNA</i> to provide a user-friendly interface for single-cell data analysis. The application supports single-sample, multiple-sample and group-based analyses, along with features such as marker discovery, cell type annotation, subclustering analysis, and advanced functional studies. Key functionalities include cell-cell communication analysis, trajectory and pseudotime inference, pathway enrichment analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and transcription factor (TF) regulatory network analysis. ScRDAVis stands out as the first GUI-based platform offering hdWGCNA for co-expression network and TF regulatory network analysis using scRNA-seq data. ScRDAVis provides publication-ready visualizations with data download options in different formats empowering researchers to extract meaningful biological insights and democratizing the analytical capabilities required to comprehensively analyze scRNA-seq studies. ScRDAVis can be freely downloaded from GitHub at https://github.com/GudaLab/ScRDAVis or accessed from any browser at https://www.gudalab-rtools.net/ScRDAVis.

                <p>by Tianjiao Zhang, Haibin Zhu</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) deciphers cell type-specific co-expression networks to resolve biological functions but remains constrained by data sparsity and compositional biases. Conventional metacells construction strategies mitigate sparsity by aggregating transcriptionally similar cells but often neglect systematic biases introduced by compositional data. This problem leads to spurious co-expression correlations and obscuring biologically meaningful interactions. Through mathematical modeling and simulations, we demonstrate that uncontrolled library size variance in traditional metacells inflates false-positive correlations and distorts co-expression networks. Here, we present LSMetacell (Library Size-stabilized Metacells), a computational framework that explicitly stabilizes library sizes across metacells to reduce compositional noise while preserving cellular heterogeneity. LSMetacell addresses this by stabilizing library sizes during metacells aggregation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of downstream analyses such as Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Applied to a postmortem Alzheimer’s disease brain scRNA-seq dataset, LSMetacell revealed robust, cell type-specific co-expression modules enriched for disease-relevant pathways, outperforming the conventional metacells approach. Our work establishes a principled strategy for resolving compositional biases in scRNA-seq data, advancing the reliability of co-expression network inference in studying complex biological systems. This framework provides a generalizable solution for improving transcriptional analyses in single-cell studies.

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have enabled multi-modal systems to model and translate diverse information spaces. Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal Deep Learning model for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data, rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates good performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute the most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.

                <p>by Pantelis Vafidis, Antonio Rangel</p>

Animals learn to predict external contingencies from experience through a process of conditioning. A natural mechanism for conditioning is stimulus substitution, whereby the neuronal response to the CS becomes increasingly identical to that of the US. We propose a recurrent neural network model of stimulus substitution which leverages two forms of inductive bias pervasive in the cortex: representational inductive bias in the form of mixed stimulus representations, and architectural inductive bias in the form of two-compartment pyramidal neurons that have been shown to serve as a fundamental unit of cortical associative learning. The properties of these neurons allow for a biologically plausible learning rule that implements stimulus substitution, utilizing only information available locally at the synapses. We show that the model generates a wide array of conditioning phenomena, and can learn large numbers of associations with an amount of training commensurate with animal experiments, without relying on parameter fine-tuning for each individual experimental task. In contrast, we show that commonly used Hebbian rules fail to learn generic stimulus-stimulus associations with mixed selectivity, and require task-specific parameter fine-tuning. Our framework highlights the importance of multi-compartment neuronal processing in the cortex, and showcases how it might confer cortical animals the evolutionary edge.

Benchmarking, which involves collecting reference datasets and demonstrating method performance, is a requirement for the development of new computational tools, but also becomes a domain of its own to achieve neutral comparisons of methods. Although a lot has been written about how to design and conduct benchmark studies, this Perspective sheds light on a wish list for a computational platform to orchestrate benchmark studies. We discuss various ideas for organizing reproducible software environments, formally defining benchmarks, orchestrating standardized workflows, and how they interface with computing infrastructure.

                <p>by Thomas F. Varley, Pedro A. M. Mediano, Alice Patania, Josh Bongard</p>

The study of irreducible higher-order interactions has become a core topic of study in complex systems, as they provide a formal scaffold around which to build a quantitative understanding of emergence and emergent properties. Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel - with limited interdisciplinary cross-talk between them. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the goal of assessing the similarities, and differences, between how the frameworks define “higher-order structures.” We begin with toy examples with known topologies (spheres, toroids, planes, and knots), before turning to more complex, naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in an embedded point cloud: shapes such as spheres and hollow toroids are synergy-dominated, regardless of how the data is rotated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods.

                <p>by Mousumi Roy, Hannah E. Clapham, Swapnil Mishra</p>

Human mobility plays a critical role in the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, influencing both their spread and the effectiveness of control measures. In the process of quantifying the real-time situation of an epidemic, the instantaneous reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> appears to be one of the useful metrics widely used by public health researchers, officials, and policy makers. Since individuals can contract infections both within their region of origin and in other regions they visit, ignoring human mobility in the estimation process overlooks its impact on transmission dynamics and can lead to biased estimates of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, potentially misrepresenting the true epidemic situation. Our study explicitly integrates human mobility into a renewal-equation based disease transmission model to capture the mobility-driven effect on transmission. By incorporating pathogen-specific generation-time distribution, observational delay, the framework is epidemiologically informed and flexible to a wide range of diseases. We primarily validate the approach using simulated data, and demonstrate the limitations of estimating <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> without considering mobility. We then apply it to two real-world mobility settings using SARS-CoV-2 mortality data: the regions of England and the LTLAs of North East region of England, and uncover the mobility driven effect on transmission at different spatial resolutions. This framework uses non-identifiable and widely accessible publicly available datasets, demonstrating its practical applicability and supporting better-informed and more targeted public health measures.

                <p>by Young-Hwan Jo</p>

The liver communicates with the brain by transmitting interoceptive signals, including nutrients, hormones, and cytokines, potentially via the liver-innervating vagal sensory neurons. This communication is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and emotional stability.

Interoceptive signals from visceral organs, such as heart, lungs and gut, are known to influence many aspects of organismal physiology and behavior. This Perspective argues that liver signaling via the vagal nerve is another avenue of body-brain communication that shapes metabolism and mood.

Interoception may be a key mechanism in “Whole Person Health.” More and better technologies, tools, and mechanistic research are needed to fully understand its role, as well as new interventions to promote healthy physiological self-regulation through interoceptive signals.

Decoding the body’s internal signals could revolutionize Whole Person Health. This Perspective suggests a research framework linking brain, body and behavior to foster resilience, self-regulation and holistic well-being.

                <p>by Guanhua Sun, Tomoyuki Mano, Shoi Shi, Alvin Li, Koji L Ode, Alex Rosi-Andersen, Erica Pedron, Steven A. Brown, Hiroki R Ueda, Konstantinos Kompotis, Daniel B. Forger</p>

The mouse brain’s activity changes drastically over a day despite being generated from the same neurons and physical connectivity. To better understand this, we develop an experimental-computational pipeline to determine which neurons and networks are most active at different times of the day. We genetically mark active neurons of freely behaving mice at four times of the day with a c-Fos activity-dependent TRAP2 system. Neurons are imaged and digitized in 3D, and their molecular properties are inferred from the latest brain spatial transcriptomic dataset. We then develop a new computational method to analyze the network formed by the identified active neurons. Applying this pipeline, we observe region and layer-specific activation of neurons in the cortex, especially activation of layer five neurons at the end of the dark (wake) period. We also observe a shift in the balance of excitatory (glutamatergic) neurons versus inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons across the whole brain, especially in the thalamus. Moreover, as the dark (wake) period progresses, the network formed by the active neurons becomes less modular, and the hubs switch from subcortical regions, such as the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, to cortical regions in the default mode network. Taken together, we present a pipeline to understand which neurons and networks may be most activated in the mouse brain during an experimental protocol, and use this pipeline to understand how brain activity changes over the course of a day.

                Background Comparing non-randomized groups, such as COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated, even in the presence of seemingly relevant control variables, is challenging, but in this study, using English data, I show an achievable approach. Methods First, I estimated age-standardized all-cause mortality among vaccinated and unvaccinated ten years and older, covering 26 months from Apr 21 to May 23. Then, I estimated mortality not involving COVID-19, and finally, I contrasted the calculations. Results First, I found that all-cause mortality among unvaccinated was higher than among vaccinated. But, as the pattern was similar concerning mortality not involving COVID-19, the discrepancy can be attributed mainly to unvaccinated having inferior health at the outset. There were nonetheless indications of significant protection for vaccinated between July 21 and Jan 22. In the absence of control variables as a means to compare non-randomized groups, I reached that conclusion by contrasting all-cause mortality with mortality not involving COVID-19. However, while mortality not involving COVID-19 decreased among unvaccinated compared to the first observation month, it remained high among vaccinated, indicating a relative increase. Conclusions An interpretation is that vaccination, despite a potential temporary protection, has increased mortality. Strengthening the interpretation was relatively high mortality among vaccinated not involving COVID-19 counterintuitively following periods of excess mortality. Further strengthening the interpretation was the relatively high mortality not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated, corresponding with excess mortality during much of the same period. Future research should include data over a longer period than those available for this study. Also, future research should examine different age groups, vaccination types, and the number of doses given.

                Background Recently, the dynamics of gender and entrepreneurship have received more attention; however, the subtleties of how gender affects entrepreneurial intentions remain a challenge, despite empowerment through skills and formal training. This study seeks to establish gender differences in entrepreneurial intentions in educational settings as well as the broader context of gender equity in achieving financial independence among finalist undergraduate students. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of gender-related factors that influence entrepreneurial intentions among undergraduate students. Methodology This was a cross-sectional and quantitative study. The study site was the town campus of Mbarara University of Science and Technology. The study population consisted of finalist businesses and students. The data were managed and analyzed using STATA version 17. T-tests of independent samples and means were used for data analysis. Results Of the 404 respondents, the majority were males (56.2%). Entrepreneurial Intentions were higher among females with a history of business ownership (M = 22.7, SD = 5.1) than among those without a history of business ownership (M = 19.5, SD = 6.9), at t = 2.25, p <0.05. Further, entrepreneurial intentions were lower among male students whose male caretakers or parents had business as an occupation (M = 19.5, SD = 6.9) than their counterparts whose male parents were not in business (M = 21.5, SD = 5.6) at t = 2.31, p <0.05. No other gender differences were found across other socio-demographic variables (p <0.05). Conclusion Entrepreneurial Intentions differed among females with a history of business ownership. We argue that the complex interplay of gender demographic gaps in shaping undergraduate students’ entrepreneurial aspirations cannot be significantly improved based on family background without conclusive equal opportunity training approaches. Designing a hands-on and role-modeling entrepreneurship curriculum can shape gender-mainstream intentions.

                Background Mexico’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda requires reliable forecasts of sustainability performance. Anticipating trends can help target interventions and allocate resources effectively. Methods An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained on historical national time-series data to forecast three composite indicators through 2030: the Sustainable Development Index (SDI), the UN Sustainable Development Goals Index (ISDG), and the Economic Complexity Index (ECI). The model jointly learned patterns across indices to capture interdependencies relevant to sustainability outcomes. Results The ANN indicates interconnected dynamics among sustainability dimensions and suggests that measurable progress toward the SDGs by 2030 will depend on targeted policy effort in three domains: (1) education outcomes, (2) economic diversification that moves production toward higher-complexity activities, and (3) environmental strategies that mitigate ecological pressures. Forecasts underscore that gains in one area can reinforce others, but also that uneven advances may constrain aggregate progress. Conclusions Despite constraints—including a relatively short training series and omission of potentially important exogenous variables—the ANN provides a useful decision-support tool for refining sustainability policy. Future research should incorporate additional drivers (e.g., socio-economic, environmental, and governance covariates) and optimize ANN parameters to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability, helping ensure Mexico remains on track to meet its SDG commitments by 2030.

                Background Globally, 10–20% of adolescents face mental health disorders, with 14% affected in South Africa. Despite existing policies and school-based frameworks, significant gaps remain in implementation, particularly in awareness and early intervention. Schools offer a platform for mental health promotion, yet few well-documented, adolescent-focused awareness programs exist. This scoping review aimed to map available scientific evidence on mental health awareness promotion programs targeting adolescents in South Africa. Methodology The scoping review followed Arksey and O’Malley’s framework, and a systematic search was conducted in Sabinet, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Wiley Online Library, covering English-language studies published between January 2020 and January 2025. A total of 4881 records were identified, including 20 from manual searches, with 39 articles meeting the inclusion criteria for final synthesis. The study was registered on prospero: CRD420251174673 Results Study findings discovered several programs in South Africa to enhance mental health awareness among adolescents. The Integrated School Health Policy was implemented across all nine provinces which provides comprehensive school health and psychosocial support through collaboration among various stakeholders. The Early Adolescent Skills for Emotions program which targets 10-15 with internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression was implemented in 4 Cape Town schools. In Khayelitsha, the Health Action in Schools for Thriving Adolescent Generation program was implemented to support learners aged 11-15 by fostering thriving school environments and peer support. Despite these efforts, challenges including inconsistent attendance, logistical barriers, insufficient resources, concerns about sustainability, and inadequate school capacity addressing critical learner vulnerabilities were identified. Resulting in the high prevalence of anxiety and depression. Conclusion The review highlights a clear gap in the implementation and evaluation of structured mental health awareness programs for adolescents in South Africa. Strengthening school-based mental health initiatives, training educators, and addressing systemic barriers are essential steps toward improving adolescent mental health outcomes and closing the existing treatment gap.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1243/v1?src=rss">Decentralisation in Action: Understanding Organisational Culture and Employee Performance in Local Governments – A Multicontext Review for Advancing Sustainable Development Goal 16 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In this narrative review, we examine the role of organisational culture in shaping employee performance within local governments, addressing a critical gap in synthesised evidence connecting cultural elements to practical performance outcomes across diverse contexts. We focus on how leadership practices, change management, performance management, communication patterns, and employee engagement, within an organisational culture framework, collectively influence institutional capacity and foster inclusive, transparent, and accountable governance aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 16. Anchored in Schein’s Organisational Culture Theory, we conducted a narrative review of peer-reviewed articles, government reports, and case studies published between 2015 and 2025. We searched multidisciplinary databases including Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to select high-quality studies relevant to organisational culture and performance in local government contexts. Data were analysed thematically to identify patterns and relationships among the key variables influencing performance outcomes. Our findings show that ethical and participatory leadership cultivates trust and alignment with institutional objectives, adaptive change management promotes responsiveness to technological and policy reforms, and data-driven performance management strengthens goal attainment and continuous improvement. We also found that inclusive communication patterns foster transparency and collaboration, while meaningful employee engagement drives motivation, equity, and professional growth. By integrating these elements, we establish a clear link between cultural practices and tangible governance outcomes, offering actionable insights for policymakers, institutional leaders, and stakeholders seeking to enhance local government performance. We contribute to the body of knowledge by providing a consolidated evidence base that informs strategies to strengthen institutional culture, advance accountability, and promote inclusive, effective, and sustainable public service delivery, supporting both theoretical understanding and practical interventions in local government contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-83/v2?src=rss">Is rationality a cognitive faculty? [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Rationality in the standard (economics) sense cannot be a form of intelligence or any other cognitive faculty, such as memory, language, or mathematical skills. To establish this thesis, this paper uses a distinction from set theory, namely, the distinction between “binary relators” and “binary operators”. Rationality, in the standard sense, acts as a binary relator in the sense that it is an optimization method, whereas cognitive ability acts as a binary operator in the sense that it is a transformational function. Rationality as an optimization method (binary relator) does not differ from the neo-Darwinian notion of natural selection: either method seeks to find the best choice or fit trait given the constraints. A cognitive faculty as a transformational function (binary operator) simply translates inputs into outputs. The distinction between standard rationality and cognitive functions has wide-ranging implications for the theory of evolution.
