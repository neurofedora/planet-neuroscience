                <p>Operant chambers are widely used in animal research to study cognition, motivation, and learning processes. Paired with the rapidly developing technologies for brain imaging and manipulations of brain activity, operant conditioning chambers are a powerful tool for neuroscience research. The behavioral testing and imaging setups that are commercially available are often quite costly. Here, we present a custom-built operant chamber that can be constructed in a few days by an unexperienced user with relatively inexpensive, widely available materials. The advantages of our operant setup compared with other open-source and closed-source solutions are its relatively low cost, its support of complex behavioral tasks, its user-friendly setup, and its validated functionality with video imaging of behavior and calcium imaging using the UCLA Miniscope. Using this setup, we replicate our previously published findings showing that mice exposed to social defeat stress in adolescence have inhibitory control impairments in the Go/No-Go task when they reach adulthood. We also present calcium imaging data of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neuronal activity acquired during Go/No-Go testing in freely moving mice and show that neuronal population activity increases from day 1 to day 14 of the task. We propose that our operant chamber is a cheaper alternative to its commercially available counterparts and offers a better balance between versatility and user-friendly setup than other open-source alternatives.</p>

Antimicrobial resistance presents a significant health care crisis. The mutation F98Y in Staphylococcus aureus dihydrofolate reductase (SaDHFR) confers resistance to the clinically important antifolate trimethoprim (TMP). Propargyl-linked antifolates (PLAs), next generation DHFR inhibitors, are much more resilient than TMP against this F98Y variant, yet this F98Y substitution still reduces efficacy of these agents. Surprisingly, differences in the enantiomeric configuration at the stereogenic center of PLAs influence the isomeric state of the NADPH cofactor. To understand the molecular basis of F98Y-mediated resistance and how PLAs’ inhibition drives NADPH isomeric states, we used protein design algorithms in the osprey protein design software suite to analyze a comprehensive suite of structural, biophysical, biochemical, and computational data. Here, we present a model showing how F98Y SaDHFR exploits a different anomeric configuration of NADPH to evade certain PLAs’ inhibition, while other PLAs remain unaffected by this resistance mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Machine learning modeling of family wide enzyme-substrate specificity screens</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel Goldman, Ria Das, Kevin K. Yang, Connor W. Coley</p>

Biocatalysis is a promising approach to sustainably synthesize pharmaceuticals, complex natural products, and commodity chemicals at scale. However, the adoption of biocatalysis is limited by our ability to select enzymes that will catalyze their natural chemical transformation on non-natural substrates. While machine learning and <i>in silico</i> directed evolution are well-posed for this predictive modeling challenge, efforts to date have primarily aimed to increase activity against a single known substrate, rather than to identify enzymes capable of acting on new substrates of interest. To address this need, we curate 6 different high-quality enzyme family screens from the literature that each measure multiple enzymes against multiple substrates. We compare machine learning-based compound-protein interaction (CPI) modeling approaches from the literature used for predicting drug-target interactions. Surprisingly, comparing these interaction-based models against collections of independent (single task) enzyme-only or substrate-only models reveals that current CPI approaches are incapable of learning interactions between compounds and proteins in the current family level data regime. We further validate this observation by demonstrating that our no-interaction baseline can outperform CPI-based models from the literature used to guide the discovery of kinase inhibitors. Given the high performance of non-interaction based models, we introduce a new structure-based strategy for pooling residue representations across a protein sequence. Altogether, this work motivates a principled path forward in order to build and evaluate meaningful predictive models for biocatalysis and other drug discovery applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Homeostatic control of synaptic rewiring in recurrent networks induces the formation of stable memory engrams</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Júlia V. Gallinaro, Nebojša Gašparović, Stefan Rotter</p>

Brain networks store new memories using functional and structural synaptic plasticity. Memory formation is generally attributed to Hebbian plasticity, while homeostatic plasticity is thought to have an ancillary role in stabilizing network dynamics. Here we report that homeostatic plasticity alone can also lead to the formation of stable memories. We analyze this phenomenon using a new theory of network remodeling, combined with numerical simulations of recurrent spiking neural networks that exhibit structural plasticity based on firing rate homeostasis. These networks are able to store repeatedly presented patterns and recall them upon the presentation of incomplete cues. Storage is fast, governed by the homeostatic drift. In contrast, forgetting is slow, driven by a diffusion process. Joint stimulation of neurons induces the growth of associative connections between them, leading to the formation of memory engrams. These memories are stored in a distributed fashion throughout connectivity matrix, and individual synaptic connections have only a small influence. Although memory-specific connections are increased in number, the total number of inputs and outputs of neurons undergo only small changes during stimulation. We find that homeostatic structural plasticity induces a specific type of “silent memories”, different from conventional attractor states.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Slow nucleosome dynamics set the transcriptional speed limit and induce RNA polymerase II traffic jams and bursts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Robert C. Mines, Tomasz Lipniacki, Xiling Shen</p>

Nucleosomes are recognized as key regulators of transcription. However, the relationship between slow nucleosome unwrapping dynamics and bulk transcriptional properties has not been thoroughly explored. Here, an agent-based model that we call the dynamic defect Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ddTASEP) was constructed to investigate the effects of nucleosome-induced pausing on transcriptional dynamics. Pausing due to slow nucleosome dynamics induced RNAPII convoy formation, which would cooperatively prevent nucleosome rebinding leading to bursts of transcription. The mean first passage time (MFPT) and the variance of first passage time (VFPT) were analytically expressed in terms of the nucleosome rate constants, allowing for the direct quantification of the effects of nucleosome-induced pausing on pioneering polymerase dynamics. The mean first passage elongation rate <i>γ</i>(<i>h</i><sub>c</sub>, <i>h</i><sub>o</sub>) is inversely proportional to the MFPT and can be considered to be a new axis of the ddTASEP phase diagram, orthogonal to the classical <i>αβ</i>-plane (where <i>α</i> and <i>β</i> are the initiation and termination rates). Subsequently, we showed that, for <i>β</i> = 1, there is a novel jamming transition in the <i>αγ</i>-plane that separates the ddTASEP dynamics into initiation-limited and nucleosome pausing-limited regions. We propose analytical estimates for the RNAPII density <i>ρ</i>, average elongation rate <i>v</i>, and transcription flux <i>J</i> and verified them numerically. We demonstrate that the intra-burst RNAPII waiting times <i>t</i><sub>in</sub> follow the time-headway distribution of a max flux TASEP and that the average inter-burst interval tIBI¯ correlates with the index of dispersion <i>D</i><sub>e</sub>. In the limit <i>γ</i>→0, the average burst size reaches a maximum set by the closing rate <i>h</i><sub>c</sub>. When <i>α</i>≪1, the burst sizes are geometrically distributed, allowing large bursts even while the average burst size NB¯ is small. Last, preliminary results on the relative effects of static and dynamic defects are presented to show that dynamic defects can induce equal or greater pausing than static bottle necks.

Here, potential HLA class I epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were predicted for 2,915 human alleles of 71 families using the netMHCIpan EL algorithm. Allele families showed extreme epitopic differences, underscoring genetic variability of protective capacity between humans. Up to 1,222 epitopes were associated with any of the twelve supertypes, that is, allele clusters covering 90% population. Next, from all mutations identified in ~118,000 viral NCBI isolates, those causing significant epitope score reduction were considered epitope escape mutations. These mutations mainly involved non-conservative substitutions at the second and C-terminal position of the ligand core, or total ligand removal by large recurrent deletions. Escape mutations affected 47% of supertype epitopes, which in 21% of cases concerned isolates from two or more sub-continental areas. Some of these changes were coupled, but never surpassed 15% of evaded epitopes for the same supertype in the same isolate, except for B27. In contrast to most supertypes, eight allele families mostly contained alleles with few SARS-CoV-2 ligands. Isolates harboring cytotoxic escape mutations for these families co-existed geographically within sub-Saharan and Asian populations enriched in these alleles according to the Allele Frequency Net Database. Collectively, our findings indicate that escape mutation events have already occurred for half of HLA class I supertype epitopes. However, it is presently unlikely that, overall, it poses a threat to the global population. In contrast, single and double mutations for susceptible alleles may be associated with viral selective pressure and alarming local outbreaks. The integration of genomic, geographical and immunoinformatic information eases the surveillance of variants potentially affecting the global population, as well as minority subpopulations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hidden Markov Modeling with HMMTeacher</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Camilo Fuentes-Beals, Alejandro Valdés-Jiménez, Gonzalo Riadi</p>

Is it possible to learn and create a first Hidden Markov Model (HMM) without programming skills or understanding the algorithms in detail? In this concise tutorial, we present the HMM through the 2 general questions it was initially developed to answer and describe its elements. The HMM elements include variables, hidden and observed parameters, the vector of initial probabilities, and the transition and emission probability matrices. Then, we suggest a set of ordered steps, for modeling the variables and illustrate them with a simple exercise of modeling and predicting transmembrane segments in a protein sequence. Finally, we show how to interpret the results of the algorithms for this particular problem. To guide the process of information input and explicit solution of the basic HMM algorithms that answer the HMM questions posed, we developed an educational webserver called HMMTeacher. Additional solved HMM modeling exercises can be found in the user’s manual and answers to frequently asked questions. HMMTeacher is available at https://hmmteacher.mobilomics.org, mirrored at https://hmmteacher1.mobilomics.org. A repository with the code of the tool and the webpage is available at https://gitlab.com/kmilo.f/hmmteacher.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Combination and competition between path integration and landmark navigation in the estimation of heading direction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sevan K. Harootonian, Arne D. Ekstrom, Robert C. Wilson</p>

Successful navigation requires the ability to compute one’s location and heading from incoming multisensory information. Previous work has shown that this multisensory input comes in two forms: body-based idiothetic cues, from one’s own rotations and translations, and visual allothetic cues, from the environment (usually visual landmarks). However, exactly how these two streams of information are integrated is unclear, with some models suggesting the body-based idiothetic and visual allothetic cues are combined, while others suggest they compete. In this paper we investigated the integration of body-based idiothetic and visual allothetic cues in the computation of heading using virtual reality. In our experiment, participants performed a series of body turns of up to 360 degrees in the dark with only a brief flash (300ms) of visual feedback <i>en route</i>. Because the environment was virtual, we had full control over the visual feedback and were able to vary the offset between this feedback and the true heading angle. By measuring the effect of the feedback offset on the angle participants turned, we were able to determine the extent to which they incorporated visual feedback as a function of the offset error. By further modeling this behavior we were able to quantify the computations people used. While there were considerable individual differences in <i>performance</i> on our task, with some participants mostly ignoring the visual feedback and others relying on it almost entirely, our modeling results suggest that almost all participants used the same <i>strategy</i> in which idiothetic and allothetic cues are combined when the mismatch between them is small, but compete when the mismatch is large. These findings suggest that participants update their estimate of heading using a hybrid strategy that mixes the combination and competition of cues.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RFX transcription factors control a miR-150/PDAP1 axis that restrains the proliferation of human T cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michele Chirichella, Niccolò Bianchi, Emina Džafo, Elena Foli, Francesco Gualdrini, Amy Kenyon, Gioacchino Natoli, Silvia Monticelli</p>

Within the immune system, microRNAs (miRNAs) exert key regulatory functions. However, what are the mRNA targets regulated by miRNAs and how miRNAs are transcriptionally regulated themselves remain for the most part unknown. We found that in primary human memory T helper lymphocytes, miR-150 was the most abundantly expressed miRNA, and its expression decreased drastically upon activation, suggesting regulatory roles. Constitutive <i>MIR150</i> gene expression required the RFX family of transcription factors, and its activation-induced down-regulation was linked to their reduced expression. By performing miRNA pull-down and sequencing experiments, we identified PDGFA-associated protein 1 (PDAP1) as one main target of miR-150 in human T lymphocytes. PDAP1 acted as an RNA-binding protein (RBP), and its CRISPR/Cas-9–mediated deletion revealed that it prominently contributed to the regulation of T-cell proliferation. Overall, using an integrated approach involving quantitative analysis, unbiased genomics, and genome editing, we identified RFX factors, miR-150, and the PDAP1 RBP as the components of a regulatory axis that restrains proliferation of primary human T lymphocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dynamic assembly of the mRNA m6A methyltransferase complex is regulated by METTL3 phase separation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dasol Han, Andrew P. Longhini, Xuemei Zhang, Vivian Hoang, Maxwell Z. Wilson, Kenneth S. Kosik</p>

m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is the most abundant and reversible chemical modification on mRNA with approximately one-fourth of eukaryotic mRNAs harboring at least one m<sup>6</sup>A-modified base. The recruitment of the mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase writer complex to phase-separated nuclear speckles is likely to be crucial in its regulation; however, control over the activity of the complex remains unclear. Supported by our observation that a core catalytic subunit of the methyltransferase complex, METTL3, is endogenously colocalized within nuclear speckles as well as in noncolocalized puncta, we tracked the components of the complex with a Cry2-METTL3 fusion construct to disentangle key domains and interactions necessary for the phase separation of METTL3. METTL3 is capable of self-interaction and likely provides the multivalency to drive condensation. Condensates in cells necessarily contain myriad components, each with partition coefficients that establish an entropic barrier that can regulate entry into the condensate. In this regard, we found that, in contrast to the constitutive binding of METTL14 to METTL3 in both the diffuse and the dense phase, WTAP only interacts with METTL3 in dense phase and thereby distinguishes METTL3/METTL14 single complexes in the dilute phase from METTL3/METTL14 multicomponent condensates. Finally, control over METTL3/METTL14 condensation is determined by its small molecule cofactor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which regulates conformations of 2 gate loops, and some cancer-associated mutations near gate loops can impair METTL3 condensation. Therefore, the link between SAM binding and the control of writer complex phase state suggests that the regulation of its phase state is a potentially critical facet of its functional regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Four concurrent feedforward and feedback networks with different roles in the visual cortical hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elham Barzegaran, Gijs Plomp</p>

Visual stimuli evoke fast-evolving activity patterns that are distributed across multiple cortical areas. These areas are hierarchically structured, as indicated by their anatomical projections, but how large-scale feedforward and feedback streams are functionally organized in this system remains an important missing clue to understanding cortical processing. By analyzing visual evoked responses in laminar recordings from 6 cortical areas in awake mice, we uncovered a dominant feedforward network with scale-free interactions in the time domain. In addition, we established the simultaneous presence of a gamma band feedforward and 2 low frequency feedback networks, each with a distinct laminar functional connectivity profile, frequency spectrum, temporal dynamics, and functional hierarchy. We could identify distinct roles for each of these 4 processing streams, by leveraging stimulus contrast effects, analyzing receptive field (RF) convergency along functional interactions, and determining relationships to spiking activity. Our results support a dynamic dual counterstream view of hierarchical processing and provide new insight into how separate functional streams can simultaneously and dynamically support visual processes.

Kucharski, on behalf of the CMMID COVID-19 working group and the SpaceX COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative </p>

Identifying the potential for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection is crucial for understanding possible long-term epidemic dynamics. We analysed longitudinal PCR and serological testing data from a prospective cohort of 4,411 United States employees in 4 states between April 2020 and February 2021. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression investigating the association between baseline serological status and subsequent PCR test result in order to calculate an odds ratio for reinfection. We estimated an odds ratio for reinfection ranging from 0.14 (95% CI: 0.019 to 0.63) to 0.28 (95% CI: 0.05 to 1.1), implying that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline is associated with around 72% to 86% reduced odds of a subsequent PCR positive test based on our point estimates. This suggests that primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides protection against reinfection in the majority of individuals, at least over a 6-month time period. We also highlight 2 major sources of bias and uncertainty to be considered when estimating the relative risk of reinfection, confounders, and the choice of baseline time point and show how to account for both in reinfection analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perceived stress, sources of stress and coping strategies among undergraduate medical students of Nepal: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Medical students are subjected to various stressors throughout their training, which has a considerable impact on their physical and mental health. Some students have positive ways of coping, while others take to maladaptive coping measures. This study aims to assess severity, sources of stress, and coping strategies among medical students of a non-Western low-income country from South Asia. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was carried out. Demographic variables were collected and stress level was assessed using PSS 14 (Perceived Stress Scale 14). The sources of stress were assessed using MSSQ (Medical Student Stressor Questionnaire) and coping strategies were evaluated using the Brief-Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced 28. Results: The response rate was 95%. The mean PSS score was 27.85. Overall, 55% of students were stressed (male 52%, female 60%), the difference among gender was not significant. Basic science students perceived higher levels of stress than clinical clerkship students. Academic related stressors caused higher stress, whereas other variables caused moderate stress. The major stressors were examinations, inadequate time to study, poor marks, extensive amount of learning content, and the need to performing well in the exam. The five most common coping strategies used were active coping, acceptance, planning, self-distraction, and instrumental support. The least common coping mechanism was substance use. All MSSQ domains positively correlated with the total PSS score. Students with higher PSS scores were likely to use behavioral disengagement, venting, and self-blame as the primary coping strategies. Conclusions: Stress level among the medical students is high and mainly in relation to academia. Inadequate guidance from teachers contributed significantly. Stressed students were likely to use maladaptive coping strategies. Strategies to enhance teacher-student communication and adaptive coping measures should be implemented. Further studies should be done to evaluate the effects of stress on the academic outcomes of students.

                Background: The NEFH-tTA mouse has the human neurofilament heavy polypeptide promoter directing tetracycline-controlled transactivator protein (tTa) expression to the brain and spinal cord, allowing tissue-specific and doxycycline-suppressible expression of a target gene. Current genotyping protocols can only differentiate between wild-type and transgenic animals. Being able to differentiate between hemizygous and homozygous animals would be beneficial in experiment planning and reducing animal numbers. Methods: We have identified the insertion site of the NEFH-tTA transgene via targeted locus amplification and next-generation sequencing. This was then used to design a multiplex PCR assay to distinguish between hemizygous and homozygous mice. Results: The NEFH-tTA transgene is located on chromosome 12. Our genotyping method can identify hemizygous and homozygous mice. Conclusions: The NEFH-tTA transgenic mouse line is a useful tool for studying a wide range of diseases including frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease, as well as other neurodevelopmental, neuromuscular or neurodegenerative disorders. We have designed and utilised a novel genotyping assay to distinguish between hemizygous and homozygous mice, involving a simple PCR assay. This is easily adaptable to a laboratory-specific protocol or machine, and will allow refinement of breeding strategies and a reduction in the number of animals that cannot be used in experiments.

                Introduction: The Clinical Presentation (CP) curriculum was first formulated in 1990 at the University of Calgary, Canada. Since then, it has been adopted at various medical schools, including Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS), a state-funded medical school in a low-income country (LIC), Nepal. This study aims to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of the CP curriculum by students and faculty at PAHS, and test knowledge retention through a surprise non-routine exam administered to students.  Method: This is a cross-sectional study to evaluate the efficacy of the CP curriculum in teaching clinical medicine to the first batch of MBBS students of PAHS School of Medicine. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC)-PAHS (Ref no std1505911069). Perceived effectiveness was evaluated using a set of questionnaires for faculty and students. A total of 33 students and 34 faculty filled the perception questionnaires. Subsequently, a questionnaire consisting of 50 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from different clinical medicine disciplines was administered to test students’ knowledge retention. Out of 49 students, 38 participated in the surprise non-routine exam.   Result: A significantly higher number of faculty preferred the CP curriculum compared to the traditional system of teaching clinical medicine (16 vs 11, Kruskal Wallis: 0.023, ie. P-value < 0.05). A significantly higher number of the students liked and recommended CP curriculum in the clinical year of medical education (20 vs. 13 with p-value < 0.05). In the non-routine surprise exam, two thirds of the students scored 60% or above.  Conclusion: Both faculty and students perceive that the CP curriculum system is an effective teaching and learning method in medical education, irrespective of their different demographic and positional characteristics. The students’ overall performance was good in surprise, non-routine exams taken without scheduling or reminders.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Local cholesterol metabolism orchestrates remyelination</a></h4>

              
                Cholesterol is an essential component of all cell membranes and particularly enriched in myelin membranes. Myelin membranes are a major target of immune attacks in the chronic neurological disorder multiple sclerosis (MS). During demyelinating insults, cholesterol is released from damaged myelin, increasing local levels of this unique lipid and impeding tissue regeneration. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of cholesterol-dependent processes during demyelination and remyelination, emphasizing cell type-specific responses.

                Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is the most common genetic form of gingival fibromatosis which is featured as a localized or generalized overgrowth of gingivae. Currently two genes (<i>SOS1</i> and <i>REST</i>), as well as four loci (2p22.1, 2p23.3-p22.3, 5q13-q22, and 11p15), have been identified as associated with HGF in a dominant inheritance pattern. Here we report thirteen individuals with autosomal-dominant HGF from a four-generation Chinese family. Whole-exome sequencing followed by further genetic co-segregation analysis was performed for the family members across three generations. A novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.2812G&gt;A) in zinc finger protein 862 gene (<i>ZNF862</i>) was identified, and it is absent among the population as per the Genome Aggregation Database. The functional study supports a biological role of <i>ZNF862</i> for increasing the profibrotic factors particularly COL1A1 synthesis and hence resulting in HGF. Here for the first time we identify the physiological role of <i>ZNF862</i> for the association with the HGF.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A unifying mechanism governing inter-brain neural relationship during social interactions</a></h4>

              
                A key goal of social neuroscience is to understand the inter-brain neural relationship - the relationship between the neural activity of socially interacting individuals. Decades of research investigating this relationship have focused on the similarity in neural activity across brains. Here we instead asked how neural activity differs between brains, and how that difference evolves alongside activity patterns shared between brains. Applying this framework to bats engaged in spontaneous social interactions revealed two complementary phenomena characterizing the inter-brain neural relationship: fast fluctuations of activity difference across brains unfolding in parallel with slow activity covariation across brains. A model reproduced these observations and generated multiple predictions that we confirmed using experimental data involving pairs of bats and a larger social group of bats. The model suggests that a simple computational mechanism involving positive and negative feedback could explain diverse experimental observations regarding the inter-brain neural relationship.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A vibrissa pathway that activates the limbic system</a></h4>

              
                Vibrissa sensory inputs play a central role in driving rodent behavior. These inputs transit through the sensory trigeminal nuclei, which give rise to the ascending lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways. While lemniscal projections are somatotopically mapped from brainstem to cortex, those of the paralemniscal pathway are more widely distributed. Yet the extent and topography of paralemniscal projections are unknown, along with the potential role of these projections in controlling behavior. Here, we used viral tracers to map paralemniscal projections. We find that this pathway broadcasts vibrissa-based sensory signals to brainstem regions that are involved in the regulation of autonomic functions and to forebrain regions that are involved in the expression of emotional reactions. We further provide evidence that GABAergic cells of the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus gate trigeminal sensory input in the paralemniscal pathway via a mechanism of presynaptic or extrasynaptic inhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cdc6 is sequentially regulated by PP2A-Cdc55, Cdc14, and Sic1 for origin licensing in S. cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Cdc6, a subunit of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC), contains multiple regulatory cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1) consensus sites, SP or TP motifs. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Cdk1 phosphorylates Cdc6-T7 to recruit Cks1, the Cdk1 phospho-adaptor in S phase, for subsequent multisite phosphorylation and protein degradation. Cdc6 accumulates in mitosis and is tightly bound by Clb2 through N-terminal phosphorylation in order to prevent premature origin licensing and degradation. It has been extensively studied how Cdc6 phosphorylation is regulated by the cyclin–Cdk1 complex. However, a detailed mechanism on how Cdc6 phosphorylation is reversed by phosphatases has not been elucidated. Here, we show that PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> dephosphorylates Cdc6 N-terminal sites to release Clb2. Cdc14 dephosphorylates the C-terminal phospho-degron, leading to Cdc6 stabilization in mitosis. In addition, Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 releases Clb2·Cdk1·Cks1 from Cdc6 to load Mcm2–7 on the chromatin upon mitotic exit. Thus, pre-RC assembly and origin licensing are promoted by phosphatases through the attenuation of distinct Cdk1-dependent Cdc6 inhibitory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neural network model of when to retrieve and encode episodic memories</a></h4>

              
                Recent human behavioral and neuroimaging results suggest that people are selective in when they encode and retrieve episodic memories. To explain these findings, we trained a memory-augmented neural network to use its episodic memory to support prediction of upcoming states in an environment where past situations sometimes reoccur. We found that the network learned to retrieve selectively as a function of several factors, including its uncertainty about the upcoming state. Additionally, we found that selectively encoding episodic memories at the end of an event (but not mid-event) led to better subsequent prediction performance. In all of these cases, the benefits of selective retrieval and encoding can be explained in terms of reducing the risk of retrieving irrelevant memories. Overall, these modeling results provide a resource-rational account of why episodic retrieval and encoding should be selective and lead to several testable predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human embryoid bodies as a novel system for genomic studies of functionally diverse cell types</a></h4>

              
                Practically all studies of gene expression in humans to date have been performed in a relatively small number of adult tissues. Gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent. In order to better understand the connection between gene regulation and complex phenotypes, including disease, we need to be able to study gene expression in more cell types, tissues, and states that are relevant to human phenotypes. In particular, we need to characterize gene expression in early development cell types, as mutations that affect developmental processes may be of particular relevance to complex traits. To address this challenge, we propose to use embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states. EBs provide a system in which one can study dynamic regulatory processes at an unprecedentedly high resolution. To explore the utility of EBs, we systematically explored cellular and gene expression heterogeneity in EBs from multiple individuals. We characterized the various cell types that arise from EBs, the extent to which they recapitulate gene expression in vivo, and the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to variability in gene expression, cell composition, and differentiation efficiency. Our results highlight the utility of EBs as a new model system for mapping dynamic inter-individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Mindbomb1 controls planar cell polarity-dependent convergent extension movements during zebrafish gastrulation</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrate Delta/Notch signaling involves multiple ligands, receptors and transcription factors. Delta endocytosis - a critical event for Notch activation - is however essentially controlled by the E3 Ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1). Mib1 inactivation is therefore often used to inhibit Notch signaling. However, recent findings indicate that Mib1 function extends beyond the Notch pathway. We report a novel Notch-independent role of Mib1 in zebrafish gastrulation. <i>mib1</i> null mutants and morphants display impaired Convergence Extension (CE) movements. Comparison of different <i>mib1</i> mutants and functional rescue experiments indicate that Mib1 controls CE independently of Notch. Mib1-dependent CE defects can be rescued using the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) downstream mediator RhoA, or enhanced through knock-down of the PCP ligand Wnt5b. Mib1 regulates CE through its RING Finger domains that have been implicated in substrate ubiquitination, suggesting that Mib1 may control PCP protein trafficking. Accordingly, we show that Mib1 controls the endocytosis of the PCP component Ryk and that Ryk internalization is required for CE. Numerous morphogenetic processes involve both Notch and PCP signaling. Our observation that during zebrafish gastrulation Mib1 exerts a Notch-independent control of PCP-dependent CE movements suggest that Mib1 loss of function phenotypes should be cautiously interpreted depending on the biological context.

                Sensory information is critical for motor coordination. However, understanding sensorimotor integration is complicated, especially in individuals with nervous system impairment. This research presents a novel functional biomarker, based on a nonlinear network graph of muscle connectivity, called InfoMuNet, to quantify the role of sensory information in motor performance. Thirty-two individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis performed a grasp-and-lift task while muscle activities were measured using eight surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors. Subjects performed the task with their affected hand before and after exposure to the sensory stimulation elicited by performing the task with the less-affected hand. For the first time, this work shows that InfoMuNet robustly quantifies functional muscle connectivity improvements in the affected hand after exposure of the less-affected side to sensory information. >90% of the subjects conformed with the improvement resulting from this sensory exposure. InfoMuNet also shows high sensitivity to tactile, kinesthetic, and visual input alterations at the subject level, highlighting the potential use in precision rehabilitation interventions.

                More than a dozen excitatory cell types have been identified in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) based on transcriptomic, morphological and in vitro electrophysiological features. However, the functional landscape of excitatory neurons with respect to their responses to visual stimuli is currently unknown. Here, we combined large-scale two-photon imaging and deep learning neural predictive models to study the functional organization of mouse V1 using digital twins. Digital twins enable exhaustive in silico functional characterization providing a bar code summarizing the input-output function of each neuron. Clustering the bar codes revealed a continuum of function with around 30 modes. Each mode represented a group of neurons that exhibited a specific combination of stimulus selectivity and nonlinear response properties such as cross-orientation inhibition, size-contrast tuning and surround suppression. These non-linear properties were expressed independently spanning all possible combinations across the population. This combinatorial code provides the first large-scale, data-driven characterization of the functional organization of V1. This powerful approach based on digital twins is applicable to other brain areas and to complex non-linear systems beyond the brain.

                We have developed new imaging and computational workflows to produce accurately aligned multimodal 3D images of the mouse brain that exploit high resolution magnetic resonance histology (MRH) and light sheet microscopy (LSM) with fully rendered 3D reference delineations of brain structures. The suite of methods starts with the acquisition of geometrically accurate (in-skull) brain MRIs using multi-gradient echo (MGRE) and new diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at an isotropic spatial resolution of 15 um. Whole brain connectomes are generated using over 100 diffusion weighted images acquired with gradients at uniformly spaced angles. Track density images are generated at a super-resolution of 5 um. Brains are dissected from the cranium, cleared with SHIELD, stained by immunohistochemistry, and imaged by LSM at 1.8 um/pixel. LSM channels are registered into the reference MRH space along with the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3). The result is a high-dimensional integrated volume with registration (HiDiver) that has a global alignment accuracy of 10-50 um. HiDiver enables 3D quantitative and global analyses of cells, circuits, connectomes, and CNS regions of interest (ROIs). Throughput is sufficiently high that HiDiver is now being used in comprehensive quantitative studies of the impact of gene variants and aging on rodent brain cytoarchitecture.

                Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a highly proliferative class of non-neuronal progenitors that largely give rise to myelinating oligodendrocytes. Although OPCs persist across the lifespan, their functions beyond oligodendrogenesis remain to be fully characterized. Here, we show that OPCs contribute to neural circuit remodeling by internalizing presynaptic thalamocortical inputs in both the developing and adult mouse visual cortex. Inputs internalized by OPCs localize to lysosomal compartments, consistent with OPC engulfment of synapses occurring through phagocytosis. We further show that engulfment by OPCs is heightened during experience-dependent plasticity, and that this experience-dependent increase in engulfment requires microglia. These data identify a new function for OPCs beyond the generation of oligodendrocytes and reveal that distinct non-neuronal populations collaborate to modulate synaptic connectivity.

                It has become increasingly evident that immune cells play a role in modulating brain function. Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cell in mammals. Until recently, our understanding of the physiological role of these cells was limited to infection and cancer. Recently, it has emerged that neutrophils play critical roles in modulating tissue health and physiology. There has been evidence that neutrophils populate the rodent meninges. As such, we hypothesized that like other meningeal immune cells, neutrophils play a neuromodulatory role. Using a depletion paradigm, anti-Ly6G antibody injection, we demonstrate that the loss of neutrophils leads to changes in cognitive flexibility and social interactions in mice. Furthermore, the depletion paradigm led to a 50% decrease in the number of neutrophils in the meninges, which in turn led to the proliferation of resident immature neutrophils within the meninges. Finally, our data show that this immature population reenters the cell cycle only in response to specific physiological stimuli (neutrophil depletion, and stress). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that there are resident neutrophils within the meninges and that elucidating their function in the nervous system will deepen our understanding of immune regulation of brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring the frame effect</a></h4>

              
                Probes flashed within a moving frame are dramatically displaced (Ozkan et al, 2021; Wong & Mack, 1981). The effect is much larger than that seen on static or moving probes (induced motion, Duncker, 1929; Wallach et al, 1978). These flashed probes are often perceived with the separation they have in frame coordinates -- a 100% effect. Here we explore this frame effect on flashed tests with several versions of the standard stimulus. We find that the frame effect holds for smoothly or abruptly displacing frames, even when the frame changed shape or orientation between the endpoints of its travel. The path could be non-linear, even circular. The effect was driven by perceived not physical motion. When there were competing overlapping frames, the effect was determined by which frame was attended. There were a number of constraints that limited the effect. A static anchor near the flashes suppressed the effect but an extended static texture did not. If the probes were continuous rather than flashed, the effect was abolished. The results suggest that the frame effect is robust to many variations in its shape and path and leads to a perception of flashed tests in their locations relative to the frame as if the frame were stationary.

                The study of brain change in neuroscience studies is commonly conducted using macroscopic morphological measures of the brain such as regional volume or cortical thickness, providing little insight into the microscopic mechanisms underlying brain disease. In contrast, quantitative MRI allows the monitoring of microscopic brain change non-invasively in-vivo, and provides normative values for comparisons between tissues, regions, and individuals. To support the development and common use of qMRI for cognitive neuroscience, we analysed a set of qMRI metrics (R1, R2*, Magnetization Transfer saturation, Proton Density saturation, Fractional Anisotropy, Mean Diffusivity) in 101 healthy young adults. Here we provide a comprehensive descriptive analysis of these metrics and their linear relationships to each other in grey and white matter to develop a more complete understanding of the relationship to tissue microstructure. Furthermore, we provide evidence that combinations of metrics may uncover informative microstructural cortical gradients across the brain by showing that dimensionality reduction through PCA provides cortical gradients that were hidden in individual metrics. We discuss these results and their links to microstructural and physiological neuroscience research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Active tactile discrimination is coupled with and modulated by the cardiac cycle</a></h4>

              
                Perception and cognition are modulated by the phase of the cardiac signal in which the stimuli are presented. This has been shown by locking the presentation of stimuli to distinct cardiac phases. However, in everyday life sensory information is not presented in this phase-locked and passive manner, instead we actively sample the world. Whether active sensing is coupled and modulated with the cardiac cycle remains largely unknown. Here we recorded the ECGs of human participants while they actively performed a tactile grating orientation task. Here we show that the duration of subjects' touch varied as a function of the cardiac phase in which they initiated it. Touches initiated in the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle were held for longer periods of time than touches initiated in the diastolic phase. This effect was driven by the elongation of their holds to sample the most difficult gratings. Conversely, while touches in the control condition were coupled to the cardiac cycle, their length was not modulated as a function of when in the cycle these were initiated. In line with interoceptive inference accounts, these results are consistent with the hypotheses that we actively adjust our sensory sampling so that we spend more time in the diastole period of the cardiac cycle in which perceptual sensory sensitivity is greatest.

                Humans and animals constantly face challenging acoustic environments such as various background noises restricting the detection, discrimination and identification of behaviorally salient sounds. Here, we disentangled the role of temporal envelope tracking on the decrease in neuronal and behavioral discrimination between communication sounds in situations of acoustic degradations. We simulated responses of auditory nerve fibers and recorded neuronal activity in cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, thalamus and auditory cortex in anesthetized guinea-pigs. Furthermore, a Go/No-Go sound discrimination task involving two of the guinea-pig whistles was performed on mice in silence and noise. For all conditions, we found that auditory neurons better track the slow amplitude modulations (<20 Hz) of the stimulus envelopes than the faster ones. In addition, the decrease in neuronal and behavioral discrimination performance in noise can be explained by an increased similarity of the vocalization envelopes in the low frequency range (<20 Hz). Together, these results suggest that slow envelope tracking is a general property of auditory neurons, and any difference between the slow envelopes of natural stimuli allows coping with degraded conditions.

                Charting human brain maturation between childhood and adulthood is a fundamental prerequisite for understanding the rapid psychological changes during adolescence. Two barriers have precluded the quantification of maturational trajectories: demands on data and demands on estimation. Using high-temporal resolution neuroimaging data of up to 12-waves in the HUBU cohort (N = 90, aged 7-21 years) we investigate changes in apparent cortical thickness across childhood and adolescence. Fitting a four-parameter logistic nonlinear random effects mixed model, we quantified the characteristic, s-shaped, trajectory of cortical thinning in adolescence. This approach yields biologically meaningful parameters, including the midpoint of cortical thinning (MCT), which corresponds to the age at which the cortex shows most rapid thinning - in our sample occurring, on average, at 15 years of age. These results show that, given suitable data and models, cortical maturation can be quantified with precision for each individual and brain region.

                The eyes of nymphalid butterflies, investigated with incident illumination, show colourful facet reflection patterns, the eye shine, which is uniform or heterogeneous, dependent on the species. Facet colours suggest that the ommatidia contain different sets of photoreceptors and screening pigments, but how the colours and the cell characteristics are associated has not been clearly established. Here we analyse the retinae of two nymphalids, Apatura ilia, which has a uniform eyeshine, and Charaxes jasius, a species with a heterogeneous eye shine, using single-cell recordings, spectroscopy and optical pupillometry. Apatura has UV, blue and green-sensitive photoreceptors, allocated into three ommatidial types. The UV and blue-sensitive cells are long visual fibres (LVFs), receiving opponent input from the green-sensitive short visual fibres (SVFs). Charaxes has an expanded set of photoreceptors, allocated into three additional, red-reflecting ommatidial types. All red ommatidia contain green-sensitive LVFs, receiving opponent input from red receptors. In both species, the SVFs do not receive any opponent input. The simple retina of Apatura with three ommatidial types and two colour-opponent channels can support trichromatic vision. Charaxes has six ommatidial types and three colour-opponent channels. Its expanded receptor set can support tetrachromatic vision.

                Supplementation with the catecholamine precursor L-Tyrosine might enhance cognitive performance, but overall findings are mixed. Here, we investigate the effect of a single dose of tyrosine (2g) vs. placebo on two key aspects of catecholamine-dependent decision-making: model-based reinforcement learning (2-step task) and temporal discounting, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design (n=28 healthy male participants). We leveraged drift diffusion models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to jointly model participants' choices and response times in both tasks. Furthermore, comprehensive autonomic monitoring (heart rate, heart rate variability, pupillometry, spontaneous eye-blink rate) was performed both pre- and post-supplementation, to explore potential physiological effects of supplementation. Across tasks, tyrosine consistently reduced participants' RTs without deteriorating task-performance. Diffusion modeling linked this effect to attenuated decision-thresholds in both tasks and further revealed increased model-based control (2-step task) and (if anything) attenuated temporal discounting. On the physiological level, participants pupil dilation was predictive of the individual degree of temporal discounting. Tyrosine supplementation reduced physiological arousal as revealed by increases in pupil dilation variability and reductions in hear rate. Supplementation-related changes in physiological arousal predicted individual changes in temporal discounting. Our findings provide first evidence that tyrosine supplementation might impact psychophysiological parameters, and suggest that modeling approaches based on sequential sampling models can yield novel insights into latent cognitive processes modulated by amino-acid supplementation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An automated pipeline for extracting quantitative histological metrics for voxelwise MRI-histology comparisons</a></h4>

              
                The acquisition of MRI and histology in the same post-mortem tissue sample enables direct correlation between MRI and histologically-derived parameters. However, there still lacks a standardised automated pipeline to process histology data, with most studies relying on heavy manual intervention. Here, we introduce an automated pipeline to extract quantitative histology metrics (stained area fraction) from multiple immunohistochemical (IHC) stains. The pipeline is designed to directly address key IHC artefacts related to tissue staining and slide digitisation. This pipeline was applied to post-mortem human brain data from multiple subjects, relating MRI parameters (FA, MD, R2*, R1) to IHC slides stained for myelin, neurofilaments, microglia, and activated microglia. Utilising high-quality MRI-IHC coregistration, we then performed whole-slide voxelwise comparisons (simple correlation, partial correlation, and multiple regression analyses) between multimodal MRI- and IHC-derived parameters. The pipeline was found to be reproducible, robust to some artefacts, and generalisable across multiple IHC stains. Our partial correlation results suggest that some simple MRI-IHC correlations should be interpreted with caution, due to the colocalisation of certain tissue features (e.g. myelin and neurofilaments). Further, we find activated microglia to consistently be the strongest predictor of DTI FA, which may suggest the sensitivity of diffusion MRI to neuroinflammation. Taken together, these results show the utility of this approach in carefully curating IHC data and performing multimodal analyses to better understand microstructural relationships with MRI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase deficiency leads to early demyelination by altering the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses against Murine-β-Coronavirus</a></h4>

              
                The neurological disease Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by neuroinflammation and demyelination orchestrated by the activated glial cells, the CNS infiltrating leukocytes, and their reciprocal interaction through inflammatory signals. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), an enzyme that catalyzes sustained nitric oxide production in response to an inflammatory stimulus, is a pro-inflammatory marker expressed particularly by the microglia/macrophages (MG/M{phi}) during neuroinflammation. In MS, iNOS has been reportedly associated with the disease pathology; however, studies dissecting its role in the underlying mechanisms, specifically demyelination, are limited. Therefore, we studied the role of iNOS in a recombinant beta-coronavirus- MHV-RSA59- induced neuroinflammation, which is a prototypic animal model used to investigate the pathological hallmarks of MS, neuroinflammatory demyelination, and axonal degeneration. During the acute phase of infection with RSA59, wildtype C57BL/6 (WT) mice had significantly upregulated iNOS expression in macrophages, natural killer cells, and natural killer T cells suggesting a role for iNOS in RSA59-induced neuroinflammation. Studies comparing RSA59-infected WT and iNOS-deficient mice revealed that iNOS deficiency aggravated the disease with increased CNS infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils and enhanced mortality. As early as 9-10 days after the infection, the CNS of iNOS-deficient mice had substantially higher demyelination marked with morphologically defined MG/M{phi} in the demyelinating regions. Transcript analysis confirmed the significant upregulation of type2 macrophage (M2) markers- Arginase 1, CD206, and TREM2- in the CNS of iNOS-deficient mice. Corroborating to the phenotype, the iNOS-deficient mice showed a significantly higher expression of TGF{beta}- an anti-inflammatory cytokine- and increased T regulatory (Treg) cell infiltration, indicating an anti-inflammatory milieu established early after the infection. These observations highlight a protective role of iNOS in virus-induced neuroinflammation whereas its absence leads to MG/M{phi} polarization towards a phenotype that may be involved in the exacerbated demyelination pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory NPY neurons provide a large and heterotopic commissural projection in the inferior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Located in the midbrain, the inferior colliculus (IC) plays an essential role in many auditory computations, including speech processing and sound localization. The right and left side of the IC are interconnected by a dense fiber tract, the commissure of the IC (CoIC), that provides each IC with one its largest sources of input (i.e., the contralateral IC). Despite its prominence, the CoIC remains poorly understood. Previous studies using anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing showed that IC commissural projections are predominately homotopic and tonotopic, targeting mirror-image locations in the same frequency region in the contralateral IC. However, it is unknown whether specific classes of neurons, particularly inhibitory neurons which constitute ~10-40% of the commissural projection, follow this pattern. We therefore examined the commissural projections of Neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons, the first molecularly identifiable class of GABAergic neurons in the IC. Using retrograde tracing with Retrobeads in NPY-hrGFP mice of both sexes, we found that NPY neurons comprise ~11% of the commissural projection. Moreover, focal injections of Retrobeads showed that NPY neurons in the central nucleus of the IC exhibit a more divergent and heterotopic commissural projection pattern than non-NPY neurons. Thus, commissural NPY neurons are positioned to provide cross-frequency, lateral inhibition to the contralateral IC. Through this circuit, sounds that drive activity in limited frequency bands on one side of the IC might suppress activity across a larger number of frequency bands in the contralateral IC.

                To better understand the computational steps that the brain performs during reading, we used a convolutional neural network as a computational model of visual word recognition, the first stage of reading. In contrast to traditional models of reading, our model directly operates on the pixel values of an image containing text, and has a large vocabulary of 10k Finnish words. The same stimuli can thus be presented unmodified to both the model and human volunteers in a magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner. In a direct comparison between model and brain activity, we show that the model accurately predicts the amplitude of three evoked MEG response components commonly observed during reading. We conclude that the deep learning techniques that revolutionized models of object recognition can also create models of reading that can be straightforwardly compared to neuroimaging data, which will greatly facilitate testing and refining theories on language processing in the brain.

                Online research platforms have enabled mass data collection enabling representative samples for cognitive behavioural studies. However, the benefits of online data collection have not been available for cognitive neuroscience fields such as electroencephalography (EEG). In this study, we introduce an approach for remote EEG data collection. We demonstrate how an experiment can be built via the EmotivPRO Builder and deployed to the EmotivLABS website where it can be completed by participants who own EMOTIV EEG headsets. To demonstrate the data collection technique, we collected EEG while participants engaged in a resting state task where participants sat with their eyes open and then eyes closed for two minutes each. We observed a significant difference in alpha power between the two conditions thereby demonstrating the well-known alpha suppression effect. Thus, we demonstrate that EEG data collection, particularly for frequency domain analysis, can be successfully conducted online with remote users.

                Higher general cognitive ability (GCA) is associated with lower risk of neurodegenerative disorders, but neural mechanisms are unknown. GCA could be associated with more cortical tissue, from young age, i.e. brain reserve, or less cortical atrophy in adulthood, i.e. brain maintenance. Controlling for education, we investigated the relative association of GCA with reserve and maintenance of cortical volume, -area and -thickness through the adult lifespan, using multiple longitudinal brain imaging cohorts (n = 3327, 7002 MRI scans, baseline age 20-88 years, followed-up up to 11 years). There were widespread positive relationships between GCA and cortical characteristics (level-level associations). In select regions, higher baseline GCA was associated with less atrophy over time (level-change associations). Relationships remained when controlling for polygenic scores for both GCA and education. Our findings suggest that higher GCA is associated with cortical volumes by both brain reserve and -maintenance mechanisms through the adult lifespan.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Direct Modulation Index: a measure of phase amplitude coupling for neurophysiology data</a></h4>

              
                Neural communication across different spatial and temporal scales is a topic of great interest in clinical and basic science. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) has attracted particular interest due to its functional role in a wide range of cognitive and motor functions. Here, we introduce a novel measure termed the direct modulation index (dMI). Based on the classical modulation index, dMI provides an estimate of PAC that is bound to an absolute interval between 0 and +1, resistant against noise, and reliable even for small amounts of data. To highlight the properties of this newly-proposed measure, we evaluated dMI by comparing it to the classical modulation index, mean vector length, and phase-locking value using simulated data. We ascertained that dMI provides a more accurate estimate of PAC than the existing methods and that is resilient to varying noise levels and signal lengths. As such, dMI permits a reliable investigation of PAC, which may reveal insights crucial to our understanding of functional brain architecture in key contexts such as behaviour and cognition. A Python toolbox that implements dMI and other measures of PAC is freely available at https://github.com/neurophysiological-analysis/FiNN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task-dependent and automatic tracking of hierarchical linguistic structure</a></h4>

              
                Linguistic phrases are tracked in sentences even though there is no clear acoustic phrasal marker in the physical signal. This phenomenon suggests an automatic tracking of abstract linguistic structure that is endogenously generated by the brain. However, all studies investigating linguistic tracking compare conditions where either relevant information at linguistic timescales is available, or where this information is absent altogether (e.g. sentences versus word lists during passive listening). It is therefore unclear whether tracking at these phrasal timescales is related to the content of language, or rather, is a consequence of attending to the timescales that happen to match behaviourally-relevant information. To investigate this question, we presented participants with sentences and word lists while recording their brain activity with MEG. Participants performed passive, syllable, word, and word-combination tasks corresponding to attending to rates they would naturally attend to, syllable-rates, word-rates, and phrasal-rates, respectively. We replicated overall findings of stronger phrasal-rate tracking measured with mutual information (MI) for sentences compared to word lists across the classical language network. However, in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) we found a task-effect suggesting stronger phrasal-rate tracking during the word-combination task independent of the presence of linguistic structure, as well as stronger delta-band connectivity during this task. These results suggest that extracting linguistic information at phrasal-rates occurs automatically with or without the presence of an additional task, but also that that IFG might be important for temporal integration across various perceptual domains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell multi-region dissection of brain vasculature in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular breakdown occurs early in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but its cell-type-specific molecular basis remains uncharacterized. Here, we characterize single-cell transcriptomic differences in human cerebrovasculature across 220 AD and 208 control individuals and across 6 brain regions. We annotate 22,514 cerebrovascular cells in 11 subtypes of endothelial, pericyte, smooth muscle, perivascular fibroblast, and ependymal cells, and how they differ between brain regions. We identify 2,676 AD-differential genes, including lower expression of PDGFRB in pericytes, and ABCB1 and ATP10A in endothelial cells. These AD-differential genes reveal common upstream regulators, including MECOM, EP300, and KLF4, whose targeting may help restore vasculature function. We find coordinated vasculature-glial-neuronal co-expressed gene modules supported by ligand-receptor pairs, involved in axon growth/degeneration and neurogenesis, suggesting mechanistic mediators of neurovascular unit dysregulation in AD. Integration with AD genetics reveals 125 AD-differential genes directly linked to AD-associated genetic variants (through vasculature-specific eQTLs, Hi-C, and correlation-based evidence), 559 targeted by AD-associated regulators, and 661 targeted by AD-associated ligand-receptor signaling. Lastly, we show that APOE4-genotype associated differences are significantly enriched among AD-associated genes in capillary and venule endothelial cells, and subsets of pericytes and fibroblasts, which underlie the vascular dysregulation in APOE4-associated cognitive decline. Overall, our multi-region molecular atlas of differential human cerebrovasculature genes and pathways in AD can help guide early-stage AD therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Express detection and discrimination of visual objects by primate superior colliculus neurons</a></h4>

              
                Primate superior colliculus (SC) neurons exhibit rich visual feature tuning properties and are implicated in a subcortical network hypothesized to mediate fast threat and/or conspecific detection. However, the mechanisms through which generalized object detection may be mediated by SC neurons remain unclear. Here we explored whether, and how quickly, SC neurons detect and discriminate real-life object stimuli. We presented experimentally-controlled gray-scale images of seven different object categories within the response fields (RFs) of SC neurons, and we also presented a variety of luminance- and spectral-matched image controls. We found that all of our functionally-identified SC neuron types preferentially detected real-life objects even in their very first stimulus-evoked visual bursts (starting within approximately 50 ms from image onset). Intriguingly, even visually-responsive motor-related neurons exhibited such robust early object detection, and they also preferentially discriminated between object categories in their initial visual bursts. We further identified spatial frequency information in visual images as a critical source for early object detection and discrimination by SC neurons. Our results demonstrate rapid and robust SC processing of visual objects, and they underline how the visual processing capabilities of the primate SC support perception and action.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Not all noise-reduction methods for fMRI preprocessing are created equal</a></h4>

              
                Preprocessing fMRI data requires striking a fine balance between conserving signals of interest and removing noise. Typical steps of preprocessing include motion correction, slice timing correction, spatial smoothing, and high-pass filtering. However, these standard steps do not remove many sources of noise. Thus, noise-reduction techniques such as CompCor and FIX have been developed to further improve the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. The ability of these techniques to minimize noise while conserving signals of interest has been tested almost exclusively in resting-state fMRI datasets and, only rarely, in task-related fMRI datasets. Application of noise-reduction techniques to task-related fMRI is particularly important given that such procedures have been shown to reduce false positive rates. However, little remains known about the impact of different noise reduction techniques on the retention of signal, particularly during tasks that may be associated with systemic physiological changes. In this paper, we compared two noise-reduction techniques, i.e. FIX and CompCor, in an fMRI dataset including noxious heat stimulation and non-noxious auditory stimulation. Results show that preprocessing including FIX noise-reduction technique conserves significantly more signal than a preprocessing protocol including CompCor noise-reduction technique in both noxious heat and non-noxious auditory stimulations, while removing only slightly less noise. These results suggest that FIX might be the most appropriate technique to achieve the balance between conserving signals of interest and removing noise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impacts of Spaceflight Experience on Human Brain Structure</a></h4>

              
                Spaceflight induces widespread changes in human brain morphology. It is unclear if these brain changes differ with varying mission durations or one's history of spaceflight experience (e.g., number of prior missions, time between missions). Here we addressed this issue by quantifying voxelwise post-flight changes in gray matter volume, white matter microstructure, extracellular free water (FW), and ventricular volume in a sample of 28 astronauts. We found that longer missions induced greater ventricular expansion and larger FW displacement at the top of the brain. A greater number of prior missions was associated with white matter microstructure declines in a tract supporting voluntary leg movement. Longer inter-mission intervals were associated with greater ventricle expansion, with compensatory ventricular expansion observed only in those crewmembers with inter-missions intervals of 3 years or longer. Longer missions therefore induce more extensive brain fluid shifts, and the ventricles may require at least 3 years to recover post-flight.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective integration of diverse taste inputs within a single taste modality</a></h4>

              
                Each sensory system contains a diverse repertoire of sensory cells. In the gustatory system, individual taste modalities contain sensory cells that reside in different locations or express different combinations of taste receptors. These different input channels may converge onto common downstream circuits and drive the same behaviors, or they may activate separate pathways to regulate distinct behaviors. To distinguish between these models in Drosophila, we first characterized a repertoire of behaviors induced by optogenetic activation of sugar- or bitter-sensing neurons. We then activated subsets of bitter-sensing neurons within specific organs. Different subsets elicited a broad and highly overlapping set of behaviors, suggesting that they converge onto common downstream pathways, but we also observed behavioral differences that argue for selective convergence. Transsynaptic tracing experiments provided a neuronal substrate for these results, revealing that bitter neuron subsets connect to overlapping downstream regions with biased connectivity. We characterized one type of second-order bitter neuron that integrates multiple types of bitter input and regulates a subset of bitter-induced behaviors. These results suggest that different bitter inputs are selectively integrated early in the circuit, enabling the pooling of sensory information, and the circuit then diverges into multiple pathways that may have different behavioral roles.

                The ventral midbrain is the primary source of dopamine- (DA) expressing neurons in most species. GABA-ergic and glutamatergic cell populations are intermixed among DA-expressing cells and purported to regulate both local and long-range dopamine neuron activity. Most work has been conducted in rodent models, however due to evolutionary expansion of the ventral midbrain in primates, the increased size and complexity of DA subpopulations warrants further investigation. Here, we quantified the number of DA neurons, and their GABA-ergic complement in classic DA cell groups A10 (midline ventral tegmental area nuclei [VTA] and parabrachial pigmented nucleus [PBP]), A9 (substantia nigra, pars compacta [SNc]) and A8 (retrorubral field [RRF]) in the macaque. Because the PBP is a disproportionately expanded feature of the A10 group, and has unique connectional features in monkeys, we analyzed A10 data by dividing it into 'classic 'midline nuclei and the PBP. Unbiased stereology revealed total putative DA neuron counts to be 210,238 +/- 17,127 (A10 = 110,319 +/- 9,649, A9= 87,399 +/-7,751 and A8=12,520 +/- 827). Putative GABAergic neurons were fewer overall, and evenly dispersed across the DA subpopulations (GAD67= 71,215 +/- 5,663; A10=16,836 +/- 2,743; A9=24,855 +/- 3,144 and A8=12,633 +/- 3,557). Calculating the GAD67/TH ratio for each subpopulation revealed differential balances of these two cell types across the DA subpopulations. The A8 subpopulation had the highest complement of GAD67-positive neurons compared to TH-positive neurons (1:1), suggesting a potentially high capacity for GABAergic inhibition of DA output in this region.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct features of the cortical N1 response to balance perturbation are associated with balance and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Mechanisms underlying associations between balance and cognitive impairments in older adults with and without Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood. Balance disturbances evoke a cortical N1 response that is associated with both balance and cognitive abilities in unimpaired populations. We hypothesized that the N1 response reflects a neural mechanism that is shared between balance and cognitive function, and would therefore be associated with both balance and cognitive impairments in PD. Although N1 responses did not differ at the group level they showed distinct associations with balance and cognitive function in the PD vs. control (noPD) groups. In noPD, higher N1 amplitudes were correlated with lower cognitive set shifting ability and lower balance confidence. However, in PD, higher N1 amplitudes were correlated with lower overall cognitive function, while earlier and narrower N1 peaks were correlated with more severe PD and balance impairments. Our results show that balance and cognitive impairments are dissociable and associated with distinct features of the N1 response, suggesting that the N1 response reflects coordination of distinct mechanisms for balance and cognitive function. Identifying coordinated but dissociable mechanisms underlying balance and cognitive processes may reveal potential targets for rehabilitation of comorbid balance and cognitive impairments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Principled clustering of functional signals reveals gradients in processing both within the anterior hippocampus and across its long axis</a></h4>

              
                A particularly elusive puzzle concerning the hippocampus is how the structural differences along its long, anteroposterior axis might beget meaningful functional differences, particularly in terms of the granularity of information processing. One measure posits to quantify this granularity by calculating the average statistical independence of the BOLD signal across neighboring voxels, or inter-voxel similarity (IVS), and has shown the anterior hippocampus to process coarser-grained information than that in the posterior hippocampus. This model of the hippocampus, however, conflicts with a number of task-oriented findings, many of which have varied in their fMRI acquisition parameters and hippocampal parcellation methods. In order to reconcile these findings, we measured IVS across two separate resting-state fMRI acquisitions and compared the results across many of the most widely used parcellation methods in a large young-adult sample (Acquisition 1, N = 253; Acquisition 2, N = 183). Finding conflicting results across acquisitions and parcellations, we reasoned that a principled, data-driven approach to hippocampal parcellation is necessary. To this end, we implemented a group masked independent components analysis (mICA) to identify functional subunits of the hippocampus, most notably separating the anterior hippocampus into separate anterior-medial, anterior-lateral, and posteroanterior-lateral components. Measuring IVS across these components revealed a decrease in IVS along the medial-lateral axis of the anterior hippocampus but an increase from anterior to posterior. We conclude that representational granularity may not change linearly or unidirectionally across the hippocampus, and that moving the study of the hippocampus towards reproducibility requires grounding it in a functionally informed approach.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral decomposition reveals rich encoding structure employed across neocortex</a></h4>

              
                The cortical population code is pervaded by activity patterns evoked by movement, but how such signals relate to the natural actions of unrestrained animals remains largely unknown, particularly in sensory areas. To address this we compared high-density neural recordings across four cortical regions (visual, auditory, somatosensory, motor) in relation to sensory modulation, posture, movement, and ethograms of freely foraging rats. Momentary actions, such as rearing or turning, were represented ubiquitously and could be decoded from all sampled structures. However, more elementary and continuous features, such as pose and movement, followed region-specific organization, with neurons in visual and auditory cortices preferentially encoding mutually distinct head-orienting features in world-referenced coordinates, and somatosensory and motor cortices principally encoding the trunk and head in egocentric coordinates. The tuning properties of synaptically coupled cells also exhibited connection patterns suggestive of different uses of behavioral information within and between regions. Together, our results speak for detailed, multi-level encoding of animal behavior subserving its dynamic employment in local cortical computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">State-dependent activity dynamics of hypothalamic stress effector neurons</a></h4>

              
                The stress response necessitates an immediate boost in vital physiological functions from their homeostatic operation to elevated emergency response. However, neural mechanisms underlying this state-dependent change remain largely unknown. Using a combination of in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology with computational modeling, we report that corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the effector neurons of hormonal stress response, rapidly transition between distinct activity states through recurrent inhibition. Specifically, in vivo optrode recording shows that under non-stress conditions, CRHPVN neurons often fire with rhythmic brief bursts (RB), which, somewhat counterintuitively, constrains firing rate due to long (~2 s) inter-burst intervals. Stressful stimuli rapidly switch RB to continuous single spiking (SS), permitting a large increase in firing rate. A spiking network model shows that recurrent inhibition can control this activity-state switch, and consequently the gain of spiking responses to excitatory inputs. In biological CRHPVN neurons ex vivo, the injection of whole-cell currents derived from our computational model recreates the in vivo-like switch between RB and SS, providing a direct evidence that physiologically relevant network inputs enable state-dependent computation in single neurons. Together, we present a novel mechanism for state-dependent activity dynamics in CRHPVN neurons.

	<p>The imbalance between the speed and accuracy of cognitive-motor operations can lead to the formation of abnormal behavioral programs fraught with serious negative consequences for the individual. For successful correction and prevention of social disadaptation in adolescents with nervous and mental diseases and functional disorders in mental sphere in general education schools, the peculiarities of their psychomotor activity should be taken into account. We measured some parameters of visual-motor coordination and sensorimotor reaction in adolescents with mental disorders with (n = 36) or without (n = 27) organic brain damage. Adolescents from both groups showed higher speed, but poorer accuracy and smoothness, of movements than typically developing students (n = 70). The visual and acoustic reaction times were longer in adolescents with mental disorders without organic brain damage than in reference groups.</p>

	<p>Despite evidence that stress relates negatively to cognitive functioning in older adults, little is known how appraisal of stress and socioeconomic meso-level factors influence different types of cognitive functions in older adults. Here, we assess the relationship between perceived stress (PSS scale) and a battery of cognitive functions, including prospective memory in 1054 older adults (65+). A moderator analysis assessed whether this relationship varies with neighborhood socioeconomic status using an area-based measure of Socioeconomic Position (SEP). Perceived stress was associated with worse processing speed, verbal fluency, and inductive reasoning. The perceived self-efficacy subscale of the PSS is related to better performance in these measures. Higher self-efficacy was also associated with better prospective memory; this relationship was more pronounced for people with high neighborhood SEP. These findings indicate that not only do perceived stress and perceived self-efficacy relate to cognitive functioning in older age but also that neighborhood SEP is a moderator of this relationship.</p>

	<p>Aim. Handwriting abilities in children with dyslexia (DYS) are not well documented in the current literature, and the presence of graphomotor impairment in addition to spelling impairment in dyslexia is controversial. Using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), the present study aims to answer the following question: are there markers of graphomotor impairment at rest in DYS children? Method. The participants were children with DYS and typically developing (TD) children (n = 32) from French-speaking primary schools (Mage = 9.3 years). The behavioural evaluation consisted of spelling and handwriting measures. Participants underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. Results. Analyses of RSFC focused on a brain region responsible for graphomotor processes&amp;amp;mdash;the graphemic/motor frontal area (GMFA). The RSFC between the GMFA and all other voxels of the brain was measured. Whole-brain ANOVAs were run to compare RSFC in DYS and TD children. The results demonstrated reduced RSFC in DYS compared to TD between the GMFA and brain areas involved in both spelling processes and motor-related processes. Conclusions. For the first time, this study highlighted a disruption of the writing network in DYS. By identifying functional markers of both spelling and handwriting deficits at rest in young DYS participants, this study supports the presence of graphomotor impairment in dyslexia.</p>

	<p>Tics can be associated with neurological disorders and are thought to be the result of dysfunctional basal ganglia pathways. In Tourette Syndrome (TS), excess dopamine in the striatum is thought to excite the thalamo-cortical circuits, producing tics. When external stressors activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, more dopamine is produced, furthering the excitation of tic-producing pathways. Emotional processing structures in the limbic are also activated during tics, providing further evidence of a possible emotional component in motor ticking behaviors. The purpose of this review is to better understand the relationship between emotional states and ticking behavior. We found support for the notion that premonitory sensory phenomena (PSP), sensory stimulation, and other environmental stressors that impact the HPA axis can influence tics through dopaminergic neurotransmission. Dopamine plays a vital role in cognition and motor control and is an important neurotransmitter in the pathophysiology of other disorders such as obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which tend to be comorbid with ticking disorders and are thought to use similar pathways. It is concluded that there is an emotional component to ticking behaviors. Emotions primarily involving anxiety, tension, stress, and frustration have been associated with exacerbated tics, with PSP contributing to these feelings.</p>

	<p>The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins play important roles in cytokine and growth factor signaling, where they act principally as negative feedback regulators, particularly of the downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors. This critical mode of regulation impacts on both development and homeostasis. However, understanding of the function of SOCS4 remains limited. To address this, we investigated one of the zebrafish SOCS4 paralogues, socs4a, analyzing its expression and the consequences of its ablation. The socs4a gene had a dynamic expression profile during zebrafish embryogenesis, with initial ubiquitous expression becoming restricted to sensory ganglion within the developing nervous system. The knockdown of zebrafish socs4a revealed novel roles in notochord development, as well as the formation of a functional sensory system.</p>

	<p>Background: Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a specific learning disorder concerning reading acquisition that may has a lifelong negative impact on individuals. A reliable estimate of the prevalence of DD serves as the basis for diagnosis, intervention, and evidence-based health resource allocation and policy-making. Hence, the present meta-analysis aims to generate a reliable prevalence estimate of DD worldwide in primary school children and explore the potential variables related to that prevalence. Methods: Studies from the 1950s to June 2021 were collated using a combination of search terms related to DD and prevalence. Study quality was assessed using the STROBE guidelines according to the study design, with study heterogeneity assessed using the I2 statistic, and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Variations in the prevalence of DD in different subgroups were assessed via subgroup meta-analysis and meta-regression. Results: The pooled prevalence of DD was 7.10% (95% CI: 6.27&amp;amp;ndash;7.97%). The prevalence in boys was significantly higher than that in girls (boys: 9.22%, 95%CI, 8.07&amp;amp;ndash;10.44%; girls: 4.66%, 95% CI, 3.84&amp;amp;ndash;5.54%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), but no significant difference was found in the prevalence across different writing systems (alphabetic scripts: 7.26%, 95%CI, 5.94&amp;amp;ndash;8.71%; logographic scripts: 6.97%, 95%CI, 5.86&amp;amp;ndash;8.16%; p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05) or across different orthographic depths (shallow: 7.13%, 95% CI, 5.23&amp;amp;ndash;9.30%; deep: 7.55%, 95% CI, 4.66&amp;amp;ndash;11.04%; p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). It is worth noting that most articles had small sample sizes with diverse operational definitions, making comparisons challenging. Conclusions: This study provides an estimation of worldwide DD prevalence in primary school children. The prevalence was higher in boys than in girls but was not significantly different across different writing systems.</p>

	<p>Mathematical performance implies a series of numerical and mathematical skills (both innate and derived from formal training) as well as certain general cognitive abilities that, if inadequate, can have a cascading effect on mathematics learning. These latter skills were the focus of the present systematic review. Method: The reviewing process was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. We included 46 studies comparing school-aged children&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance with and without math difficulties in the following cognitive domains: processing speed, phonological awareness, short- and long-term memory, executive functions, and attention. Results: The results showed that some general cognitive domains were compromised in children with mathematical difficulties (i.e., executive functions, attention, and processing speed). Conclusions: These cognitive functions should be evaluated during the diagnostic process in order to better understand the child&amp;amp;rsquo;s profile and propose individually tailored interventions. However, further studies should investigate the role of skills that have been poorly investigated to date (e.g., long-term memory and phonological awareness).</p>

                Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm generated by reciprocal chromosomal translocation, t (9; 22) (q34; q11) in the transformed hematopoietic stem cell. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) target the mature proliferating BCR-ABL cells, the major CML driver, and increase overall and disease-free survival. However, mutant clones, pre-existing or due to therapy, develop resistance against TKIs. BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein activates various molecular pathways including the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, JAK2/STAT pathway, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Stimulation of these pathways in TKI resistant CML patients, make them a new target. Moreover, a small proportion of CML cells, leukemic stem cells (LSCs), persist during the TKI therapy and sustain the disease in the patient. Engraftment of LSCs in the bone marrow niche and dysregulation of miRNA participate greatly in the TKI resistance. Current efforts are needed for determining the reason behind TKI resistance, identification, and elimination of CML LSC might be of great need for cancer cure.

                Atmospheric nitrogen fixation carried out by microorganisms has environmental and industrial importance, related to the increase of soil fertility and productivity. The present work proposes the development of a new high precision system that allows the recognition of amino acid sequences of the nitrogenase enzyme (NifH) as a promising way to improve the identification of diazotrophic bacteria. For this purpose, a database obtained from UniProt built a processed dataset formed by a set of 4911 and 4782 amino acid sequences of the NifH and non-NifH proteins respectively. Subsequently, the feature extraction was developed using two methodologies: (i) k-mers counting and (ii) embedding layers to obtain numerical vectors of the amino acid chains. Afterward, for the embedding layer, the data was crossed by an external trainable convolutional layer, which received a uniform matrix and applied convolution using filters to obtain the feature maps of the model. Finally, a deep neural network was used as the primary model to classify the amino acid sequences as NifH protein or not. Performance evaluation experiments were carried out, and the results revealed an accuracy of 96.4%, a sensitivity of 95.2%, and a specificity of 96.7%. Therefore, an amino acid sequence-based feature extraction method that uses a neural network to detect N-fixing organisms is proposed and implemented.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genre analysis of introduction section in electrical engineering undergraduate laboratory reports [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the genre of Engineering Laboratory Reports (ELR) introduction section written by Electrical Engineering Undergraduates in a higher learning institution. The aims of this study are to identify the rhetorical moves and combinations of move patterns used by engineering students to write introduction section of ELR.  Method A genre analysis was conducted to identify writing patterns and convention practices of engineering undergraduate students thus a corpus of N= 35 was selected from electrical engineering students in their final year of study. This study adopted Genre Theory as its theoretical framework, [1] analytical framework and [2] BCU approach for analysis procedure. A pilot test was conducted to determine the model that fits the best to describe moves and steps of ELR. The study benchmarks a move or step to be present in at least 60% of the reports.  Results The finding shows the introduction consists of one main move which is providing background information of the experiment and followed by four subsequent steps which are reference to research purposes, reference to theoretical knowledge in the field, providing an overview of the study and identification of main research apparatus. The move 1 and all four steps identified above are viewed as conventional move and steps of introduction section only among undergraduates in academic context. The exemplification of finding pave ways to address grey areas of improvement in scientific written genre among laboratory instructors and academics. The method employed in this study may be replicated to analyse other sections of scientific and technical reports such as method, result, discussion and conclusion (MRDC).  Conclusion This study posits the importance of collaboration between English for Academic (EAP) practitioners such as English-writing instructors and discipline specific specialist from engineering field to further improve on genre-based writing instruction, and to identify student learning needs.

                Background: Mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and their aggravation have been studied extensively in the general population. However, there are few studies on depression in older adults and the few existing results may be contradictory, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with depression in older adults in two coastal regions of Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study uses an analytical cross-sectional design in a population of older adults, who participated in a non-governmental ambulatory social support program in Callao and Ica, two coastal regions of Peru. We administered an on-site structured questionnaire to record sociodemographic data, the Geriatric Depression Scale by Yesavage to measure depression, and the Barthel Index to assess physical function. In order to determine cognitive impairment as an exclusion criterion, the MEC-30 was used. The association between variables was assessed through contingency tables, using the odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding confidence interval (95% CI) and the X2 test. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: Out of the 244 older adults surveyed, 39% had depressive symptoms, of which 28.3% (n=69) and 10.7% (n=26) were moderately and severely depressive, respectively. The findings significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms were being 76 years old or older [p=0.005, OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29-4.20], not participating in weekly recreational activities [p=0.004, OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.31-3.99] and the presence of comorbidities [p=0.026, OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.07-3.29]. Conclusion: There are few studies exploring depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic; this research shows the importance of mental health care in this population and, particularly, of those who are 76 or older because they suffer from comorbid conditions and have interrupted recreational activities.

                Background: Anxiety is common among oncology nurses due to the complexity of oncology patients' needs and demands. The current study aimed to assess the anxiety level among newly hired nurses in a specialized oncology hospital throughout their initial period of employment, deploying a General Nursing Orientation (GNO) and the Clinical Resource Nurse (CRN) role. Methods: A longitudinal one-group repeated measure design was used. Participants' demographics sheet and Sate-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults questionnaire were used. A total of 181 newly hired nurses participated in the study. Results: The anxiety level among newly hired oncology nurses was (mean=38.65, SD=9.58) at the beginning of GNO, and the level of anxiety was highest after 90 days of employment (mean=45.71, SD=7.20). The level of anxiety among newly hired oncology nurses increased gradually from day one of the GNO, the last day of GNO, and finally, after 90 days of employment. Conclusions: Nurses working in oncology workplaces face anxiety. It is important to seek nursing administrators' attention to apply proper strategies to decrease the anxiety level among newly hired nurses to help them smoothly fit into a new team to ensure safe patient care.

                Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the care-seeking behaviour among adolescents with patellofemoral pain (PFP). Methods: This retrospective study included data on 121 adolescents with PFP enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. A questionnaire was sent to the general practitioner (GP) of each adolescent, assessing information on the consultation dates for knee pain, potential diagnoses, and treatment provided. Results: 106/121 adolescents had been in contact with their GP, and 95 medical records of adolescents were available. Of the 95 adolescents with available medical records 60 had consulted their GP for knee pain. The median number of contacts was 1.5 (range 1-7). The GPs initiated treatment for 48 of the 60 adolescents and in most cases it was information and advice (36/48) or pain medication to a minor extent (6/48). Out of the 60 adolescents who consulted their GP 26 were subsequently referred to different types of health care professionals, in 11 out of 26 to physiotherapy, but also to the department of rheumatology or orthopaedics. Conclusions: 63% of adolescents diagnosed with PFP had previously consulted their GP due to knee pain. Several types of treatments were initiated by the GP, but most commonly advice and information were given. Standardized and evidence-based treatment guidelines for adolescent knee pain in general practice are needed

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Collaboration in neuroscience is impeded by the difficulty of sharing primary data, results, and software across labs. Here, we introduce Neuroscience Data Interface (NDI), a platform-independent standard that allows an analyst to use and create software that functions independently from the format of the raw data or the manner in which the data are organized into files. The interface is rooted in a simple vocabulary that describes common apparatus and storage devices used in neuroscience experiments. Results of analyses, and analyses of analyses, are stored as documents in a scalable, queryable database that stores the relationships and history among the experiment elements and documents. The interface allows the development of an application ecosystem where applications can focus on calculation rather than data format or organization. This tool can be used by individual labs to exchange and analyze data, and it can serve to curate neuroscience data for searchable archives.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Seizure prediction is the grand challenge of epileptology. However, effort was devoted to prediction of focal seizures, while generalized seizures were regarded as stochastic events. Long-lasting local field potential (LFP) recordings containing several hundred generalized spike and wave discharges (SWDs), acquired at eight locations in the cortico-thalamic system of absence epileptic rats, were iteratively analyzed in all possible combinations of either two or three recording sites, by a wavelet-based algorithm, calculating the product of the wavelet-energy signaling increases in synchronicity. Sensitivity and false alarm rate of prediction were compared between various combinations, and wavelet spectra of true and false positive predictions were fed to a random forest machine learning algorithm to further differentiate between them. Wavelet analysis of intracortical and cortico-thalamic LFP traces showed a significantly smaller number of false alarms compared with intrathalamic combinations, while predictions based on recordings in Layers IV, V, and VI of the somatosensory-cortex significantly outreached all other combinations in terms of prediction sensitivity. In 24-h out-of-sample recordings of nine Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), containing diurnal fluctuations of SWD occurrence, classification of true and false positives by the trained random forest further reduced the false alarm rate by 71%, although at some trade-off between false alarms and sensitivity of prediction, as reflected in relatively low F1 score values. Results provide support for the cortical-focus theory of absence epilepsy and allow the conclusion that SWDs are predictable to some degree. The latter paves the way for the development of closed-loop SWD prediction-prevention systems. Suggestions for a possible translation to human data are outlined.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Despite significant progress in understanding neural coding, it remains unclear how the coordinated activity of large populations of neurons relates to what an observer actually perceives. Since neurophysiological differences must underlie differences among percepts, <I>differentiation analysis</I>&mdash;quantifying distinct patterns of neurophysiological activity&mdash;has been proposed as an "inside-out" approach that addresses this question. This methodology contrasts with "outside-in" approaches such as feature tuning and decoding analyses, which are defined in terms of extrinsic experimental variables. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging in mice of both sexes to systematically survey stimulus-evoked neurophysiological differentiation (ND) in excitatory neuronal populations in layers (L)2/3, L4, and L5 across five visual cortical areas (primary, lateromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, and anteromedial) in response to naturalistic and phase-scrambled movie stimuli. We find that unscrambled stimuli evoke greater ND than scrambled stimuli specifically in L2/3 of the anterolateral and anteromedial areas, and that this effect is modulated by arousal state and locomotion. By contrast, decoding performance was far above chance and did not vary substantially across areas and layers. Differentiation also differed within the unscrambled stimulus set, suggesting that differentiation analysis may be used to probe the ethological relevance of individual stimuli.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>There is consensus that primary auditory cortex (A1) utilizes a combination of rate codes and temporally precise population codes to represent discreet auditory objects. During the response to auditory streams, forward suppression constrains cortical rate coding strategies, but it may also be well positioned to enhance temporal coding strategies that rely on synchronized firing across neural ensembles. Here, we exploited the rapid temporal dynamics of bat echolocation to investigate how forward suppression modulates the cortical ensemble representation of complex acoustic signals embedded in echo streams. We recorded from auditory cortex of anesthetized free-tailed bats while stimulating the auditory system with naturalistic biosonar pulse-echo sequences covering a range of pulse emission rates. As expected, increasing pulse repetition rate significantly reduced the number of spikes per echo stimulus, but it also increased spike timing precision and doubled the information gain. This increased spike-timing precision translated into more robust inter-neuronal synchronization patterns with &gt;10-dB higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the ensemble level. We propose that forward suppression dynamically mediates a trade-off between the sensitive detection of isolated sounds versus precise spatiotemporal encoding of ongoing sound sequences in auditory cortex.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Over half of all spinal cord injuries (SCIs) are cervical, which can lead to paralysis and respiratory compromise, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Effective treatments to restore breathing after severe upper cervical injury are lacking; thus, it is imperative to develop therapies to address this. Epidural stimulation has successfully restored motor function after SCI for stepping, standing, reaching, grasping, and postural control. We hypothesized that closed-loop stimulation triggered via healthy hemidiaphragm EMG activity has the potential to elicit functional neuroplasticity in spinal respiratory pathways after cervical SCI (cSCI). To test this, we delivered closed-loop, electrical, epidural stimulation (CLES) at the level of the phrenic motor nucleus (C4) for 3 d after C2 hemisection (C2HS) in freely behaving rats. A 2 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 2 Latin Square experimental design incorporated two treatments, C2HS injury and CLES therapy resulting in four groups of adult, female Sprague Dawley rats: C2HS + CLES (<I>n</I> = 8), C2HS (<I>n</I> = 6), intact + CLES (<I>n</I> = 6), intact (<I>n</I> = 6). In stimulated groups, CLES was delivered for 12&ndash;20 h/d for 3 d. After C2HS, 3 d of CLES robustly facilitated the slope of stimulus-response curves of ipsilesional spinal motor evoked potentials (sMEPs) versus nonstimulated controls. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of CLES eliciting respiratory neuroplasticity after C2HS in freely behaving animals. These findings suggest CLES as a promising future therapy to address respiratory deficiency associated with cSCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Complexes of Ghrelin GHS-R1a, GHS-R1b, and Dopamine D1 Receptors Localized in the Ventral Tegmental Area as Main Mediators of the Dopaminergic Effects of Ghrelin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ghrelin receptor, also known as growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1a), is coexpressed with its truncated isoform GHS-R1b, which does not bind ghrelin or signal, but oligomerizes with GHS-R1a, exerting a complex modulatory role that depends on its relative expression. D<SUB>1</SUB> dopamine receptor (D1R) and D5R constitute the two D<SUB>1</SUB>-like receptor subtypes. Previous studies showed that GHS-R1b also facilitates oligomerization of GHS-R1a with D1R, conferring GHS-R1a distinctive pharmacological properties. Those include a switch in the preferred coupling of GHS-R1a from Gq to Gs and the ability of D1R/D5R agonists and antagonists to counteract GHS-R1a signaling. Activation of ghrelin receptors localized in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) seems to play a significant role in the contribution of ghrelin to motivated behavior. In view of the evidence indicating that dopaminergic cells of the VTA express ghrelin receptors and D5R, but not D1R, we investigated the possible existence of functional GHS-R1a:GHS-R1b:D5R oligomeric complexes in the VTA. GHS-R1a:GHS-R1b:D5R oligomers were first demonstrated in mammalian transfected cells, and their pharmacological properties were found to be different from those of GHS-R1a:GHS-R1b:D1R oligomers, including weak Gs coupling and the ability of D1R/D5R antagonists, but not agonists, to counteract the effects of ghrelin. However, analyzing the effect of ghrelin in the rodent VTA on MAPK activation with <I>ex vivo</I> experiments, on somatodendritic dopamine release with <I>in vivo</I> microdialysis and on the activation of dopaminergic cells with patch-clamp electrophysiology, provided evidence for a predominant role of GHS-R1a:GHS-R1b:D1R oligomers in the rodent VTA as main mediators of the dopaminergic effects of ghrelin.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The activation of ghrelin receptors localized in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a significant role in the contribution of ghrelin to motivated behavior. We present evidence that indicates these receptors form part of oligomeric complexes that include the functional ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a, its truncated nonsignaling isoform GHS-R1b, and the dopamine D<SUB>1</SUB> receptor (D1R). The binding of ghrelin to these complexes promotes activation of the dopaminergic neurons of the VTA by activation of adenylyl cyclase&ndash;protein kinase A signaling, which can be counteracted by both GHS-R1a and D1R antagonists. Our study provides evidence for a predominant role of GHS-R1a:GHS-R1b:D1R oligomers in rodent VTA as main mediators of the dopaminergic effects of ghrelin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presynaptic Mitochondrial Volume and Packing Density Scale with Presynaptic Power Demand</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stable neural function requires an energy supply that can meet the intense episodic power demands of neuronal activity. Neurons have presumably optimized the volume of their bioenergetic machinery to ensure these power demands are met, but the relationship between presynaptic power demands and the volume available to the bioenergetic machinery has never been quantified. Here, we estimated the power demands of six motor nerve terminals in female <I>Drosophila</I> larvae through direct measurements of neurotransmitter release and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and via theoretical estimates of Na<sup>+</sup> entry and power demands at rest. Electron microscopy revealed that terminals with the highest power demands contained the greatest volume of mitochondria, indicating that mitochondria are allocated according to presynaptic power demands. In addition, terminals with the greatest power demand-to-volume ratio (~66 nmol&middot;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup>&middot;&micro;l<sup>&ndash;1</sup>) harbor the largest mitochondria packed at the greatest density. If we assume sequential and complete oxidation of glucose by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, then these mitochondria are required to produce ATP at a rate of 52 nmol&middot;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup>&middot;&micro;l<sup>&ndash;1</sup> at rest, rising to 963 during activity. Glycolysis would contribute ATP at 0.24 nmol&middot;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup>&middot;&micro;l<sup>&ndash;1</sup> of cytosol at rest, rising to 4.36 during activity. These data provide a quantitative framework for presynaptic bioenergetics <I>in situ</I>, and reveal that, beyond an immediate capacity to accelerate ATP output from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, over longer time periods presynaptic terminals optimize mitochondrial volume and density to meet power demand.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The remarkable energy demands of the brain are supported by the complete oxidation of its fuel but debate continues regarding a division of labor between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation across different cell types. Here, we exploit the neuromuscular synapse, a model for studying neurophysiology, to elucidate fundamental aspects of neuronal energy metabolism that ultimately constrain rates of neural processing. We quantified energy production rates required to sustain activity at individual nerve terminals and compared these with the volume capable of oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) and glycolysis (cytosol). We find strong support for oxidative phosphorylation playing a primary role in presynaptic terminals and provide the first <I>in vivo</I> estimates of energy production rates per unit volume of presynaptic mitochondria and cytosol.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatiotemporal Control of Noradrenaline-Dependent Synaptic Transmission in Mouse Dorsal Raphe Serotonin Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Activity of dorsal raphe neurons is controlled by noradrenaline afferents. In this brain region, noradrenaline activates G&alpha;<SUB>q</SUB>-coupled &alpha;1-adrenergic receptors (&alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>), causing action potential (AP) firing and serotonin release. <I>In vitro</I>, electrical stimulation elicits vesicular noradrenaline release and subsequent activation of &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB> to produce an EPSC (&alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>-EPSC). The duration of the &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>-EPSC (~27 s) is much longer than that of most other synaptic currents, but the factors that govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB> are poorly understood. Using an acute brain slice preparation from adult male and female mice and electrophysiological recordings from dorsal raphe neurons, we found that the time course of the &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>-EPSC was slow, but highly consistent within individual serotonin neurons. The amount of noradrenaline released influenced the amplitude of the &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>-EPSC without altering the time constant of decay suggesting that once released, extracellular noradrenaline was cleared efficiently. Reuptake of noradrenaline via noradrenaline transporters was a primary means of terminating the &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>-EPSC, with little evidence for extrasynaptic diffusion of noradrenaline unless transporter-dependent reuptake was impaired. Taken together, the results demonstrate that despite slow intrinsic signaling kinetics, noradrenaline-dependent synaptic transmission in the dorsal raphe is temporally and spatially controlled and noradrenaline transporters are critical regulators of serotonin neuron excitability. Given the functionally distinct types of neurons intermingled in the dorsal raphe nucleus and the unique roles of these neural circuits in physiological responses, transporters may preserve independence of each synapse to encode a long-lasting but discrete signal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The dorsal raphe nucleus is the predominant source of serotonin in the brain and is controlled by another monoamine, noradrenaline. In this brain region, noradrenaline activates G-protein-coupled &alpha;1-adrenergic receptors (&alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>) causing action potential (AP) firing and serotonin release. Despite high interest in pharmacotherapies to enhance serotonin signaling, the factors that govern noradrenaline &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB> signaling have received little attention. Here, we show using mouse brain slices that the time course of &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB> signaling is slow, persisting for tens of seconds. Despite slow intrinsic signaling kinetics, noradrenaline-dependent synaptic transmission in the dorsal raphe is controlled temporally and spatially by efficient noradrenaline transporter-dependent clearance of extracellular noradrenaline. Thus, noradrenaline transporters are critical regulators of serotonin neuron excitability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Integration of Subquantal Neurotransmission by Colocalized G Protein-Coupled Receptors in Presynaptic Terminals</a></h4>

              
                <p>In presynaptic terminals, membrane-delimited G<SUB>i/o</SUB>-mediated presynaptic inhibition is ubiquitous and acts via G&beta; to inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, or directly at SNARE complexes to inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent synaptotagmin-SNARE complex interactions. At CA1-subicular presynaptic terminals, 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> and GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors colocalize. GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, whereas 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptors target SNARE complexes. We demonstrate in male and female rats that GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors alter P<SUB>r</SUB>, whereas 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptors reduce evoked cleft glutamate concentrations, allowing differential inhibition of AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs. This reduction in cleft glutamate concentration was confirmed by imaging glutamate release using a genetic sensor (iGluSnFR). Simulations of glutamate release and postsynaptic glutamate receptor currents were made. We tested effects of changes in vesicle numbers undergoing fusion at single synapses, relative placement of fusing vesicles and postsynaptic receptors, and the rate of release of glutamate from a fusion pore. Experimental effects of P<SUB>r</SUB> changes, consistent with GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptor effects, were straightforwardly represented by changes in numbers of synapses. The effects of 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptor-mediated inhibition are well fit by simulated modulation of the release rate of glutamate into the cleft. Colocalization of different actions of GPCRs provides synaptic integration within presynaptic terminals. Train-dependent presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation forces frequency-dependent recovery of neurotransmission during 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptor activation. This is consistent with competition between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-synaptotagmin and G&beta; at SNARE complexes. Thus, stimulus trains in 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptor agonist unveil dynamic synaptic modulation and a sophisticated hippocampal output filter that itself is modulated by colocalized GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors, which alter presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In combination, these pathways allow complex presynaptic integration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Two G protein-coupled receptors colocalize at presynaptic sites, to mediate presynaptic modulation by G&beta;, but one (a GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptor) inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry whereas another (a 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptor) competes with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-synaptotagmin binding to the synaptic vesicle machinery. We have investigated downstream effects of signaling and integrative properties of these receptors. Their effects are profoundly different. GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors alter P<SUB>r</SUB> leaving synaptic properties unchanged, whereas 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptors fundamentally change properties of synaptic transmission, modifying AMPAR but sparing NMDAR responses. Coactivation of these receptors allows synaptic integration because of convergence of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptor alteration on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the effect of this altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal on 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptor signaling. This presynaptic convergence provides a novel form of synaptic integration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stochastic Properties of Spontaneous Synaptic Transmission at Individual Active Zones</a></h4>

              
                <p>Using postsynaptically tethered calcium sensor GCaMP, we investigated spontaneous synaptic transmission at individual active zones (AZs) at the <I>Drosophila</I> (both sexes) neuromuscular junction. Optical monitoring of GCaMP events coupled with focal electrical recordings of synaptic currents revealed "hot spots" of spontaneous transmission, which corresponded to transient states of elevated activity at selected AZs. The elevated spontaneous activity had two temporal components, one at a timescale of minutes and the other at a subsecond timescale. We developed a three-state model of AZ preparedness for spontaneous transmission and performed Monte Carlo simulations of the release process, which produced an accurate quantitative description of the variability and time course of spontaneous transmission at individual AZs. To investigate the mechanisms of elevated activity, we first focused on the protein complexin, which binds the SNARE protein complex and serves to clamp spontaneous fusion. Overexpression of <I>Drosophila</I> complexin largely abolished the high-activity states of AZs, while complexin deletion drastically promoted it. A mutation in the SNARE protein Syntaxin-1A had an effect similar to complexin deficiency, promoting the high-activity state. We next tested how presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients affect the states of elevated activity at individual AZs. We either blocked or promoted Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pharmacologically, and also promoted Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores. These experiments coupled with computations revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients can trigger bursts of spontaneous events from individual AZs or AZ clusters at a subsecond timescale. Together, our results demonstrated that spontaneous transmission is highly heterogeneous, with transient hot spots being regulated by the SNARE machinery and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spontaneous synaptic transmission is a vital component of neuronal communication, since it regulates the neuronal development and plasticity. Our study demonstrated that spontaneous transmission is highly heterogeneous and that nerve terminals create transient "hot spots" of spontaneous release of neuronal transmitters. We show that these hot spots are regulated by the protein machinery mediating the release process and by calcium ions. These results contribute to our understanding of spontaneous synaptic transmission as a dynamic, plastic, and tightly regulated signaling mechanism and unravel fundamental biophysical properties of neuronal communication.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Late-Onset, Short-Term Intermittent Fasting Reverses Age-Related Changes in Calcium Buffering and Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission in Mouse Basal Forebrain Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging is often associated with cognitive decline and recurrent cellular and molecular impairments. While life-long caloric restriction (CR) may delay age-related cognitive deterioration as well as the onset of neurologic disease, recent studies suggest that late-onset, short-term intermittent fasting (IF), may show comparable beneficial effects as those of life-long CR to improve brain health. We used a new optogenetic aging model to study the effects of late-onset (&gt;18 months), short-term (four to six weeks) IF on age-related changes in GABAergic synaptic transmission, intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) buffering, and cognitive status. We used male mice from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse line with stable expression of the channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) variant H134R [VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP] in a reduced synaptic preparation that allows for specific optogenetic light stimulation on GABAergic synaptic terminals across aging. We performed quantal analysis using the method of failures in this model and show that short-term IF reverses the age-related decrease in quantal content of GABAergic synapses. Likewise, short-term IF also reversed age-related changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering and spontaneous GABAergic synaptic transmission in basal forebrain (BF) neurons of aged mice. Our findings suggest that late-onset short-term IF can reverse age-related physiological impairments in mouse BF neurons but that four weeks IF is not sufficient to reverse age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here, we demonstrate plasticity of the aging brain and reversal of well-defined hallmarks of brain aging using short-term intermittent fasting (IF) initiated later in life. Few therapeutics are currently available to treat age-related neurologic dysfunction although synaptic dysfunction occurs during aging and neurologic disease is a topic of intense research. Using a new reduced synaptic preparation and optogenetic stimulation we are able to study age-related synaptic mechanisms in greater detail. Several neurophysiological parameters including quantal content were altered during aging and were reversed with short-term IF. These methods can be used to identify potential therapies to reverse physiological dysfunction during aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Altered Excitation-Inhibition Balance on Decision Making in a Cortical Circuit Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>The synaptic balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) is a fundamental principle of cortical circuits, and disruptions in E/I balance are commonly linked to cognitive deficits such as impaired decision-making. Explanatory gaps remain in a mechanistic understanding of how E/I balance contributes to cognitive computations, and how E/I disruptions at the synaptic level can propagate to induce behavioral deficits. Here, we studied how E/I perturbations may impair perceptual decision-making in a biophysically-based association cortical circuit model. We found that both elevating and lowering E/I ratio, via NMDA receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction at inhibitory interneurons and excitatory pyramidal neurons, respectively, can similarly impair psychometric performance, following an inverted-U dependence. Nonetheless, these E/I perturbations differentially alter the process of evidence accumulation across time. Under elevated E/I ratio, decision-making is impulsive, overweighting early evidence and underweighting late evidence. Under lowered E/I ratio, decision-making is indecisive, with both evidence integration and winner-take-all competition weakened. The distinct time courses of evidence accumulation at the circuit level can be measured at the behavioral level, using multiple psychophysical task paradigms which provide dissociable predictions. These results are well captured by a generalized drift-diffusion model (DDM) with self-coupling, implementing leaky or unstable integration, which thereby links biophysical circuit modeling to algorithmic process modeling and facilitates model fitting to behavioral choice data. In general, our findings characterize critical roles of cortical E/I balance in cognitive function, bridging from biophysical to behavioral levels of analysis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive deficits in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, have been associated with alterations in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I) in cerebral cortical circuits. However, the circuit mechanisms by which E/I imbalance leads to cognitive deficits in decision-making have remained unclear. We used a computational model of decision-making in cortical circuits to study the neural and behavioral effects of E/I imbalance. We found that elevating and lowering E/I ratio produce distinct modes of dysfunction in decision-making processes, which can be dissociated in behavior through psychophysical task paradigms. The biophysical circuit model can be mapped onto a psychological model of decision-making which can facilitate experimental tests of model predictions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Biased Orientation and Color Tuning of the Human Visual Gamma Rhythm</a></h4>

              
                <p>Narrowband  oscillations (NBG: ~20-60 Hz) in visual cortex reflect rhythmic fluctuations in population activity generated by underlying circuits tuned for stimulus location, orientation, and color. A variety of theories posit a specific role for NBG in encoding and communicating this information within visual cortex. However, recent findings suggest a more nuanced role for NBG, given its dependence on certain stimulus feature configurations, such as coherent-oriented edges and specific hues. Motivated by these factors, we sought to quantify the independent and joint tuning properties of NBG to oriented and color stimuli using intracranial recordings from the human visual cortex (male and female). NBG was shown to display a cardinal orientation bias (horizontal) and also an end- and mid-spectral color bias (red/blue and green). When jointly probed, the cardinal bias for orientation was attenuated and an end-spectral preference for red and blue predominated. This loss of mid-spectral tuning occurred even for recording sites showing large responses to uniform green stimuli. Our results demonstrate the close, yet complex, link between the population dynamics driving NBG oscillations and known feature selectivity biases for orientation and color within visual cortex. Such a bias in stimulus tuning imposes new constraints on the functional significance of the visual  rhythm. More generally, these biases in population electrophysiology will need to be considered in experiments using orientation or color features to examine the role of visual cortex in other domains, such as working memory and decision-making.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oscillations in electrophysiological activity occur in visual cortex in response to stimuli that strongly drive the orientation or color selectivity of visual neurons. The significance of this induced " rhythm" to brain function remains unclear. Answering this question requires understanding how and why some stimuli can reliably generate oscillatory  activity while others do not. We examined how different orientations and colors independently and jointly modulate  oscillations in the human brain. Our data show that  oscillations are greatest for certain orientations and colors that reflect known response biases in visual cortex. Such findings complicate the functional significance of  oscillations but open new avenues for linking circuits to population dynamics in visual cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pathways for Memory, Cognition and Emotional Context: Hippocampal, Subgenual Area 25, and Amygdalar Axons Show Unique Interactions in the Primate Thalamic Reuniens Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The reuniens nucleus (RE) is situated at the most ventral position of the midline thalamus. In rats and mice RE is distinguished by bidirectional connections with the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a role in memory and cognition. In primates, many foundational questions pertaining to RE remain unresolved. We addressed these issues by investigating the composition of the rhesus monkey RE in both sexes by labeling for GABA, a marker of inhibitory neurons, and for the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), and calretinin (CR), which label thalamic excitatory neurons that project to cortex. As in rats and mice, the macaque RE was mostly populated by CB and CR neurons, characteristic of matrix-dominant nuclei, and had bidirectional connections with hippocampus and mPFC area 25 (A25). Unlike rodents, we found GABAergic neurons in the monkey RE and a sparser but consistent population of core-associated thalamocortical PV neurons. RE had stronger connections with the basal amygdalar complex than in rats or mice. Amygdalar terminations were enriched with mitochondria and frequently formed successive synapses with the same postsynaptic structures, suggesting an active and robust pathway to RE. Significantly, hippocampal pathways formed multisynaptic complexes that uniquely involved excitatory projection neurons and dendrites of local inhibitory neurons in RE, extending this synaptic principle beyond sensory to high-order thalamic nuclei. Convergent pathways from hippocampus, A25, and amygdala in RE position it to flexibly coordinate activity for memory, cognition, and emotional context, which are disrupted in several psychiatric and neurologic diseases in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The primate RE is a central node for memory and cognition through connections with the hippocampus and mPFC. As in rats or mice, the primate RE is a matrix-dominant thalamic nucleus, suggesting signal traffic to the upper cortical layers. Unlike rats or mice, the primate RE contains inhibitory neurons, synaptic specializations with the hippocampal pathway, and robust connections with the amygdala, suggesting unique adaptations. Convergence of hippocampal, mPFC, and amygdalar pathways in RE may help unravel a circuit basis for binding diverse signals for conscious flexible behaviors and the synthesis of memory with affective significance in primates, whereas disruption of distinct circuit nodes may occur in psychiatric disorders in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Activity-Dependent Increase in Synaptic Inhibition and Parvalbumin Interneuron Recruitment in Dentate Granule Cells and Semilunar Granule Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Strong inhibitory synaptic gating of dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs), attributed largely to fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs), is essential to maintain sparse network activity needed for dentate dependent behaviors. However, the contribution of PV-INs to basal and input-driven sustained synaptic inhibition in GCs and semilunar granule cells (SGCs), a sparse morphologically distinct dentate projection neuron subtype, is currently unknown. In studies conducted in hippocampal slices from mice, we find that although basal IPSCs are more frequent in SGCs and optical activation of PV-INs reliably elicited IPSCs in both GCs and SGCs, optical suppression of PV-INs failed to reduce IPSC frequency in either cell type. Amplitude and kinetics of IPSCs evoked by perforant path (PP) activation were not different between GCs and SGCs. However, the robust increase in sustained polysynaptic IPSCs elicited by paired afferent stimulation was lower in SGCs than in simultaneously recorded GCs. Optical suppression of PV-IN selectively reduced sustained IPSCs in SGCs but not in GCs. These results demonstrate that PV-INs, while contributing minimally to basal synaptic inhibition in both GCs and SGCs in slices, mediate sustained feedback inhibition selectively in SGCs. The temporally selective blunting of activity-driven sustained inhibitory gating of SGCs could support their preferential and persistent recruitment during behavioral tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our study identifies that feedback inhibitory regulation of dentate semilunar granule cells (SGCs), a sparse and functionally distinct class of projection neurons, differs from that of the classical projection neurons, GCs. Notably, we demonstrate relatively lower activity-dependent increase in sustained feedback inhibitory synaptic inputs to SGCs when compared with GCs which would facilitate their persistent activity and preferential recruitment as part of memory ensembles. Since dentate GC activity levels during memory processing are heavily shaped by basal and feedback inhibition, the fundamental differences in basal and evoked sustained inhibition between SGCs and GCs characterized here provide a framework to reorganize current understanding of the dentate circuit processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Suppresses Drift in Cortical Memory Representations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Memory retrieval is thought to depend on the reinstatement of cortical memory representations guided by pattern completion processes in the hippocampus. The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is one of the intermediary regions supporting hippocampal&ndash;cortical interactions and houses neurons that prospectively signal past events in a familiar environment. To investigate the functional relevance of the activity of the LEC for cortical reinstatement, we pharmacologically inhibited the LEC and examined its impact on the stability of ensemble firing patterns in one of the efferent targets of the LEC, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). When male rats underwent multiple epochs of identical stimulus sequences in the same environment, the mPFC maintained a stable ensemble firing pattern across repetitions, particularly when the sequence included pairings of neutral and aversive stimuli. With LEC inhibition, the mPFC still formed an ensemble pattern that accurately captured stimuli and their associations within each epoch. However, LEC inhibition markedly disrupted its consistency across the epochs by decreasing the proportion of mPFC neurons that stably maintained firing selectivity for stimulus associations. Thus, the LEC stabilizes cortical representations of learned stimulus associations, thereby facilitating the recovery of the original memory trace without generating a new, redundant trace for familiar experiences. Failure of this process might underlie retrieval deficits in conditions associated with degeneration of the LEC, such as normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To recall past events, the brain needs to reactivate the activity patterns that occurred during those events. However, such reinstatement of memory traces is not trivial because it goes against the natural tendency of the brain to restructure the activity patterns continuously. We found that dysfunction of a brain region called the LEC worsened the drift of the brain activity when rats repeatedly underwent the same events in the same room and made them behave as if they had never experienced these events before. Thus, the LEC stabilizes the brain activity to facilitate the recovery of the original memory trace. Failure of this process might underlie memory problems in elderly and Alzheimer's disease patients with the degenerated LEC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Task-Related Modulation of Sensorimotor GABA+ Levels in Association with Brain Activity and Motor Performance: A Multimodal MRS-fMRI Study in Young and Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent studies suggest an important role of the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA for motor performance in the context of aging. Nonetheless, as previous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies primarily reported resting-state GABA levels, much less is known about transient changes in GABA levels during motor task performance and how these relate to behavior and brain activity patterns. Therefore, we investigated GABA+ levels of left primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) acquired before, during, and after execution of a unimanual/bimanual action selection task in 30 (human) young adults (YA; age 24.5 &plusmn; 4.1, 15 male) and 30 older adults (OA; age 67.8 &plusmn; 4.9, 14 male). In addition to task-related MRS data, task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired. Behavioral results indicated lower motor performance in OA as opposed to YA, particularly in complex task conditions. MRS results demonstrated lower GABA+ levels in OA as compared with YA. Furthermore, a transient task-related decrease of GABA+ levels was observed, regardless of age. Notably, this task-induced modulation of GABA+ levels was linked to task-related brain activity patterns in SM1 such that a more profound task-induced instantaneous lowering of GABA+ was related to higher SM1 activity. Additionally, higher brain activity was related to better performance in the bimanual conditions, despite some age-related differences. Finally, the modulatory capacity of GABA+ was positively related to motor performance in OA but not YA. Together, these results underscore the importance of transient dynamical changes in neurochemical content for brain function and behavior, particularly in the context of aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Emerging evidence designates an important role to regional GABA levels in motor control, especially in the context of aging. However, it remains unclear whether changes in GABA levels emerge when executing a motor task and how these changes relate to brain activity patterns and performance. Here, we identified a transient decrease of sensorimotor GABA+ levels during performance of an action selection task across young adults (YA) and older adults (OA). Interestingly, whereas a more profound GABA+ modulation related to higher brain activity across age groups, its association with motor performance differed across age groups. Within OA, our results highlighted a functional merit of a task-related release from inhibitory tone, i.e. lowering regional GABA+ levels was associated with task-relevant brain activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sensory-Tactile Functional Mapping and Use-Associated Structural Variation of the Human Female Genital Representation Field</a></h4>

              
                <p>The precise location of the human female genital representation field in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is controversial and its capacity for use-associated structural variation as a function of sexual behavior remains unknown. We used a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-compatible sensory-tactile stimulation paradigm to functionally map the location of the female genital representation field in 20 adult women. Neural response to tactile stimulation of the clitoral region (vs right hand) identified individually-diverse focal bilateral activations in dorsolateral areas of S1 (BA1&ndash;BA3) in alignment with anatomic location. We next used cortical surface analyses to assess structural thickness across the 10 individually most activated vertices per hemisphere for each woman. We show that frequency of sexual intercourse within 12 months is correlated with structural thickness of the individually-mapped left genital field. Our results provide a precise functional localization of the female genital field and provide support for use-associated structural variation of the human genital cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We provide a precise location of the human female genital field in the somatosensory cortex and, for the first time, provide evidence in support of structural variation of the human genital field in association with frequency of genital contact. Our study represents a significant methodological advance by individually mapping genital fields for structural analyses. On a secondary level, our results suggest that any study investigating changes in the human genital field must map the field individually to achieve sufficient precision. Our results pave the way for future research into the plasticity of the human genital cortex as a function of normal or adverse experience as well as changes in pathologic conditions, i.e., sexual dysfunction, sexual deviation, or sexual risk-taking behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Representational Dynamics of Sequential Perceptual Averaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is clear that humans can extract statistical information from streams of visual input, yet how our brain processes sequential images into the abstract representation of the mean feature value remains poorly explored. Using multivariate pattern analyses of electroencephalography recorded while human observers viewed 10 sequentially presented Gabors of different orientations to estimate their mean orientation at the end, we investigated sequential averaging mechanism by tracking the quality of individual and mean orientation as a function of sequential position. Critically, we varied the sequential variance of Gabor orientations to understand the neural basis of perceptual mean errors occurring during a sequential averaging task. We found that the mean-orientation representation emerged at specific delays from each sequential stimulus onset and became increasingly accurate as additional Gabors were viewed. Especially in frontocentral electrodes, the neural representation of mean orientation improved more rapidly and to a greater degree in less volatile environments, whereas individual orientation information was encoded precisely regardless of environmental volatility. The computational analysis of behavioral data also showed that perceptual mean errors arise from the cumulative construction of the mean orientation rather than the low-level encoding of individual stimulus orientation. Thus, our findings provide neural mechanisms to differentially accumulate increasingly abstract features from a concrete piece of information across the cortical hierarchy depending on environmental volatility.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The visual system extracts behaviorally relevant summary statistical representation by exploiting statistical regularity of the visual stream over time. However, how the neural representation of the abstract mean feature value develops in a temporally changing environment remains poorly identified. Here, we directly recover the mean orientation information of sequentially delivered Gabor stimuli with different orientations as a function of their positions in time. The mean orientation representation, which is regularly updated, becomes increasingly accurate with increasing sequential position especially in the frontocentral region. Further, perceptual mean errors arise from the cumulative process rather than the low-level stimulus encoding. Overall, our study reveals a role of higher cortical areas in integrating stimulus-specific information into increasingly abstract task-oriented information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sex-Specific Regulation of {beta}-Secretase: A Novel Estrogen Response Element (ERE)-Dependent Mechanism in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Women have a higher prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) than age-matched men, and loss of estrogen might be partially responsible for the higher risk of AD in aged women. While &beta;-secretase (BACE1) plays an important role in AD pathogenesis, whether BACE1 involved the sex difference in AD pathology remains unclear. This study investigated the hypothesis that estrogen regulates BACE1 transcription via the estrogen response element (ERE) and designated pathways. Using estrogen receptor (ER) knock-out mice and mutagenesis of EREs in HEK293 cells, we demonstrated sex-specific inhibition of BACE1 transcription by estrogen via direct binding to ERE sites and ER&alpha;. We also used a repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA) and showed that an REA&ndash;ERE complex downregulated BACE1. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analysis determined that all three EREs at the BACE1 promoter were required for estradiol-mediated downregulation of BACE1 transcription in mice. Last, we confirmed the impairment of the REA pathway in the cortex of female AD patients. Our study identified an estrogen-specific BACE1 transcriptional regulation pathway from cell and animal models to AD patients.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> With the increase in the aging population and Alzheimer's disease worldwide, an urgent need to find effective approaches to treat or prevent AD. Women have a higher prevalence and incidence of AD than men. Identification of the sex-specific risk for AD may be valuable for disease prevention. This study evaluated several estrogen response element (ERE) sites on the promoter of &beta;-secretase (BACE1), a key enzyme for AD pathology. We demonstrated that estrogen downregulated BACE1 transcription through direct binding and complex formation with ERE and cofactors. Our novel findings provide evidence that an estrogen supplement may decrease the risk of AD in menopausal and postmenopausal women. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the "sex-specific" mechanisms of BACE1 as a role in AD pathogenesis.</p>

     alt="Distribution of neurogranin-like immunoreactivity in the brain and sensory organs of the adult zebrafish"/>
<p>The expression and distribution of mammalian neurogranin-like peptides were studied in the brain and sensory organs of adult zebrafish by means of immunocytochemical methods. Results indicate the relation of these neuropeptides with primary and highly integrative centers and suggest a divergent evolution in teleosts.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied the expression of neurogranin in the brain and some sensory organs (barbel taste buds, olfactory organs, and retina) of adult zebrafish. Database analysis shows zebrafish has two paralog neurogranin genes (<i>nrgna</i> and <i>nrgnb</i>) that translate into three peptides with a conserved IQ domain, as in mammals. Western blots of zebrafish brain extracts using an anti-neurogranin antiserum revealed three separate bands, confirming the presence of three neurogranin peptides. Immunohistochemistry shows neurogranin-like expression in the brain and sensory organs (taste buds, neuromasts and olfactory epithelium), not being able to discern its three different peptides. In the retina, the most conspicuous positive cells were bipolar neurons. In the brain, immunopositive neurons were observed in all major regions (pallium, subpallium, preoptic area, hypothalamus, diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, including the cerebellum), a more extended distribution than in mammals. Interestingly, dendrites, cell bodies and axon terminals of some neurons were immunopositive, thus zebrafish neurogranins may play presynaptic and postsynaptic roles. Most positive neurons were found in primary sensory centers (viscerosensory column and medial octavolateral nucleus) and integrative centers (pallium, subpallium, optic tectum and cerebellum), which have complex synaptic circuitry. However, we also observed expression in areas not related to sensory or integrative functions, such as in cerebrospinal fluid-contacting cells associated with the hypothalamic recesses, which exhibited high neurogranin-like immunoreactivity. Together, these results reveal important differences with the patterns reported in mammals, suggesting divergent evolution from the common ancestor.</p>

                Myocardial infarction (MI) is frequently complicated by the worsening of renal function. Undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) becomes crucial to a patient with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). With appropriate management of MI, acute-on-chronic kidney disease (ACKD) requiring dialysis post-MI remains an important clinical predictor of elevated in-hospital mortality among patients with MI.    In this study, we reported an octogenarian patient suffering from STEMI with ACKD and total atrioventricular block (TAVB). She underwent insertion of a temporary pacemaker and primary PCI. Renal function was improved after dialysis by decreasing the amount of serum creatinine from 8.1 mg/dL at admission to 1.05 mg/dL after primary PCI and dialysis. Primary PCI should still be considered for patients with acute MI, even though these patients have kidney disease, to save the heart muscle and even indirectly improve the kidney function itself.

                Virulence is a complex mix of microbial traits and host susceptibility that could ultimately lead to disease. The increased prevalence of multidrug resistant infections complicates treatment options, augmenting the need for developing robust computational methods and pipelines that enable researchers and clinicians to rapidly identify the underlying mechanism(s) of virulence in any given sample/isolate. Consequently, the National Center for Biotechnology and Information at the National Institutes of Health hosted an in-person hackathon in Bethesda, Maryland during July 2019 to assist with developing cloud-based methods to reduce reliance on local computational infrastructure. Groups of attendees were assigned tasks that are relevant to identifying relevant tools, constructing pipelines capable of identifying microbial virulence factors, and managing the associated data and metadata. Specifically, the assigned tasks consisted of the following: data indexing, metabolic functions, virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance, mobile elements in enterococci, and metatranscriptomics. The cloud-based framework established by this hackathon can be augmented and built upon by the research community to aid in the rapid identification of microbial virulence factors.

                Introduction: Acne is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous unit with differential pathogenesis. To elucidate the roles of hormones in acne pathogenesis, we conducted a study to evaluate the serum testosterone, estradiol, progesterone levels in women with acne vulgaris. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study, and 175 women with acne vulgaris were examined; their serum estradiol, progesterone, testosterone were analyzed by chemiluminescence technique and compared with the healthy control group. Results: Increased serum hormone levels in women with acne vulgaris were accounted for 29.7%, and hyperandrogenism was accounted for 16.0% of cases. We found significant differences in testosterone levels (mean value, 55.67±25.56 versus 38.37±10.16 ng/dL, p<0.05) respectively in the acne group and the control group. However, the estradiol level of the acne group (323.15±93.31 pmol/L) was lower than the control group (370.94±58.88 pmol/L) with p<0.05). No statistically significant differences were found for progesterone (0.60±0.38 versus 0.50±0.15 ng/mL, p>0.05) levels. Moreover, we did not find the relationship between serum hormone levels and the severity of acne vulgaris. Conclusion: This study showed that the female acne vulgaris patients may have high serum testosterone levels and low serum estradiol levels compared with those of female controls. However, hormone alterations had no correlation with the acne grades.

                Background: Porcine eyes have been widely used as ex vivo models in glaucoma research, as they share similar features with human eyes. Freeze-thawing is a non-invasive technique that has been used to obliterate living cells in anterior segment ex vivo cultures, to prepare them for further research such as cellular repopulation. This technique has previously been shown to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) in porcine eyes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether freeze-thaw cytoablation causes corresponding canalogram outflow changes in perfused anterior segment cultures (AFT) and whole porcine eyes (WFT). We hypothesized that the known IOP drop in AFT after trabecular meshwork ablation by freeze-thaw would be accompanied by a similarly large change in the distal outflow pattern. Methods: Two-dye (fluorescein and Texas red) reperfusion canalograms were used to compare the outflow time before and after two -80°C cycles of freeze-thaw. We assigned 28 freshly enucleated porcine eyes to four groups: perfused anterior segment dye controls (ACO, n = 6), perfused whole eye dye controls (WCO, n = 6), freeze-thaw treated anterior segment cultures (AFT, n = 10), and freeze-thaw treated whole eyes (WFT, n = 6). Results: In control groups ACO and WCO, the two different dyes had similar filling times. In AFT, the outflow pattern and filling times were unchanged. In WFT, the temporal superior quadrant filled more slowly (p = 0.042) while all others remained unchanged. The qualitative appearance of distal outflow spaces was altered only in some eyes. Conclusions: Freeze-thaw cytoablation caused neither loss nor leakage of distal outflow structures. Surprisingly, the loss of an intact trabecular meshwork over the entire circumference did not result in a general acceleration of quadrant outflow times. The results validate freeze-thawing as a method to generate an extracellular matrix without major structural changes.

The ability to aggregate experimental data analysis and results into a concise and interpretable format is a key step in evaluating the success of an experiment. This critical step determines baselines for reproducibility and is a key requirement for data dissemination. However, in practice it can be difficult to consolidate data analyses that encapsulates the broad range of datatypes available in the life sciences. We present STENCIL, a web templating engine designed to organize, visualize, and enable the sharing of interactive data visualizations. STENCIL leverages a flexible web framework for creating templates to render highly customizable visual front ends. This flexibility enables researchers to render small or large sets of experimental outcomes, producing high-quality downloadable and editable figures that retain their original relationship to the source data. REST API based back ends provide programmatic data access and supports easy data sharing. STENCIL is a lightweight tool that can stream data from Galaxy, a popular bioinformatic analysis web platform. STENCIL has been used to support the analysis and dissemination of two large scale genomic projects containing the complete data analysis for over 2,400 distinct datasets. Code and implementation details are available on GitHub: https://github.com/CEGRcode/stencil

In the absence of point-of-care gonorrhea diagnostics that report antibiotic susceptibility, gonorrhea treatment is empiric and determined by standardized guidelines. These guidelines are informed by estimates of resistance prevalence from national surveillance systems. We examined whether guidelines informed by local, rather than national, surveillance data could reduce the incidence of gonorrhea and increase the effective lifespan of antibiotics used in treatment guidelines. We used a transmission dynamic model of gonorrhea among men who have sex with men (MSM) in 16 U.S. metropolitan areas to determine whether spatially adaptive treatment guidelines based on local estimates of resistance prevalence can extend the effective lifespan of hypothetical antibiotics. The rate of gonorrhea cases in these metropolitan areas was 5,548 cases per 100,000 MSM in 2017. Under the current strategy of updating the treatment guideline when the prevalence of resistance exceeds 5%, we showed that spatially adaptive guidelines could reduce the annual rate of gonorrhea cases by 200 cases (95% uncertainty interval: 169, 232) per 100,000 MSM population while extending the use of a first-line antibiotic by 0.75 (0.55, 0.95) years. One potential strategy to reduce the incidence of gonorrhea while extending the effective lifespan of antibiotics is to inform treatment guidelines based on local, rather than national, resistance prevalence.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Known allosteric proteins have central roles in genetic disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by György Abrusán, David B. Ascher, Michael Inouye</p>

Allostery is a form of protein regulation, where ligands that bind sites located apart from the active site can modify the activity of the protein. The molecular mechanisms of allostery have been extensively studied, because allosteric sites are less conserved than active sites, and drugs targeting them are more specific than drugs binding the active sites. Here we quantify the importance of allostery in genetic disease. We show that 1) known allosteric proteins are central in disease networks, contribute to genetic disease and comorbidities much more than non-allosteric proteins, and there is an association between being allosteric and involvement in disease; 2) they are enriched in many major disease types like hematopoietic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, or diseases of the central nervous system; 3) variants from cancer genome-wide association studies are enriched near allosteric proteins, indicating their importance to polygenic traits; and 4) the importance of allosteric proteins in disease is due, at least partly, to their central positions in protein-protein interaction networks, and less due to their dynamical properties.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">There are no equal opportunity infectors: Epidemiological modelers must rethink our approach to inequality in infection risk</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jon Zelner, Nina B. Masters, Ramya Naraharisetti, Sanyu A. Mojola, Merlin Chowkwanyun, Ryan Malosh</p>

Mathematical models have come to play a key role in global pandemic preparedness and outbreak response: helping to plan for disease burden, hospital capacity, and inform nonpharmaceutical interventions. Such models have played a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic, with transmission models—and, by consequence, modelers—guiding global, national, and local responses to SARS-CoV-2. However, these models have largely not accounted for the social and structural factors, which lead to socioeconomic, racial, and geographic health disparities. In this piece, we raise and attempt to clarify several questions relating to this important gap in the research and practice of infectious disease modeling: Why do epidemiologic models of emerging infections typically ignore known structural drivers of disparate health outcomes? What have been the consequences of a framework focused primarily on aggregate outcomes on infection equity? What should be done to develop a more holistic approach to modeling-based decision-making during pandemics? In this review, we evaluate potential historical and political explanations for the exclusion of drivers of disparity in infectious disease models for emerging infections, which have often been characterized as “equal opportunity infectors” despite ample evidence to the contrary. We look to examples from other disease systems (HIV, STIs) and successes in including social inequity in models of acute infection transmission as a blueprint for how social connections, environmental, and structural factors can be integrated into a coherent, rigorous, and interpretable modeling framework. We conclude by outlining principles to guide modeling of emerging infections in ways that represent the causes of inequity in infection as central rather than peripheral mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sparse balance: Excitatory-inhibitory networks with small bias currents and broadly distributed synaptic weights</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ramin Khajeh, Francesco Fumarola, LF Abbott</p>

Cortical circuits generate excitatory currents that must be cancelled by strong inhibition to assure stability. The resulting excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance can generate spontaneous irregular activity but, in standard balanced E-I models, this requires that an extremely strong feedforward bias current be included along with the recurrent excitation and inhibition. The absence of experimental evidence for such large bias currents inspired us to examine an alternative regime that exhibits asynchronous activity without requiring unrealistically large feedforward input. In these networks, irregular spontaneous activity is supported by a continually changing sparse set of neurons. To support this activity, synaptic strengths must be drawn from high-variance distributions. Unlike standard balanced networks, these sparse balance networks exhibit robust nonlinear responses to uniform inputs and non-Gaussian input statistics. Interestingly, the speed, not the size, of synaptic fluctuations dictates the degree of sparsity in the model. In addition to simulations, we provide a mean-field analysis to illustrate the properties of these networks.

     alt="Comparison of prefrontal cortex sucrose seeking ensembles engaged in multiple seeking sessions: Context is key"/>
<p>TetTag mice self-administered sucrose, then underwent two seeking sessions either in the same or distinct environments. Reactivation of a prelimbic cortex ensemble tagged during the first seeking session shifted from being proportional to operant responding (cue reactivity) in the same context to goal directed (sucrose retrieval responding) in the distinct context.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Encoding of memories, including those associated with prior drug or reward, is thought to take place within distinct populations of neurons, termed ensembles. Neuronal ensembles for drug- and reward-seeking have been identified in regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, but much of our understanding of these ensembles is based on experiments that take place in a single reward-associated environment and measure ensemble encoding over short durations of time. In contrast, reward seeking behavior is evident across different reward-associated environments and persists over time. Using TetTag mice and Fos immunohistochemistry, we examined the relationship between persistent sucrose-seeking and ensemble encoding in mice that undergo seeking sessions in the same or different sucrose self-administration contexts 2 weeks apart. We found that prelimbic (PrL) and anterior cingulate cortex ensembles tagged in the first seeking session were highly sensitive to the context in which a second seeking session took place: reactivation of these ensembles was reduced in the same context but elevated in a distinct sucrose self-administration context. Correlational analyses revealed that ensemble reactivation in the PrL was proportional to the persistence of sucrose seeking behavior across sessions in differing ways in female mice. In the same context, reactivation was proportional to the persistence of non-reinforced operant responses, whereas in a distinct context, reactivation was proportional to the persistence of non-reinforced head entries into the sucrose receptacle. This study underlines the importance of the medial prefrontal cortex importance in maintaining a reward-seeking ensemble over time and identifies context-dependent changes in behavioral correlates of ensemble reactivation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the last years, new evidence has increased the attention on sex differences in the development of children with cerebral palsy (CP). Males seem to present with a higher risk for severe motor impairment and in the response to chirurgical and rehabilitative interventions. The published data confirmed a higher incidence of CP in males than in females. The aim of this literature review was to evaluate the impact of the sex on the most important areas that characterized CP: motor function, comorbidities (pain, cognitive impairment, communications skills, epilepsy, sleep, and behavior), and the different kind of interventions.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The study was undertaken to assess the impact of B cell depletion on humoral and cellular immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in patients with various neuroimmunologic disorders on anti-CD20 therapy. This included an analysis of the T cell vaccine response to the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated prospectively humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in 82 patients with neuroimmunologic disorders on anti-CD20 therapy and 82 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. For quantification of antibodies, the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) immunoassay against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) was used. IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays were performed to assess T cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and the Delta variant.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were found less frequently in patients (70% [57/82]) compared with controls (82/82 [100%], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In patients without detectable B cells (&lt;1 B cell/mcl), seroconversion rates and antibody levels were lower compared to nondepleted (≥1 B cell/mcl) patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). B cell levels ≥1 cell/mcl were sufficient to induce seroconversion in our cohort of anti-CD20 treated patients. In contrast to the antibody response, the T-cell response against the Wuhan strain and the Delta variant was more pronounced in frequency (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and magnitude (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) in B-cell depleted compared to nondepleted patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinnation can be attained in patients on anti-CD20 therapy by the onset of B cell repopulation. In the absence of B cells, a strong T cell response is generated which may help to protect against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this high-risk population.

                <p>Nature, Published online: 09 February 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00305-1">doi:10.1038/d41586-022-00305-1</a></p>Measurements indicate that electrons move in loops between the atoms of an intriguing class of superconducting material. Such dynamics breaks key symmetries of the crystal lattice — suggesting the material hosts a rare state of matter.
