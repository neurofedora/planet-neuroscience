<p>Characterization of early myelin ensheathment during Xenopus mid-larval development was performed by immunostaining for myelin basic protein and by third harmonic generation microscopy. Temporally patterned visual stimuli regulated the extent of myelination.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myelination allows for the regulation of conduction velocity, affecting the precise timing of neuronal inputs important for the development and function of brain circuits. In turn, myelination may be altered by changes in experience, neuronal activity, and vesicular release, but the links between sensory experience, corresponding neuronal activity, and resulting alterations in myelination require further investigation. We thus studied the development of myelination in the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpole, a classic model for studies of visual system development and function because it is translucent and visually responsive throughout the formation of its retinotectal system. We begin with a systematic characterization of the timecourse of early myelin ensheathment in the <i>Xenopus</i> retinotectal system using immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) along with third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, a label-free structural imaging technique. Based on the mid-larval developmental progression of MBP expression in <i>Xenopus</i>, we identified an appropriate developmental window in which to assess the effects of early temporally patterned visual experience on myelin ensheathment. We used calcium imaging of axon terminals in vivo to characterize the responses of retinal ganglion cells over a range of stroboscopic stimulation frequencies. Strobe frequencies that reliably elicited robust versus dampened calcium responses were then presented to animals for 7 d, and differences in the amount of early myelin ensheathment at the optic chiasm were subsequently quantified. This study provides evidence that it is not just the presence but also to the specific temporal properties of sensory stimuli that are important for myelin plasticity.</p>

     alt="Cre driver mouse lines for thalamocortical circuit mapping"/>
<p>This study characterizes the temporal and spatial expression pattern of genetically encoded reporters following Cre-mediated recombination from three Cre drivers selective for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within the thalamus, including thalamocortical (TC) neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to TC neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Subpopulations of neurons and associated neural circuits can be targeted in mice with genetic tools in a highly selective manner for visualization and manipulation. However, there are not well-defined Cre “driver” lines that target the expression of Cre recombinase to thalamocortical (TC) neurons. Here, we characterize three Cre driver lines for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre</i>. We examined the postnatal distribution of Cre expression for each of these lines with the Cre-dependent reporter <i>CAG-tdTomato</i> (<i>Ai9)</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within the thalamus, including TC neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to TC neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. Cre expression is present by the time of natural birth in all three lines, underscoring their utility for developmental studies. To demonstrate the utility of these Cre drivers for studying sensory TC circuitry, we targeted the expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to thalamus from the <i>CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP (Ai32)</i> allele with either <i>HDC-Cre</i> or <i>CRH-Cre</i>. Optogenetic activation of TC afferents in primary visual cortex was sufficient to measure frequency-dependent depression. Thus, these Cre drivers provide selective Cre-dependent gene expression in thalamus suitable for both anatomical and functional studies.</p>

     alt="Running exercise protects spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice"/>
<p>Using the unbiased stereological methods, we found that long-term, regular and moderate running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to be closely associated with emotional processes, decision making, and memory. Previous studies have identified the prefrontal cortex as one of the most vulnerable brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Running exercise has widely been recognized as a simple and effective method of physical activity that enhances brain function and slows the progression of AD. However, the effect of exercise on the mPFC of AD is unclear. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of 4 months of exercise on the numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of 12-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model mice using stereological methods. The spatial learning and memory abilities of mice were tested using the Morris water maze. Four months of running exercise delayed declines in spatial learning and memory abilities. The stereological results showed significantly lower numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type control group. The numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of running APP/PS1 mice were significantly greater than those in the APP/PS1 control mice. In addition, running-induced improvements in spatial learning and memory were significantly associated with running-induced increases in spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons numbers in the mPFC. Running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.</p>

<p>We investigated the comparative neuroanatomical distribution of neuropeptide F in the female prawn, <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i> (MrNPF), and its expression levels in the entire CNS during the ovarian cycle. Interestingly, we found a correlation between changes in MrNPF neuroanatomical expression in various parts of the prawn CNS and different stages of the ovarian cycle. Our findings suggest that MrNPF may be a key coordinator that mediates sensory inputs, including photoreception, chemoreception, gustatory reception with feeding, and ovarian development in this female prawn.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide F (NPF) plays critical roles in controlling the feeding and reproduction of prawns. In the present study, we investigated changes in the expression levels of <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i> neuropeptide F (MrNPF), and its neuroanatomical distribution in eyestalk (ES), brain (BR), subesophageal ganglion (SEG), thoracic ganglia (TG), and abdominal ganglia (AG), during the ovarian cycle of female prawn. By qRT-PCR, the amount of <i>MrNPF</i> transcripts exhibited a gradual increase in the ES, BR, and combined SEG and TG from stages I and II, to reach a maximum level at stage III, and slightly declined at stage IV, respectively. The highest to lowest expression levels were detected in combined SEG and TG, BR, ES, and AG, respectively. MrNPF immunolabeling was observed in several neuronal clusters, associated fibers, and neuropils of these central nervous system (CNS) tissues. MrNPF-ir was more intense in neurons and neuropils of SEG and TG than those found in other parts of the CNS. The number of MrNPF-ir neurons and intensity of MrNPF-ir were higher in the ES, BR, SEG, and TG at the late stages than those at the early stages of the ovarian cycle, while those in AG exhibited insignificant change. Taken together, there is a correlation between changes in the neuroanatomical distribution of MrNPF and stages of the ovarian cycle, implying that MrNPF may be an important neuropeptide that integrates sensory stimuli, including photo-, chemo-, and gustatory receptions, to control feeding and reproduction, particularly ovarian development, of this female prawn, <i>M. rosenbergii</i>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with knowledge, attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-19 in health care professionals in Lima, Peru [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nowadays, we are facing a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, known globally as COVID-19, which is considered a threat to global health due to its high contagiousness and rapid spread. Methods: Analytical cross-sectional study in 302 health professionals. An online questionnaire consisting of questions about knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 was applied. Socio-demographic, occupational and comorbidities factors were explored. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with KAP. Results: Of the total, 25.2%, 31.5% and 37.4% had high levels of knowledge, preventive practices and risk perception attitudes respectively. Being married aOR=6.75 IC(1.46-31.2) p=0.014, having a master's degree aOR=0.4, IC(0.21-0.80) p=0.009, having a working day with less than ten hours ORa=0.49 IC(0.25-0.95) p=0.036 and obesity aOR=0.38 IC (0.15-0.95) p=0.039 were associated with a low level of knowledge of COVID-19. The variables associated with preventive practices were being over the age of 50 aOR=0.52 IC(0.27-0.98) p=0.007, working in the hospitalization area aOR=1.86 IC(1.08-3.18) p= 0.018 and having comorbidities such as arterial hypertension aOR=0.28 IC(0.081-0.99) p=0.02 and obesity aOR=0.35 IC(0.14-0.83) p=0.019. In relation to negative attitudes towards COVID-19, it was found that physical contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis aOR=1.84 IC (1.14-2.97) p=0.006 and having asthma aOR=2.13 IC(1.081-4.22) p=0.029 were associated with these attitudes. Conclusion: Our study revealed that health professionals have an insufficient level of knowledge of COVID-19. This is why we recommend implementing strategies such as health literacy programs among health care workers. Thus, they can help develop positive attitudes towards the acquisition of self-care habits at work that, in turn, improve their confidence so that health care workers can provide adequate care for their patients and protect themselves.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Toward an Anti-Racist Approach to Biomedical and Neuroscience Research</a></h4>

              
                <p>Racism is a threat to public health. Race is a sociopolitical construct that has been used for generations to create disparities in educational access, housing conditions, exposure to environmental contaminants, and access to health care. Collectively, these disparities have a negative impact on the health of non-white Americans. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds biomedical research, including basic neuroscience research, aimed at understanding the mechanisms and consequences of health and disease in Americans. NIH has recently acknowledged its own structural racism, the disadvantage this perpetuates in the biomedical research enterprise, and has announced its commitment to eliminating these disparities. Here, we discuss different rates of disease in U.S. citizens from different racial backgrounds. We next describe ways in which the biomedical research enterprise (1) has contributed to health disparities and (2) can contribute to the solving this problem. Based on our own scientific expertise, we use neuroscience in general and mental health/addiction disorders more specifically as examples of a broader issue. The NIH, including its neuroscience-focused Institutes, and NIH-funded scientists, including neuroscientists, should prioritize research topics that reflect the health conditions that affect all Americans, not just white Americans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">C-Jun N-Terminal Kinase Post-Translational Regulation of Pain-Related Acid-Sensing Ion Channels 1b and 3</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal proton-gated acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) participate in the detection of tissue acidosis, a phenomenon often encountered in painful pathologic diseases. Such conditions often involve in parallel the activation of various signaling pathways such as mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that ultimately leads to phenotype modifications of sensory neurons. Here, we identify one member of the MAPKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), as a new post-translational positive regulator of ASICs in rodent sensory neurons. Recombinant H<sup>+</sup>-induced ASIC currents in HEK293 cells are potently inhibited within minutes by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 in a subunit-dependent manner, targeting both rodent and human ASIC1b and ASIC3 subunits (except mouse ASIC3). The regulation by JNK of recombinant ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels (homomers and heteromers) is lost on mutation of a putative phosphorylation site within the intracellular N- and the C-terminal domain of the ASIC1b and ASIC3 subunit, respectively. Moreover, short-term JNK activation regulates the activity of native ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels in rodent sensory neurons and is involved in the rapid potentiation of ASIC activity by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF&alpha;. Local JNK activation <I>in vivo</I> in mice induces a short-term potentiation of the acid-induced cutaneous pain in inflammatory conditions that is partially blocked by the ASIC1-specific inhibitor mambalgin-1. Collectively, our data identify pain-related channels as novel physiological JNK substrates in nociceptive neurons and propose JNK-dependent phosphorylation as a fast post-translational mechanism of regulation of sensory-neuron-expressed ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels that may contribute to peripheral sensitization and pain hypersensitivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> ASICs are a class of excitatory cation channels critical for the detection of tissue acidosis, which is a hallmark of several painful diseases. Previous work in sensory neurons has shown that ASICs containing the ASIC3 or the ASIC1b subunit are important players in different pain models. We combine here functional and pharmacological <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> approaches to demonstrate that the MAP Kinase JNK is a potent post-translational positive regulator, probably <I>via</I> direct phosphorylation, of rodent and human ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels. This JNK-dependent, fast post-translational mechanism of regulation of sensory-neuron-expressed ASICs may contribute to peripheral sensitization and pain hypersensitivity. These data also identify pain-related channels as direct downstream effectors of JNK in nociceptors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">APOE4 Affects Basal and NMDAR-Mediated Protein Synthesis in Neurons by Perturbing Calcium Homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Apolipoprotein E (APOE), one of the primary lipoproteins in the brain has three isoforms in humans, APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. APOE4 is the most well-established risk factor increasing the predisposition for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presence of the APOE4 allele alone is shown to cause synaptic defects in neurons and recent studies have identified multiple pathways directly influenced by APOE4. However, the mechanisms underlying APOE4-induced synaptic dysfunction remain elusive. Here, we report that the acute exposure of primary cortical neurons or synaptoneurosomes to APOE4 leads to a significant decrease in global protein synthesis. Primary cortical neurons were derived from male and female embryos of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats or C57BL/6J mice. Synaptoneurosomes were prepared from P30 male SD rats. APOE4 treatment also abrogates the NMDA-mediated translation response indicating an alteration of synaptic signaling. Importantly, we demonstrate that both APOE3 and APOE4 generate a distinct translation response which is closely linked to their respective calcium signature. Acute exposure of neurons to APOE3 causes a short burst of calcium through NMDA receptors (NMDARs) leading to an initial decrease in protein synthesis which quickly recovers. Contrarily, APOE4 leads to a sustained increase in calcium levels by activating both NMDARs and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs), thereby causing sustained translation inhibition through eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) phosphorylation, which in turn disrupts the NMDAR response. Thus, we show that APOE4 affects basal and activity-mediated protein synthesis responses in neurons by affecting calcium homeostasis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Defective protein synthesis has been shown as an early defect in familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this has not been studied in the context of sporadic AD, which constitutes the majority of cases. In our study, we show that Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the predominant risk factor for AD, inhibits global protein synthesis in neurons. APOE4 also affects NMDA activity-mediated protein synthesis response, thus inhibiting synaptic translation. We also show that the defective protein synthesis mediated by APOE4 is closely linked to the perturbation of calcium homeostasis caused by APOE4 in neurons. Thus, we propose the dysregulation of protein synthesis as one of the possible molecular mechanisms to explain APOE4-mediated synaptic and cognitive defects. Hence, the study not only suggests an explanation for the APOE4-mediated predisposition to AD, it also bridges the gap in understanding APOE4-mediated pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Metabolic Control of Sensory Neuron Survival by the p75 Neurotrophin Receptor in Schwann Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>We report that the neurotrophin receptor p75 contributes to sensory neuron survival through the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in Schwann cells. Selective deletion of p75 in mouse Schwann cells of either sex resulted in a 30% loss of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and diminished thermal sensitivity. P75 regulates Schwann cell cholesterol biosynthesis in response to BDNF, forming a co-receptor complex with ErbB2 and activating ErbB2-mediated stimulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), a master regulator of cholesterol synthesis. Schwann cells lacking p75 exhibited decreased activation of SREBP2 and a reduction in 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase (DHCR7) expression, resulting in accumulation of the neurotoxic intermediate, 7-dehyrocholesterol in the sciatic nerve. Restoration of DHCR7 in p75 null Schwann cells in mice significantly attenuated DRG neuron loss. Together, these results reveal a mechanism by which the disruption of lipid metabolism in glial cells negatively influences sensory neuron survival, which has implications for a wide range of peripheral neuropathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although expressed in Schwann cells, the role of p75 in myelination has remained unresolved in part because of its dual expression in sensory neurons that Schwann cells myelinate. When p75 was deleted selectively among Schwann cells, myelination was minimally affected, while sensory neuron survival was reduced by 30%. The phenotype is mainly due to dysregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in p75-deficient Schwann cells, leading to an accumulation of neurotoxic cholesterol precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Mechanism-wise, we discovered that in response to BDNF, p75 recruits and activates ErbB2 independently of ErbB3, thereby stimulating the master regulator, sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2). These results together highlight a novel role of p75 in Schwann cells in regulating DRG neuron survival by orchestrating proper cholesterol metabolism.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Galanin in Cerebellar Granule Cell Migration in the Early Postnatal Mouse during Normal Development and after Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Galanin, one of the most inducible neuropeptides, is widely present in developing brains, and its expression is altered by pathologic events (e.g., epilepsy, ischemia, and axotomy). The roles of galanin in brain development under both normal and pathologic conditions have been hypothesized, but the question of how galanin is involved in fetal and early postnatal brain development remains largely unanswered. In this study, using granule cell migration in the cerebellum of early postnatal mice (both sexes) as a model system, we examined the role of galanin in neuronal cell migration during normal development and after brain injury. Here we show that, during normal development, endogenous galanin participates in accelerating granule cell migration via altering the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP signaling pathways. Upon brain injury induced by the application of cold insults, galanin levels decrease at the lesion sites, but increase in the surroundings of lesion sites. Granule cells exhibit the following corresponding changes in migration: (1) slowing down migration at the lesion sites; and (2) accelerating migration in the surroundings of lesion sites. Experimental manipulations of galanin signaling reduce the lesion site-specific changes in granule cell migration, indicating that galanin plays a role in such deficits in neuronal cell migration. The present study suggests that manipulating galanin signaling may be a potential therapeutic target for acutely injured brains during development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Deficits in neuronal cell migration caused by brain injury result in abnormal development of cortical layers, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. Here, we report that on brain injury, endogenous levels of galanin, a neuropeptide, are altered in a lesion site-specific manner, decreasing at the lesion sites but increasing in the surroundings of lesion sites. The changes in galanin levels positively correlate with the migration rate of immature neurons. Manipulations of galanin signaling ameliorate the effects of injury on neuronal migration and cortical layer development. These results shed a light on galanin as a potential therapeutic target for acutely injured brains during development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Developmental Effects of Oxytocin Neurons on Social Affiliation and Processing of Social Information</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hormones regulate behavior either through activational effects that facilitate the acute expression of specific behaviors or through organizational effects that shape the development of the nervous system thereby altering adult behavior. Much research has implicated the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) in acute modulation of various aspects of social behaviors across vertebrate species, and OXT signaling is associated with the developmental social deficits observed in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, little is known about the role of OXT in the neurodevelopment of the social brain. We show that perturbation of OXT neurons during early zebrafish development led to a loss of dopaminergic neurons, associated with visual processing and reward, and blunted the neuronal response to social stimuli in the adult brain. Ultimately, adult fish whose OXT neurons were ablated in early life, displayed altered functional connectivity within social decision-making brain nuclei both in naive state and in response to social stimulus and became less social. We propose that OXT neurons have an organizational role, namely, to shape forebrain neuroarchitecture during development and to acquire an affiliative response toward conspecifics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Social behavior is developed over the lifetime of an organism and the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) modulates social behaviors across vertebrate species, and is associated with neuro-developmental social deficits such as autism. However, whether OXT plays a role in the developmental maturation of neural systems that are necessary for social behavior remains poorly explored. We show that proper behavioral and neural response to social stimuli depends on a developmental process orchestrated by OXT neurons. Animals whose OXT system is ablated in early life show blunted neuronal and behavioral responses to social stimuli as well as wide ranging disruptions in the functional connectivity of the social brain. We provide a window into the mechanisms underlying OXT-dependent developmental processes that implement adult sociality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reliable Sensory Processing in Mouse Visual Cortex through Cooperative Interactions between Somatostatin and Parvalbumin Interneurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Intrinsic neuronal variability significantly limits information encoding in the primary visual cortex (V1). However, under certain conditions, neurons can respond reliably with highly precise responses to the same visual stimuli from trial to trial. This suggests that there exists intrinsic neural circuit mechanisms that dynamically modulate the intertrial variability of visual cortical neurons. Here, we sought to elucidate the role of different inhibitory interneurons (INs) in reliable coding in mouse V1. To study the interactions between somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs), we used a dual-color calcium imaging technique that allowed us to simultaneously monitor these two neural ensembles while awake mice, of both sexes, passively viewed natural movies. SST neurons were more active during epochs of reliable pyramidal neuron firing, whereas PV neurons were more active during epochs of unreliable firing. SST neuron activity lagged that of PV neurons, consistent with a feedback inhibitory SST-&gt;PV circuit. To dissect the role of this circuit in pyramidal neuron activity, we used temporally limited optogenetic activation and inactivation of SST and PV interneurons during periods of reliable and unreliable pyramidal cell firing. Transient firing of SST neurons increased pyramidal neuron reliability by actively suppressing PV neurons, a proposal that was supported by a rate-based model of V1 neurons. These results identify a cooperative functional role for the SST-&gt;PV circuit in modulating the reliability of pyramidal neuron activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cortical neurons often respond to identical sensory stimuli with large variability. However, under certain conditions, the same neurons can also respond highly reliably. The circuit mechanisms that contribute to this modulation remain unknown. Here, we used novel dual-wavelength calcium imaging and temporally selective optical perturbation to identify an inhibitory neural circuit in visual cortex that can modulate the reliability of pyramidal neurons to naturalistic visual stimuli. Our results, supported by computational models, suggest that somatostatin interneurons increase pyramidal neuron reliability by suppressing parvalbumin interneurons via the inhibitory SST-&gt;PV circuit. These findings reveal a novel role of the SST-&gt;PV circuit in modulating the fidelity of neural coding critical for visual perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Effects of Cerebellar Degeneration on Feedforward versus Feedback Control across Speech and Reaching Movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>Errors that result from a mismatch between predicted movement outcomes and sensory afference are used to correct ongoing movements through feedback control and to adapt feedforward control of future movements. The cerebellum has been identified as a critical part of the neural circuit underlying implicit adaptation across a wide variety of movements (reaching, gait, eye movements, and speech). The contribution of this structure to feedback control is less well understood. Although it has recently been shown in the speech domain that individuals with cerebellar degeneration produce larger online corrections for sensory perturbations than control participants, similar behavior has not been observed in other motor domains. Currently, comparisons across domains are limited by different population samples and potential ceiling effects in existing tasks. To assess the relationship between changes in feedforward and feedback control associated with cerebellar degeneration across motor domains, we evaluated adaptive (feedforward) and compensatory (feedback) responses to sensory perturbations in reaching and speech production in human participants of both sexes with cerebellar degeneration and neurobiologically healthy controls. As expected, the cerebellar group demonstrated impaired adaptation in both reaching and speech. In contrast, the groups did not differ in their compensatory response in either domain. Moreover, compensatory and adaptive responses in the cerebellar group were not correlated within or across motor domains. These results point to a general impairment in feedforward control with spared feedback control in cerebellar degeneration. However, the magnitude of feedforward impairments and potential changes in feedback-based control manifest in a domain-specific manner across individuals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebellum contributes to feedforward updating of movement in response to sensory errors, but its role in feedback control is less understood. Here, we tested individuals with cerebellar degeneration (CD), using sensory perturbations to assess adaptation of feedforward control and feedback gains during reaching and speech production tasks. The results confirmed that CD leads to reduced adaption in both domains. However, feedback gains were unaffected by CD in either domain. Interestingly, measures of feedforward and feedback control were not correlated across individuals within or across motor domains. Together, these results indicate a general impairment in feedforward control with spared feedback control in CD. However, the magnitude of feedforward impairments manifests in a domain-specific manner across individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Posterodorsal Medial Amygdala Regulation of Female Social Behavior: GABA versus Glutamate Projections</a></h4>

              
                <p>Social behaviors, including reproductive behaviors, often display sexual dimorphism. Lordosis, the measure of female sexual receptivity, is one of the most apparent sexually dimorphic reproductive behaviors. Lordosis is regulated by estrogen and progesterone (P4) acting within a hypothalamic-limbic circuit, consisting of the arcuate, medial preoptic, and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. Social cues are integrated into the circuit through the amygdala. The posterodorsal part of the medial amygdala (MeApd) is involved in sexually dimorphic social and reproductive behaviors, and sends projections to hypothalamic neuroendocrine regions. GABA from the MeApd appears to facilitate social behaviors, while glutamate may play the opposite role. To test these hypotheses, adult female vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)-Cre and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2)-Cre mice were transfected with halorhodopsin (eNpHR)-expressing or channelrhodopsin-expressing adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), respectively, in the MeApd. The lordosis quotient (LQ) was measured following either photoinhibition of VGAT or photoexcitation of VGluT2 neurons, and brains were assessed for c-Fos immunohistochemistry (IHC). Photoinhibition of VGAT neurons in the MeApd decreased LQ, and decreased c-Fos expression within VGAT neurons, within the MeApd as a whole, and within the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus (VMHvl). Photoexcitation of VGluT2 neurons did not affect LQ, but did increase time spent self-grooming, and increased c-Fos expression within VGluT2 neurons in the MeApd. Neither condition altered c-Fos expression in the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) or the arcuate nucleus (ARH). These data support a role for MeApd GABA in the facilitation of lordosis. Glutamate from the MeApd does not appear to be directly involved in the lordosis circuit, but appears to direct behavior away from social interactions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Lordosis, the measure of female sexual receptivity, is a sexually dimorphic behavior regulated within a hypothalamic-limbic circuit. Social cues are integrated through the amygdala, and the posterodorsal part of the medial amygdala (MeApd) is involved in sexually dimorphic social and reproductive behaviors. Photoinhibition of GABAergic neurons in the MeApd inhibited lordosis, while photoactivation of glutamate neurons had no effect on lordosis, but increased self-grooming. These data support a role for MeApd GABA in the facilitation of social behaviors and MeApd glutamate projections in anti-social interactions.</p>

                <p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disabilities, motor and balance deficits, impaired communication, and a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent laughter. We sought to elucidate a preclinical outcome measure in male and female rats that addressed communication abnormalities of AS and other neurodevelopmental disorders in which communication is atypical and/or lack of speech is a core feature. We discovered, and herein report for the first time, excessive laughter-like 50 kHz ultrasonic emissions in the <I>Ube3a</I><sup>mat&ndash;/pat+</sup> rat model of AS, which suggests an excitable, playful demeanor and elevated positive affect, similar to the demeanor of individuals with AS. Also in line with the AS phenotype, <I>Ube3a</I><sup>mat&ndash;/pat+</sup> rats demonstrated aberrant social interactions with a novel partner, distinctive gait abnormalities, impaired cognition, an underlying LTP deficit, and profound reductions in brain volume. These unique, robust phenotypes provide advantages compared with currently available mouse models and will be highly valuable as outcome measures in the evaluation of therapies for AS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurogenetic disorder for which there is no cure, despite decades of research using mouse models. This study used a recently developed rat model of AS to delineate disease-relevant outcome measures to facilitate therapeutic development. We found the rat to be a strong model of AS, offering several advantages over mouse models by exhibiting numerous AS-relevant phenotypes, including overabundant laughter-like vocalizations, reduced hippocampal LTP, and volumetric anomalies across the brain. These findings are unconfounded by detrimental motor abilities and background strain, issues plaguing mouse models. This rat model represents an important advancement in the field of AS, and the outcome metrics reported herein will be central to the therapeutic pipeline.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cognitive Control Promotes Either Honesty or Dishonesty, Depending on One's Moral Default</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive control is crucially involved in making (dis)honest decisions. However, the precise nature of this role has been hotly debated. Is honesty an intuitive response, or is will power needed to override an intuitive inclination to cheat? A reconciliation of these conflicting views proposes that cognitive control enables dishonest participants to be honest, whereas it allows those who are generally honest to cheat. Thus, cognitive control does not promote (dis)honesty per se; it depends on one's moral default. In the present study, we tested this proposal using electroencephalograms in humans (males and females) in combination with an independent localizer (Stroop task) to mitigate the problem of reverse inference. Our analysis revealed that the neural signature evoked by cognitive control demands in the Stroop task can be used to estimate (dis)honest choices in an independent cheating task, providing converging evidence that cognitive control can indeed help honest participants to cheat, whereas it facilitates honesty for cheaters.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dishonesty causes enormous economic losses. To target dishonesty with interventions, a rigorous understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms is required. A recent study found that cognitive control enables honest participants to cheat, whereas it helps cheaters to be honest. However, it is evident that a single study does not suffice as support for a novel hypothesis. Therefore, we tested the replicability of this finding using a different modality (EEG instead of fMRI) together with an independent localizer task to avoid reverse inference. We find that the same neural signature evoked by cognitive control demands in the localizer task can be used to estimate (dis)honesty in an independent cheating task, establishing converging evidence that the effect of cognitive control indeed depends on a person's moral default.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Common and Unique Inhibitory Control Signatures of Action-Stopping and Attentional Capture Suggest That Actions Are Stopped in Two Stages</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to stop an already initiated action is paramount to adaptive behavior. Much scientific debate in the field of human action-stopping currently focuses on two interrelated questions. (1) Which cognitive and neural processes uniquely underpin the implementation of inhibitory control when actions are stopped after explicit stop signals, and which processes are instead commonly evoked by all salient signals, even those that do not require stopping? (2) Why do purported (neuro)physiological signatures of inhibition occur at two different latencies after stop signals? Here, we address both questions via two preregistered experiments that combined measurements of corticospinal excitability, EMG, and whole-scalp EEG. Adult human subjects performed a stop signal task that also contained "ignore" signals: equally salient signals that did not require stopping but rather completion of the Go response. We found that both stop- and ignore signals produced equal amounts of early-latency inhibition of corticospinal excitability and EMG, which took place ~150 ms following either signal. Multivariate pattern analysis of the whole-scalp EEG data further corroborated that this early processing stage was shared between stop- and ignore signals, as neural activity following the two signals could not be decoded from each other until a later time period. In this later period, unique activity related to stop signals emerged at frontocentral scalp sites, reflecting an increased stop signal P3. These findings suggest a two-step model of action-stopping, according to which an initial, universal inhibitory response to the saliency of the stop signal is followed by a slower process that is unique to outright stopping.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans often have to stop their ongoing actions when indicated by environmental stimuli (stop signals). Successful action-stopping requires both the ability to detect these salient stop signals and to subsequently inhibit ongoing motor programs. Because of this tight entanglement of attentional control and motor inhibition, identifying unique neurophysiological signatures of action-stopping is difficult. Indeed, we report that recently proposed early-latency signatures of motor inhibition during action-stopping are also found after salient signals that do not require stopping. However, using multivariate pattern analysis of scalp-recorded neural data, we also identified subsequent neural activity that uniquely distinguished action-stopping from saliency detection. These results suggest that actions are stopped in two stages: the first common to all salient events and the second unique to action-stopping.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Connectivity with Retrosplenial Cortex is Linked to Neocortical Tau Accumulation and Memory Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mechanisms underlying accumulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related tau pathology outside of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in older adults are unknown but crucial to understanding cognitive decline. A growing body of evidence from human and animal studies strongly implicates neural connectivity in the propagation of tau in humans, but the pathways of neocortical tau spread and its consequences for cognitive function are not well understood. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and tau PET imaging from a sample of 97 male and female cognitively normal older adults, we examined MTL structures involved in medial parietal tau accumulation and associations with memory function. Functional connectivity between hippocampus (HC) and retrosplenial cortex (RsC), a key region of the medial parietal lobe, was associated with tau in medial parietal lobe. By contrast, connectivity between entorhinal cortex (EC) and RsC did not correlate with medial parietal lobe tau. Further, greater hippocampal-retrosplenial (HC-RsC) connectivity was associated with a stronger correlation between MTL and medial parietal lobe tau. Finally, an interaction between connectivity strength and medial parietal tau was associated with episodic memory performance, particularly in the visuospatial domain. This pattern of tau accumulation thus appears to reflect pathways of neural connectivity, and propagation of tau from EC to medial parietal lobe via the HC may represent a critical process in the evolution of cognitive dysfunction in aging and AD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The accumulation of tau pathology in the neocortex is a fundamental process underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we use functional connectivity in cognitively normal older adults to track the accumulation of tau in the medial parietal lobe, a key region for memory processing that is affected early in the progression of AD. We show that the strength of connectivity between the hippocampus (HC) and retrosplenial cortex (RsC) is related to medial parietal tau burden, and that these tau and connectivity measures interact to associate with episodic memory performance. These findings establish the HC as the origin of medial parietal tau and implicate tau pathology in this region as a crucial marker of the beginnings of AD.</p>

                <p>Exposure to loud noises not only leads to trauma and loss of output from the ear but also alters downstream central auditory circuits. A perceptual consequence of noise-induced central auditory disruption is impairment in gap-induced prepulse inhibition, also known as gap detection. Recent studies have implicated cortical parvalbumin (PV)-positive inhibitory interneurons in gap detection and prepulse inhibition. Here, we show that exposure to loud noises specifically reduces the density of cortical PV but not somatostatin (SOM)-positive interneurons in the primary auditory cortex in mice (C57BL/6) of both sexes. Optogenetic activation of PV neurons produced less cortical inhibition in noise-exposed than sham-exposed animals, indicative of reduced PV neuron function. Activation of SOM neurons resulted in similar levels of cortical inhibition in noise- and sham-exposed groups. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of PV neurons with the hM3-based designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs completely reversed the impairments in gap detection for noise-exposed animals. These results support the notions that cortical PV neurons encode gap in sound and that PV neuron dysfunction contributes to noise-induced impairment in gap detection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Noise-induced hearing loss contributes to a range of central auditory processing deficits (CAPDs). The mechanisms underlying noise-induced CAPDs are still poorly understood. Here we show that exposure to loud noises results in dysfunction of PV-positive but not somatostatin-positive inhibitory interneurons in the primary auditory cortex. In addition, cortical PV inhibitory neurons in noise-exposed animals had reduced expression of glutamic acid decarboxylases and weakened inhibition on cortical activity. Noise exposure resulted in impaired gap detection, indicative of disrupted temporal sound processing and possibly tinnitus. We found that chemogenetic activation of cortical PV inhibitory interneurons alleviated the deficits in gap detection. These results implicate PV neuron dysfunction as a mechanism for noise-induced CAPDs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Narcolepsy in Parkinson's disease with insulin resistance [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by its progression of motor-related symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking and balance. Comorbid conditions in PD individuals include insulin resistance (IR) and narcolepsy-like sleep patterns. The intersecting sleep symptoms of both conditions include excessive daytime sleepiness, hallucinations, insomnia, and falling into REM sleep more quickly than an average person. Understanding of the biological basis and relationship of these comorbid disorders with PD may help with early detection and intervention strategies to improve quality of life. Methods: In this study, an integrative genomics and systems biology approach was used to analyze gene expression patterns associated with PD, IR, and narcolepsy in order to identify genes and pathways that may shed light on how these disorders are interrelated. A correlation analysis with known genes associated with these disorders (LRRK2, HLA-DQB1, and HCRT) was used to query microarray data corresponding to brain regions known to be involved in PD and narcolepsy. This includes the hypothalamus, dorsal thalamus, pons, and subcoeruleus nucleus. Risk factor genes for PD, IR, and narcolepsy were also incorporated into the analysis. Results: The PD and narcolepsy signaling networks are connected through insulin and immune system pathways. Important genes and pathways that link PD, narcolepsy, and IR are CACNA1C, CAMK1D, BHLHE41, HMGB1, and AGE-RAGE. Conclusions: We have identified the genetic signatures that link PD with its comorbid disorders, narcolepsy and insulin resistance, from the convergence and intersection of dopaminergic, insulin, and immune system related signaling pathways. These findings may aid in the design of early intervention strategies and treatment regimes for non-motor symptoms in PD patients as well as individuals with diabetes and narcolepsy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A Case of Encephalopathy Presenting the Lentiform Fork Sign on MRI in a Diabetic Dialysis Patient [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Basal ganglia lesions showing an expansile high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI are termed the lentiform fork sign. This specific finding is mainly observed in diabetic patients with uremic encephalopathy with metabolic acidosis, although there are also reports in patients with ketoacidosis, dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, intoxication, and following drug treatment (e.g., metformin). A 57-year-old Japanese man on chronic hemodialysis for 4 years because of diabetic nephropathy was admitted to our hospital for relatively rapid-onset gait disturbance, severe dysarthria, and consciousness disturbance. Brain T2-weighted MRI showed the lentiform fork sign. Hemodialysis was performed the day before admission, and laboratory tests showed mild metabolic (lactic) acidosis, but no uremia. Surprisingly, metformin, which is contraindicated for patients with end-stage kidney disease, had been prescribed for 6 months in his medication record, and his sluggish speaking and dysarthria appeared gradually after metformin treatment was started. Thus, the encephalopathy was considered to be related to metformin treatment. He received hemodialysis treatment for 6 consecutive days, and his consciousness disturbance and dysarthria improved in 1 week. At the 8-month follow-up, the size of the hyperintensity area on MRI had decreased, while the mild gait disturbance remained. Considering the rapid onset of gait and consciousness disturbance immediately before admission, diabetic uremic syndrome may also have occurred with metformin-related encephalopathy, and resulted in the lentiform fork sign, despite the patient showing no evidence of severe uremia on laboratory data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How conformity can lead to polarised social behaviour</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Folco Panizza, Alexander Vostroknutov, Giorgio Coricelli</p>

Learning social behaviour of others strongly influences one’s own social attitudes. We compare several distinct explanations of this phenomenon, testing their predictions using computational modelling across four experimental conditions. In the experiment, participants chose repeatedly whether to pay for increasing (prosocial) or decreasing (antisocial) the earnings of an unknown other. Halfway through the task, participants predicted the choices of an extremely prosocial or antisocial agent (either a computer, a single participant, or a group of participants). Our analyses indicate that participants polarise their social attitude mainly due to normative expectations. Specifically, most participants conform to presumed demands by the authority (vertical influence), or because they learn that the observed human agents follow the norm very closely (horizontal influence).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Atorvastatin-mediated rescue of cancer-related cognitive changes in combined anticancer therapies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Junho Lee, Jin Su Kim, Yangjin Kim</p>

Acute administration of trastuzumab (TZB) may induce various forms of cognitive impairment. These cancer-related cognitive changes (CRCC) are regulated by an adverse biological process involving cancer stem cells (CSCs) and IL-6. Recent studies have reported that atorvastatin (ATV) may change the dynamic of cognitive impairment in a combination (TZB+ATV) therapy. In this study, we investigate the mutual interactions between cancer stem cells and the tumor cells that facilitate cognitive impairment during long term TZB therapy by developing a mathematical model that involves IL-6 and the key apoptotic regulation. These include the densities of tumor cells and CSCs, and the concentrations of intracellular signaling molecules (NF<i>κ</i>B, Bcl-2, BAX). We apply the mathematical model to a single or combination (ATV+TZB) therapy used in the experiments to demonstrate that the CSCs can enhance CRCC by secreting IL-6 and ATV may interfere the whole regulation. We show that the model can both reproduce the major experimental observation on onset and prevention of CRCC, and suggest several important predictions to guide future experiments with the goal of the development of new anti-tumor and anti-CRCC strategies. Moreover, using this model, we investigate the fundamental mechanism of onset of cognitive impairment in TZB-treated patients and the impact of alternating therapies on the anti-tumor efficacy and intracellular response to different treatment schedules.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Extended graphical lasso for multiple interaction networks for high dimensional omics data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yang Xu, Hongmei Jiang, Wenxin Jiang</p>

There has been a spate of interest in association networks in biological and medical research, for example, genetic interaction networks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, the extended joint hub graphical lasso (EDOHA), to estimate multiple related interaction networks for high dimensional omics data across multiple distinct classes. To be specific, we construct a convex penalized log likelihood optimization problem and solve it with an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The proposed method can also be adapted to estimate interaction networks for high dimensional compositional data such as microbial interaction networks. The performance of the proposed method in the simulated studies shows that EDOHA has remarkable advantages in recognizing class-specific hubs than the existing comparable methods. We also present three applications of real datasets. Biological interpretations of our results confirm those of previous studies and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Understanding degraded speech leads to perceptual gating of a brain stem reflex in human listeners</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Heivet Hernández-Pérez, Jason Mikiel-Hunter, David McAlpine, Sumitrajit Dhar, Sriram Boothalingam, Jessica J. M. Monaghan, Catherine M. McMahon</p>

The ability to navigate “cocktail party” situations by focusing on sounds of interest over irrelevant, background sounds is often considered in terms of cortical mechanisms. However, subcortical circuits such as the pathway underlying the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex modulate the activity of the inner ear itself, supporting the extraction of salient features from auditory scene prior to any cortical processing. To understand the contribution of auditory subcortical nuclei and the cochlea in complex listening tasks, we made physiological recordings along the auditory pathway while listeners engaged in detecting non(sense) words in lists of words. Both naturally spoken and intrinsically noisy, vocoded speech—filtering that mimics processing by a cochlear implant (CI)—significantly activated the MOC reflex, but this was not the case for speech in background noise, which more engaged midbrain and cortical resources. A model of the initial stages of auditory processing reproduced specific effects of each form of speech degradation, providing a rationale for goal-directed gating of the MOC reflex based on enhancing the representation of the energy envelope of the acoustic waveform. Our data reveal the coexistence of 2 strategies in the auditory system that may facilitate speech understanding in situations where the signal is either intrinsically degraded or masked by extrinsic acoustic energy. Whereas intrinsically degraded streams recruit the MOC reflex to improve representation of speech cues peripherally, extrinsically masked streams rely more on higher auditory centres to denoise signals.

Michaelis constants (Km) are essential to predict the catalytic rate of enzymes, but are not widely available. A new study in PLOS Biology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict Km on a proteome-wide scale, paving the way for dynamic, genome-wide modeling of metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RefPlantNLR is a comprehensive collection of experimentally validated plant disease resistance proteins from the NLR family</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiorgos Kourelis, Toshiyuki Sakai, Hiroaki Adachi, Sophien Kamoun</p>

Reference datasets are critical in computational biology. They help define canonical biological features and are essential for benchmarking studies. Here, we describe a comprehensive reference dataset of experimentally validated plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors. RefPlantNLR consists of 481 NLRs from 31 genera belonging to 11 orders of flowering plants. This reference dataset has several applications. We used RefPlantNLR to determine the canonical features of functionally validated plant NLRs and to benchmark 5 NLR annotation tools. This revealed that although NLR annotation tools tend to retrieve the majority of NLRs, they frequently produce domain architectures that are inconsistent with the RefPlantNLR annotation. Guided by this analysis, we developed a new pipeline, NLRtracker, which extracts and annotates NLRs from protein or transcript files based on the core features found in the RefPlantNLR dataset. The RefPlantNLR dataset should also prove useful for guiding comparative analyses of NLRs across the wide spectrum of plant diversity and identifying understudied taxa. We hope that the RefPlantNLR resource will contribute to moving the field beyond a uniform view of NLR structure and function.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The glucose-sensing transcription factor MLX balances metabolism and stress to suppress apoptosis and maintain spermatogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Patrick A. Carroll, Brian W. Freie, Pei Feng Cheng, Sivakanthan Kasinathan, Haiwei Gu, Theresa Hedrich, James A. Dowdle, Vivek Venkataramani, Vijay Ramani, Xiaoying Wu, Daniel Raftery, Jay Shendure, Donald E. Ayer, Charles H. Muller, Robert N. Eisenman</p>

Male germ cell (GC) production is a metabolically driven and apoptosis-prone process. Here, we show that the glucose-sensing transcription factor (TF) MAX-Like protein X (MLX) and its binding partner MondoA are both required for male fertility in the mouse, as well as survival of human tumor cells derived from the male germ line. Loss of <i>Mlx</i> results in altered metabolism as well as activation of multiple stress pathways and GC apoptosis in the testes. This is concomitant with dysregulation of the expression of male-specific GC transcripts and proteins. Our genomic and functional analyses identify loci directly bound by MLX involved in these processes, including metabolic targets, obligate components of male-specific GC development, and apoptotic effectors. These in vivo and in vitro studies implicate MLX and other members of the proximal MYC network, such as MNT, in regulation of metabolism and differentiation, as well as in suppression of intrinsic and extrinsic death signaling pathways in both spermatogenesis and male germ cell tumors (MGCTs).

                Background: Malaysia is embarking on sustainable, resilient, and prosperous living conditions initiatives. Malaysian cities are embracing the smart city aspiration through their respective local authorities. However, they face challenges regarding  funding allocation for smart city implementation. Local authorities primarily operate on a conventional business model. Based on their current business model, they are unlikely to sustain their smart city initiatives. A more financially sustainable business model is required by these local authorities to embark on smart city initiatives. This study presents a systematic review concerning the business models adopted by local authorities to implement smart cities. This paper also explores the applicability of frugal innovation towards developing a smart city business model. Methods: This article undertakes a systematic review based on combination sets of eight main keywords: smart city, business model, frugal innovation, local authorities, performance, inclusivity, technology and success factor. The search strategy includes journal articles and conference proceedings from five major online databases: Emerald, ProQuest, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Springer Link between 2001-2021. The data is tabulated for clear expression of knowledge gaps. Results: A total of 17 articles from 300 articles on smart city business models matched the search on smart city business models for local authorities . The study revealed that hardly any in-depth research providing the crucial elements for a successful smart city business model for local authorities has been conducted. No research has linked frugal innovation to smart city business models. Conclusions: The study calls upon the research community to explore further, the possible linkage between frugal innovation and smart cities for local authorities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Health status classification model for medical adherence system in retirement township [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Medical adherence and remote patient monitoring have gained huge attention from researchers recently, especially with the need to observe the patients’ health outside hospitals due to the ongoing pandemic. The main goal of this research work is to propose a health status classification model that provides a numerical indicator of the overall health condition of a patient via four major vital signs, which are body temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation level, and heart rate. A dataset has been prepared based on the data obtained from hospital records, with these four vital signs extracted for each patient. This dataset provides a label associating each patient to the number of medical diagnoses. Generally, the number of diagnoses correlates with the patient's medical condition, with no diagnoses indicating normal condition, one to two diagnoses suggest low risk, and more than that implies high risk. Thus, we propose a method to classify a patient’s health status into three classes, which are normal, low risk and high risk. This would provide guidance for healthcare workers on the patient's medical condition. By training the classification model using the prepared dataset, the seriousness of a patient's health condition can be predicted. This prediction is performed by classifying the patients based on their four vital signs. Our tests have yielded encouraging results using precision and recall as the evaluation metrics. The key outcome of this work is a trained classification model that quantifies a patient's health condition based on four vital signs. Nevertheless, the model can be further improved by considering more input features such as medical history. The results obtained from this research can assist medical personnel by providing a secondary advice regarding the health status for the patients who are located remotely from the medical facilities.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Profile of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: Results from a longitudinal, prospective, multi‐site study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is highly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives of the study were to characterize autistic features in young children with TSC.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants included 138 children followed from ages 3 to 36 months with TSC from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN), a multicenter, prospective observational study aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms of ASD in TSC. Developmental and autism-specific assessments were administered, and a clinical diagnosis of ASD was determined for all participants at 36 months. Further analyses were performed on 117 participants with valid autism assessments based on nonverbal mental age greater than 15 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prevalence of clinical diagnosis of ASD at 36 months was 25%. Nearly all autistic behaviors on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) were more prevalent in children diagnosed with ASD; however, autism-specific behaviors were also observed in children without ASD. Overall quality of social overtures, facial expressions, and abnormal repetitive interests and behaviors were characteristics most likely to distinguish children with ASD from those without an ASD diagnosis. Participants meeting ADOS-2 criteria but not a clinical ASD diagnosis exhibited intermediate developmental and ADOS-2 scores compared to individuals with and without ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ASD is highly prevalent in TSC, and many additional individuals with TSC exhibit a broad range of sub-threshold autistic behaviors. Our findings reveal a broader autism phenotype that can be identified in young children with TSC, which provides opportunity for early targeted treatments.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">Uncovering the HARbingers of human brain evolution</a></h4>

              
                During evolution, humans acquired extensive genomic changes that collectively define unique features of our species, yet functions for these sequence variants are largely unknown. In this issue of Neuron, Girskis et al. comprehensively screen human accelerated regions (HARs) for enhancer activity in human-specific cortical development, creating a valuable online resource.

                In this issue of Neuron, Amin et al. (2021) generate genetic tools to titrate down levels of miR-218, a motor neuron-enriched microRNA, in vivo. Varying miR-218 dose alters target selection, results in distinct dose-response curves reflecting 3′ UTR features, and reveals a miR-218 threshold below which motor neuron deficits emerge.

                Are social brain responses domain specific, or do domain-general but socially prevalent cognitive processes drive activity in this network? In this issue of Neuron, Konovalov et al. (2021) address this by dissociating general sociality from reactivity, one defining feature of social interactions.

                Kamm, Boffi, et al. found that the ion channel TRPM2 mediates detection of warm temperatures in the mouse hypothalamus. Specifically, TRPM2 enhances the thermosensitivity of hypothalamic warm-sensitive neurons (WSNs) via a presynaptic mechanism. This study highlights the role of WSNs and TRPM2 in body temperature homeostasis under hot environments.

                Hirabayashi et al. demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of macaque SI hand representation impairs grasping and enhances sensitivity to foot stimulation. These behavioral effects co-occur with decreased fMRI activation in the grasping-related network and enhanced foot representation. This study reveals how local inactivation affects the network operation within and across areas.

                The brain is much more than the sum of its parts because those parts interact in complex networks. Vezoli et al. show that at least 4 distinct interaction networks coexist, mediated by the neuronal synchronization of 4 brain rhythms. These rhythm-defined networks are differentially dependent on the strengths of anatomical projections.

                Measuring brain activity while manipulating breathing resistance, Harrison et al. demonstrate that activity in the anterior insula reflects breathing-related predictions and prediction errors. Furthermore, prediction-related brain activity is altered with anxiety, along with sensitivity of and insight into breathing perceptions. These findings elucidate the link between breathing perception and anxiety.

                The <i>RLBP1</i> gene encodes the 36 kDa cellular retinaldehyde binding protein, CRALBP, a soluble retinoid carrier, in the visual cycle of the eyes. Mutations in <i>RLBP1</i> are associated with recessively inherited clinical phenotypes, including Bothnia dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, retinitis punctata albescens, fundus albipunctatus, and Newfoundland rod-cone dystrophy. However, the etiology of these retinal disorders is not well understood. Here, we generated homologous zebrafish models to bridge this knowledge gap. Duplication of the <i>rlbp1</i> gene in zebrafish and cell-specific expression of the paralogs <i>rlbp1a</i> in the retinal pigment epithelium and <i>rlbp1b</i> in Müller glial cells allowed us to create intrinsically cell type-specific knockout fish lines. Using <i>rlbp1a</i> and <i>rlbp1b</i> single and double mutants, we investigated the pathological effects on visual function. Our analyses revealed that <i>rlbp1a</i> was essential for cone photoreceptor function and chromophore metabolism in the fish eyes. <i>rlbp1a</i> mutant fish displayed reduced chromophore levels and attenuated cone photoreceptor responses to light stimuli. They accumulated 11-<i>cis</i> and all-<i>trans</i>-retinyl esters which displayed as enlarged lipid droplets in the RPE reminiscent of the subretinal yellow-white lesions in patients with <i>RLBP1</i> mutations. During aging, these fish developed retinal thinning and cone and rod photoreceptor dystrophy. In contrast, <i>rlbp1b</i> mutants did not display impaired vision. The double mutant essentially replicated the phenotype of the <i>rlbp1a</i> single mutant. Together, our study showed that the <i>rlbp1a</i> zebrafish mutant recapitulated many features of human blinding diseases caused by <i>RLBP1</i> mutations and provided novel insights into the pathways for chromophore regeneration of cone photoreceptors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sequence features of retrotransposons allow for epigenetic variability</a></h4>

              
                Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that make up a large fraction of mammalian genomes. While select TEs have been co-opted in host genomes to have function, the majority of these elements are epigenetically silenced by DNA methylation in somatic cells. However, some TEs in mice, including the Intracisternal A-particle (IAP) subfamily of retrotransposons, have been shown to display interindividual variation in DNA methylation. Recent work has revealed that IAP sequence differences and strain-specific KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) may influence the methylation state of these IAPs. However, the mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of interindividual variability in DNA methylation still remain unclear. Here we report that sequence content and genomic context influence the likelihood that IAPs become variably methylated. IAPs that differ from consensus IAP sequences have altered KZFP recruitment that can lead to decreased KAP1 recruitment when in proximity of constitutively expressed genes. These variably methylated loci have a high CpG density, similar to CpG islands, and can be bound by ZF-CxxC proteins, providing a potential mechanism to maintain this permissive chromatin environment and protect from DNA methylation. These observations indicate that variably methylated IAPs escape silencing through both attenuation of KZFP binding and recognition by ZF-CxxC proteins to maintain a hypomethylated state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The anterior insular cortex associates temporally discontiguous stimuli during threat learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning about potential threats in the environment is indispensable for survival. Deficits in threat learning constitute a key dimension of multiple brain disorders, which include posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder. While human brain imaging studies have highlighted a reliable engagement of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) in threat learning, its precise role remains elusive partly due to the lack of animal studies that can address causality and mechanistic questions. Filling in this gap, the present mouse study proposes a novel AICmediated mechanism underlying the association of temporally discontiguous stimuli during threat learning. We identified that activity of AIC layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons is required for associating temporally discontiguous stimuli, specifically during a time interval between them. Notably, the AIC is not required for associating temporally contiguous stimuli during threat learning. The AIC not only sends the essential information, via its L5 pyramidal neurons, to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during the time interval, but also receives from the BLA. We also identified a modulatory role of AIC dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)-mediated dopamine signaling in associating temporally discontiguous stimuli during the time interval.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of novel therapeutic targets for polyglutamine toxicity disorders that target mitochondrial fragmentation</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is one of at least nine polyglutamine toxicity disorders caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion, all of which lead to age-onset neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial dynamics and function are disrupted in HD and other polyglutamine toxicity disorders. While multiple studies have found beneficial effects from decreasing mitochondrial fragmentation in HD models by disrupting the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1, disrupting DRP1 can also have detrimental consequences in wild-type animals and HD models. In this work, we examine the effect of decreasing mitochondrial fragmentation in a neuronal C. elegans model of polyglutamine toxicity called Neur-67Q. We find that Neur-67Q worms have deficits in mitochondrial morphology in GABAergic neurons and decreased mitochondrial function. Disruption of drp-1 eliminates differences in mitochondrial morphology and rescues deficits in both movement and longevity in Neur-67Q worms. In testing twenty-four RNA interference (RNAi) clones that decrease mitochondrial fragmentation, we identified eleven clones that increase movement and extend lifespan in Neur-67Q worms. Overall, we show that decreasing mitochondrial fragmentation may be an effective approach to treat polyglutamine toxicity disorders and identify multiple novel genetic targets that circumvent the potential negative side effects of disrupting the primary mitochondrial fission gene drp-1.

                Both cortical and subcortical regions can be functionally organized into networks. Regions of the basal ganglia are extensively interconnected with the cortex via reciprocal connections that relay and modulate cortical function. Here we employ an edge-centric approach, which computes co-fluctuations among region pairs in a network to investigate the role and interaction of subcortical regions with cortical systems. By clustering edges into communities, we show that cortical systems and subcortical regions couple via multiple edge communities, with hippocampus and amygdala having a distinct pattern from striatum and thalamus. We show that the edge community structure of cortical networks is highly similar to one obtained from cortical nodes when the subcortex is present in the network. Additionally, we show that the edge community profile of both cortical and subcortical nodes can be estimates solely from cortico-subcortical interactions. Finally, we used a motif analysis focusing on edge community triads where a subcortical region coupled to two cortical regions and found that two community triads where one community couples the subcortex to the cortex were overrepresented. In summary, our results show organized coupling of the subcortex to the cortex that may play a role in cortical organization of primary sensorimotor/attention and heteromodal systems and puts forth the motif analysis of edge community triads as a promising method for investigation of communication patterns in networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the prediction of human intelligence from neuroimaging: A systematic review of methods and reporting</a></h4>

              
                Human intelligence is one of the main objects of study in cognitive neuroscience. Reviews and meta-analyses have proved to be fundamental to establish and cement neuroscientific theories on intelligence. The prediction of intelligence using in vivo neuroimaging data and machine learning has become a widely accepted and replicated result. Here, we present a systematic review of this growing area of research, based on studies that employ structural, functional, and/or diffusion MRI to predict human intelligence in cognitively normal subjects using machine-learning. We performed a systematic assessment of methodological and reporting quality, using the PROBAST and TRIPOD assessment forms and 30 studies identified through a systematic search. We observed that fMRI is the most employed modality, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is the most studied predictor, and the Human Connectome Project is the most employed dataset. A meta-analysis revealed a significant difference between the performance obtained in the prediction of general and fluid intelligence from fMRI data, confirming that the quality of measurement moderates this association. The expected performance of studies predicting general intelligence from fMRI was estimated to be r = 0.42 (CI 95% = [0.35,0.50]) while for studies predicting fluid intelligence obtained from a single test, expected performance was estimated as r = 0.15 (CI 95% = [0.13,0.17]). We further enumerate some virtues and pitfalls we identified in the methods for the assessment of intelligence and machine learning. The lack of treatment of confounder variables, including kinship, and small sample sizes were two common occurrences in the literature which increased risk of bias. Reporting quality was fair across studies, although reporting of results and discussion could be vastly improved. We conclude that the current literature on the prediction of intelligence from neuroimaging data is reaching maturity. Performance has been reliably demonstrated, although extending findings to new populations is indispensable. Current results could be used by future works to foment new theories on the biological basis of intelligence differences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Periodic and Aperiodic Neural Activity Displays Age-Dependent Changes Across Early-to-Middle Childhood</a></h4>

              
                The neurodevelopmental period spanning early-to-middle childhood represents a time of significant growth and reorganisation throughout the cortex. Such changes are critical for the emergence and maturation of a range of social and cognitive processes. Here, we utilised both eyes open and eyes closed resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) to examine maturational changes in both oscillatory (i.e., periodic) and non-oscillatory (aperiodic, 1/f-like) activity in a large cohort of participants ranging from 4-to-12 years of age (N=139, average age=9.41 years, SD=1.95). The EEG signal was parameterised into aperiodic and periodic components, and linear regression models were used to evaluate if chronological age could predict aperiodic exponent and offset, as well as well as peak frequency and power within the alpha and beta ranges. Exponent and offset were found to both decrease with age, while aperiodic-adjusted alpha peak frequency increased with age; however, there was no association between age and peak frequency for the beta band. Age was also unrelated to aperiodic-adjusted spectral power within either the alpha or beta bands, despite both frequency ranges being correlated with the aperiodic signal. Overall, these results highlight the capacity for both periodic and aperiodic features of the EEG to elucidate age-related functional changes within the developing brain.

                Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) are highly heritable major psychiatric disorders that share a substantial portion of genetic risk as well as their clinical manifestations. This raises a fundamental question of whether, and how, common neurobiological pathways translate their shared polygenic risks into shared clinical manifestations. The present study shows the miR-124- AMPAR pathway as a key common neurobiological mediator that connects polygenic risks with behavioral changes shared between these two psychotic disorders. We discovered upregulation of miR-124 in biopsied neuronal cells and postmortem prefrontal cortex from both SZ and BP patients, implying its role not only as a biomarker, but also as a pathophysiological mediator. Intriguingly, the upregulation is associated with the polygenic risks shared between these two disorders. Seeking mechanistic dissection, we generated a mouse model that upregulates miR- 124 in the medial prefrontal cortex, which includes brain regions homologous to sub-regions of the human prefrontal cortex. We demonstrated that upregulation of miR-124 increases GRIA2- lacking calcium permeable-AMPARs and perturbs AMPAR-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission, leading to deficits in the behavioral dimensions shared between SZ and BP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feature blindness: a challenge for understanding and modelling visual object recognition</a></h4>

              
                A central problem in vision sciences is to understand how humans recognise objects under novel viewing conditions. Recently, statistical inference models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) seem to have reproduced this ability by incorporating some architectural constraints of biological vision systems into machine learning models. This has led to the proposal that, like CNNs, humans solve the problem of object recognition by performing a statistical inference over their observations. This hypothesis remains difficult to test as models and humans learn in vastly different environments. Accordingly, any differences in performance could be attributed to the training environment rather than reflect any fundamental difference between statistical inference models and human vision. To overcome these limitations, we conducted a series of experiments and simulations where humans and models had no prior experience with the stimuli. The stimuli contained multiple features that varied in the extent to which they predicted category membership. We observed that human participants frequently ignored features that were highly predictive and clearly visible. Instead, they learned to rely on global features such as colour or shape, even when these features were not the most predictive. When these features were absent they failed to learn the task entirely. By contrast, ideal inference models as well as CNNs always learned to categorise objects based on the most predictive feature. This was the case even when the CNN was pre-trained to have a shape-bias and the convolutional backbone was frozen. These results highlight a fundamental difference between statistical inference models and humans: while statistical inference models such as CNNs learn most diagnostic features with little regard for the computational cost of learning these features, humans are highly constrained by their limited cognitive capacities which results in a qualitatively different approach to object recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differences in spike generation instead of synaptic inputs determine the feature selectivity of two retinal cell types.</a></h4>

              
                The output of spiking neurons depends both on their synaptic inputs and on their intrinsic properties. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the spiking projection neurons of the retina, comprise over 40 different types in mice and other mammals, each tuned to different features of visual scenes. The circuits providing synaptic input to different RGC types to drive feature selectivity have been studied extensively, but there has been substantially less research aimed at understanding how the intrinsic properties of RGCs differ and how those differences impact feature selectivity. Here, we introduce an RGC type in the mouse, the Bursty Suppressed-by-Contrast (bSbC) RGC, whose contrast selectivity is shaped by its intrinsic properties. Surprisingly, when we compare the bSbC RGC to the OFF sustained alpha (OFFsA) RGC that receives similar synaptic input, we find that the two RGC types exhibit starkly different responses to an identical stimulus. We identified spike generation as the key intrinsic property behind this functional difference; the bSbC RGC undergoes depolarization block in conditions where the OFFsA RGC maintains a high spike rate. Pharmacological experiments, imaging, and compartment modeling demonstrate that these differences in spike generation are the result of differences in voltage-gated sodium channel conductances. Our results demonstrate that differences in intrinsic properties allow these two RGC types to detect and relay distinct features of an identical visual stimulus to the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pupil Dilation and Response Slowing Distinguish Deliberate Explorative Choices in the Probabilistic Learning Task</a></h4>

              
                This study examined whether pupil size and response time would distinguish directed exploration from random exploration and exploitation. Eighty-nine participants performed the two-choice probabilistic learning task while their pupil size and response time were continuously recorded. Using LMM analysis, we estimated differences in the pupil size and response time between the advantageous and disadvantageous choices as a function of learning success, i.e., whether or not a participant has learned the probabilistic contingency between choices and their outcomes. We proposed that before a true value of each choice became known to a decision-maker, both advantageous and disadvantageous choices represented a random exploration of the two options with an equally uncertain outcome, whereas the same choices after learning manifested exploitation and direct exploration strategies, respectively. We found that disadvantageous choices were associated with increases both in response time and pupil size, but only after the participants had learned the choice-reward contingencies. For the pupil size, this effect was strongly amplified for those disadvantageous choices that immediately followed gains as compared to losses in the preceding choice. Pupil size modulations were evident during the behavioral choice rather than during the pretrial baseline. These findings suggest that occasional disadvantageous choices, which violate the acquired internal utility model, represent directed exploration. This exploratory strategy shifts choice priorities in favor of information seeking and its autonomic and behavioral concomitants are mainly driven by the conflict between the behavioral plan of the intended exploratory choice and its strong alternative, which has already proven to be more rewarding.

                In the central nervous system, the M-current plays a critical role in regulating subthreshold electrical excitability of neurons, determining their firing properties and responsiveness to synaptic input. The M-channel is mainly formed by subunits Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 that co-assemble to form a heterotetrametric channel. Mutations in Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 are associated with hyperexcitability phenotypes including benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) and neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (NEE). SGK1.1, the neuronal isoform of the serum and glucocorticoids-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), increases M-current density in neurons, leading to reduced excitability and protection against seizures. Herein, using two-electrode voltage clamp on Xenopus laevis oocytes, we demonstrate that SGK1.1 selectively activates heteromeric Kv7 subunit combinations underlying the M-current. Importantly, activated SGK1.1 is able to up-regulate M-channel activity in the presence of two different epilepsy mutations found in Kv7.2 subunit, R207W and A306T. In addition, proximity ligation assays in the N2a cell line allowed us to address the effect of these mutations on Kv7-SGK1.1-Nedd4 molecular associations, a proposed pathway underlying M-channel up-regulation by SGK1.1

                Precisely timed interactions between hippocampal and cortical cells, during quiescent periods dominated by replay of CA1 cell sequences, are thought to support memory consolidation. However, the processes during encoding that lead to coordinated offline replay remain poorly understood. We found entrainment of deep-layer medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) cells to CA1 cell assemblies dictated their later recruitment and synchronisation with hippocampal replay. These assembly-entrained cells participated preferentially in replay which included their CA1 assembly partner and in forward-projecting replay sequences. Finally, replay coordination of these dMEC cells showed a marked experience-dependent increase; becoming stronger as an animal became fluent with a novel spatial task. Together these findings suggest cell assemblies may support information propagation in hippocampo-cortical circuits and the establishment of long-term memories.

                During neural circuit formation, axons navigate from one intermediate target to the next, until they find their final target. At intermediate targets, axons switch from being attracted to being repelled by changing the guidance receptors on the growth cone surface. For smooth navigation of the intermediate target and the continuation of their journey, the switch in receptor expression has to be orchestrated in a precisely timed manner. As an alternative to changes in expression, receptor function could be regulated by phosphorylation of receptors or components of signaling pathways. We identifed Cables1 as a linker between floor-plate exit of commissural axons regulated by Slit/Robo signaling and the rostral turn of post-crossing axons regulated by Wnt/Frizzled signaling. Cables1 localizes {beta}-Catenin phosphorylated at tyrosine 489 by Abelson kinase to the distal axon, which in turn is necessary for the correct navigation of post-crossing commissural axons in the developing chicken spinal cord.

                Tonal languages differ from other languages in their use of pitch (tones) to distinguish words. Some research suggests that the linguistic pitch expertise of tonal language speakers may generalize to improved discrimination of some aspects of musical pitch: tonal language speakers may therefore have music perception advantages over speakers of other languages. The evidence is mixed, however, as prior studies have studied small numbers of participants in only a few tonal languages and countries, making it challenging to disentangle the effects of linguistic experience from variability in music training experience, cultural differences, and so on. Here, we report an assessment of music perception skill in native speakers of 40 languages, with a preregistered exploratory-confirmatory design, including tonal(e.g., Mandarin, Vietnamese), pitch-accented (e.g., Japanese, Croatian), and non-tonal (e.g., Spanish,Hungarian) languages. Whether or not participants had taken music lessons, native speakers of tonal languages (confirmatory N = 20,102) had an improved ability to discriminate musical melodies. But this improvement came with a trade-off: relative to speakers of pitch-accented (confirmatory N = 9,694)or non-tonal languages (confirmatory N = 242,096), tonal speakers were worse at discriminating fine-scale pitch-tuning and worse at processing the musical beat. These results, which held across 5 tonal languages and were robust to geographic and demographic variation, demonstrate that linguistic experience shapes music perception ability, with implications for relations between music, language, and culture in the human mind.

                Several transcription factors, including NeuroD1, have been shown to act as neuronal reprogramming factors (RFs) that induce neuronal conversion from somatic cells. However, it remains unexplored whether expression levels of RFs in the original cells affect reprogramming efficiency. Here, we show that the neuronal reprogramming efficiency from two distinct glial cell types, microglia and astrocytes, is substantially dependent on the expression level of NeuroD1: low expression failed to induce neuronal reprogramming, whereas elevated NeuroD1 expression dramatically improved reprogramming efficiency in both cell types. Moreover, even under conditions where NeuroD1 expression was too low to induce effective conversion by itself, combined expression of three RFs (Ascl1, Brn2, and NeuroD1) facilitated the breaking down of cellular barriers, inducing neuronal reprogramming. Thus, our results suggest that a sufficiently high expression level of RFs or alternatively their combinatorial expression, is the key to achieving efficient neuronal reprogramming from different cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative MRI reveals differences in striatal myelin in children with DLD</a></h4>

              
                Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by receptive or expressive language difficulties or both. While theoretical frameworks and empirical studies support the idea that there may be neural correlates of DLD in frontostriatal loops, findings are inconsistent across studies. Here, we use a novel semiquantitative imaging protocol, multiparameter mapping (MPM), to investigate microstructural neural differences in children with DLD. The MPM protocol allows us to reproducibly map specific indices of tissue microstructure. In 56 typically developing children and 34 children with DLD, we derived maps of: 1) longitudinal relaxation rate R1 (1/T1); 2) the transverse relaxation rate R2* (1/T2*); and 3) Magnetization Transfer Saturation (MTsat). R1 and MTsat predominantly index myelin, while R2* is sensitive to iron content. Children with DLD showed reductions in MTsat values in the caudate nucleus bilaterally, as well as in the left ventral sensorimotor cortex and Heschls gyrus. They also had globally lower R1 values. No group differences were noted in R2* maps. Differences in MTsat and R1 were coincident in the caudate nucleus bilaterally. These findings support our hypothesis of corticostriatal abnormalities in DLD and indicate abnormal levels of myelin in the dorsal striatum in children with DLD.

                Random dot kinematograms (RDKs) have recently been used to train subjects with cortical scotomas to perform direction of motion discrimination, partially restoring visual motion perception. To study recovery of visual perception, it is important to understand how visual areas in normal subjects and subjects with cortical scotomas respond to RDK stimuli. Studies in normal subjects have shown that Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) responses in human area hV5/MT+ increase monotonically with coherence, in general agreement with electrophysiology studies in primates. However, RDK responses in prior studies were obtained while the subject was performing fixation, not a motion discrimination condition. Furthermore, BOLD responses were gauged against a baseline condition of uniform illumination or static dots, potentially decreasing the specificity of responses for the spatial integration of local motion signals (motion coherence). Here we revisit this question starting from a baseline RDK condition of no coherence, thereby isolating the component of BOLD response due specifically to the spatial integration of local motion signals. In agreement with prior studies, we found that responses in area hV5/MT+ of healthy subjects were monotonically increasing when subjects fixated without performing a motion discrimination task. In contrast, when subjects were performing an RDK direction of motion discrimination task, responses in area hV5/MT+ remained flat, changing minimally, if at all, as a function of motion coherence. A similar pattern of responses was seen in area hV5/MT+ of subjects with dense cortical scotomas performing direction of motion discrimination for RDKs presented inside the scotoma. Passive RDK presentation within the scotoma elicited no significant hV5/MT+ responses. These observations shed further light on how visual cortex responses behave as a function of motion coherence, helping to prepare the ground for future studies using these methods to study visual system recovery after injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural network embedding of functional microconnectome.</a></h4>

              
                Our brain works as a complex network system. Experiential knowledge seems to be coded into the organism's network architecture rather than retaining only properties of individual neurons. In order to be better able to consider the high complexity of this network architecture, extracting simple rules through both automated as well as interpretable analysis of topological patterns will be necessary in order to allow more useful observations of interrelationships within the complex neural architecture. By combining these two types of analysis methods, we could automatically compress and naturally interpret topological patterns of functional connectivities, which produced electrical activities from many neurons simultaneously from acute slices of mice brain for 2.5 hours [Kajiwara et al. 2021]. As the first type of analysis, this study trained an artificial neural network system called Neural Network Embedding (NNE), and automatically compressed the functional connectivities into only small (25%) dimensions. As the second type of analysis, we widely compared the compressed features with ~15 representative network metrics, having clear interpretations, including > 5 centrality-type metrics and newly developed network metrics, that quantify degrees or ratio of hubs distanced by several-nodes from initially focused hubs. As the result, although we could give interpretations for only 55-60% of the extracted features, these new metrics, together with the commonly utilized network metrics, enabled interpretations for 80-100% features, using automated analysis. The result demonstrates not only the fact that the NNE method surpasses limitations of commonly used human-made variables, but also the possibility that acknowledgement of our own limitations drives us to extend interpretable possibilities by developing new analytic methodologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overground Gait Kinematics and Muscle Activation Patterns in the Yucatan Mini Pig</a></h4>

              
                A growing number of spinal cord injury, neuromodulation, and cell therapy studies on porcine models, especially the Yucatan minipigs (YMPs), have been recently reported. This is due to the large similarities between human and porcine neuroanatomy and biomechanics. To assess treatment modalities and locomotor recovery in this model, there is an obvious need for detailed characterization of normative overground gait in neurologically intact YMPs. The objective of this study was to assess gait biomechanics and the effect of overground walking speed on gait parameters, kinematics, and electromyographic (EMG) activity in the hindlimb muscles of YMPs. Nine neurologically-intact adult YMPs were trained to walk overground in a straight line. Whole-body kinematics and EMG activity of hindlimb muscles were recorded and analyzed at 6 different speed ranges (0.4-0.59, 0.6-0.79, 0.8-0.99, 1.0-1.19, 1.2-1.39, and 1.4-1.6 m/s). A MATLAB program was developed to detect strides and gait events automatically from motion-captured data. Significant decreases in stride duration, stance and swing times and an increase in stride length were observed with increasing speed. A transition in gait pattern occurred at the 1.0m/s walking speed. Significant increases in the range of motion of the knee and ankle joints were observed at higher speeds. Also, the points of minimum and maximum knee and ankle joint angles occurred earlier in the gait cycle at higher speeds. The onset of EMG activity in the biceps femoris muscle occurred significantly earlier in the gait cycle with increasing speed. A comprehensive characterization of overground walking in neurologically-intact YMPs is provided. These normative measures set the basis against which the effects of future interventions on locomotor capacity in YMPs can be compared.

	<p>To identify a screening tool for poor self-reported sleep quality at 12 weeks according to non-invasive measurements and patients’ characteristics in the first week after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), data from 473 mTBI participants were collected and follow-ups were performed at 12 weeks. Patients with previous poor self-reported sleep quality prior to the injury were excluded. Patients were then divided into two groups at 12 weeks according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index based on whether or not they experienced poor sleep quality. The analysis was performed on personal profiles and heart rate variability (HRV) for 1 week. After analyzing the non-invasive measurements and characteristics of mTBI patients who did not complain of poor sleep quality, several factors were found to be relevant to the delayed onset of poor sleep quality, including age, gender, and HRV measurements. The HRV–age–gender (HAG) index was proposed and found to have 100% sensitivity (cut-off, 7; specificity, 0.537) to predicting whether the patient will experience poor sleep quality after mTBI at the 12-week follow-up. The HAG index helps us to identify patients with mTBI who have no sleep quality complaints but are prone to developing poor self-reported sleep quality. Additional interventions to improve sleep quality would be important for these particular patients in the future.</p>

	<p>Emerging evidence has indicated disrupted learned irrelevance (LIrr), a form of selective attention deficit that may contribute to psychotic symptom formation, in schizophrenia. However, previous research mostly focused on chronic patients. There is a paucity of studies on LIrr in first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (i.e., schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder; FES), which were limited by small sample size and have produced mixed results. The current study examined a LIrr effect and its relationship with positive symptom severity in 40 briefly-medicated FES patients and 42 demographically-matched healthy controls using a well-validated computerized LIrr paradigm which has been applied in chronic schizophrenia sample. Positive symptoms were assessed by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS). Our results showed that controls demonstrated intact LIrr, with significantly faster learning about previously predictive (relevant) than previously non-predictive (irrelevant) cues. Lack of such normal attention bias towards predictive over non-predictive cues was observed in FES patients, indicating their failure to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant stimuli. Nonetheless, we failed to reveal any significant correlations between learning scores, in particular learning scores for non-predictive cues, and positive symptom measures in FES patients. Learning scores were also not associated with other symptom dimensions, cognitive functions and antipsychotic dose. In conclusion, our findings indicate aberrant LIrr with impaired allocation of attention to relevant versus irrelevant stimuli in briefly-medicated FES patients. Further prospective research is warranted to clarify the longitudinal trajectory of such selective attention deficit and its association with positive symptoms and treatment response in the early course of illness.</p>

	<p>Recent literature shows that the Coronovirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has provoked significant changes in dreaming. The current study intends to provide an update about dream variable changes during the second wave of COVID-19. A total of 611 participants completed a web survey from December 2020 to January 2021. Statistical comparisons showed that subjects had lower dream-recall frequency, nightmare frequency, lucid-dream frequency, emotional intensity, and nightmare distress during the second than the first wave of the pandemic. Dreams had a higher negative tone during the second than first wave. We revealed significant differences concerning post-traumatic growth, sleep-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and sleep measures between groups obtained as a function of the changes in the oneiric frequency between the first and second waves. We also found significant correlations between qualitative/emotional dream features and COVID-19-related factors (job change, forced quarantine, having COVID-19 infected relatives/friends, or asking for mental health help). Overall, we found that the second wave affected fewer quantitative features of dream activity and there was less emotional intensity. Moreover, we confirmed the relationship between nightmares and the high risk of PTSD when subjects were grouped as a function of the increasing/decreasing frequency. Finally, our findings are partly coherent with the continuity hypothesis between oneiric and waking experiences.</p>

	<p>Given the inconclusive findings regarding the relation between perfectionism and eating disorder symptoms, it is important that we determine whether this relation is modulated by emotion dysregulation, which is a prominent risk factor for eating disorders. We sought to identify specific cognitive emotion regulatory strategies—rumination, self-blame, and catastrophizing—that interact with multidimensional perfectionism to shape eating disorder symptoms (i.e., shape, weight, eating concerns, and dietary restraint). Using latent moderated structural equation modeling, we analyzed data from 167 healthy young female adults. We found that only rumination significantly moderated the relation between socially prescribed perfectionism and eating disorder symptoms. However, this was not observed for self-oriented perfectionism or other regulatory strategies. These findings held true when a host of covariates were controlled for. Our findings underscore the crucial role of rumination, a modifiable emotion regulatory strategy, in augmenting the relation between socially prescribed perfectionism and eating disorder symptoms in young women.</p>

	<p>A special class of proteins called Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an essential part of the innate immune system, connecting it to the adaptive immune system. There are 10 different Toll-Like Receptors that have been identified in human beings. TLRs are part of the central nervous system (CNS), showing that the CNS is capable of the immune response, breaking the long-held belief of the brain’s “immune privilege” owing to the blood–brain barrier (BBB). These Toll-Like Receptors are present not just on the resident macrophages of the central nervous system but are also expressed by the neurons to allow them for the production of proinflammatory agents such as interferons, cytokines, and chemokines; the activation and recruitment of glial cells; and their participation in neuronal cell death by apoptosis. This study is focused on the potential roles of various TLRs in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), namely TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 in AD and PD in human beings and a mouse model.</p>

	<p>Deficits in neuronal structure are consistently associated with neurodevelopmental illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia. Nonetheless, the inability to access neurons from clinical patients has limited the study of early neurostructural changes directly in patients’ cells. This obstacle has been circumvented by differentiating stem cells into neurons, although the most used methodologies are time consuming. Therefore, we recently developed a relatively rapid (~20 days) protocol for transdifferentiating human circulating monocytes into neuronal-like cells. These monocyte-derived-neuronal-like cells (MDNCs) express several genes and proteins considered neuronal markers, such as MAP-2 and PSD-95. In addition, these cells conduct electrical activity. We have also previously shown that the structure of MDNCs is comparable with that of human developing neurons (HDNs) after 5 days in culture. Moreover, the neurostructure of MDNCs responds similarly to that of HDNs when exposed to colchicine and dopamine. In this manuscript, we expanded our characterization of MDNCs to include the expression of 12 neuronal genes, including tau. Following, we compared three different tracing approaches (two semi-automated and one automated) that enable tracing using photographs of live cells. This comparison is imperative for determining which neurite tracing method is more efficient in extracting neurostructural data from MDNCs and thus allowing researchers to take advantage of the faster yield provided by these neuronal-like cells. Surprisingly, it was one of the semi-automated methods that was the fastest, consisting of tracing only the longest primary and the longest secondary neurite. This tracing technique also detected more structural deficits. The only automated method tested, Volocity, detected MDNCs but failed to trace the entire neuritic length. Other advantages and disadvantages of the three tracing approaches are also presented and discussed.</p>

	<p>Anomia is an early and prominent feature of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Research investigating treatment for lexical retrieval impairment in individuals with progressive anomia has focused primarily on monolingual speakers, and treatment in bilingual speakers is relatively unexplored. In this series of single-case experiments, 10 bilingual speakers with progressive anomia received lexical retrieval treatment designed to engage relatively spared cognitive-linguistic abilities and promote word retrieval. Treatment was administered in two phases, with one language targeted per phase. Cross-linguistic cognates (e.g., rose and rosa) were included as treatment targets to investigate their potential to facilitate cross-linguistic transfer. Performance on trained and untrained stimuli was evaluated before, during, and after each phase of treatment, and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Participants demonstrated a significant treatment effect in each of their treated languages, with maintenance up to one year post-treatment for the majority of participants. Most participants showed a significant cross-linguistic transfer effect for trained cognates in both the dominant and nondominant language, with fewer than half of participants showing a significant translation effect for noncognates. A gradual diminution of translation and generalization effects was observed during the follow-up period. Findings support the implementation of dual-language intervention approaches for bilingual speakers with progressive anomia, irrespective of language dominance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Test-Retest Reliability of Short-Interval Intracortical Inhibition Assessed by Threshold-Tracking and Automated Conventional Techniques</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Two novel short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) protocols, assessing SICI across a range of interstimulus intervals (ISIs) using either parallel threshold-tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TT-TMS) or automated conventional TMS (cTMS), were recently introduced. However, the test-retest reliability of these protocols has not been investigated, which is important if they are to be introduced in the clinic. SICI was recorded in 18 healthy subjects using TT-TMS (T-SICI) and cTMS (A-SICI). All subjects were examined at four identical sessions, i.e., morning and afternoon sessions on 2 d, 5&ndash;7 d apart. Both SICI protocols were performed twice at each session by the same observer. In one of the sessions, another observer performed additional examinations. Neither intraobserver nor interobserver measures of SICI differed significantly between examinations, except for T-SICI at ISI 3 ms (<I>p</I> = 0.00035) and A-SICI at ISI 2.5 ms (<I>p</I> = 0.0103). Intraday reliability was poor-to-good for A-SICI and moderate-to-good for T-SICI. Interday and interobserver reliabilities of T-SICI and A-SICI were moderate-to-good. Although between-subject variation constituted most of the total variation, SICI repeatability in an individual subject was poor. The two SICI protocols showed no considerable systematic bias across sessions and had a comparable test-retest reliability profile. Findings from the present study suggest that both SICI protocols may be reliably and reproducibly employed in research studies, but should be used with caution for individual decision-making in clinical settings. Studies exploring reliability in patient cohorts are warranted to investigate the clinical utility of these two SICI protocols.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The nonhuman primate (NHP) constitutes an extraordinarily important model in neuroscience research for understanding the neuronal underpinnings of perceptual, motor, cognitive, and executive functions of the primate brain, and to study the physiological causes, effects, and potential treatments of brain disorders. Because of their cognitive capabilities, NHPs receive special attention in animal welfare regulations around the world, and their well-being is a benchmark for the evaluation, monitoring, and refinement of experimental procedures. As a consequence, many typical neuroscientific procedures are considered only mildly severe by animal welfare boards. There is, however, an ongoing debate about possible long-term and cumulative effects. Because of a lack of longitudinal data, it is unclear whether mildly severe procedures may cause more significant harm on the long-term, and to what extent they may impact animal well-being and healthiness over time. We here make use of a database of blood samples drawn over a period of 15 years from 39 rhesus monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) to address the issue of long-term, cumulative effects of neuroscientific procedures. A careful analysis of indicative primate blood markers for chronic inflammation, hydration status, and stress levels, their comparison to baseline values from both the same animals and the literature, and evaluation of additional hematologic, physiological, and behavioral parameters did not provide support for the notion of long-term, cumulative effects on the monkeys&rsquo; healthiness and well-being. The results may serve the community as a reference for the severity assessment of neuroscientific experiments involving NHPs.</p>

                Longstanding scientific efforts have been dedicated to answer why and how our particular intelligence is generated by our brain but not by the brain of other species. However, surprisingly little effort has been made to ask why no other species ever developed an intelligence similar to ours. Here, I explore this question based on genetic and paleontologic evidence. Contrary to the established view, this review suggests that the developmental hurdles alone are not high enough to explain the uniqueness of human intelligence (HI). As an additional explanation I propose that HI is normally not retained by natural selection, because it is, under most conditions, an intrinsically unfavourable trait. This unfavourableness, however, cannot be explained by physical constraints alone; rather, it may also be rooted in the same emotional and social complexity that is necessary for the development of HI. Thus, a major obstacle towards HI may not be solely the development of the required physical assets, but also to cope with harmful individual, social and environmental feedback intrinsically associated with this trait.

                <p>by Gal Gilad, Mark D. M. Leiserson, Roded Sharan</p>

Mutational processes shape the genomes of cancer patients and their understanding has important applications in diagnosis and treatment. Current modeling of mutational processes by identifying their characteristic signatures views each base substitution in a limited context of a single flanking base on each side. This context definition gives rise to 96 categories of mutations that have become the standard in the field, even though wider contexts have been shown to be informative in specific cases. Here we propose a data-driven approach for constructing a mutation categorization for mutational signature analysis. Our approach is based on the assumption that tumor cells that are exposed to similar mutational processes, show similar expression levels of DNA damage repair genes that are involved in these processes. We attempt to find a categorization that maximizes the agreement between mutation and gene expression data, and show that it outperforms the standard categorization over multiple quality measures. Moreover, we show that the categorization we identify generalizes to unseen data from different cancer types, suggesting that mutation context patterns extend beyond the immediate flanking bases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating ectopic beat probability with simplified statistical models that account for experimental uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qingchu Jin, Joseph L. Greenstein, Raimond L. Winslow</p>

Ectopic beats (EBs) are cellular arrhythmias that can trigger lethal arrhythmias. Simulations using biophysically-detailed cardiac myocyte models can reveal how model parameters influence the probability of these cellular arrhythmias, however such analyses can pose a huge computational burden. Here, we develop a simplified approach in which logistic regression models (LRMs) are used to define a mapping between the parameters of complex cell models and the probability of EBs (P(EB)). As an example, in this study, we build an LRM for P(EB) as a function of the initial value of diastolic cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub><sup>ini</sup>), the initial state of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> load ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub><sup>ini</sup>), and kinetic parameters of the inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>K1</sub>) and ryanodine receptor (RyR). This approach, which we refer to as arrhythmia sensitivity analysis, allows for evaluation of the relationship between these arrhythmic event probabilities and their associated parameters. This LRM is also used to demonstrate how uncertainties in experimentally measured values determine the uncertainty in P(EB). In a study of the role of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub><sup>ini</sup> uncertainty, we show a special property of the uncertainty in P(EB), where with increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub><sup>ini</sup> uncertainty, P(EB) uncertainty first increases and then decreases. Lastly, we demonstrate that I<sub>K1</sub> suppression, at the level that occurs in heart failure myocytes, increases P(EB).

Over the past 40 years, actigraphy has been used to study rest-activity patterns in circadian rhythm and sleep research. Furthermore, considering its simplicity of use, there is a growing interest in the analysis of large population-based samples, using actigraphy. Here, we introduce <i>pyActigraphy</i>, a comprehensive toolbox for data visualization and analysis including multiple sleep detection algorithms and rest-activity rhythm variables. This open-source python package implements methods to read multiple data formats, quantify various properties of rest-activity rhythms, visualize sleep agendas, automatically detect rest periods and perform more advanced signal processing analyses. The development of this package aims to pave the way towards the establishment of a comprehensive open-source software suite, supported by a community of both developers and researchers, that would provide all the necessary tools for in-depth and large scale actigraphy data analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Experiment level curation of transcriptional regulatory interactions in neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eric Ching-Pan Chu, Alexander Morin, Tak Hou Calvin Chang, Tue Nguyen, Yi-Cheng Tsai, Aman Sharma, Chao Chun Liu, Paul Pavlidis</p>

To facilitate the development of large-scale transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) that may enable in-silico analyses of disease mechanisms, a reliable catalogue of experimentally verified direct transcriptional regulatory interactions (DTRIs) is needed for training and validation. There has been a long history of using low-throughput experiments to validate single DTRIs. Therefore, we reason that a reliable set of DTRIs could be produced by curating the published literature for such evidence. In our survey of previous curation efforts, we identified the lack of details about the quantity and the types of experimental evidence to be a major gap, despite the theoretical importance of such details for the identification of bona fide DTRIs. We developed a curation protocol to inspect the published literature for support of DTRIs at the experiment level, focusing on genes important to the development of the mammalian nervous system. We sought to record three types of low-throughput experiments: Transcription factor (TF) perturbation, TF-DNA binding, and TF-reporter assays. Using this protocol, we examined a total of 1,310 papers to assemble a collection of 1,499 unique DTRIs, involving 251 TFs and 825 target genes, many of which were not reported in any other DTRI resource. The majority of DTRIs (965; 64%) were supported by two or more types of experimental evidence and 27% were supported by all three. Of the DTRIs with all three types of evidence, 170 had been tested using primary tissues or cells and 44 had been tested directly in the central nervous system. We used our resource to document research biases among reports towards a small number of well-studied TFs. To demonstrate a use case for this resource, we compared our curation to a previously published high-throughput perturbation screen and found significant enrichment of the curated targets among genes differentially expressed in the developing brain in response to Pax6 deletion. This study demonstrates a proof-of-concept for the assembly of a high resolution DTRI resource to support the development of large-scale TRNs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RgCop-A regularized copula based method for gene selection in single cell rna-seq data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Snehalika Lall, Sumanta Ray, Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay</p>

Gene selection in unannotated large single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is important and crucial step in the preliminary step of downstream analysis. The existing approaches are primarily based on high variation (highly variable genes) or significant high expression (highly expressed genes) failed to provide stable and predictive feature set due to technical noise present in the data. Here, we propose <i>RgCop</i>, a novel regularized copula based method for gene selection from large single cell RNA-seq data. <i>RgCop</i> utilizes copula correlation (<i>Ccor</i>), a robust equitable dependence measure that captures multivariate dependency among a set of genes in single cell expression data. We raise an objective function by adding a <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> regularization term with <i>Ccor</i> to penalizes the redundant co-efficient of features/genes, resulting non-redundant effective features/genes set. Results show a significant improvement in the clustering/classification performance of real life scRNA-seq data over the other state-of-the-art. <i>RgCop</i> performs extremely well in capturing dependence among the features of noisy data due to the scale invariant property of copula, thereby improving the stability of the method. Moreover, the differentially expressed (DE) genes identified from the clusters of scRNA-seq data are found to provide an accurate annotation of cells. Finally, the features/genes obtained from <i>RgCop</i> can able to annotate the unknown cells with high accuracy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Photophysiological cycles in Arctic krill are entrained by weak midday twilight during the Polar Night</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan H. Cohen, Kim S. Last, Corie L. Charpentier, Finlo Cottier, Malin Daase, Laura Hobbs, Geir Johnsen, Jørgen Berge</p>

Light plays a fundamental role in the ecology of organisms in nearly all habitats on Earth and is central for processes such as vision and the entrainment of the circadian clock. The poles represent extreme light regimes with an annual light cycle including periods of Midnight Sun and Polar Night. The Arctic Ocean extends to the North Pole, and marine light extremes reach their maximum extent in this habitat. During the Polar Night, traditional definitions of day and night and seasonal photoperiod become irrelevant since there are only “twilight” periods defined by the sun’s elevation below the horizon at midday; we term this “midday twilight.” Here, we characterize light across a latitudinal gradient (76.5° N to 81° N) during Polar Night in January. Our light measurements demonstrate that the classical solar diel light cycle dominant at lower latitudes is modulated during Arctic Polar Night by lunar and auroral components. We therefore question whether this particular ambient light environment is relevant to behavioral and visual processes. We reveal from acoustic field observations that the zooplankton community is undergoing diel vertical migration (DVM) behavior. Furthermore, using electroretinogram (ERG) recording under constant darkness, we show that the main migratory species, Arctic krill (<i>Thysanoessa inermis</i>) show endogenous increases in visual sensitivity during the subjective night. This change in sensitivity is comparable to that under exogenous dim light acclimations, although differences in speed of vision suggest separate mechanisms. We conclude that the extremely weak midday twilight experienced by krill at high latitudes during the darkest parts of the year has physiological and ecological relevance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Deep learning allows genome-scale prediction of Michaelis constants from structural features</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Kroll, Martin K. M. Engqvist, David Heckmann, Martin J. Lercher</p>

The Michaelis constant <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> describes the affinity of an enzyme for a specific substrate and is a central parameter in studies of enzyme kinetics and cellular physiology. As measurements of <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> are often difficult and time-consuming, experimental estimates exist for only a minority of enzyme–substrate combinations even in model organisms. Here, we build and train an organism-independent model that successfully predicts <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> values for natural enzyme–substrate combinations using machine and deep learning methods. Predictions are based on a task-specific molecular fingerprint of the substrate, generated using a graph neural network, and on a deep numerical representation of the enzyme’s amino acid sequence. We provide genome-scale <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> predictions for 47 model organisms, which can be used to approximately relate metabolite concentrations to cellular physiology and to aid in the parameterization of kinetic models of cellular metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Skin swabbing protocol to collect DNA samples from small-bodied fish species [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Fish species are commonly used as experimental models in the laboratory. DNA is routinely collected from these animals to permit identification of their genotype. The current standard procedure to sample DNA is fin clipping, which involves anaesthetising individuals and removing a portion of the caudal fin. While fin clipping reliably generates good quality DNA samples for downstream applications, there is evidence that it can alter health and welfare, leading to infection and impacting on the fish’s behaviour. This in turn can result in greater variation in the data collected. In a recent study we adapted a skin swabbing protocol to collect DNA from small-bodied fish, including sticklebacks and zebrafish, without the use of anaesthetics or sharp instruments. A rayon-tipped swab was used to collect mucus from the flank of the fish, which was then used for DNA extraction. We subsequently demonstrated that compared to fin clipping, skin swabbing triggered fewer changes in stress axis activation and behaviour. We also found that data collected from fish that had been swabbed were less variable than data from fish that had been fin clipped, potentially allowing smaller sample sizes in experimental groups after using this technique, and thereby reducing animal use. Here we provide a detailed protocol explaining how to collect DNA samples from small laboratory fish using skin swabs.

                False discovery rates (FDR) are an essential component of statistical inference, representing the propensity for an observed result to be mistaken. FDR estimates should accompany observed results to help the user contextualize the relevance and potential impact of findings. This paper introduces a new user-friendly R pack-age for estimating FDRs and computing adjusted p-values for FDR control. The roles of these two quantities are often confused in practice and some software packages even report the adjusted p-values as the estimated FDRs. A key contribution of this package is that it distinguishes between these two quantities while also offering a broad array of refined algorithms for estimating them. For example, included are newly augmented methods for estimating the null proportion of findings - an important part of the FDR estimation procedure. The package is broad, encompassing a variety of adjustment methods for FDR estimation and FDR control, and includes plotting functions for easy display of results. Through extensive illustrations, we strongly encourage wider reporting of false discovery rates for observed findings.

                Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Chrysanthemum (Dendrathema grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared areca nut and chrysanthemum polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into five groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (treatment with 20% areca nut:80% chrysanthemum), F2 (treatment with 50% areca nut:50% chrysanthemum), and F3 (treatment with 80% areca nut:20% chrysanthemum). Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results: During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenases assay, a high concentration of areca nut (F3) induced the abundance of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions: The combination of areca nut and chrysanthemum extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Tau reduction prevents epileptogenesis, but underlying mechanisms are uncertain. Chang et al. show that tau ablation decreases the baseline activity of excitatory neurons and modulates the intrinsic excitability and axon initial segments of inhibitory neurons, promoting network inhibition. In combination, these effects counteract network hypersynchrony and diseases causing excitation/inhibition imbalance.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Synaptogenic activity of the axon guidance molecule Robo2 underlies hippocampal circuit function</a></h4>

              
                Blockus et al. demonstrate that the axon guidance receptors Robo1/2 are synaptogenic cues required postsynaptically for the establishment of synaptic specificity between CA3 axons and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs). Developmental deletion of Robo2 in CA1 PNs disrupts the emergence of place cell properties in adult hippocampus.

Orexigenic effects of high-fat diet (HFD) occur when mice neither taste nor smell the diet. Infusing HFD into the stomach increases caloric intake, suggesting that post-oral detection of high-fat content drives increased consumption.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">NRF2 promotes urothelial cell response to bacterial infection by regulating reactive oxygen species and RAB27B expression</a></h4>

              
                Joshi et al. show that bladder epithelial cells activate the NRF2 pathway in response to urinary tract infections caused by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC). The NRF2 pathway promotes UPEC expulsion, a major defense mechanism. Dimethyl fumarate, a NRF2 activator, promotes UPEC clearance in a mouse model of UTIs.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">p38-mediated cell growth and survival drive rapid embryonic wound repair</a></h4>

              
                Scepanovic et al. show that cell growth drives rapid embryonic wound healing. Damage-induced activation of p38 in the cells around the wound stimulates the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC1 to promote an increase in cell volume that facilitates tissue repair. p38 also reduces wound-associated oxidative stress, thus limiting wound size.

                Schütz et al. show that deletion of the TRPM7 channels conducting Ca2+ and Mg2+ into cells leads to embryonic lethality. Detailed analysis of key stages during early embryogenesis indicates a defect in proliferation and adhesion of TRPM7-deficient trophoblast stem cells that guarantee embryo implantation into the uterus epithelium.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A multistate stem cell dynamics maintains homeostasis in mouse spermatogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Nakagawa et al. elucidate the dynamics of mouse spermatogenic stem cells, using a combination of clonal-fate analyses, molecular characterizations, and mathematical modeling. They find that stem cells function as a single heterogeneous pool where commitment for differentiation is not direct but occurs through a reversible transition into differentiation-primed states.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Derlin rhomboid pseudoproteases employ substrate engagement and lipid distortion to enable the retrotranslocation of ERAD membrane substrates</a></h4>

              
                ER-associated degradation is a conserved pathway of protein quality control that requires the retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated substrates from the ER to the cytoplasm for degradation. Nejatfard et al. show that derlin rhomboid pseudoproteases mediate the retrotranslocation of misfolded membrane substrates via a mechanism that is conserved from yeast to humans.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">ROR and RYK extracellular region structures suggest that receptor tyrosine kinases have distinct WNT-recognition modes</a></h4>

              
                Several receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family members function as WNT receptors. Shi et al. show that although RTKs bind WNTs using similar domains to those seen in Frizzleds (FZDs) and WIF-1, they bind WNTs in a distinct way that may allow a single WNT to bind both receptor types simultaneously.

                Toullec et al. explore the assembly of PIKK complexes as a paradigm to understand the principles governing the biogenesis of multimeric complexes. Biochemical and functional analyses show that, in fission yeast, PIKK maturation and assembly occur sequentially, rather than simultaneously, and require distinct factors and mechanisms.

                Patterns of synaptic connectivity govern the functional properties of neural circuits. Graham et al. map the afferent neurons targeting eight specific cell classes in mouse infralimbic cortex. Inputs from the hippocampus and thalamus are differentially targeted to specific neurons, suggesting two distinct synaptic microcircuits control circuit transformations.
