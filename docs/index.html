                Background Children’s use of social media has increased significantly over the past decade. As a result, they are susceptible to smartphone addiction. In particular, parents' and children's well-being and behaviors are negatively affected by smartphone addiction. Such addiction likely affects both physical performance and lifestyle. Adolescents utilize their smartphones while performing other tasks. The secondary task might divert attention away from the primary task. Reaction time is the combination of brain processing and muscular movement. Texting or communicating on a smartphone while performing another task may affect reaction time. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the influence of smartphone use on reaction time in undergraduate students who were addicted to smartphones. Methods The Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) was used to assign 64 undergraduate students to the smartphone addiction group (n = 32) and the control group (n = 32). The reaction time (RT) of an organism is used to determine how rapidly it responds to stimuli. All participants were examined on the RT test under three conditions: no smartphone use (control), texting, and chatting on a smartphone. Participants were questioned by smartphone through text message or chat with the support of a researcher during the texting and conversation conditions. While responding to the questions, the participant was administered an RT test. Results The results showed that smartphone addiction tends to have a reduced influence on reaction time when compared to the control group. Also, texting or conversing on a smartphone while doing other work had a substantial impact on reaction time in the undergraduates. Conclusions Combining smartphone use with other activities tends to reduce undergraduate students' reaction time.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-247/v3?src=rss">Recognizing human activities using light-weight and effective machine learning methodologies [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 3 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Human activity recognition poses a complex challenge in predicting individuals’ movements from raw sensor data using machine learning models. This paper explores the application of six prominent machine learning techniques – decision tree, random forest, linear regression, Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and neural networks – to enhance the accuracy of human activity detection for e-health systems. Despite previous research efforts employing data mining and machine learning, there remains room for improvement in performance. The study focuses on predicting activities such as walking, standing, laying, sitting, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Methods The research employs six machine learning algorithms to recognize human activities, including decision tree, random forest, linear regression, Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and neural networks. Results Evaluation of the human activity recognition dataset reveals that the random forest classifier, CNN, GRN and neural network yield promising results, achieving high accuracy. However, Naïve Bayes falls short of satisfying outcomes. Conclusions The study successfully classifies activities like SITTING, STANDING, LAYING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, and WALKING_UPSTAIRS with a remarkable accuracy of 98%. The contribution lies in the thorough exploration of machine learning techniques, with neural networks emerging as the most effective in enhancing human activity recognition. The findings showcase the potential for advanced applications in e-health systems and beyond.

                Background Early-life food consumption patterns may affect children’s health by increasing susceptibility to developing non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) in adulthood. Aims To evaluate Jordanian children and adolescents’ energy and macronutrient intake and how closely they adhere to dietary recommendations. Methods This cross-sectional study used data from Jordan’s Population-based Food Consumption Survey, a household population-based study conducted in Jordan between 2021 and 2022 (561 children and adolescents 8-19 years). Dietary intake was assessed using the two non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recall methods (24-h DR). The estimated food group and nutrient intakes were compared to nutritional recommendations, including MyPlate dietary guidelines. Results The prevalence of overweight/obese individuals based on body mass index (BMI) was 44%, and the average waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was 24.7%. Compared to MyPlate dietary guidelines, children and adolescents had a higher added sugar intake (57g/day). Also, consuming vegetables, fruits, and dairy fell short of MyPlate dietary guidelines. The total discretionary calorie intake in children and adolescents was approximately one-third of the total energy intake. Conclusion The food consumption of Jordanian children and adolescents includes high intakes of discretionary calories, with a low intake of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was elevated compared to international norms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-953/v2?src=rss">Community-level dietary intake of sodium, potassium, and sodium-to-potassium ratio as a global public health problem: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Widespread adoption of a westernized diet represents a major lifestyle change characterized by substantially higher sodium consumption and lower potassium intake, which is related to cardiovascular morbidity. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis over published studies in accordance with quantifying the dietary intake of sodium and potassium of the universal population across the world. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were used to find research that pronounced 24-hour urinary sodium or potassium excretion (reference period: 2014–2021). The effect size was estimated using the fixed-effect model; sub-group analysis become accomplished to determine urinary sodium and potassium excretion disaggregated by geographical location. Publication bias became evaluated the usage of graphical funnel plot. Data analysis was performed using STATA 16. Results: Forty-three studies (n= 62,940) qualified the selection criteria. The mean urinary excretion of sodium and potassium was 156.73 mmol/24h [95% confidence interval (CI), 148.98–164.47] and 48.89 mmol/24 h (95% CI, 43.61–54.17), respectively; the mean urinary sodium/potassium ratio was 3.68 (95% CI, 2.96–4.40). Conclusions: This updated systematic review highlights excessively high dietary intake of sodium and low intake of potassium at the community level in most parts of the world. The urinary Na/K ratio exceeded the level recommended by the WHO guidelines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1108/v1?src=rss">Mediating role of Social Support and Self-efficiency on Academic stress and Student’s Psychological well-being among Public and Private Universities in Mogadishu -Somalia. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic stress is a significant factor affecting students’ psychological well-being, particularly in higher education. Understanding the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy can provide insights into how these factors influence students’ psychological well-being in public and private universities. Methods The study examined the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy in the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Utilizing a stratified sampling technique, data were collected from 663 students across public (52.6%) and private (47.4%) universities through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. Structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Results The analysis revealed a significant direct effect of academic stress on psychological well-being (β = 0.133, p = 0.000). Academic stress was not significantly related to social support (β = 0.128, p = 0.066) and self-efficacy (β = 0.075, p = 0.099). However, both social support (β = 0.059, p = 0.000) and self-efficacy (β = 0.838, p = 0.000) were significantly related to psychological well-being. The mediating analysis showed that social support partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being (Indirect effect = 0.070, CI [-0.036, 0.197], p = 0.000), while self-efficacy did not mediate this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.063, CI [0.054, 0.218], p = 0.097). Conclusions The findings suggest a significant positive impact of academic stress on psychological well-being, while social support partially mediates this relationship, highlighting its buffering role. Conversely, self-efficacy, although positively contributing to psychological well-being, does not mediate the effect of academic stress. These results underscore the importance of robust social support systems and targeted interventions to enhance students’ coping mechanisms and overall psychological well-being. Study limitations and implication are discussed.

                Maintaining short-term planning aligned with the ultimate long-term plan is challenging. This requires many details to be modelled on a daily or weekly basis to reach this target. Short-term planning is more challenging than medium- and long-term planning because it deals with uncertainties, which increases the gap between medium- and long-term plans. Short-term mine planning teams are expected to identify and manage potential risks to mitigate them, and eventually achieve the long-term objective of maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV). Very few studies have identified the problems that exist in short-term mine planning and provided technical solutions to overcome them for open-pit mines. One of the complexities associated with short-term planning is the creation of polygons or mining cuts by clustering before optimizing and scheduling the plan to reduce the computational expense of mine planning models. The primary objective of this study is to review the latest papers describing short-term mine planning challenges and technical solutions proposed to optimize mine planning for open-pit mines.

                Background The success of the theories of special and general relativity in describing localised phenomena, such as objects undergoing high speed motion or located in gravitational fields, needs no further elaboration. However, when applied to the evolution of the universe several problems arise which can require an additional model, e.g., inflation during the early expansion, and adjustments to parameters to account for phenomena such as the late-time acceleration of the universe. Methods Focusing on the difference between the ways in which space and time are measured, this paper shows that there are two paths which allow the equations of special relativity to be produced from the same basic postulates. Results Both the standard theory and the energy/momentum, or dynamic model, utilise the Minkowski metric, but with different coordinate systems. The dynamic model transforms Cartesian coordinates into an Euclidean form by multiplying the coordinates by functions of γ (=(1–ν 2)c 2)-1⁄2). When utilising these coordinates, the relativistic equations are unchanged for local phenomena such as the Lorentz coordinate transformation and the energy/momentum equation for high-velocity objects. Conclusions However, the derived coordinates alter the perceived overall structure of the universe in a manner that, for the simplest model under this system, allows the reproduction of observed cosmological features, such as the intrinsic flatness of the universe and the apparent late-time acceleration of its expansion, without the need of additional models or changes in parameter values.

                Background Outpatient services were a major aspect of hospital healthcare, primarily due to the prevalent inclination of individuals to seek efficient and expedient treatment options that could be provided within a single day. In this context, the experience of head nurses played a crucial role in providing optimum nursing care under supervision. This study aimed to explore the experience of head nurses in supervising nursing staff in the outpatient department. Method this study used a qualitative hermeneutic phenomenology design, and the participants were selected using the purposive sampling method. Result This study recruited a total of 20 head nurses in public and private hospitals in West Sumatra province. The FGD data were analyzed and coded using a total of 102 nodes, which were then used to generate 5 themes and 16 subthemes. The five major themes included the knowledge of head nurses about supervision, the performance appraisal method, the feeling of head nurses when supervising, the supervisor support for supervision, and the expectations of head nurses. Conclusion Clinical supervision in the outpatient department was crucial for the success of nurses in delivering healthcare services. The study revealed that while supervision was essential, head nurses observed that it was often perceived as fault-finding by nursing staff, which could affect individual assessment scores and sometimes led to indifference towards the process.

Methods: In this study, a male and a female participants’ photographs and lateral cephalograms were digitally manipulated by inserting them into Dolphin software; we considered four soft tissue parameters at a nasolabial angle, upper lip E-line, lower lip E-line, and pg-pg’, so that 20 profiles were created for each model. A visual analog scale (VAS) along with a question about surgical correction opinion was given to 18 orthodontists, 18 general dentists, and 18 laypersons to score (1-5) from least to most attractive. Spearman’s rank correlation was computed to assess correlation, as well as ANOVA, followed by post hoc Tukey analysis to compare the mean scores, and Chi-square test to determine the opinion about surgical treatment. Results: There was an overall weak and negative correlation between the three groups, indicating that orthodontists attributed lower pleasantness scores to almost all the altered female and male facial profiles. Additionally, statistically significantly lower mean scores were attributed by orthodontists to many females and few male facial profiles. More orthodontists identified the need for surgical correction for a few severely distorted profiles but there was a statistically non-significant difference among the groups for most of the profiles. Conclusions: It was concluded that participants in the three groups had diverse concepts of facial attractiveness in all the parameters considered. Compared to general dentists and laypersons, orthodontists were much more precise, firmer, and meticulous in identifying a favorable or good-looking profile.

Solid tumors are characterized by complex interactions between the tumor, the immune system and the microenvironment. These interactions and intra-tumor variations have both diagnostic and prognostic significance and implications. However, quantifying the underlying processes in patient samples requires expensive and complicated molecular experiments. In contrast, H&E staining is typically performed as part of the routine standard process, and is very cheap. Here we present HIPI (H&E Image Interpretation and Protein Expression Inference) for predicting cell marker expression from tumor H&E images. We process paired H&E and CyCIF images taken from serial sections of colorectal cancers to train our model. We show that our model accurately predicts the spatial distribution of several important cell markers, on both held-out tumor regions as well as new tumor samples taken from different patients. Moreover, using only the tissue image morphology, HIPI is able to colocalize the interactions between different cell types, further demonstrating its potential clinical significance.

Accurate prediction of epidemics is pivotal for making well-informed decisions for the control of infectious diseases, but addressing heterogeneity in the system poses a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel modeling framework integrating the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models, by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (UDE) model. Simultaneously, we pre-set a specific form for the recruitment rate and develop a mechanistic model. Data from a COVID Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the UDE model using deep learning methods and to calibrate the mechanistic model using MCMC methods. Subsequently, we project the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy. Our projections indicate an attack rate and a peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared with the homogeneous model’s projections of 99.97% and 32.78%, thus providing an 18.6% improvement in the prediction accuracy based on the actual data. Our simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in the susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37.36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days, also aligning with the real case. We consider that this study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models and new insights for modelling heterogeneity.

                <p>by Kevin Tsai, Zhen Zhou, Jiadong Yang, Zhiliang Xu, Shixin Xu, Roya Zandi, Nan Hao, Weitao Chen, Mark Alber</p>

Understanding the mechanisms of the cellular aging processes is crucial for attempting to extend organismal lifespan and for studying age-related degenerative diseases. Yeast cells divide through budding, providing a classical biological model for studying cellular aging. With their powerful genetics, relatively short cell cycle, and well-established signaling pathways also found in animals, yeast cells offer valuable insights into the aging process. Recent experiments suggested the existence of two aging modes in yeast characterized by nucleolar and mitochondrial declines, respectively. By analyzing experimental data, this study shows that cells evolving into those two aging modes behave differently when they are young. While buds grow linearly in both modes, cells that consistently generate spherical buds throughout their lifespan demonstrate greater efficacy in controlling bud size and growth rate at young ages. A three-dimensional multiscale chemical-mechanical model was developed and used to suggest and test hypothesized impacts of aging on bud morphogenesis. Experimentally calibrated model simulations showed that during the early stage of budding, tubular bud shape in one aging mode could be generated by locally inserting new materials at the bud tip, a process guided by the polarized Cdc42 signal. Furthermore, the aspect ratio of the tubular bud could be stabilized during the late stage as observed in experiments in this work. The model simulation results suggest that the localization of new cell surface material insertion, regulated by chemical signal polarization, could be weakened due to cellular aging in yeast and other cell types, leading to the change and stabilization of the bud aspect ratio.

Deep learning methods, trained on the increasing set of available protein 3D structures and sequences, have substantially impacted the protein modeling and design field. These advancements have facilitated the creation of novel proteins, or the optimization of existing ones designed for specific functions, such as binding a target protein. Despite the demonstrated potential of such approaches in designing general protein binders, their application in designing immunotherapeutics remains relatively underexplored. A relevant application is the design of T cell receptors (TCRs). Given the crucial role of T cells in mediating immune responses, redirecting these cells to tumor or infected target cells through the engineering of TCRs has shown promising results in treating diseases, especially cancer. However, the computational design of TCR interactions presents challenges for current physics-based methods, particularly due to the unique natural characteristics of these interfaces, such as low affinity and cross-reactivity. For this reason, in this study, we explored the potential of two structure-based deep learning protein design methods, ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF1, in designing fixed-backbone TCRs for binding target antigenic peptides presented by the MHC through different design scenarios. To evaluate TCR designs, we employed a comprehensive set of sequence- and structure-based metrics, highlighting the benefits of these methods in comparison to classical physics-based design methods and identifying deficiencies for improvement.

                <p>by Yutaro Kumagai</p>

Recent advances in measurement technologies, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have revolutionized our ability to acquire large amounts of omics-level data on cellular states. As measurement techniques evolve, there has been an increasing need for data analysis methodologies, especially those focused on cell-type identification and inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We have developed a new method named BootCellNet, which employs smoothing and resampling to infer GRNs. Using the inferred GRNs, BootCellNet further infers the minimum dominating set (MDS), a set of genes that determines the dynamics of the entire network. We have demonstrated that BootCellNet robustly infers GRNs and their MDSs from scRNA-seq data and facilitates unsupervised identification of cell clusters using scRNA-seq datasets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and hematopoiesis. It has also identified COVID-19 patient-specific cells and their potential regulatory transcription factors. BootCellNet not only identifies cell types in an unsupervised and explainable way but also provides insights into the characteristics of identified cell types through the inference of GRNs and MDS.

An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity. Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of “health benefits packages” (HBPs), which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision. Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations. In this work, we propose the individual-based <i>Thanzi La Onse</i> (TLO) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modelling—and calibrating to extensive, country-specific data—the incidence of disease, health-seeking behaviour, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available, we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country. We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis (LCOA) achieved the largest health gain—∼8% reduction in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario—by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments. This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation. Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed, including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics, rather than service type. Unlike the LCOA-based HBP, this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis, and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period, which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future.

<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) releases the unusual terpene nucleoside 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd) to block lysosomal function and promote survival in human macrophages. Using conventional approaches, we found that genes <i>Rv3377c</i> and <i>Rv3378c</i>, but not <i>Rv3376</i>, were necessary for 1-TbAd biosynthesis. Here, we introduce linear models for mass spectrometry <i>(limms)</i> software as a next-generation lipidomics tool to study the essential functions of lipid biosynthetic enzymes on a whole-cell basis. Using <i>limms</i>, whole-cell lipid profiles deepened the phenotypic landscape of comparative mass spectrometry experiments and identified a large family of approximately 100 terpene nucleoside metabolites downstream of <i>Rv3378c</i>. We validated the identity of previously unknown adenine-, adenosine-, and lipid-modified tuberculosinol-containing molecules using synthetic chemistry and collisional mass spectrometry, including comprehensive profiling of bacterial lipids that fragment to adenine. We tracked terpene nucleoside genotypes and lipid phenotypes among <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTC) species that did or did not evolve to productively infect either human or nonhuman mammals. Although 1-TbAd biosynthesis genes were thought to be restricted to the MTC, we identified the locus in unexpected species outside the MTC. Sequence analysis of the locus showed nucleotide usage characteristic of plasmids from plant-associated bacteria, clarifying the origin and timing of horizontal gene transfer to a pre-MTC progenitor. The data demonstrated correlation between high level terpene nucleoside biosynthesis and mycobacterial competence for human infection, and 2 mechanisms of 1-TbAd biosynthesis loss. Overall, the selective gain and evolutionary retention of tuberculosinyl metabolites in modern species that cause human TB suggest a role in human TB disease, and the newly discovered molecules represent candidate disease-specific biomarkers.

                Research data management (RDM) is central to the implementation of the FAIR (Findable Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and Open Science principles. Recognising the importance of RDM, ELIXIR Platforms and Nodes have invested in RDM and launched various projects and initiatives to ensure good data management practices for scientific excellence. These projects have resulted in a rich set of tools and resources highly valuable for FAIR data management. However, these resources remain scattered across projects and ELIXIR structures, making their dissemination and application challenging. Therefore, it becomes imminent to coordinate these efforts for sustainable and harmonised RDM practices with dedicated forums for RDM professionals to exchange knowledge and share resources. The proposed ELIXIR RDM Community will bring together RDM experts to develop ELIXIR’s vision and coordinate its activities, taking advantage of the available assets. It aims to coordinate RDM best practices and illustrate how to use the existing ELIXIR RDM services. The Community will be built around three integral pillars, namely, a network of RDM professionals, RDM knowledge management and RDM training expertise and resources. It will also engage with external stakeholders to leverage benefits and provide a forum to RDM professionals for regular knowledge exchange, capacity building and development of harmonised RDM practices, keeping in line with the overall scope of the RDM Community. In the short term, the Community aims to build upon the existing resources and ensure that the content of these remain up to date and fit for purpose. In the long run, the Community will aim to strengthen the skills and knowledge of its RDM professionals to support the emerging needs of the scientific community. The Community will also devise an effective strategy to engage with other ELIXIR structures and international stakeholders to influence and align with developments and solutions in the RDM field.

                We describe the case report of an Osteosarcoma patient, with a Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, presenting with a pathological femoral fracture. The patient was treated with a multidisciplinary approach associating neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy with excisional surgery. The femoral reconstruction consisted of a ``Capasquelet'' reconstruction combining an induced membrane and a vascularized fibula allograft allowing a good functional result with an early weight-bearing. We managed to complete our histological analysis in this patient, in order to evaluate the tumor vascularization. Indeed, using the syngeneic osteosarcoma MOS-J mouse model, we highlighted previously that CD31+/\ensuremath{\alpha}-SMA+ vessels may be indicators of vasculature normalization and therefore may be used as specific markers of a good therapeutic response. Thus, we search for its interest in this specific case as preliminary work. The aim was to assess the feasibility and technical validity of the vascularization analysis of a human osteosarcoma tumor specimen. Therefore, we propose an immunohistochemistry methodology  with multiplexed immunofluorescence to assess the vascularization as a promising marker in human osteosarcoma tissue.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To determine the prevalence and distribution of intracranial vessel occlusion identified on computed tomography (CT) or magnet resonance (MR) angiography and to explore its association with functional outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicenter cohort study enrolling consecutive patients with AF with imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke who underwent CT- or MR-angiography on admission (2014–2022). Multivariable regression was used to explore the association between intracranial vessel occlusion and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 3–6) at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis included 10,164 patients (median age 81.5 years, 47.8% female, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission 6; 14.7% on a vitamin K antagonist [VKA], 27.5% on a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC], 57.8% not receiving oral anticoagulation). Angiography showed intracranial vessel occlusion in 5,190 patients (51.1%), affecting the anterior cerebral circulation in 87.4%. Overall, 29.2% and 29.4% of patients received thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, respectively. The proportion of patients with poor functional outcome at 90 days was 60.6% and 42.7% in those with and without vessel occlusion, respectively. In multivariable analyses, vessel occlusion was associated with poor functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.71–2.22) with consistent results in subgroups according to oral anticoagulation use (VKA, aOR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.40–2.80; DOAC, aOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.83–3.03; none, aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.49–2.09).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Intracranial vessel occlusion is common in patients with AF with ischemic stroke, mainly affects the anterior circulation and is associated with poor functional outcome. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The gross domestic product (GDP) of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states can be used to determine their overall economic growth. In order to increase GDP, all emerging nations in Southeast Asia are stating to depend on foreign direct investment (FDI), the tourism industry, international visitors visiting ASEAN member nations banking credit, and low inflation rates. High inflation is a problem that developed and developing countries will definitely face. One of the problems faced by ASEAN member countries is that most of the member countries are in the developing country category. For ASEAN member countries, high inflation levels will encourage economic instability. GDP is less than optimal because of these classic problems in developing countries so that economic growth is not as planned. The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which ASEAN established, is seen as a way to reduce unemployment, alleviate poverty by boosting the travel and tourism industry and increasing investment, as well as to offer or distribute credit to businesses at low interest rates in order to boost GDP. The purpose of this study is to investigate and analyze how the GDP of ASEAN member nations is affected by FDI, foreign visitors, bank credit, and inflation. s: We analyzed panel data for seven ASEAN members from 2002 to 2020. FDI, foreign tourists, banking credit, and inflation are the research factors examined as independent variables that have an impact on GDP, the dependent variable. Results The study’s findings indicate that while inflation has a large negative impact on GDP, FDI, foreign tourism, and bank credit have a considerable positive impact on GDP. Conclusions FDI, foreign tourists, bank credit, and inflation have a significant influence on GDP in ASEAN member countries.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94898">An arms race between 5’ppp-RNA virus and its alternative recognition receptor MDA5 in RIG-I-lost teleost fish</a></h4>

              
                The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life’s evolution. During this process, the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, <i>Miichthys miiuy</i>. Firstly, the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of <i>M. miiuy and Gallus gallus</i>, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92080">Neuro-evolutionary evidence for a universal fractal primate brain shape</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex displays a bewildering diversity of shapes and sizes across and within species. Despite this diversity, we present a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices. We show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. As neighbouring folds are gradually merged, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory, that also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species. Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the <i>same</i> archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of <i>d</i><sub><i>f</i></sub> = 2.5. Importantly, this new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding, we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology. We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size (from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses. Our new understanding may, therefore, generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96028">Transcription factor condensates, 3D clustering, and gene expression enhancement of the MET regulon</a></h4>

              
                Some transcription factors (TFs) can form liquid–liquid phase separated (LLPS) condensates. However, the functions of these TF condensates in 3-Dimentional (3D) genome organization and gene regulation remain elusive. In response to methionine (met) starvation, budding yeast TF Met4 and a few co-activators, including Met32, induce a set of genes involved in met biosynthesis. Here, we show that the endogenous Met4 and Met32 form co-localized puncta-like structures in yeast nuclei upon met depletion. Recombinant Met4 and Met32 form mixed droplets with LLPS properties in vitro. In relation to chromatin, Met4 puncta co-localize with target genes, and at least a subset of these target genes is clustered in 3D in a Met4-dependent manner. A <i>MET3pr</i>-GFP reporter inserted near several native Met4-binding sites becomes co-localized with Met4 puncta and displays enhanced transcriptional activity. A Met4 variant with a partial truncation of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) shows less puncta formation, and this mutant selectively reduces the reporter activity near Met4-binding sites to the basal level. Overall, these results support a model where Met4 and co-activators form condensates to bring multiple target genes into a vicinity with higher local TF concentrations, which facilitates a strong response to methionine depletion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84662">Variation in thermal physiology can drive the temperature-dependence of microbial community richness</a></h4>

              
                Predicting how species diversity changes along environmental gradients is an enduring problem in ecology. In microbes current theories tend to invoke energy availability and enzyme kinetics as the main drivers of temperature-richness relationships. Here we derive a general empirically-grounded theory that can explain this phenomenon by linking microbial species richness in competitive communities to variation in the temperature-dependence of their interaction and growth rates. Specifically, the shape of the microbial community temperature-richness relationship depends on how rapidly the strength of effective competition between species pairs changes with temperature relative to the variance of their growth rates. Furthermore, it predicts that a thermal specialist-generalist tradeoff in growth rates alters coexistence by shifting this balance, causing richness to peak at relatively higher temperatures. Finally, we show that the observed patterns of variation in thermal performance curves of metabolic traits across extant bacterial taxa is indeed sufficient to generate the variety of community-level temperature-richness responses observed in the real world. Our results provide a new and general mechanism that can help explain temperature-diversity gradients in microbial communities, and provide a quantitative framework for interlinking variation in the thermal physiology of microbial species to their community-level diversity.

">Spontaneous emergence and drifting of sequential neural activity in recurrent networks</a></h4>

              
                Repeating sequences of neural activity exist across diverse brain regions of different animals and are thought to underlie diverse computations. However, their emergence and evolution in the presence of ongoing synaptic plasticity remain poorly understood. To gain mechanistic insights into this process, we modeled how biologically-inspired rules of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in recurrent circuits interact to produce connectivity structures that support sequential neuronal activity. Even under unstructured inputs, our recurrent networks developed strong unidirectional connections, resulting in spontaneous repeating spiking sequences. During ongoing plasticity these sequences repeated despite turnover of individual synaptic connections, a process reminiscent of synaptic drift. The turnover process occurred over different timescales, with certain connectivity types and motif structures leading to sequences with different volatility. Structured inputs could reinforce or retrain the resulting connectivity structures underlying sequences, enabling stable but still flexible encoding of inputs. Our model unveils the interplay between synaptic plasticity and sequential activity in recurrent networks, providing insights into how brains implement reliable but flexible computations.

">A depth map of visual space in the primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Depth perception is essential for visually-guided behavior. Computer vision algorithms use depth maps to encode distances in three-dimensional scenes but it is unknown whether such depth maps are generated by animal visual systems. To answer this question, we focused on motion parallax, a depth cue relying on visual motion resulting from movement of the observer. As neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are broadly modulated by locomotion, we hypothesized that they may integrate vision- and locomotion-related signals to estimate depth from motion parallax. Using recordings in a three-dimensional virtual reality environment, we found that conjunctive coding of visual and self-motion speeds gave rise to depth-selective neuronal responses. Depth-selective neurons could be characterized by three-dimensional receptive fields, responding to specific virtual depths and retinotopic locations. Neurons tuned to a broad range of virtual depths were found across all sampled retinotopic locations, showing that motion parallax generates a depth map of visual space in V1.

">A post-injury immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide following adult traumatic brain injury alters neuroinflammation and the gut microbiome acutely, but has little effect on chronic outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Patients with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) are susceptible to hospital-acquired infections, presenting a significant challenge to an already-compromised immune system. The consequences and mechanisms by which this dual insult worsens outcomes are poorly understood. This study aimed to explore how a systemic immune stimulus (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) influences outcomes following experimental TBI in young adult mice. Male and female C57Bl/6J mice underwent controlled cortical impact or sham surgery, followed by 1 mg/kg i.p. LPS or saline-vehicle at 4 days post-TBI, before behavioral assessment and tissue collection at 6 h, 24 h, 7 days or 6 months. LPS induced acute sickness behaviors including weight loss, transient hypoactivity, and increased anxiety-like behavior. Early systemic immune activation by LPS was confirmed by increased spleen weight and serum cytokines. In brain tissue, gene expression analysis revealed a time course of inflammatory immune activation in TBI or LPS-treated mice (e.g., IL-1{beta}, IL-6, CCL2, TNF), which was exacerbated in TBI+LPS mice. This group also presented with fecal microbiome dysbiosis at 24 h post-LPS, with reduced bacterial diversity and changes in the relative abundance of key bacterial genera associated with sub-acute neurobehavioral and immune changes. Chronically, TBI induced hyperactivity and cognitive deficits, brain atrophy, and increased seizure susceptibility, similarly in vehicle and LPS-treated groups. Together, findings suggest that an immune challenge with LPS early after TBI, akin to a hospital-acquired infection, alters the acute neuroinflammatory response to injury, but has no lasting effects. Future studies could consider more clinically-relevant models of infection to build upon these findings.

">A rich conformational palette underlies human CaV2.1-channel availability</a></h4>

              
                Depolarization-evoked opening of CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca2+-channels triggers neurotransmitter release, while voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) limits channel availability to open, contributing to synaptic plasticity. The mechanism of CaV2.1 response to voltage is unclear. Using voltage-clamp fluorometry and kinetic modeling, we optically tracked and physically characterized the structural dynamics of the four CaV2.1 voltage-sensor domains (VSDs). VSD-I seems to directly drive opening and convert between two modes of function, associated with VDI. VSD-II is apparently voltage-insensitive. VSD-III and VSD-IV sense more negative voltages and undergo voltage-dependent conversion uncorrelated with VDI. Auxiliary {beta}-subunits regulate VSD-I-to-pore coupling and VSD conversion kinetics. CaV2.1 VSDs are differentially sensitive to voltage changes brief and long-lived. Specifically the voltage-dependent conformational changes of VSD-I are linked to synaptic release and plasticity.

">Levodopa impairs lysosomal function in sensory neurons in vitro</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Patients are diagnosed based upon movement disorders, including bradykinesia, tremor and stiffness of movement. However, non-motor signs, including constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, smell deficits and pain are well recognized. Peripheral neuropathy is also increasingly recognized, as the vast majority of patients show reduced intraepidermal nerve fibers, and sensory nerve conduction and sensory function is also impaired. Many case studies in the literature show that high-dose levodopa, the primary drug used in the treatment of PD, may exacerbate neuropathy, thought to involve levodopa's metabolism to homocysteine. Here, we treated primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia and a sensory neuronal cell line with levodopa to examine effects on cell morphology, mitochondrial content and physiology, and lysosomal function. High-dose levodopa reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. At concentrations observed in the patient, levodopa enhanced immunoreactivity to beta III tubulin. Critically, levodopa reduced lysosomal content and also reduced the proportion of lysosomes that were acidic while homocysteine tended to have the opposite effect. Levodopa is a critically important drug for the treatment of PD. However, our data suggests that at concentrations observed in the patient, it has deleterious effects on sensory neurons that are not related to homocysteine.

">Temporal Dynamics of Nucleus Accumbens Neurons in Male Mice During Reward Seeking</a></h4>

              
                The nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulates reward-motivated behavior, but the temporal dynamics of NAc neurons that enable free-willed animals to obtain rewards remain elusive. Here, we recorded Ca2+ activity from individual NAc neurons when mice performed self-paced lever-presses for sucrose. NAc neurons exhibited three temporally-sequenced clusters, defined by times at which they exhibited increased Ca2+ activity: approximately 0, -2.5 or -5 sec relative to the lever-pressing. Dopamine D1 receptor (D1)-expressing neurons and D2-neurons formed the majority of the -5-sec versus -2.5-sec clusters, respectively, while both neuronal subtypes were represented in the 0-sec cluster. We found that pre-press activity patterns of D1- or D2-neurons could predict subsequent lever-presses. Inhibiting D1-neurons at -5 sec or D2-neurons at -2.5 sec, but not at other timepoints, reduced sucrose-motivated lever-pressing. We propose that the time-specific activity of D1- and D2-neurons mediate key temporal features of the NAc through which reward motivation initiates reward-seeking behavior.

">Neurophysiological Dynamics of Metacontrol States: EEG Insights into Conflict Regulation</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol and conflict regulation is crucial for insights into cognitive flexibility and persistence. This study employed electroencephalography (EEG), EEG-beamforming and directed connectivity analyses to explore how varying metacontrol states influence conflict regulation at a neurophysiological level. Metacontrol states were manipulated by altering the frequency of congruent and incongruent trials across experimental blocks in a modified flanker task, and both behavioral and electrophysiological measures were analyzed. Behavioral data confirmed the experimental manipulation's efficacy, showing an increase in persistence bias and a reduction in flexibility bias during increased conflict regulation. Electrophysiologically, theta band activity paralleled the behavioral data, suggesting that theta oscillations reflect the mismatch between expected metacontrol bias and actual task demands. Alpha and beta band dynamics differed across experimental blocks, though these changes did not directly mirror behavioral effects. Post-response alpha and beta activity were more pronounced in persistence-biased states, indicating a neural reset mechanism preparing for future cognitive demands. By using a novel artificial neural networks method, directed connectivity analyses revealed enhanced inter-regional communication during persistence states, suggesting stronger top-down control and sensorimotor integration. Overall, theta band activity was closely tied to metacontrol processes, while alpha and beta bands played a role in resetting the neural system for upcoming tasks. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the neural substrates involved in metacontrol and conflict monitoring, emphasizing the distinct roles of different frequency bands in these cognitive processes.

">State and trait serotonin variations interact to shape the intrinsic connectivity and gradient architecture of the brain: a combined TPH2 genetics and tryptophan depletion study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Serotonin (5-HT) critically regulates cognitive and emotional functions, and both stable and transient variations in 5-HT signaling have been associated with emotional dysregulations. However, findings regarding the neurofunctional effects of transient 5-HT variations have been highly inconsistent. Therefore, we examined whether individual variations in a central 5-HT-regulating genetic polymorphism (tryptophan hydroxylase 2, TPH2) represent a vulnerability or resilience factor for the effects of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) on functional brain architecture. Method: The current study utilized a pharmacogenetic within-subject randomized placebo-controlled resting-state fMRI design with n=53 healthy male participants in combination with spontaneous intrinsic neural activity, functional connectivity, and connectome gradient analyses to compare the neurofunctional effects of ATD-induced transient reduction in central 5-HT signaling between TPH2 genotypes (a priori genotyping for rs4570625, GG n = 25 vs. TT n = 23). Results: ATD induced significant increases in spontaneous neural activity in hippocampal CA1 irrespective of genotype and enhanced communication of this region with the bilateral amygdala and the vmPFC specifically in GG carriers. ATD sharpened the intrinsic connectome gradient architecture in several large-scale networks, including the salience, frontoparietal, and default mode network. Conclusions: Our results identify a potential genetic marker for an increased vulnerability to the neural effects of transient variations in 5-HT signaling on the functional architecture of an anxiety- and stress-related brain circuit. Connectome gradient results underscore the regulatory role of 5-HT on the intricate organization of large-scale networks involved in emotional reactivity and regulation.

                Despite advances in diffusion MRI, which have led to remarkable progress in mapping white matter of the living human brain, the understanding of cerebral cortical microstructure in vivo and its relationship to macrostructure, myeloarchitecture, cytoarchitecture, chemoarchitecture, metabolism, and function lag far behind. We present neuromaps of 21 microstructural metrics derived from diffusion tensor, diffusion kurtosis, mean apparent propagator, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging of the young adult cerebral cortex. We demonstrate how cortical microstructure follows cytoarchitectural and laminar differentiation, aligns with the macroscale sensory-fugal and sensorimotor-association axes, and contributes to functional brain networks, neural oscillatory dynamics, neurotransmitter receptor/transporter distributions, and cognition and behavior. We find cortical microstructural covariation across individuals to encode functional and structural connectivity as well as gene expression and neurotransmitter similarity. Finally, our exploratory analysis suggests cortical microstructure from diffusion MRI could prove useful in investigating a broad array of neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Effects of systemic oxytocin and beta-3 receptor agonist (CL 316243) treatment on body weight and adiposity in male diet-induced obese rats</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have implicated hindbrain oxytocin (OT) receptors in the control of food intake and brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. We recently demonstrated that hindbrain [fourth ventricle (4V)] administration of oxytocin (OT) could be used as an adjunct to drugs that directly target beta-3 adrenergic receptors ({beta}3-AR) to elicit weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents. What remains unclear is whether systemic OT can be used as an adjunct with the {beta}3-AR agonist, CL 316243, to increase BAT thermogenesis and elicit weight loss in DIO rats. We hypothesized that systemic OT and {beta}3-AR agonist (CL 316243) treatment would produce an additive effect to reduce body weight and adiposity in DIO rats by decreasing food intake and stimulating BAT thermogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of systemic (subcutaneous) infusions of OT (50 nmol/day) or vehicle (VEH) when combined with daily systemic (intraperitoneal) injections of CL 316243 (0.5 mg/kg) or VEH on body weight, adiposity, food intake and brown adipose tissue temperature (TIBAT). OT and CL 316243 monotherapy decreased body weight by 8.0 {+/-} 0.9% (P<0.05) and 8.6{+/-}0.6% (P<0.05), respectively, but OT in combination with CL 316243 produced more substantial weight loss (14.9& [plusmn] 1.0%; P<0.05) compared to either treatment alone. These effects were associated with decreased adiposity, energy intake and elevated TIBAT during the treatment period. The findings from the current study suggest that the effects of systemic OT and CL 316243 to elicit weight loss are additive and appear to be driven primarily by OT-elicited changes in food intake and CL 316243-elicited increases in BAT thermogenesis.

">Evaluation of scalp-based targeting methods of DLPFC for TMS therapy: EEG cap F3, Beam F3, CPC F3, and adjusted Beam F3</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) offers a promising approach for treating depression. Scalp-based targeting methods, including EEG Cap, Beam F3, CPC F3, and adjusted Beam F3, have evolved to enhance clinical application. Our study aims to evaluate and compare the accuracy, reliability, speed, and training efficacy of these four methods. Three trained technicians conducted repeated DLPFC targeting measurements on 10 3D-printed head models. Accuracy was assessed by calculating targeting error and electric field strength at the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex anti-correlated peak. Reliability was evaluated through inter- and intra-rater variability, and training efficacy was examined by comparing targeting errors between trained technicians and novices. CPC F3, Beam F3, and adjusted Beam F3 demonstrated comparable accuracy in terms of electric field strength, but CPC F3 had the lowest targeting error (4.2 mm). CPC F3 also exhibited the highest reliability (inter-rater variability at 3.3 mm, intra-rater variability at 2.3 mm). The EEG cap was the fastest method (80 seconds), while CPC F3 was faster than Beam F3 but slower than the EEG Cap. No significant differences in targeting error between trained technicians and novices were noted with CPC F3 and adjusted Beam F3. The comparative analysis of these four scalp-based targeting methods provides insights that can enhance clinical decision-making and practical application. While accuracy among CPC F3, Beam F3, and adjusted Beam F3 was comparable, CPC F3 emerges as highly practical due to its significantly better reliability, training efficacy, moderate speed, and straightforward implementation.

">Test-Retest Reliability and repeatability of Behavioral and Electrophysiological Markers in an Eriksen Flanker Task</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control processes, specifically interference control and error monitoring, are often impaired across neuropsychiatric disorders and have been proposed as transdiagnostic markers of psychopathology and important treatment targets. Accurately probing them, however, requires understanding the psychometric properties of the measures used to assess cognitive control, including their intra- and interindividual stability over time. Using an Eriksen Flanker Task, we tested behavioral and electrophysiological readouts of cognitive control in 36 healthy individuals (26 female, 10 male, M age+/-SD=33.18+/-14.49, range=19-68) and evaluated their test-retest reliability across 48 hours by calculating Pearson correlations and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) to assess group-level stability. Moreover, we assessed repeatability through Coefficients of Variation (CVs) and Bland-Altman statistics, to investigate the degree of change in participants' absolute scores. We found satisfactory-to-excellent test-retest reliability for most cognitive control measures, with condition-specific metrics generally being more reliable than difference scores. Regarding repeatability, we observed considerable intraindividual variability in absolute scores over time, which differed widely between participants. These results demonstrate that measurements of cognitive control may display substantial intraindividual variability across sessions despite demonstrating high test-retest reliability and vice versa. Our findings expand the current literature by providing novel information about the stability of behavioral and physiological markers of cognitive control over time. Moreover, they may have important implications for the application and evaluation of clinical interventions by highlighting the usefulness of considering repeatability measures in addition to the more commonly reported test-retest reliability metrics, when tracking changes over time in clinically relevant processes within single individuals.

">Active reconfiguration of neural task states</a></h4>

              
                The ability to switch between different tasks is a critical component of adaptive cognitive functioning, but a mechanistic understanding of this capacity has remained elusive. Longstanding debates over whether task switching requires active preparation remain hotly contested, in large part due to the difficulty of inferring task preparation from behavior alone. We make progress on this debate by quantifying neural task representations through high-dimensional linear dynamical systems fit to human electroencephalographic recordings. We find that these dynamical systems are highly predictive of macroscopic neural activity, and reveal neural signatures of active preparation that are shared with task-optimized neural networks. These findings help inform a classic debate about how we control our cognition, and offer a promising new paradigm for neuroimaging analysis.

">ACE1 Does Not Influence Cerebral Aβ Degradation or Amyloid Plaque Accumulation in 5XFAD Mice</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and multiple lines of evidence support the relevance of amyloid beta deposition and amyloid plaque accumulation in the neurotoxicity and cognitive decline in AD. Rare mutations in angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) have been highly associated with late onset AD patients; however, the mechanism for ACE1 mutation in AD pathogenesis is unknown. Given the relevance of ACE1 with AD and the strong association of abeta to AD pathogenesis, we investigated whether ACE1 degrades abeta; and affects amyloid burden in 5XFAD mice in vivo. To investigate this, we analyzed 6-month-old 5XFAD mice with ACE1 loss of function. ACE1 loss of function was mediated either by crossing 5XFAD mice to ACE1 conditional knockout mice or administering 5XFAD mice with the ACE1 inhibitor enalapril. Our analyses revealed that ACE1 loss of function through both genetic and pharmacological methods does not affect amyloid plaque load and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and cortex of 5XFAD mice.

">The oneirogen hypothesis: modeling the hallucinatory effects of classical psychedelics in terms of replay-dependent plasticity mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Classical psychedelics induce complex visual hallucinations in humans, generating percepts that are coherent at a low level, but which have surreal, dream-like qualities at a high level. While there are many hypotheses as to how classical psychedelics could induce these effects, there are no concrete mechanistic models that capture the variety of observed effects in humans, while remaining consistent with the known pharmacological effects of classical psychedelics on neural circuits. In this work, we propose the "oneirogen hypothesis," which posits that the perceptual effects of classical psychedelics are a result of their pharmacological actions inducing neural activity states that truly are more similar to dream-like states. We simulate classical psychedelics' effects via manipulating neural network models trained on perceptual tasks with the Wake-Sleep algorithm. This established machine learning algorithm leverages two activity phases, a perceptual phase (wake) where sensory inputs are encoded, and a generative phase (dream) where the network internally generates activity consistent with stimulus-evoked responses. We simulate the action of psychedelics by partially shifting the model to the 'Sleep' state, which entails a greater influence of top-down connections, in-line with the impact of psychedelics on apical dendrites. The effects resulting from this manipulation capture a number of experimentally observed phenomena including the emergence of hallucinations, increases in stimulus-conditioned variability, and large increases in synaptic plasticity. We further provide a number of testable predictions which could be used to validate or invalidate our oneirogen hypothesis.

">Endosomal hyper-acidification via proton-activated chloride channel deletion in neurons impairs AMPA receptor endocytosis and LTD</a></h4>

              
                Endosomal homeostasis is critical for neuronal function, including the post-synaptic trafficking of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Dynamic AMPAR trafficking is a major component of synaptic plasticity, such as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) and is thought to be required for learning and memory. Dramatic alteration of endosomal pH has been reported to negatively affect synaptic transmission and neural development, but the underlying mechanisms by which pH is involved in AMPAR trafficking are unclear. Here, we show that the proton-activated chloride (PAC) channel localizes to early and recycling endosomes along neuronal dendrites and prevents hyper-acidification of endosomes. To directly measure AMPAR endocytosis, we used a new method to assess LTD using HaloTag-GluA2 and found that the loss of PAC reduces AMPAR internalization during chemical LTD in primary neurons, while AMPAR trafficking in unstimulated cells or during chemical LTP is unaffected. Consistently, pyramidal neuron-specific PAC knockout mice had impaired hippocampal LTD, but not LTP, and performed poorly in the Morris water maze reversal test, exhibiting an inability to adapt to changing environments (also referred to as behavioral flexibility). We conclude that proper maintenance of pH by PAC is important during LTD to regulate AMPAR trafficking in a manner critical for animal physiology and behavior.

">A Water Relaxation Atlas for Age and Region specific Metabolite Concentration Correction</a></h4>

              
                Metabolite concentration estimates from Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) are typically quantified using water referencing, correcting for relaxation time differences between metabolites and water. One common approach is to correct the water reference signal for differential relaxation within three tissue compartments (gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) using fixed literature values. However, water relaxation times (T1 and T2) vary between brain locations, in pathology, and with age. MRS studies, even those measuring metabolite levels across the lifespan, often ignore these effects, because of a lack of reference data. The purpose of this study is to develop a water relaxometry atlas and to integrate location and age appropriate relaxation values into the MRS analysis workflow. 101 volunteers (51 men, 50 women; ~10 male and 10 female participants per decade (from the 20s to 60s), were recruited. T1 weighted MPRAGE images ((1 mm)3 isotropic resolution) were acquired. Whole brain water T1 and T2 measurements were made with DESPOT ((1.4 mm)3 isotropic resolution). T1 and T2 maps were registered to the JHU MNI-SS/EVE atlas using affine and LDDMM transformation. The atlas's 268 parcels were reduced to 130 by combining homologous parcels. Mean T1 and T2 values were calculated for each parcel in each subject. Linear models of T1 and T2 as functions of age were computed, using age minus 30 as the predictor. Reference atlases of age 30 intercept and age-slope for T1 and T2 were generated. The atlas-based workflow was integrated into Osprey, which coregisters MRS voxels to the atlas and calculates location and age appropriate water relaxation parameters for quantification. The water relaxation aging atlas revealed significant regional and tissue differences in water relaxation behavior across adulthood. Using location and subject appropriate reference values in the MRS analysis workflow removes a current methodological limitation and is expected to reduce quantification biases associated with water referenced tissue correction, especially for studies of aging.

">Cortex-wide spatiotemporal motifs of theta oscillations are coupled to freely moving behavior</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory information is combined across the cortex and assimilated into the continuous production of ongoing behavior. In the hippocampus, theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) radiate as large-scale traveling waves, and serve as a scaffold for neuronal ensembles of multisensory information involved in memory and movement-related processing. An extension of such an encoding framework across the neocortex could similarly serve to bind disparate multisensory signals into ongoing, coherent, phase-coded processes. Whether the neocortex exhibits unique large-scale traveling waves distinct from that of the hippocampus however, remains unknown. Here, using cortex-wide electrocorticography in freely moving mice, we find that theta oscillations are organized into bilaterally-symmetric spatiotemporal "modes" that span virtually the entire neocortex. The dominant mode (Mode 1) is a divergent traveling wave that originates from retrosplenial cortex and whose amplitude correlates with mouse speed. Secondary modes are asynchronous spiral waves centered over primary somatosensory cortex (Modes 2 & 3), which become prominent during rapid drops in amplitude and synchrony (null spikes) and which underlie a phase reset of Mode 1. These structured cortex-wide traveling waves may provide a scaffold for large-scale phase-coding that allows the binding of multisensory information across all the regions of the cortex.

">Non-invasive brain stimulation over the Frontopolar Cortex promotes willingness to exert cognitive effort in a foraging-like sequential choice task</a></h4>

              
                Individuals avoid spending cognitive effort unless expected rewards offset the perceived costs. Recent work employing tasks that provide explicit information about demands and incentives, suggests causal involvement of the Frontopolar Cortex (FPC) in effort-based decision-making. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we examined whether the FPC's role in motivating effort generalizes to sequential choice problems in which task demand and reward rates vary indirectly and as a function of experience. In a double-blind, within-subject design, 46 participants received anodal (i.e., excitatory) or sham stimulation over the right FPC during an Effort Foraging Task, which required choosing between harvesting patches for successively decreasing resources or traveling to replenished patches by performing a cognitive task with environment-specific difficulty. As expected, participants exited patches later (i.e., displayed lower exit thresholds) when travelling required greater (versus less) effort, indicating increased travel costs in high-effort environments. Under anodal tDCS, the difference in exit thresholds between environments was significantly smaller relative to sham. Finally, individual differences analyses hint that participants with lower self-reported motivation to exert effort exhibited greater travel cost reductions following tDCS. Together, these findings support the theorized causal role of the FPC in motivating cognitively effortful behavior, expand its role to more ecologically valid serial decisions and highlight the potential for tDCS as a tool to increase motivation with potential clinical applications.

">Context-Dependent Interaction Between Goal-Directed and Habitual Control Under Time Pressure</a></h4>

              
                Habits are an important aspect of human behaviour. Habits are reflexive, inflexible, and fast, in contrast to goal-directed behaviour which is reflective, flexible, and slow. Current theories assume that habits and goal-directed actions are controlled by two separate but interacting systems. However, it is not clear how these two systems interact when actions must be made under time pressure. Here we use a task which induces habitual behaviour in the form of action sequences, while concurrently requiring participants to perform goal-directed actions that are either congruent or incongruent with the habit. This task thus allows for concurrent measurement of both goal-directed and habitual behaviour, thereby permitting a nuanced analysis of the interaction between these two control modes. Using computational modelling, we find that models where the influence of the habit depends on the number of repetitions, explain participant behaviour better than models that assume the habit to be constant. We further show that roughly half of the participants modulate their use of the habit depending on the context, i.e. they selectively inhibit the habit's influence when it is incongruent to their explicit goals, but not when both are congruent and the influence of the habit is adaptive. Additional drift-diffusion modelling of choice and reaction time data shows that proactive control is mobilized in the congruent task context whereas reactive control is mobilized in the incongruent task context. The present study thus indicates that habitual control is context-dependent and can be adaptively deployed via proactive and reactive control, rather than being a fixed or isolated mechanism.

">Inversed association of locus coeruleus MRI integrity with structural volume and its impact on individual's inattentiveness</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus (LC) is a nucleus within the brainstem associated with physiological arousal and altered structure and function in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. Pathologies related to difficulties with attention have previously been associated with abnormalities in neurotransmitter production and sensitivity, suggesting the possibility of abnormality in neurotransmitter producing neural regions. One such region is the LC, associated with norepinephrine production. To examine the possibility that LC alteration is associated with inattentive symptom reporting, a set of analyses have been performed with 141 individuals age-ranged from 8 to 54. We found that the structural integrity value of the LC, especially on the right hemisphere, showed a significant negative association with the level of individual's inattentiveness score. Furthermore, LC volume size was significantly positively associated with inattention, and this finding was also lateralized to the right LC. Interestingly, an inverse association was found between structural integrity and volume size. These findings support the relationship between LC and attention-related behavior through both neuromelanin-sensitive and structural imaging, with important implications for the association between regional structure and function.

">When Attention Hurts: The Effect Of rTMS On Neural Correlates Of Time Perception</a></h4>

              
                The parietal lobe plays a crucial role in the attentional networks that help shape our perception, including our perception of time. Based on neuropsychological and neurophysiological evidence, a "when" pathway including the right parietal lobe has been proposed as the critical cortical site for the discrimination of objects across time. When an oddball stimulus is presented in a stream of identical standard stimuli, it is perceived as lasting longer, even when its actual duration is shorter. While attentional capture seems to play a major role in this subjective expansion of time the cortical mechanisms responsible for this effect remain unclear. We therefore set to investigate the direct role of parietal brain areas in time perception using combined repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and electroencephalogram (EEG). We measured the perceived duration of an oddball stimulus in each participant before and after inhibitory 1-Hz rTMS stimulation at one of three scalp locations: the right intraparietal sulcus (rIPS), the right inferior parietal lobe (rIPL), or the occipital cortex as a control. EEG was recorded throughout. Stimulation over the rIPL caused a more veridical experience of times subjective expansion towards the oddball, while rTMS over the rIPS and the occipital cortex had no effect. These data provide theoretically challenging notions to the concept of the cortexes role within time perception and the mechanisms involved.

">LPS-induced delirium-like behavior and microglial activation in mice correlate with bispectral electroencephalography (BSEEG)</a></h4>

              
                Delirium is a multifactorial medical condition characterized by impairment across various mental functions and is one of the greatest risk factors for prolonged hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Research focused on delirium has proven to be challenging due to a lack of objective measures for diagnosing patients, and few laboratory models have been validated. Our recent studies report the efficacy of bispectral electroencephalography (BSEEG) in diagnosing delirium in patients and predicting patient outcomes. We applied BSEEG to validate a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model of delirium. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between BSEEG score, delirium-like behaviors, and microglia activation in hippocampal dentate gyrus and cortex regions in young and aged mice. There was a significant correlation between BSEEG score and impairment of attention in young mice. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between BSEEG score and microglial activation in hippocampal dentate gyrus and cortex regions in young and aged mice. We have successfully validated the BSEEG method by showing its associations with a level of behavioral change and microglial activation in an LPS-induced mouse model of delirium. In addition, the BSEEG method was able to sensitively capture an LPS-induced delirium-like condition that behavioral tests could not capture because of a hypoactive state.

">Restoration of Fbxo7 expression in dopaminergic neurons restores tyrosine hydroxylase in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in FBXO7 are linked to an atypical parkinsonism. Conditional knock out (KO) of Fbxo7 in dopaminergic neurons in a mouse model caused a neurodegenerative phenotype, including a significant reduction in striatal TH staining at 6 weeks of age and a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc. To test whether re-expression of Fbxo7 could act as a treatment to prevent or restore TH expression in the striatum in this model, we used a rAAV vector to deliver murine Fbxo7 and a mRuby fluorescent marker to dopaminergic neurons. We found that Fbxo7 expression, both before and after the TH loss, restored its expression in the striatum and nucleus accumbens in the mouse. This study therefore highlights that Fbxo7 is important for the integrity and persistence of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in the mammalian brain, which could be of relevance to Parkinson's disease with therapeutic implications.

">Psilocybin prevents habituation to familiar stimuli and preserves sensitivity to sound following repeated stimulation in mouse primary auditory cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin, a psychoactive substance derived from fungi, has been utilized historically by diverse cultures for both medicinal and non-medicinal purposes, owing to its ability to elicit profound sensory and cognitive alterations and sustain long-term changes in mood and cognition. Promising results from recent clinical studies have generated a wave of interest in employing psilocybin to treat neuropsychiatric and neuro-degenerative conditions. How psychedelics cause acute perceptual effects, and how these relate to long-lasting alterations is still debated. Whereas it is thought that perceptual disturbances may be caused by disrupted flow of information between sensory and higher order areas, in vivo studies have focused mostly on the latter. In particular, there has been little study of how psilocybin affects sensory representations in primary auditory cortex (A1). We used two-photon microscopy and wide field calcium imaging to examine how psilocybin affects A1 neuron response properties in the mouse. Administration of 1 mg/kg psilocybin prevented habituation of sound-evoked responses to repeated stimuli, maintaining overall responsiveness, bandwidth, and sound-level response thresholds after repeated stimulation. This was in contrast to marked habituation of responses and narrowing of tuning in controls. We observed no effect on overall distribution of best frequencies at the cortical level, suggesting psilocybin in A1 disrupts normal sensory gating, rather than tonotopic organization. This supports models of psychedelic action in which perceptual disturbances are driven by disrupted hierarchical sensory gating. With further research, influences of psychedelics on sensory representations could be harnessed to target maladaptive sensory processing in conditions such as tinnitus.

                Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in rodents is pivotal for understanding the mechanisms underlying Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) signals and phenotyping animal models of disorders, amongst other applications. Despite its growing use, comparing rodent fMRI results across different research sites remains challenging due to variations in experimental protocols. Here, we aggregated and analyzed 22 sensory-evoked rat fMRI datasets from 12 imaging centers, totaling scans from 220 rats, to assess the consistency of results across diverse protocols. We applied a standardized preprocessing pipeline and evaluated the impact of different hemodynamic response function models on group and individual level activity patterns. Our analysis revealed inter-dataset variability attributed to differences in experimental design, anesthesia protocols, and imaging parameters. We identified robust activation clusters in all (22/22) datasets. The comparison between stock human models implemented in software and rat-specific models showed significant variations in the resulting statistical maps. Our findings emphasize the necessity for standardized protocols and collaborative efforts to improve the reproducibility and reliability of rodent fMRI studies. We provide open access to all datasets and analysis code to foster transparency and further research in the field.

                The blood-brain barrier is a near ubiquitous feature of animal nervous systems, adapted to maintain brain homeostasis across species occupying unique and dynamic environments. Understanding the structural and functional diversity of animal blood-brain barriers can aid our understanding of how this structure contributes to important areas of neuroscience such as behavior, health, and disease. The honeybee worker is a well-established model for exploring these dimensions of brain function, however, the honeybee worker blood-brain barrier has yet to be described. Here, we present the first global anatomic analysis and description of the honeybee worker blood-brain barrier and compare key ultrastructural features between two age groups. We describe the cellular makeup of the honeybee worker blood-brain barrier, patterns of heterogeneity in barrier structure throughout the brain, and highlight important areas of further study.

">Current Reporting Practices in Human Neuroscience Research</a></h4>

              
                Concerns for the replicability, reliability, and generalizability of human neuroimaging research have led to intense debates over sample size and open science practices, with more recent attention on the contributions of sampling and recruitment practices. Key to understanding the state of neuroscience research is an assessment of reporting practices that influence replicability, reliability, and generalizability. In this structured review, we evaluated reporting practice across three domains: (1) demographic (e.g., reporting participant race-ethnicity, age, any measure of socioeconomic position), (2) methodological (e.g., reporting recruitment methods, inclusion and exclusion criteria, why participants were excluded from analyses), and (3) open science and generalizability (e.g., analyses were preregistered, target population was stated). Included were 919 published MRI and fMRI studies from 2019 in nine top-ranked journals (N = 3,856 records screened). Reporting across domains was infrequent, with participant racial or ethnic identity (14.8%), reasons for missing imaging data (31.2%), and identification of a target population (19.4%) being particularly low/underreported. Reporting likelihood varied by study characteristics (e.g., participant age group) and was correlated across domains. The median sample size of studies was 55 participants. Study sample size, reporting frequency, was positively associated with two-year citation counts, providing some evidence that the complete reporting of demographic characteristics, methodological decisions, and open science and generalizability practices may not be as valued as study sample size. Recommendations for structural interventions at the journal level are proposed.

">Acoustic parameter combinations underlying mapping of auditory pseudoword sounds to multiple domains of meaning: a machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                Sound symbolism, referring to the resemblance between the sound structure of words and their meaning, is commonly studied using auditory pseudowords. Companion studies across seven meaning domains demonstrated systematic relationships, varying by domain, between the perceptual ratings, phonetic features, and acoustic parameters of a set of 537 pseudowords (Lacey et al. 2024a, 2024b). Here we employed a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) machine-learning algorithm to compare 4094 combinations of twelve acoustic parameters (3 spectro-temporal and 9 characterizing vocal quality) and identify the parameter combination that best predicted perceptual ratings in each domain. Using multiple regression, we then examined the relative contributions of the parameters comprising the best performing acoustic model for each domain. Finally, we used the KNN approach to generate sound-symbolic ratings, in the shape domain, for 160 real words and compared these predicted ratings with corresponding perceptual ratings. We found that sound-symbolic mappings rely on domain-specific combinations and weights of acoustic parameters. One spectro-temporal parameter, the fast Fourier transform, and one vocal parameter, the fraction of unvoiced frames, were both present in the best performing model for each meaning domain studied, indicating the general importance of these two parameters for sound-symbolic judgments. The predicted and perceptual ratings of the real words were strongly correlated, indicating the value of this approach to measure the degree of sound-symbolic mapping in natural languages, unconfounded by semantic bias. Our findings support the proposed relevance of sound symbolism to language.

">Identification of SLC45A4 as a pain gene encoding a neuronal polyamine transporter.</a></h4>

              
                Polyamines are regulatory metabolites with key roles in transcription, translation, cell signalling and autophagy1. They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels2. Polyamines have been linked to pain showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models3. However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. In undertaking a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK-Biobank we found significant association with variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system SLC45A4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron sub-types within the dorsal root ganglion including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, whilst the cryo-EM structure reveals a novel regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat and algogen induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of peptidergic nociceptors. Our findings thus establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a new target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have emerged in recent years as a strong candidate for the treatment of a range of difficulties faced by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including cognitive, emotional, and social aspects. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a review that systematically examined the efficacy of MBIs for individuals with ASD and their caregivers. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our literature search was conducted within the MEDLINE database. We included in the review only longitudinal or intervention studies focusing mainly on mindfulness principles, while we excluded mixed intervention studies. We only included studies that explicitly utilized quantitative methodologies for evaluating the outcomes of the interventions, including mental health indices (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) and assessments of cognitive and social skills (e.g., attention, prosociality). We conducted also a risk of bias assessment through the method of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for intervention studies ROBINS-I. Results: Thirty-seven studies were included in the review, and we grouped the studies by the targets of the interventions, i.e., adults (n = 12), children and adolescents (n = 9), caregivers and medical staff (n = 13), and combined intervention for both children/adolescents and their parents/caregivers (n 5). The reviewed papers seem to support the feasibility and utility of mindfulness interventions for persons with ASD and their caregivers, but any recommendations based on this body of evidence should be made with caution due to the overall low quality of the studies conducted so far. Conclusions: The review reveals a positive outcome, including the alleviation of psychological distress, reduced behavioral problems, and enhanced cognitive and social skills in individuals with ASD. Despite such promising results, the review notes a limitation in the scarcity of MBIs for young patients, emphasizing caution in universally endorsing the existing literature. Moreover, the results underline the urgency of the exploration of tailored interventions for different ASD subgroups, considering varying levels of autism, and expanding support to teachers in educational settings.</p>

	<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of movement disorders that impair posture and mobility, often leading to spasticity and joint contractures. Interventions like serial casting are commonly used to improve joint mobility and manage spasticity in children with CP. However, its effects on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of serial casting and ankle&amp;amp;ndash;foot orthoses (AFOs) on ANS responses during a virtual reality (VR) standing task, comparing these interventions with a barefoot condition. Thirty children with CP were randomized into three groups (n = 10 per group): serial casting, AFOs, and barefoot. Heart rate variability (HRV) was used to assess ANS responses across three phases: seated rest, VR task, and recovery. The results showed that the serial casting group exhibited higher sympathetic activity during rest compared to the other groups, but had a reduced sympathetic response during the VR task. Additionally, the serial casting group displayed a more pronounced parasympathetic rebound during recovery, similar to the orthoses and barefoot groups. While serial casting provides essential joint stability, it alters ANS response patterns, leading to heightened sympathetic activation at rest, without providing significant improvements in ANS behavior during physical activity.</p>

	<p>Background: Post-treatment side effects of chemotherapy can include cognitive deficits commonly known as Chemo-brain. The treatment of patients with Doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of cancer, can induce depression, anxiety, and impaired cognitive function. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa that has been identified as a possible therapeutic agent against many neurodegenerative disorders, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Tau-protein-induced neurodegeneration, and neuropathic pain. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether oral CBD administration could reduce DOX-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors and alter the expression of mRNA associated with neuroinflammation. Methods: Female Long Evans Hooded rats received intraperitoneal injections of DOX (6 mg/kg) or the vehicle (0.9% saline) once a week for four weeks, followed by oral administration of CBD (10 mg/kg) three times a week for the same period. Results: CBD was significantly protective against DOX-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors, as measured by several behavioral tests. Furthermore, CBD improved DOX-induced alterations in the gene expression of biomarkers of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: This provides insights into future studies on possible mechanisms by which DOX-induced cognitive dysfunction could be alleviated by CBD.</p>

	<p>Background: Decision-making is a highly complex process that depends on numerous cognitive functions, such as episodic memory. It is also influenced by aging. However, how changes in episodic memory with age contribute to changes in decision-making is not clear yet. Objective: This work aimed to examine the role of two memory processes, recollection and familiarity, in decision-making in ageing. Method: Thirty young adults and 30 older adults performed two episodic memory tasks: recognition, which allowed for the measurement of recollection and familiarity, and recall, which allowed for the measurement of recollection. In both tasks, they first viewed a series of pictures and then were asked to recognise or recall them respectively. They also performed an original scenario task based on situations inspired by everyday life, evaluating decision-making under conditions of either risk or ambiguity. In this task, participants were presented with short descriptions of situations requiring a decision and had to choose between two given options. Results: Lower performances was observed in recall and recognition tasks in older than in young adults. In the scenarios task, young adults sought significantly more risk and ambiguity than older adults. In both young and older adults, recollection and familiarity processes were involved differently in decision-making. The former is more involved in decision-making under ambiguity, and the latter in decision-making under risk. Conclusions: The results suggest that decision-making changes with age, but that the involvement of the episodic memory, familiarity and recollection processes, does not appear to vary with age.</p>

	<p>Background: Visual perceptual learning plays a crucial role in shaping our understanding of how the human brain integrates visual cues to construct coherent perceptual experiences. The visual system is continually challenged to integrate a multitude of visual cues, including form and motion, to create a unified representation of the surrounding visual scene. This process involves both the processing of local signals and their integration into a coherent global percept. Over the past several decades, researchers have explored the mechanisms underlying this integration, focusing on concepts such as internal noise and sampling efficiency, which pertain to local and global processing, respectively. Objectives and Methods: In this study, we investigated the influence of visual perceptual learning on non-directional motion processing using dynamic Glass patterns (GPs) and modified Random-Dot Kinematograms (mRDKs). We also explored the mechanisms of learning transfer to different stimuli and tasks. Specifically, we aimed to assess whether visual perceptual learning based on illusory directional motion, triggered by form and motion cues (dynamic GPs), transfers to stimuli that elicit comparable illusory motion, such as mRDKs. Additionally, we examined whether training on form and motion coherence thresholds improves internal noise filtering and sampling efficiency. Results: Our results revealed significant learning effects on the trained task, enhancing the perception of dynamic GPs. Furthermore, there was a substantial learning transfer to the non-trained stimulus (mRDKs) and partial transfer to a different task. The data also showed differences in coherence thresholds between dynamic GPs and mRDKs, with GPs showing lower coherence thresholds than mRDKs. Finally, an interaction between visual stimulus type and session for sampling efficiency revealed that the effect of training session on participants&amp;amp;rsquo; performance varied depending on the type of visual stimulus, with dynamic GPs being influenced differently than mRDKs. Conclusion: These findings highlight the complexity of perceptual learning and suggest that the transfer of learning effects may be influenced by the specific characteristics of both the training stimuli and tasks, providing valuable insights for future research in visual processing.</p>

	<p>Victims of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women (IPVAW) experience neuropsychological and cerebral changes, which have been linked to several tentative causal mechanisms, including elevated cortisol levels, psychopathological disorders, traumatic brain injury (TBI), hypoxic/ischemic brain damage, and medical conditions related to IPVAW. While these mechanisms and their effects on brain function and neuropsychological health are well-documented in other clinical populations, they manifest with unique characteristics in women affected by IPVAW. Specifically, IPVAW is chronic and repeated in nature, and mechanisms are often cumulative and may interact with other comorbid conditions. Thus, in light of existing literature on neuropsychological alterations in other populations, and recognizing the distinct features in women who experience IPVAW, we propose a new theoretical model&amp;amp;mdash;the Neuro-IPVAW model. This framework aims to explain the complex interplay between these mechanisms and their impact on cognitive and brain health in IPVAW victims. We anticipate that this theoretical model will be valuable for enhancing our understanding of neuropsychological and brain changes related to intimate partner violence, identifying research gaps in these mechanisms, and guiding future research directions in this area.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by a complex interplay of genetic, developmental, and environmental factors that significantly increase the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SAs). This systematic review synthesizes current research on the developmental predictors of SI in individuals with SZ, aiming to delineate the multifactorial etiology of suicide within this population. Methods: A comprehensive search across Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases identified 23 eligible studies, emphasizing the varied methodological approaches and the global distribution of research efforts. Results: These studies demonstrate a robust association between early life adversities, particularly childhood trauma such as physical neglect, emotional abuse, and sexual abuse, and the increased prevalence of SI and SAs in SZ. This review also highlights the significant genetic factors associated with the development of suicidality in SZ, raising the possibility that polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes and neurodevelopmental abnormalities may influence susceptibility to SI. Notably, family history of psychiatric conditions may exacerbate the risk of SI through both hereditary and environmental mechanisms. Environmental factors, including socioeconomic status and social support, are also implicated, underscoring the role of broader socio-environmental conditions influencing outcomes. Conclusions: This review supports the integration of biopsychosocial models in understanding SI in SZ, advocating for interventions addressing the complex interplay of risk factors and the need for longitudinal studies to elucidate the dynamic interactions between risk factors over time. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for developing targeted preventive strategies and enhancing the clinical management of SZ, aiming to reduce suicidality in this vulnerable population.</p>

	<p>Background: In the oddball paradigm, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is often associated with active cognitive responses, such as maintaining information in working memory or adapting response strategies. While some evidence points to the DLPFC&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in passive auditory deviance perception, a detailed understanding of the spatiotemporal neurodynamics involved remains unclear. Methods: In this study, event-related optical signals (EROS) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were simultaneously recorded for the first time over the prefrontal cortex using a 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system, during passive auditory deviance perception in 12 right-handed young adults (7 women and 5 men). In this oddball paradigm, deviant stimuli (a 1500 Hz pure tone) elicited a negative shift in the N1 ERP component, related to mismatch negativity (MMN), and a significant positive deflection associated with the P300, compared to standard stimuli (a 1000 Hz tone). Results: We hypothesize that the DLPFC not only participates in active tasks but also plays a critical role in processing deviant stimuli in passive conditions, shifting from pre-attentive to attentive processing. We detected enhanced neural activity in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), at the same timing of the MMN component, followed by later activation at the timing of the P3a ERP component in the right MFG. Conclusions: Understanding these dynamics will provide deeper insights into the DLPFC&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in evaluating the novelty or unexpectedness of the deviant stimulus, updating its cognitive value, and adjusting future predictions accordingly. However, the small number of subjects could limit the generalizability of the observations, in particular with respect to the effect of handedness, and additional studies with larger and more diverse samples are necessary to validate our conclusions.</p>

	<p>Purpose: To assess spatial contrast sensitivity (CS) in suspected primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. Methods: CS was measured using sinusoidal gratings of 4 cycles/degree. First, foveal and peripheral CS were assessed in 34 suspected POAG patients and compared with 71 and 28 age-matched healthy individuals for foveal and peripheral conditions, respectively. Second, foveal CS was assessed in 34 early POAG patients age-matched with suspected POAG patients. Analyses were performed considering two age ranges: Under and Over 50 y.o. Correlations were evaluated between CS and clinical parameters. Diagnostic accuracy was also analyzed. Results: Peripheral CS was lower in older suspected POAG patients (23.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.1) than the control group (39.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 28.2) (p = 0.040). Foveal CS was reduced in suspected POAG participants (Under 50: 146.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 63.3; p = 0.004. Over 50: 110.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 65.0; p = 0.044) and in early POAG patients (Under 50: 141.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 72.6; p = 0.002. Over 50: 80.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 54.5 p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), both compared to the control group (Under 50: 213.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 66.2. Over 50: 138.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 71.7). CS was lower in early POAG than in POAG suspected in older patients (p = 0.042). Foveal CS was correlated with age (Early: p = 0.001. Suspect: p = 0.002) and with the cup&amp;amp;ndash;disc ratio only in early POAG patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Foveal CS had fair (AUC = 0.74) diagnostic accuracy for early POAG patients. Conclusions: CS in suspected POAG patients is lower than in healthy individuals. Our findings evidence the spatial vision loss before the onset of POAG.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Although the involvement of progressive brain alterations in epilepsy was recently suggested, individual patients&amp;amp;rsquo; trajectories of white matter (WM) disruption are not known. Methods: We investigated the disease progression patterns of WM damage and its associations with clinical metrics. We examined the cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of 155 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 270 age/gender-matched healthy controls, and we then calculated the average fractional anisotropy (FA) values within 20 WM tracts of the whole brain. We used the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) program to detect the progression trajectory of FA changes and investigated its association with clinical parameters including onset age, disease duration, drug-responsiveness, and the number of anti-seizure medications (ASMs). Results: The SuStaIn algorithm identified a single subtype model in which the initial damage occurs in the ipsilateral uncinate fasciculus (UF), followed by damage in the forceps, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). This pattern was replicated when analyzing TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (n = 50) and TLE with no lesions (n = 105) separately. Further-progressed stages were associated with longer disease duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and a greater number of ASMs (p = 0.001). Conclusions: the disease progression model based on WM tracts may be useful as a novel individual-level biomarker.</p>

	<p>The acute levodopa challenge is widely used to distinguish Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) from atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APSs) such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In APSs, very few patients present a clinically relevant response to levodopa. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with atypical parkinsonism benefit from levodopa in any aspect of their multiple motor deficits despite the generally poor response. This retrospective study analyzed individual motor responses to the acute levodopa challenge using the MDS-UPDRS III in 47 PSP, 26 MSA, and 71 PD patients at Hannover Medical School. Despite the generally poor levodopa response in both PSP and MSA patients, bradykinesia and rigidity were the symptoms most notably affected by levodopa in PSP patients, while MSA patients experienced significant improvements in bradykinesia and action tremor. These findings underscore the variability in levodopa response among PSP and MSA patients and highlight the need for personalized treatment approaches in atypical parkinsonism.</p>

	<p>The landscape of pharmacological treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) has undergone significant transformations with the advent of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) targeting &amp;amp;beta;-Amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;) accumulation, one of the hallmark pathologies of AD. The approval and market introduction of monoclonal antibodies mark the dawn of a new era in AD therapeutics as well. Furthermore, considerable progress has also been made in the development of new drugs targeting non-A&amp;amp;beta; and non-Tau protein pathways. These advancements are key in tackling the root causes of AD, offering hope for treatments that both relieve symptoms and slow disease progression, improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the advances in drug development and application for AD, including those currently in clinical trials and those already approved for the market to treat patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neural decoding methods are often limited by the performance of brain encoders, which map complex brain signals into a latent representation space of perception information. These brain encoders are constrained by the limited amount of paired brain and stimuli data available for training, making it challenging to learn rich neural representations. Methods: To address this limitation, we present a novel multimodal training approach using paired image and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to establish a brain masked autoencoder that learns the interactions between images and brain activities. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion model conditioned on brain data to decode realistic images. Results: Our method achieves high-quality decoding results in semantic contents and low-level visual attributes, outperforming previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, our method is applied to decode artificial patterns across region of interests (ROIs) to explore their functional properties. We not only validate existing knowledge concerning ROIs but also unveil new insights, such as the synergy between early visual cortex and higher-level scene ROIs, as well as the competition within the higher-level scene ROIs. Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights for future directions in the field of neural decoding.</p>

	<p>Background: Mental health issues are increasingly prominent worldwide, posing significant threats to patients and deeply affecting their families and social relationships. Traditional diagnostic methods are subjective and delayed, indicating the need for an objective and effective early diagnosis method. Methods: To this end, this paper proposes a lightweight detection method for multi-mental disorders with fewer data sources, aiming to improve diagnostic procedures and enable early patient detection. First, the proposed method takes Electroencephalography (EEG) signals as sources, acquires brain rhythms through Discrete Wavelet Decomposition (DWT), and extracts their approximate entropy, fuzzy entropy, permutation entropy, and sample entropy to establish the entropy-based matrix. Then, six kinds of conventional machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Decision Tree (DT), are adopted for the entropy-based matrix to achieve the detection task. Their performances are assessed by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Concerning these experiments, three public datasets of schizophrenia, epilepsy, and depression are utilized for method validation. Results: The analysis of the results from these datasets identifies the representative single-channel signals (schizophrenia: O1, epilepsy: F3, depression: O2), satisfying classification accuracies (88.10%, 75.47%, and 89.92%, respectively) with minimal input. Conclusions: Such performances are impressive when considering fewer data sources as a concern, which also improves the interpretability of the entropy features in EEG, providing a reliable detection approach for multi-mental disorders and advancing insights into their underlying mechanisms and pathological states.</p>

	<p>Background: Intravenous thrombolysis is one of the most effective therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), with urokinase offering a cost-effective alternative to newer agents like alteplase and tenecteplase, especially in resource-limited settings. Methods: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of intravenous thrombolysis with urokinase for AIS in the clinical practice of stroke management, including the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of urokinase compared to other thrombolytic agents. Results: Urokinase, a first-generation thrombolytic drug, is a non-specific plasminogen activator that offers a cost-effective alternative. It has been used in clinical practice for over two decades to improve neurological outcomes in patients with AIS if administered within 6 h of ictus. Numerous studies have indicated that urokinase remains a viable option for patients who cannot access alteplase or tenecteplase because of economic constraints, time window limitations, availability, or other reasons. Conclusions: In low- and middle-income countries, urokinase is a cost-effective alternative thrombolytic drug. High-level evidence-based medical research is therefore urgently needed to confirm that urokinase is not inferior to new-generation thrombolytic drugs, and to assess whether it may even be superior in some patient populations.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive deficits following ischemic stroke significantly impair quality of life, highlighting the need for effective interventions. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of extended N-Pep-12 dietary supplementation in enhancing cognitive recovery post-stroke. Methods: In this randomized, open-label, controlled study, 106 patients with supratentorial ischemic stroke were enrolled to receive either 90mg N-Pep-12 or no supplementation daily for 360 days and were followed-up for 360 days. Cognitive function and emotional well-being were assessed using established neuropsychological scales at baseline, 90 days, and 360 days post-stroke. Safety was monitored through adverse events and mortality rates. Results: Significant improvements were observed in the N-Pep-12 group compared to controls, particularly in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores at both 90 and 360 days, and in the Digit Symbol Coding scores at 360 days, suggesting enhanced cognitive recovery with extended N-Pep-12 supplementation. A linear regression for a composite outcome analysis at day 360 further confirmed the efficacy of N-Pep-12 in contributing to cognitive improvement. Safety profiles were favorable, with no significant adverse effects attributed to N-Pep-12. Conclusions: Extended dietary supplementation with N-Pep-12 appears to offer a safe and effective approach to support cognitive recovery in ischemic stroke survivors. These findings underscore the potential of the supplement as an add-on intervention for managing post-stroke cognitive impairments.</p>

	<p>Objectives. There is a significant correlation between EEG microstate and the neurophysiological basis of mental illness, brain state, and cognitive function. Given that the unclear relationship between network dynamics and different microstates, this paper utilized microstate, brain network, and control theories to understand the microstate characteristics of short-term memory task, aiming to mechanistically explain the most influential microstates and brain regions driving the abnormal changes in brain state transitions in patients with schizophrenia. Methods. We identified each microstate and analyzed the microstate abnormalities in schizophrenia patients during short-term memory tasks. Subsequently, the network dynamics underlying the primary microstates were studied to reveal the relationships between network dynamics and microstates. Finally, using control theory, we confirmed that the abnormal changes in brain state transitions in schizophrenia patients are driven by specific microstates and brain regions. Results. The frontal-occipital lobes activity of microstate D decreased significantly, but the left frontal lobe of microstate B increased significantly in schizophrenia, when the brain was moving toward the easy-to-reach states. However, the frontal-occipital lobes activity of microstate D decreased significantly in schizophrenia, when the brain was moving toward the hard-to-reach states. Microstate D showed that the right-frontal activity had a higher priority than the left-frontal, but microstate B showed that the left-frontal priority decreased significantly in schizophrenia, when changes occur in the synchronization state of the brain. Conclusions. In conclusion, microstate D may be a biomarker candidate of brain abnormal activity during the states transitions in schizophrenia, and microstate B may represent a compensatory mechanism that maintains brain function and exchanges information with other brain regions. Microstate and brain network provide complementary perspectives on the neurodynamics, offering potential insights into brain function in health and disease.</p>

	<p>Background: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the evaluation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic traits in prison populations and offenders. Due to misleading headlines and highly publicized criminal cases, the belief that autistic individuals are more prone to commit crimes has spread among the general population, also leading to increasing research on this matter. Aims: In this context, this narrative review aimed to analyze the available scientific literature on the bi-directional link between ASD and criminal behaviors and to assess the key characteristics of eventual ASD offenders, including sociodemographic data, comorbidities, crime-related features, and interactions with the criminal justice system. Results: Our review highlighted that the available studies lack methodological rigor and present controversial results. Overall, the current state of research does not support any definitive correlation between ASD or autistic traits and the predisposition to engage in criminal conduct. Further studies are needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.</p>

	<p>The delivery of nutrients to the brain is provided by a 600 km network of capillaries and microvessels. Indeed, the brain is highly energy demanding and, among a total amount of 100 billion neurons, each neuron is located just 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 &amp;amp;mu;m from a capillary. This vascular network also forms part of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB), which maintains the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s stable environment by regulating chemical balance, immune cell transport, and blocking toxins. Typically, brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) have low turnover, indicating a stable cerebrovascular structure. However, this structure can adapt significantly due to development, aging, injury, or disease. Temporary neural activity changes are managed by the expansion or contraction of arterioles and capillaries. Hypoxia leads to significant remodeling of the cerebrovascular architecture and pathological changes have been documented in aging and in vascular and neurodegenerative conditions. These changes often involve BMEC proliferation and the remodeling of capillary segments, often linked with local neuronal changes and cognitive function. Cerebrovascular plasticity, especially in arterioles, capillaries, and venules, varies over different time scales in development, health, aging, and diseases. Rapid changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) occur within seconds due to increased neural activity. Prolonged changes in vascular structure, influenced by consistent environmental factors, take weeks. Development and aging bring changes over months to years, with aging-associated plasticity often improved by exercise. Injuries cause rapid damage but can be repaired over weeks to months, while neurodegenerative diseases cause slow, varied changes over months to years. In addition, if animal models may provide useful and dynamic in vivo information about vascular plasticity, humans are more complex to investigate and the hypothesis of glymphatic system together with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques could provide useful clues in the future.</p>

	<p>The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) has gained attention owing to its involvement in various physiological functions, such as sleep&amp;amp;ndash;awake, feeding, and emotion, with its analgesic role being particularly significant. It is described as the &amp;amp;ldquo;pain inhibitory nucleus&amp;amp;rdquo; in the brain. The DRN has diverse projections from hypothalamus, midbrain, and pons. In turn, the DRN is a major source of projections to diverse cortex, limbic forebrain thalamus, and the midbrain and contains highly heterogeneous neuronal subtypes. The activation of DRN neurons in mice prevents the establishment of neuropathic, chronic pain symptoms. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition neurons in the DRN are sufficient to establish pain phenotypes, including long-lasting tactile allodynia, that scale with the extent of stimulation, thereby promoting nociplastic pain. Recent progress has been made in identifying the neural circuits and cellular mechanisms in the DRN that are responsible for sensory modulation. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive review addressing the specific neuron types in the DRN involved in pain modulation. This review summarizes the function of specific cell types within DRN in the pain regulation, and aims to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain regulation in the DRN, ultimately offering insights for further exploration.</p>

                <p>There is experimental evidence of varying correlation among the elements of the neuromuscular system over the course of the reach-and-grasp task. The aim of this study was to investigate if modifications in correlations and clustering can be detected in the local field potential (LFP) recordings of the motor cortex during the task. To this end, we analyzed the LFP recordings from a previously published study on monkeys that performed a reach-and-grasp task for targets with a vertical or horizontal orientation. LFP signals were recorded from the motor and premotor cortex of macaque monkeys as they performed the task. We found very robust changes in the correlations of the multielectrode LFP recordings that corresponded to task epochs. Mean LFP correlation increased significantly during reach and then decreased during grasp. This pattern was very robust for both left and right arm reaches irrespective of target orientation. A hierarchical cluster analysis also demonstrated similar changes. In focusing on correlations, our study has contributed new insights to the understanding of LFP signals and their relationship to movement. A sliding window computation of the number of clusters was performed to probe the capacities of the LFP clusters for detecting upcoming task events. For a very high percentage of trials (97.89%), there was a downturn in cluster number following the Pellet Drop (GO signal) that reached a minimum preceding the Start of grasp, hence indicating that cluster analyses of LFPs could contribute to signaling an increased probability of the Start of grasp.</p>

                <p>A new era of disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) arrived in 2021 following the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to grant accelerated approval for aducanumab, an anti-&beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) monoclonal antibody designed to target A&beta; aggregates, a biological component of AD. More recently, trial outcomes for lecanemab and donanemab, two additional antibodies of this drug class, have shown favorable and significant slowing of metrics for cognitive and functional decline. Lecanemab and donanemab have since received similar FDA approval to aducanumab in January 2023 and July 2024, respectively. Given that these therapies are a clearly emerging tool in the repertoire of clinicians treating AD and related dementias, a critical dialogue has been ongoing regarding the potential impacts and place for these therapies. Here, we seek to contextualize this debate by first considering factors involved in theoretically extrapolating current randomized control trial outcomes to estimate meaningful clinical impacts. In the process of this exercise, we outline a generally useful concept termed Summative Treatment-Associated Benefit measuring Long-term Efficacy/Effectiveness Area as a metric of summative benefits of treatment over the life course of an individual. Second, we consider current real-world factors, such as conditions of FDA approval and other points involved in clinical decision-making that will influence and/or temper the actual impacts of this drug class.</p>

                <p>How the human brain reconstructs, step-by-step, the core elements of past experiences is still unclear. Here, we map the spatiotemporal trajectories along which visual object memories are reconstructed during associative recall. Specifically, we inquire whether retrieval reinstates feature representations in a copy-like but reversed direction with respect to the initial perceptual experience, or alternatively, this reconstruction involves format transformations and regions beyond initial perception. Participants from two cohorts studied new associations between verbs and randomly paired object images, and subsequently recalled the objects when presented with the corresponding verb cue. We first analyze multivariate fMRI patterns to map where in the brain high- and low-level object features can be decoded during perception and retrieval, showing that retrieval is dominated by conceptual features, represented in comparatively late visual and parietal areas. A separately acquired EEG dataset is then used to track the temporal evolution of the reactivated patterns using similarity-based EEG&ndash;fMRI fusion. This fusion suggests that memory reconstruction proceeds from anterior frontotemporal to posterior occipital and parietal regions, in line with a conceptual-to-perceptual gradient but only partly following the same trajectories as during perception. Specifically, a linear regression statistically confirms that the sequential activation of ventral visual stream regions is reversed between image perception and retrieval. The fusion analysis also suggests an information relay to frontoparietal areas late during retrieval. Together, the results shed light onto the temporal dynamics of memory recall and the transformations that the information undergoes between the initial experience and its later reconstruction from memory.</p>

                <p>Systemic inflammation has been implicated in the development and progression of neurodegenerative conditions such as cognitive impairment and dementia. Recent clinical studies indicate an association between sepsis, endothelial dysfunction, and cognitive decline. However, the investigations of the role and therapeutic potential of the cerebral microvasculature in sepsis-induced cognitive dysfunction have been limited by the lack of standardized experimental models for evaluating the alterations in the cerebral microvasculature and cognition induced by the systemic inflammatory response. Herein, we validated a mouse model of endotoxemia that recapitulates key pathophysiology related to sepsis-induced cognitive dysfunction, including the induction of an acute systemic hyperinflammatory response, blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB) leakage, neurovascular inflammation, and memory impairment after recovery from the systemic inflammation. In the acute phase, we identified novel molecular (e.g., upregulation of plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein, PLVAP, a driver of endothelial permeability, and the procoagulant plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, PAI-1) and functional perturbations (i.e., albumin and small-molecule BBB leakage) in the cerebral microvasculature along with neuroinflammation. Remarkably, small-molecule BBB permeability, elevated levels of PAI-1, intra-/perivascular fibrin/fibrinogen deposition, and microglial activation persisted 1 month after recovery from sepsis. We also highlight molecular neuronal alterations of potential clinical relevance following systemic inflammation including changes in neurofilament phosphorylation and decreases in postsynaptic density protein 95 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, suggesting diffuse axonal injury, synapse degeneration, and impaired neurotrophism. Our study serves as a standardized mouse model to support future mechanistic studies of sepsis-associated cognitive dysfunction and to identify novel endothelial therapeutic targets for this devastating condition.</p>

                Background Cogan’s syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular inflammation, vestibulocochlear dysfunction, and systemic vasculitis. Case Presentation We report a 28-year-old female who experienced decreased visual acuity and ocular redness one month after a COVID-19 infection, with ophthalmological signs linked to keratitis, uveitis and retinal vascularitis. Two weeks later, she developed vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden hearing loss, leading to a diagnosis of Cogan’s disease. The patient received corticosteroid therapy, resulting in regression of ophthalmological signs, but progressed to complete deafness. One month later, she presented with lymphocytic meningitis and high intracranial pressure, which improved under treatment. The patient later received cochlear implants. Objective This case report aims to highlight an atypical presentation of Cogan’s syndrome with neurological involvement following a COVID-19 infection. This case contributes to the limited literature on such presentations. Conclusion Our case is one of only two reported instances of Cogan’s syndrome presenting with neurological signs post-COVID-19 infection, underscoring the rarity and complexity of this condition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1103/v1?src=rss">Coiling of echogenic perineural catheters with integral stylet: A proof-of-concept randomized control trial in a sciatic nerve block simulator and a pilot study in orthopaedic-trauma patients. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Backround/Objectives We investigated a technique that facilitates the coiling of a regular straight catheter (with integral stylet) behind the sciatic nerve in an ultrasound (US) regional anaesthesia simulator, and then applied our findings to a series of orthopedic-trauma patients. Methods We conducted a randomized study of two methods of perineural catheter advancement in a sciatic nerve block Blue Phantom simulator. Two groups of twenty catheters each (method A and method B) were evaluated under real-time ultrasound imaging. The needle in-plane/nerve in-short-axis technique was applied. In method A the catheter was advanced beyond the needle tip with the integral stylet extending along its entire length; in method B the catheter was advanced after its integral stylet was retracted by 6 cm, thus providing flexibility to the catheter’s distal end. Additionally, to assess the procedural effectiveness of method B coiling technique, a pilot study was conducted examining 25 perineural catheters coiled underneath the sciatic nerve in trauma-orthopaedic patients to document any displacement of catheters’ tip from their initial position (for 36 hours postoperatively). Results In the simulation study, method B led to a significantly higher percentage (18/20:90%) of coiled catheters than method A (3/20:15%). Two coiled catheters of method B were found kinked/obstructed. In our patients, after catheter insertion, the distal end of 2/25 (8%) coiled catheters was obstructed. One perineural catheter was dislodged. For the remaining 22 (88%) catheters, ultrasound imaging demonstrated that local anaesthetic infusion made contact with the sciatic nerve, indicating no displacement of the catheter’s distal end postoperatively. Conclusion Regular straight perineural catheters can be easily coiled if their integral stylet is partially retracted. This coiling method offers extra catheter length adjacent to the nerve structure which potentially mitigates catheter tip displacement.

                Background The Wheat Crop ontology was created to annotate phenotypic experimental data (i.e. field and greenhouse measurements standardized and integrated in databases). The Wheat Trait and Phenotype ontology was created to annotate information on wheat traits from the literature (i.e. text found in the abstract, results and discussion of scholarly articles). To enable seamless data retrieval on wheat traits from these complementary sources, the classes in the two ontologies have been aligned. Methods All pairs of ontology classes were examined and categorized in nine groups based on the nature of their relationships (e.g. equivalence, subsumption). General principles emerged from this process which were formalized into rules. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) representation was chosen to represent the mappings in RDF (Resource Description Framework), including their metadata such as creators, reviewers, and justification (including rules). Results The mapping dataset is publicly available. It covers 77% of the ontology classes. Most labels of the aligned classes differed significantly and required domain expertise for decisions, especially for traits related to biotic stress. Consequently, most mappings are close mappings rather than exact equivalents. Conclusions We present the end-to-end manual process used to select and represent mappings in SSSOM within the specific domain of wheat traits. We derive general lessons from the complex alignment process that extend beyond the specific case of these two ontologies and more generally apply to alignments of specialized ontologies for information retrieval purposes. This work demonstrates the relevance of SSSOM for representing these mappings.

                Background Over the past three decades, Portugal has invested significantly in doctoral training. However, there is a lack of up-to-date information on the success of scholarship holders in obtaining the degree or on their subsequent career paths. Methods This study analysed four cohorts of scholarship holders funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology between 1995 and 2012. The professional situation at different points in time after the Ph.D. (5, 10, 15 and 20 years) was studied. Results The success rate for obtaining the degree was 88%, which is comparable to other European countries for doctorates completed with funding over a period of 3-4 years. The average time to obtain the degree was 5.06 years. The time to degree was influenced by the scientific field, the nationality of the scholarship holder, and the location of the institution awarding the degree (in Portugal or abroad). The gender or age range of the scholarship recipients did not influence the time required for graduation. The analysis of the career and sector of activity of these graduates at different points in time after obtaining the Ph.D. revealed that approximately 60% percent of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities at some point in their career paths, but this percentage diminished from the oldest to the most recent cohorts, suggesting difficulties in retaining recent graduates in academia and in the private sector. In 2020, 63% of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities, and almost half were employed in higher education as teachers, researchers, or scholarship holders. Conclusions This study confirmed the challenges faced by doctoral graduates in integrating into non-academic job markets. On the other hand, it has demonstrated an efficient use of public funds, with high success rates and a time to degree that is within the average of other European countries.

                <p>by Mengze Zhang, Xia Wang, Sanyi Tang</p>

Aedes mosquitoes, known as vectors of mosquito-borne diseases, pose significant risks to public health and safety. Modeling the population dynamics of Aedes mosquitoes requires comprehensive approaches due to the complex interplay between biological mechanisms and environmental factors. This study developed a model that couples differential equations with a neural network to simulate the dynamics of mosquito population, and explore the relationships between oviposition rate, temperature, and precipitation. Data from nine cities in Guangdong Province spanning four years were used for model training and parameter estimation, while data from the remaining three cities were reserved for model validation. The trained model successfully simulated the mosquito population dynamics across all twelve cities using the same set of parameters. Correlation coefficients between simulated results and observed data exceeded 0.7 across all cities, with some cities surpassing 0.85, demonstrating high model performance. The coupled neural network in the model effectively revealed the relationships among oviposition rate, temperature, and precipitation, aligning with biological patterns. Furthermore, symbolic regression was used to identify the optimal functional expression for these relationships. By integrating the traditional dynamic model with machine learning, our model can adhere to specific biological mechanisms while extracting patterns from data, thus enhancing its interpretability in biology. Our approach provides both accurate modeling and an avenue for uncovering potential unknown biological mechanisms. Our conclusions can provide valuable insights into designing strategies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases and developing related prediction and early warning systems.

Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the human microbiome. Despite this progress, challenges persist in comprehending the microbiome’s influence on disease, hindered by technical complexities in species classification, abundance estimation, and data compositionality. At the same time, the existence of macroecological laws describing the variation and diversity in microbial communities irrespective of their environment has been recently proposed using 16s data and explained by a simple phenomenological model of population dynamics. We here investigate the relationship between dysbiosis, i.e. in unhealthy individuals there are deviations from the “regular” composition of the gut microbial community, and the existence of macro-ecological emergent law in microbial communities. We first quantitatively reconstruct these patterns at the species level using shotgun data, and addressing the consequences of sampling effects and statistical errors on ecological patterns. We then ask if such patterns can discriminate between healthy and unhealthy cohorts. Concomitantly, we evaluate the efficacy of different statistical generative models, which incorporate sampling and population dynamics, to describe such patterns and distinguish which are expected by chance, versus those that are potentially informative about disease states or other biological drivers. A critical aspect of our analysis is understanding the relationship between model parameters, which have clear ecological interpretations, and the state of the gut microbiome, thereby enabling the generation of synthetic compositional data that distinctively represent healthy and unhealthy individuals. Our approach, grounded in theoretical ecology and statistical physics, allows for a robust comparison of these models with empirical data, enhancing our understanding of the strengths and limitations of simple microbial models of population dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012471">The role of training variability for model-based and model-free learning of an arbitrary visuomotor mapping</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Carlos A. Velázquez-Vargas, Nathaniel D. Daw, Jordan A. Taylor</p>

A fundamental feature of the human brain is its capacity to learn novel motor skills. This capacity requires the formation of vastly different visuomotor mappings. Using a grid navigation task, we investigated whether training variability would enhance the flexible use of a visuomotor mapping (key-to-direction rule), leading to better generalization performance. Experiments 1 and 2 show that participants trained to move between multiple start-target pairs exhibited greater generalization to both distal and proximal targets compared to participants trained to move between a single pair. This finding suggests that limited variability can impair decisions even in simple tasks without planning. In addition, during the training phase, participants exposed to higher variability were more inclined to choose options that, counterintuitively, moved the cursor away from the target while minimizing its actual distance under the constrained mapping, suggesting a greater engagement in model-based computations. In Experiments 3 and 4, we showed that the limited generalization performance in participants trained with a single pair can be enhanced by a short period of variability introduced early in learning or by incorporating stochasticity into the visuomotor mapping. Our computational modeling analyses revealed that a hybrid model between model-free and model-based computations with different mixing weights for the training and generalization phases, best described participants’ data. Importantly, the differences in the model-based weights between our experimental groups, paralleled the behavioral findings during training and generalization. Taken together, our results suggest that training variability enables the flexible use of the visuomotor mapping, potentially by preventing the consolidation of habits due to the continuous demand to change responses.

                <p>by Jiaxin Jiang, Xiaona Meng, Yibo Wang, Ziqian Zhuang, Ting Du, Jing Yan</p>

Most COVID-19 patients have a positive prognosis, but patients with additional underlying diseases are more likely to have severe illness and increased fatality rates. Numerous studies indicate that cancer patients are more prone to contract SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19 or even dying. In the recent transcriptome investigations, it is demonstrated that the fructose metabolism is altered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, cancer cells can use fructose as an extra source of energy for growth and metastasis. Furthermore, enhanced living conditions have resulted in a notable rise in fructose consumption in individuals’ daily dietary habits. We therefore hypothesize that the poor prognosis of cancer patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 may therefore be mediated through fructose metabolism. Using CRC cases from four distinct cohorts, we built and validated a predictive model based on SARS-CoV-2 producing fructose metabolic anomalies by coupling Cox univariate regression and lasso regression feature selection algorithms to identify hallmark genes in colorectal cancer. We also developed a composite prognostic nomogram to improve clinical practice by integrating the characteristics of aberrant fructose metabolism produced by this novel coronavirus with age and tumor stage. To obtain the genes with the greatest potential prognostic values, LASSO regression analysis was performed, In the TCGA training cohort, patients were randomly separated into training and validation sets in the ratio of 4: 1, and the best risk score value for each sample was acquired by lasso regression analysis for further analysis, and the fifteen genes <i>CLEC4A</i>, <i>FDFT1</i>, <i>CTNNB1</i>, <i>GPI</i>, <i>PMM2</i>, <i>PTPRD</i>, <i>IL7</i>, <i>ALDH3B1</i>, <i>AASS</i>, <i>AOC3</i>, <i>SEPINE1</i>, <i>PFKFB1</i>, <i>FTCD</i>, <i>TIMP1</i> and <i>GATM</i> were finally selected. In order to validate the model’s accuracy, ROC curve analysis was performed on an external dataset, and the results indicated that the model had a high predictive power for the prognosis prediction of patients. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the future targeted regulation of fructose metabolism in colorectal cancer patients, while simultaneously optimizing dietary guidance and therapeutic care for colorectal cancer patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <p>by Ilaria Granata, Lucia Maddalena, Mario Manzo, Mario Rosario Guarracino, Maurizio Giordano</p>

Machine learning-based approaches are particularly suitable for identifying essential genes as they allow the generation of predictive models trained on features from multi-source data. Gene essentiality is neither binary nor static but determined by the context. The databases for essential gene annotation do not permit the personalisation of the context, and their update can be slower than the publication of new experimental data. We propose HELP (Human Gene Essentiality Labelling & Prediction), a computational framework for labelling and predicting essential genes. Its double scope allows for identifying genes based on dependency or not on experimental data. The effectiveness of the labelling method was demonstrated by comparing it with other approaches in overlapping the reference sets of essential gene annotations, where HELP demonstrated the best compromise between false and true positive rates. The gene attributes, including multi-omics and network embedding features, lead to high-performance prediction of essential genes while confirming the existence of essentiality nuances.

                <p>by Cecile Le Sueur, Magnus Rattray, Mikhail Savitski</p>

Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) is a proteome wide technology that enables unbiased detection of protein drug interactions as well as changes in post-translational state of proteins between different biological conditions. Statistical analysis of temperature range TPP (TPP-TR) datasets relies on comparing protein melting curves, describing the amount of non-denatured proteins as a function of temperature, between different conditions (e.g. presence or absence of a drug). However, state-of-the-art models are restricted to sigmoidal melting behaviours while unconventional melting curves, representing up to 50% of TPP-TR datasets, have recently been shown to carry important biological information. We present a novel statistical framework, based on hierarchical Gaussian process models and named GPMelt, to make TPP-TR datasets analysis unbiased with respect to the melting profiles of proteins. GPMelt scales to multiple conditions, and extension of the model to deeper hierarchies (i.e. with additional sub-levels) allows to deal with complex TPP-TR protocols. Collectively, our statistical framework extends the analysis of TPP-TR datasets for both protein and peptide level melting curves, offering access to thousands of previously excluded melting curves and thus substantially increasing the coverage and the ability of TPP to uncover new biology.

                <p>by Irène Barbarin-Bocahu, Nathalie Ulryck, Amandine Rigobert, Nadia Ruiz Gutierrez, Laurence Decourty, Mouna Raji, Bhumika Garkhal, Hervé Le Hir, Cosmin Saveanu, Marc Graille</p>

The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway clears eukaryotic cells of mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) or normal stop codons located in specific contexts. It therefore plays an important role in gene expression regulation. The precise molecular mechanism of the NMD pathway has long been considered to differ substantially from yeast to metazoa, despite the involvement of universally conserved factors such as the central ATP-dependent RNA-helicase Upf1. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the yeast Upf1 bound to its recently identified but yet uncharacterized partner Nmd4, show that Nmd4 stimulates Upf1 ATPase activity and that this interaction contributes to the elimination of NMD substrates. We also demonstrate that a region of Nmd4 critical for the interaction with Upf1 in yeast is conserved in the metazoan SMG6 protein, another major NMD factor. We show that this conserved region is involved in the interaction of SMG6 with UPF1 and that mutations in this region affect the levels of endogenous human NMD substrates. Our results support the universal conservation of the NMD mechanism in eukaryotes.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of the physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. Eleven articles attained the inclusion criteria. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Background The continuing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a massive impact on healthcare systems all around the globe. There is no exception in the demographics of elective surgery also. Like any other medical professionals, surgeons and post-graduates are redirected to the management of patients with COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected elective surgeries, surgeon skills, and post-graduate training. Methods This prospective study was done among 320 participants through a 15-question online cross-sectional survey sent primarily to surgeons practicing in six states of India that were most affected by the pandemic according to recent statistics and also to surgeons in other states via email or other online messaging services carried out from June 2021 to July 2021. Results 320 surgeons participated from various states in India. Overall, 59.7% of those participants who agreed that there was a reduction in bed availability, 70.4% of those participants who agreed that there was a shortage of oxygen, 78.8% of those participants who agreed that there was a shortage of PPE kits, 60.7% of those participants who agreed that there was a delay in procurement of surgical implants and 64% of participants also agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic had affected the post-graduate teaching program. Conclusions All these factors showed significant p-values with statistical significance, thereby indicating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system and healthcare delivery. The pandemic also had a significant impact on post-graduate training.

                The 25th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2024, open-bio.org/events/bosc-2024) was part of the 2024 conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB 2024). Launched in 2000 and held yearly since, BOSC is the premier meeting covering open-source bioinformatics and open science. ISMB 2024 was held in Montréal, Canada, with an online participation option. A total of nearly 2000 people attended; about 200 people participated in BOSC sessions. Over the course of two days, BOSC covered a wide range of topics in open science and open source bioinformatics, including Data Analysis, Open Data, Visualization, Developer Tools and Libraries, Standards and Frameworks for Open Science, and Open AI/ML. Mélanie Courtot delivered an impactful first keynote with a perspective on how “The Data Shows We Need Better Data”. The second keynote speaker, Andrew Su, discussed “Open Data, Knowledge Graphs, and Large Language Models.” BOSC ended with a panel, “Open Source AI/ML: A Game Changer for Bioinformatics?,” in which Lawrence Hunter and Thomas Hervé Mboa Nkoudou joined BOSC’s keynote speakers as panelists. Immediately following BOSC, the CollaborationFest was held at Montréal’s University of Québec campus. First launched in 2010, CoFest is a collaborative work event held yearly around BOSC. This year’s CoFest included 42 participants who worked together on 10 projects.

                The duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. Delineating immune memory typically requires longitudinal serological studies that track antibody prevalence in the same cohort for an extended time. However, this information is needed in faster timescales. Notably, the dynamics of an epidemic where recovered patients become immune for any period should differ significantly from those of one where the recovered promptly become susceptible. Here, we exploit this difference to provide a reliable protocol that can estimate immunity early in an epidemic. We verify this protocol with synthetic data, discuss its limitations, and then apply it to evaluate human immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in mortality data series from New York City. Our results indicate that New York’s mortality figures are incompatible with immunity lasting anything below 105 or above 211 days (90% CI.), and set an example on how to assess immune memory in emerging pandemics before serological studies can be deployed.

                The search for neural markers of depression remains challenging. Despite progress, neuroimaging results have generally not yielded actionable findings that could transform how we understand and treat this disorder. However, in a recent study, Lynch and colleagues identified enlargement of the frontrostriatal salience network as a reproducible, trait-like marker of depression.

                The capabilities of transformer networks such as ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) have captured the world’s attention. The crucial computational mechanism underlying their performance relies on transforming a complete input sequence – for example, all the words in a sentence – into a long ‘encoding vector’ that allows transformers to learn long-range temporal dependencies in naturalistic sequences. Specifically, ‘self-attention’ applied to this encoding vector enhances temporal context in transformers by computing associations between pairs of words in the input sequence. We suggest that waves of neural activity traveling across single cortical areas, or multiple regions on the whole-brain scale, could implement a similar encoding principle. By encapsulating recent input history into a single spatial pattern at each moment in time, cortical waves may enable a temporal context to be extracted from sequences of sensory inputs, the same computational principle as that used in transformers.

                Antimicrobial resistance is responsible for an alarming number of deaths, estimated at 5 million per year. To combat priority pathogens, like <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, the development of novel therapies is of utmost importance. Understanding the molecular alterations induced by medications is critical for the design of multi-targeting treatments capable of eradicating the infection and mitigating its pathogenicity. However, the application of bulk omics approaches for unraveling drug molecular mechanisms of action is limited by their inability to discriminate between target-specific modifications and off-target effects. This study introduces a multi-omics method to overcome the existing limitation. For the first time, the Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay is utilized in bacteria in the PISA-Express format to link proteome solubility with different and potentially immediate responses to drug treatment, enabling us the resolution to understand target-specific modifications and off-target effects. This study introduces a comprehensive method for understanding drug mechanisms and optimizing the development of multi-targeting antimicrobial therapies.

                We propose the Self Returning Excluded Volume (SR-EV) model for the structure of chromatin based on stochastic rules and physical interactions. The SR-EV <i>rules of return</i> generate conformationally defined domains observed by single-cell imaging techniques. From nucleosome to chromosome scales, the model captures the overall chromatin organization as a corrugated system, with dense and dilute regions alternating in a manner that resembles the mixing of two disordered bi-continuous phases. This particular organizational topology is a consequence of the multiplicity of interactions and processes occurring in the nuclei, and mimicked by the proposed return rules. Single configuration properties and ensemble averages show a robust agreement between theoretical and experimental results including chromatin volume concentration, contact probability, packing domain identification and size characterization, and packing scaling behavior. Model and experimental results suggest that there is an inherent chromatin organization regardless of the cell character and resistant to an external forcing such as RAD21 degradation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97444">High-frequency terahertz stimulation alleviates neuropathic pain by inhibiting the pyramidal neuron activity in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system and is characterized by abnormal hypersensitivity to stimuli and nociceptive responses to non-noxious stimuli, affecting approximately 7–10% of the general population. However, current first-line drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids have limitations, including dose-limiting side effects, dependence, and tolerability issues. Therefore, developing new interventions for the management of NP is urgent. In this study, we discovered that the high-frequency terahertz stimulation (HFTS) at approximately 36 THz effectively alleviates NP symptoms in mice with spared nerve injury. Computational simulation suggests that the frequency resonates with the carbonyl group in the filter region of Kv1.2 channels, facilitating the translocation of potassium ions. In vivo and in vitro results demonstrate that HFTS reduces the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex likely through enhancing the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> and also the leak K<sup>+</sup> conductance. This research presents a novel optical intervention strategy with terahertz waves for the treatment of NP and holds promising applications in other nervous system diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90633">Lost in translation: Inconvenient truths on the utility of mouse models in Alzheimer’s disease research</a></h4>

              
                The recent, controversial approval of antibody-based treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is fueling a heated debate on the molecular determinants of this condition. The discussion should also incorporate a critical revision of the limitations of preclinical mouse models in advancing our understanding of AD. We critically discuss the limitations of animal models, stressing the need for careful consideration of how experiments are designed and results interpreted. We identify the shortcomings of AD models to recapitulate the complexity of the human disease. We dissect these issues at the quantitative, qualitative, temporal, and context-dependent levels. We argue that these models are based on the oversimplistic assumptions proposed by the amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) of AD and fail to account for the multifactorial nature of the condition. By shedding light on the constraints of current experimental tools, this review aims to foster the development and implementation of more clinically relevant tools. While we do not rule out a role for preclinical models, we call for alternative approaches to be explored and, most importantly, for a re-evaluation of the ACH.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98739">Reproducible, data-driven characterization of sleep based on brain dynamics and transitions from whole-night fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the function of sleep requires studying the dynamics of brain activity across whole-night sleep and their transitions. However, current gold standard polysomnography (PSG) has limited spatial resolution to track brain activity. Additionally, previous fMRI studies were too short to capture full sleep stages and their cycling. To study whole-brain dynamics and transitions across whole-night sleep, we used an unsupervised learning approach, the Hidden Markov model (HMM), on two-night, 16 hr fMRI recordings of 12 non-sleep-deprived participants who reached all PSG-based sleep stages. This method identified 21 recurring brain states and their transition probabilities, beyond PSG-defined sleep stages. The HMM trained on one night accurately predicted the other, demonstrating unprecedented reproducibility. We also found functionally relevant subdivisions within rapid eye movement (REM) and within non-REM 2 stages. This study provides new insights into brain dynamics and transitions during sleep, aiding our understanding of sleep disorders that impact sleep transitions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95867">Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to study inflammation-induced aberrant calcium transient</a></h4>

              
                Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is commonly found in persons living with HIV (PLWH) even when antiretroviral therapy suppresses HIV viremia. However, studying this condition has been challenging because an appropriate animal model is not available. In this article, we studied calcium transient in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in culture to simulate the cardiomyocyte relaxation defect noted in PLWH and HFpEF and assess whether various drugs have an effect. We show that treatment of hiPSC-CMs with inflammatory cytokines (such as interferon-γ or TNF-α) impairs their Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum and that SGLT2 inhibitors, clinically proven as effective for HFpEF, reverse this effect. Additionally, treatment with mitochondrial antioxidants (like mito-Tempo) and certain antiretrovirals resulted in the reversal of the effects of these cytokines on calcium transient. Finally, incubation of hiPSC-CMs with serum from HIV patients with and without diastolic dysfunction did not alter their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-decay time, indicating that the exposure to the serum of these patients is not sufficient to induce the decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in vitro. Together, our results indicate that hiPSC-CMs can be used as a model to study molecular mechanisms of inflammation-mediated abnormal cardiomyocyte relaxation and screen for potential new interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96854">Task-dependent coarticulation of movement sequences</a></h4>

              
                Combining individual actions into sequences is a hallmark of everyday activities. Classical theories propose that the motor system forms a single specification of the sequence as a whole, leading to the coarticulation of the different elements. In contrast, recent neural recordings challenge this idea and suggest independent execution of each element specified separately. Here, we show that separate or coarticulated sequences can result from the same task-dependent controller, without implying different representations in the brain. Simulations show that planning for multiple reaches simultaneously allows separate or coarticulated sequences depending on instructions about intermediate goals. Human experiments in a two-reach sequence task validated this model. Furthermore, in co-articulated sequences, the second goal influenced long-latency stretch responses to external loads applied during the first reach, demonstrating the involvement of the sensorimotor network supporting fast feedback control. Overall, our study establishes a computational framework for sequence production that highlights the importance of feedback control in this essential motor skill.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Meditation induces changes in the nervous system, which presumably underpin positive psychological and physiological effects. Such neural changes include alterations in the arousal fluctuation, as well as in infraslow brain activity (ISA, &amp;amp;lt;0.1 Hz). Furthermore, it is known that fluctuations of arousal over time correlate with the oscillatory phase of ISA. However, whether this arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlation changes after meditation practices remains unanswered.; Methods: The present study aims to address this question by analyzing a publicly available electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset recorded during meditation sessions in the groups of experienced meditators and novices. The arousal fluctuation is measured by galvanic skin responses (GSR), and arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations are measured by phase synchronization between GSR and EEG ISAs.; Results: While both groups exhibit arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations, experienced meditators display higher correlations than novices. These increased arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations in experienced meditators manifest more clearly when oscillatory phase differences between GSR and EEG ISAs are either 0 or &amp;amp;pi; radians. As such, we further investigate the characteristics of these phase differences with respect to spatial distribution over the brain. We found that brain regions with the phase difference of either 0 or &amp;amp;pi; radians form distinct spatial clusters, and that these clusters are spatially correlated with functional organization estimated by the principal gradient, based on functional connectivity.; Conclusions: Since increased arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations reflect enhanced global organization of the central and autonomic nervous systems, our findings imply that the positive effects of meditation might be mediated by enhanced global organization of the nervous system.</p>

	<p>Introduction: This study investigates how traumatic injuries alter joint movements in the ankle and foot. We used a brain injury model in rats, focusing on the hippocampus between the CA1 and dentate gyrus. Materials and Methods: We assessed the dissimilarity factor (DF) and vertical displacement (VD) of the ankle and metatarsus joints before and after the hippocampal lesion. We analyzed joint movements in rats after the injury or in rats treated with resveratrol, exercise, or a combination of both. Results: Resveratrol facilitated the recovery of DF in both legs, showing improvements in the ankle and metatarsus joints on the third and seventh days post-injury. The hippocampal lesion affected VD in both legs, observed on the third or seventh day after the injury. Both exercise and resveratrol partially recovered VD in the ankle and metatarsus joints on these days. These effects may be linked to increased hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced neuroinflammation. Conclusions: The study highlights the benefits of resveratrol and exercise in motor recovery following brain injury, suggesting their potential to enhance the quality of life for patients with neurological disorders affecting motor function and locomotion. These findings also suggest that resveratrol could offer a promising or complementary alternative in managing chronic pain and inflammation associated with orthopedic conditions, thus improving overall patient management.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Research suggests that metalinguistic and cognitive/attentional-control processes are key variables in literacy development in young learners. Interactions between these variables are complex, and this complexity is increased in multilingual learners. With data on the interplay between metalinguistic and cognitive awareness, literacy, and multilingualism being scarce, it is far from clear how these variables interact and how they impact the individual child. This article sets out to shine some light on the interconnectedness and interactions between metalinguistic awareness, cognitive/executive functions, and (multilingual) literacy. Conclusions: We argue that the three dimensions are strongly correlated and that this correlation comes with important implications for language learning, language processing, and language development. However, the exact nature of these correlations is yet to be established.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease with progressive neurodegeneration, affecting both the cortical and the spinal component of the motor neuron circuitry in patients. The cellular and molecular basis of selective neuronal vulnerability is beginning to emerge. Yet, there are no effective cures for ALS, which affects more than 200,000 people worldwide each year. Recent studies highlight the importance of the glymphatic system and its proper function for the clearance of the cerebral spinal fluid, which is achieved mostly during the sleep period. Therefore, a potential link between problems with sleep and neurodegenerative diseases has been postulated. This paper discusses the present understanding of this potential correlation.</p>

	<p>Background: Perinatal infection is a major risk factor for diffuse white matter injury (dWMI), which remains the most common form of neurological disability among very preterm infants. The disease primarily targets oligodendrocytes (OL) lineage cells in the white matter but also involves injury and/or dysmaturation of neurons of the gray matter. This study aimed to investigate whether neuroinflammation preferentially affects the cellular compositions of the white matter or gray matter. Method: Neuroinflammation was initiated by intracerebral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rat pups at postnatal (P) day 5, and neurobiological and behavioral outcomes were assessed between P6 and P21. Results: LPS challenge rapidly activates microglia and astrocytes, which is associated with the inhibition of OL and neuron differentiation leading to myelination deficits. Specifically, neuroinflammation reduces the immature OLs but not progenitors and causes acute axonal injury (&amp;amp;beta;-amyloid precursor protein immunopositivity) and impaired dendritic maturation (reduced MAP2+ neural fiber density) in the cortical area at P7. Neuroinflammation also reduces the expression of doublecortin in the hippocampus, suggesting compromise in neurogenesis. Utilizing a battery of behavioral assessments, we found that LPS-exposed animals exhibited deficits in sensorimotor, neuromuscular, and cognitive domains. Conclusion: Our overall results indicate that neuroinflammation alone in the early postnatal period can produce cardinal neuropathological features of dWMI.</p>

	<p>Background: Hemodynamics during the growth process of cerebral aneurysms are incompletely understood. We developed a novel fluid&amp;amp;ndash;structure interaction analysis method for the identification of relevant scenarios of aneurysm onset. Method: This method integrates both fluid dynamics and structural mechanics, as well as their mutual interaction, for a comprehensive analysis. Patients with a single unruptured cerebral aneurysm were included. Results: Overall, three scenarios were identified. In scenario A, wall shear stress (WSS) was low, and the oscillatory shear index (OSI) was high in large areas within the region of aneurysm onset (RAO). In scenario B, the quantities indicated a reversed behavior, where WSS was high and OSI was low. In the last scenario C, a behavior in-between was found, with scenarios A and B coexisting simultaneously in the RAO. Structural mechanics demonstrated a similar but independent trend. Further, we analyzed the change in hemodynamics between the onset and a fully developed aneurysm. While scenarios A and C remained unchanged during aneurysm growth, 47% of aneurysms in scenario B changed into scenario A and 20% into scenario C. Conclusions: In conclusion, these findings suggest that WSS and the OSI are reciprocally regulated, and both low and high WSS/OSI conditions can lead to aneurysm onset.</p>

	<p>Background: Lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms are reported in more than 80% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), most commonly an overactive bladder (OAB). The relationship between brain white matter (WM) changes in MS and OAB symptoms is poorly understood. Objectives: We aim to evaluate (i) microstructural WM differences across MS patients (pwMS) with OAB symptoms, patients without LUT symptoms, and healthy subjects using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and (ii) associations between clinical OAB symptom scores and DTI indices. Methods: Twenty-nine female pwMS [mean age (SD) 43.3 years (9.4)], including seventeen with OAB [mean age (SD) 46.1 years (8.6)] and nine without LUT symptoms [mean age (SD) 37.5 years (8.9)], and fourteen healthy controls (HCs) [mean age (SD) 48.5 years (20)] were scanned in a 3T MRI with a DTI protocol. Additionally, clinical scans were performed for WM lesion segmentation. Group differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) were evaluated using tract-based spatial statistics. The Urinary Symptom Profile questionnaire assessed OAB severity. Results: A statistically significant reduction in FA (p = 0.004) was identified in microstructural WM in pwMS, compared with HCs. An inverse correlation was found between FA in frontal and parietal WM lobes and OAB scores (p = 0.021) in pwMS. Areas of lower FA, although this did not reach statistical significance, were found in both frontal lobes and the rest of the non-dominant hemisphere in pwMS with OAB compared with pwMS without LUT symptoms (p = 0.072). Conclusions: This study identified that lesions affecting different WM tracts in MS can result in OAB symptoms and demonstrated the role of the WM in the neural control of LUT functions. By using DTI, the association between OAB symptom severity and WM changes were identified, adding knowledge to the current LUT working model. As MS is predominantly a WM disease, these findings suggest that regional WM involvement, including of the anterior corona radiata, anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and superior frontal-occipital fasciculus and a non-dominant prevalence in WM, can result in OAB symptoms. OAB symptoms in MS correlate with anisotropy changes in different white matter tracts as demonstrated by DTI. Structural impairment in WM tracts plays an important role in LUT symptoms in MS.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by structural changes in the brain, including hippocampal atrophy, cortical thinning, amyloid plaques, and tau tangles. Due to the aging of the global population, the burden of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is expected to increase, making the exploration of non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical exercise, an urgent priority. Results: There is emerging evidence that regular physical exercise may mitigate the structural and functional declines associated with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis research is a promising area for further investigation. This system involves bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain. According to recent studies, the gut microbiome may influence brain health through modulating neuroinflammation, producing neuroactive compounds, and altering metabolic processes. Exercise has been shown to alter the composition of the gut microbiome, potentially impacting brain structure and function. In this review, we aim to synthesize current research on the relationship between physical exercise, structural brain changes in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. Conclusions: In this study, we will investigate whether changes in the gut microbiome induced by physical exercise can mediate its neuroprotective effects, offering new insights into the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. By integrating findings from neuroimaging studies, clinical trials, and microbiome research, this review will highlight potential mechanisms. It will also identify key gaps in the literature. This will pave the way for future research directions.</p>

	<p>Background: Long COVID-19 is an emerging chronic illness of significant public health concern due to a myriad of neuropsychiatric sequelae, including increased suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB). Methods: This review provides a concise synthesis of clinical evidence that points toward the dysfunction of astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the central nervous system, as a potential shared pathology between SI/SB and COVID-19. Results: Depression, a suicide risk factor, and SI/SB were both associated with reduced frequencies of various astrocyte subsets and complex proteomic/transcriptional changes of astrocyte-related markers in a brain-region-specific manner. Astrocyte-related circulating markers were increased in depressed subjects and, to a less consistent extent, in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, reactive astrocytosis was observed in subjects with SI/SB and those with COVID-19. Conclusions: Astrocyte dysfunctions occurred in depression, SI/SB, and COVID-19. Reactive-astrocyte-mediated loss of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) integrity and subsequent neuroinflammation&amp;amp;mdash;a factor previously linked to SI/SB development&amp;amp;mdash;might contribute to increased suicide in individuals with long COVID-19. As such, the formulation of new therapeutic strategies to restore astrocyte homeostasis, enhance BBB integrity, and mitigate neuroinflammation may reduce SI/SB-associated neuropsychiatric manifestations among long COVID-19 patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-788/v2?src=rss">Cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions (HEIs): A literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cheating and plagiarism have become serious problems in higher education institutions (HEIs). It affects educational quality as well as the reputation of higher education. The purpose of this study is to identify the most prevalent types of cheating and plagiarism, as well as the elements that contribute to cheating and plagiarism, and to present solutions to this recurring problem. This paper systematically reviews 45 articles published from 2018, to 2022, aligned with the PRISMA guidelines in the selection, filtering, and reporting of the papers. This review shows that factors such as increased pressure on students, poor academic integrity awareness, lack of up-to-date academic honor codes, and the unethical application of AI tools are prime contributing factors to cheating and plagiarism in HEIs. In a broader sense, all these factors are classified as individual, social, cultural, institutional, and technological factors that are responsible for this problem. This problem can be reduced by establishing ethical and moral development tutorials as well as formulating up-to-date honor codes considering AI tools. Furthermore, higher education institutions must develop anti-plagiarism detection software in order to detect plagiarism and aid students in improving academic writing and paraphrasing approaches. The findings of this systematic literature review provide useful insights for educators and policymakers to solve the complicated issue of cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1097/v1?src=rss">A high-throughput gene expression analysis software tool for developmental time series and gene signature analysis of human cardiomyocyte differentiation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Publicly available high-throughput gene expression data enable the investigation of biological processes by the scientific community. Although several bioinformatics tools offer methodologies for basic differential gene expression analysis, difficulties arise in the analysis of multiple sample groups comprising a developmental time series, especially when the identification and classification of unique gene expression patterns is the primary goal of the study. Data analysis using these tools requires programming experience, which limits the accessibility of these tools to the broader community. To streamline developmental time-series investigations, we created the Developmental Gene Expression Analysis (devGEA) tool. This environment can be implemented locally or via web browsers to expedite differential gene expression analysis. This tool provides gene signature determination methods that can classify differentially expressed genes based on their correlation with gene expression patterns. devGEA was used to characterize cardiac development gene expression signatures from high-throughput RNA-seq datasets profiling small-molecule directed cardiomyocyte differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell lines (hiPSCs). After pre-processing, discrete gene expression criteria-based expected changes were used to classify the genes into developmental signatures. Several cardiomyocyte differentiation markers and candidate cardiac genes representing different developmental signatures were experimentally validated using the GIBCOTM hiPSC line. This method was then compared to a gene signature correlation approach that classified expressed genes based on their degree of similarity with key cardiac developmental signatures representing the stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Therefore, devGEA provides a robust workflow for investigator-driven analysis of developmental time series, allowing for the identification of differentially expressed genes and gene signatures for extensive experimental investigation. We also introduced a method for classifying genes by their correlation with genes or developmental patterns of interest. Our correlation-based method takes advantage of a priori knowledge of an experiment and is conceptually simpler than unsupervised clustering approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-789/v2?src=rss">Occurrence of pathogenic yeast species in artisanal cheeses from Boyacá, Colombia, including fluconazole resistant isolates [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Candida lambica (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Candida krusei (24.4%), Candida kefyr (22.2%), Candida lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Candida guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, most isolates of C. lambica C. krusei, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

                Purpose This study aims to evaluate the changes in the sustainability of fiscal policies in South Africa and selected Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries by employing the Kalman filter and Markov switching model and further overcome the limitations of previous studies by considering the impact of previously neglected variables. Design/methodology/approach The paper utilizes regression analysis, the Kalman filter, and the Markov switching model. By analysing GDP data for SADC countries, regime shifts are estimated, and fiscal sustainability is evaluated. To enhance numerical adaptation, a random walk state space model is incorporated into the conventional Kalman filter. Originality and value This study significantly contributes to academia and the field of economics in South Africa by addressing previous research limitations on fiscal policy sustainability. It incorporates previously omitted variables and employs advanced estimation techniques, such as the random walk-based Kalman filter and Markov switching model, to provide a comprehensive understanding of fiscal sustainability in South Africa and selected SADC countries. The findings offer valuable recommendations for policymakers and government authorities, including the necessity of fiscal consolidation to reduce debt, adherence to specified borrowing ratios, and reforms to increase savings and overall fiscal sustainability in the SADC region. Findings The random walk-based Kalman filter exhibits superior numerical adaptation compared to the conventional approach. An analysis of normalized financial impacts reveals significant variations in fiscal sustainability among SADC countries and different GDP categories. Countries with higher GDPs generally exhibit greater financial sustainability, while those with lower GDPs face more challenges in this regard. Conclusion Advanced estimation techniques like the random walk-based Kalman filter and Markov switching model offer critical insights into fiscal sustainability in South Africa and the broader SADC region. They further provide a more accurate and comprehensive analysis, revealing significant variations in fiscal stability across different GDP categories.

                <p>by Ylva Katarina Wedmark, Jon Olav Vik, Ove Øyås</p>

The metabolic network of an organism can be analyzed as a constraint-based model. This analysis can be biased, optimizing an objective such as growth rate, or unbiased, aiming to describe the full feasible space of metabolic fluxes through pathway analysis or random flux sampling. In particular, pathway analysis can decompose the flux space into fundamental and formally defined metabolic pathways. Unbiased methods scale poorly with network size due to combinatorial explosion, but a promising approach to improve scalability is to focus on metabolic subnetworks, e.g., cells’ metabolite exchanges with each other and the environment, rather than the full metabolic networks. Here, we applied pathway enumeration and flux sampling to metabolite exchanges in microbial species and a microbial community, using models ranging from central carbon metabolism to genome-scale and focusing on pathway definitions that allow direct targeting of subnetworks such as metabolite exchanges (elementary conversion modes, elementary flux patterns, and minimal pathways). Enumerating growth-supporting metabolite exchanges, we found that metabolite exchanges from different pathway definitions were related through a hierarchy, and we show that this hierarchical relationship between pathways holds for metabolic networks and subnetworks more generally. Metabolite exchange frequencies, defined as the fraction of pathways in which each metabolite was exchanged, were similar across pathway definitions, with a few specific exchanges explaining large differences in pathway counts. This indicates that biological interpretation of predicted metabolite exchanges is robust to the choice of pathway definition, and it suggests strategies for more scalable pathway analysis.

                <p>by Elena Miu, Luke Rendell, Sam Bowles, Rob Boyd, Daniel Cownden, Magnus Enquist, Kimmo Eriksson, Marcus W. Feldman, Timothy Lillicrap, Richard McElreath, Stuart Murray, James Ounsley, Kevin N. Lala</p>

Social learning is common in nature, yet cumulative culture (where knowledge and technology increase in complexity and diversity over time) appears restricted to humans. To understand why, we organized a computer tournament in which programmed entries specified when to learn new knowledge and when to refine (i.e. improve) existing knowledge. The tournament revealed a ‘refinement paradox’: refined behavior afforded higher payoffs as individuals converged on a small number of successful behavioral variants, but refining did not generally pay. Paradoxically, entries that refined only in certain conditions did best during behavioral improvement, while simple copying entries thrived when refinement levels were high. Cumulative cultural evolution may be rare in part because sophisticated strategies for improving knowledge and technology are initially advantageous, yet complex culture, once achieved, favors conformity, blind imitation and hyper-credulity.

                <p>by Carlos Albors, Jordi Mill, Andy L. Olivares, Xavier Iriart, Hubert Cochet, Oscar Camara</p>

Left atrial appendage occlusion devices (LAAO) are a feasible alternative for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients at high risk of thromboembolic stroke and contraindication to antithrombotic therapies. However, optimal LAAO device configurations (i.e., size, type, location) remain unstandardized due to the large anatomical variability of the left atrial appendage (LAA) morphology, leading to a 4-6% incidence of device-related thrombus (DRT). In-silico simulations have the potential to assess DRT risk and identify the key factors, such as suboptimal device positioning. This work presents fluid simulation results computed on 20 patient-specific left atrial geometries, analysing different commercially available LAAO occluders, including plug-type and pacifier-type devices. In addition, we explored two distinct device positions: 1) the real post-LAAO intervention configuration derived from follow-up imaging; and 2) one covering the pulmonary ridge if it was not achieved during the implantation (13 out of 20). In total, 33 different configurations were analysed. In-silico indices indicating high risk of DRT (e.g., low blood flow velocities and flow complexity around the device) were combined with particle deposition analysis based on a discrete phase model. The obtained results revealed that covering the pulmonary ridge with the LAAO device may be one of the key factors to prevent DRT, resulting in higher velocities and reduced flow recirculations (e.g., mean velocities of 0.183 ± 0.12 m/s and 0.236 ± 0.16 m/s for uncovered versus covered positions in DRT patients). Moreover, disk-based devices exhibited enhanced adaptability to various LAA morphologies and, generally, demonstrated a lower risk of abnormal events after LAAO implantation.

Understanding perturbations in circulating lipid levels that often occur years or decades before clinical symptoms may enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide novel intervention opportunities. Here, we assessed if polygenic scores (PGSs) for complex traits could detect lipid dysfunctions related to the traits and provide new biological insights. We constructed genome-wide PGSs (approximately 1 million genetic variants) for 50 complex traits in 7,169 Finnish individuals with routine clinical lipid profiles and lipidomics measurements (179 lipid species). We identified 678 associations (<i>P</i> < 9.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) involving 26 traits and 142 lipids. Most of these associations were also validated with the actual phenotype measurements where available (89.5% of 181 associations where the trait was available), suggesting that these associations represent early signs of physiological changes of the traits. We detected many known relationships (e.g., PGS for body mass index (BMI) and lysophospholipids, PGS for type 2 diabetes and triacyglycerols) and those that suggested potential target for prevention strategies (e.g., PGS for venous thromboembolism and arachidonic acid). We also found association of PGS for favorable adiposity with increased sphingomyelins levels, suggesting a probable role of sphingomyelins in increased risk for certain disease, e.g., venous thromboembolism as reported previously, in favorable adiposity despite its favorable metabolic effect. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of lipidomic alterations in genetic predisposition for a wide range of complex traits. The study also demonstrates potential of PGSs for complex traits to capture early, presymptomatic lipid alterations, highlighting its utility in understanding disease mechanisms and early disease detection.

                <p>by Alexander Kroll, Nico Niebuhr, Gregory Butler, Martin J. Lercher</p>

Transport proteins play a crucial role in cellular metabolism and are central to many aspects of molecular biology and medicine. Determining the function of transport proteins experimentally is challenging, as they become unstable when isolated from cell membranes. Machine learning-based predictions could provide an efficient alternative. However, existing methods are limited to predicting a small number of specific substrates or broad transporter classes. These limitations stem partly from using small data sets for model training and a choice of input features that lack sufficient information about the prediction problem. Here, we present SPOT, the first general machine learning model that can successfully predict specific substrates for arbitrary transport proteins, achieving an accuracy above 92% on independent and diverse test data covering widely different transporters and a broad range of metabolites. SPOT uses Transformer Networks to represent transporters and substrates numerically. To overcome the problem of missing negative data for training, it augments a large data set of known transporter-substrate pairs with carefully sampled random molecules as non-substrates. SPOT not only predicts specific transporter-substrate pairs, but also outperforms previously published models designed to predict broad substrate classes for individual transport proteins. We provide a web server and Python function that allows users to explore the substrate scope of arbitrary transporters.

                <p>by Jobran Chebib, Anika Jonas, Eugenio López-Cortegano, Sven Künzel, Diethard Tautz, Peter D. Keightley</p>

Each generation, spontaneous mutations introduce heritable changes that tend to reduce fitness in populations of highly adapted living organisms. This erosion of fitness is countered by natural selection, which keeps deleterious mutations at low frequencies and ultimately removes most of them from the population. The classical way of studying the impact of spontaneous mutations is via mutation accumulation (MA) experiments, where lines of small effective population size are bred for many generations in conditions where natural selection is largely removed. Such experiments in microbes, invertebrates, and plants have generally demonstrated that fitness decays as a result of MA. However, the phenotypic consequences of MA in vertebrates are largely unknown, because no replicated MA experiment has previously been carried out. This gap in our knowledge is relevant for human populations, where societal changes have reduced the strength of natural selection, potentially allowing deleterious mutations to accumulate. Here, we study the impact of spontaneous MA on the mean and genetic variation for quantitative and fitness-related traits in the house mouse using the MA experimental design, with a cryopreserved control to account for environmental influences. We show that variation for morphological and life history traits accumulates at a sufficiently high rate to maintain genetic variation and selection response. Weight and tail length measures decrease significantly between 0.04% and 0.3% per generation with narrow confidence intervals. Fitness proxy measures (litter size and surviving offspring) decrease on average by about 0.2% per generation, but with confidence intervals overlapping zero. When extrapolated to humans, our results imply that the rate of fitness loss should not be of concern in the foreseeable future.

[version 2; peer review: 1 appr</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Restorative dental materials are defined as substances that are used to repair, replace, or enhance a patient’s teeth. Various materials used in paediatric dentistry are zinc oxide eugenol, glass ionomer cement, resin composite, calcium hydroxide, silver amalgam, giomers etc. GIC is a biocompatible material having a low thermal expansion coefficient and fluoride release property. There are still a few drawbacks of GICdue of their poor mechanical properties therefore addition of Silver Nanoparticles demonstrated improved mechanical and bactericidal capabilities. There hasn’t been much study on the quality of the bond contact between silver nanoparticles and dentin, as well as the color’s durability. Aim: To evaluate and compare the mechanical properties and bond strength of Glass ionomer cement reinforced with three different concentrations of silver nanoparticle as against conventional glass ionomer cement in primary Teeth. Materials and Method: Silver nanoparticles will be prepared using three chemicals namely, silver nitrate, sodium citrate and tannic acid. Traditional GIC (GC Fuji II, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) will be purchased. Three different concentrations of silver nanoparticles will be prepared i.e., 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6%. The GIC specimens will then be divided into 4 groups: GIC without silver nanoparticles (AgNPs),0.2%,0.4% and 0.6% AgNPs. Mechanical properties will be checked such as compressive, tensile, and bond strength using Universal Testing Machine. Expected Results: GIC reinforced with silver nano particles is expected to have better mechanical strength, less microleakage and wear resistance, greater fracture resistance and adhesive bond strength. Conclusion: GIC reinforced with silver nano particles will be expected to have better mechanical and physical properties than conventional Type II GICs and is expected to be a promising material for restoration in primary teeth.

                Background An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials. Narcissism refers to the personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behaviour, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of the influence of selfie-taking behavior and narcissism on oral health. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age. Step forward binary regression demonstrated a significant odds ratio for grandiose narcissism followed by selfie-taking behavior Conclusion This study revealed a correlation between perceived oral health and selfie-taking behaviour. Further studies are required to assess selfie-taking behaviour and oral health.

                Background The primary objective worldwide during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had been controlling disease transmission. However, lockdown measures used to mitigate transmission affected human behavior and altered lifestyles, with a likely impact on chronic non-communicable diseases. More than a year into the pandemic, substantial peer-reviewed literature emerged on altered lifestyles following the varying lockdown measures imposed globally to control the virus spread. We explored the impact of lockdown measures on six lifestyle factors, namely diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, social connectedness, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, or other harmful substances. Methods We comprehensively searched PubMed and the World Health Organization’s global literature database on COVID-19 and retrieved 649 relevant articles for the narrative review. A critical interpretative synthesis of the articles was performed. Results Most of the articles included in the review identified the negative effect of lockdown measures on each of the lifestyle factors in many parts of the world. Encouraging lifestyle trends were also highlighted in a few articles. Such trends can positively influence the outcome of lifestyle-related chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Conclusions The lockdown associated with COVID-19 has largely had a negative impact on the lifestyles of individuals and communities across many countries and cultures. However, some individuals and communities also initiated positive lifestyle-related behavioral changes. If the knowledge generated by studying the impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns on the six lifestyle factors is further consolidated, it could improve chronic disease outcomes. This will help better understand lifestyle behaviors amidst crises and assist in redesigning extreme public health measures such as lockdowns.. It is up to governments, communities, and healthcare/academic entities to derive benefit from lessons learned from the pandemic, with the ultimate objective of better educating and promoting healthy lifestyles among communities.

                Behçet’s disease (BD) is rare in children. Herein, we report a case of 12-year-old male child with a history of left superficial femoral vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary embolism, admitted for multiple thrombosis located in the inferior vena cava, right atrium and ventricle associated with multiple pulmonary artery aneurisms and fissurations concomitant to oral aphthosis, which was suggestive of BD. Despite corticoids and immunosuppressive therapy, the child had a massive hemoptysis resulting in his death. The association between intracardiac thrombosis, pulmonary aneurism and venous thrombosis should raise suspicion of angio-Behçet, which could be lethal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1094/v1?src=rss">Enhancing climate forecasting with AI: Current state and future prospect [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The escalating impact of climate change underscores the critical need for advanced and sustainable climate forecasting techniques. This review examines the current state and future prospects of leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for climate forecasting, focusing on enhancing accuracy and identifying complex patterns in large datasets. Methods A systematic bibliometric methodology was employed, analyzing peer-reviewed literature from the past two decades. The study screened 455 articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases using specific keywords related to AI and weather forecasting. After removing duplicates and irrelevant studies, 218 articles were selected for detailed analysis. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using RStudio software to examine publication trends, co-word co-occurrence, and thematic evolution. Results The findings indicate significant growth in AI applications for climate forecasting, particularly from 2014 to 2023. AI techniques such as machine learning, artificial neural networks, and deep learning have shown promise in improving the accuracy of weather forecasts and early warning systems. The thematic analysis identified key themes like numerical weather prediction, feature selection, and neural networks as fundamental areas of research. Additionally, AI-based early warning systems for extreme weather events were highlighted as a crucial application. Below Figure 1. shows the graphical abstract of research Conclusions AI has the potential to significantly enhance climate forecasting by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying complex patterns. Future research should focus on developing universal AI models, increasing model accuracy with explainable AI techniques, and integrating region-specific forecasts to aid decision-making in various sectors. Addressing ethical concerns and ensuring sustainable AI applications are essential for the responsible deployment of AI in climate forecasting.

                Background This study examines Muhammad Shahrur’s theory of limits and women’s issues. This theory adjusts the muhkamat verses to remain relevant to sociocultural conditions while remining within the jurisdiction of Allah SWT. Shahrur’s approach conveyed women as different from traditional ulemas and controversial. Therefore, it is necessary to describe Shahrur’s theory and interpretation of women’s issues. Methods This was an exploratory bibliographic study using descriptive-hermeneutic analysis. Two of Shahrur’s books were selected and five chapters from Al-Kitāb wa Al-Qur’ān, Qirā’ah Mu’āshirah and five chapters from Nahw Ushūl al-Jadīdah Li al-Fiqh al-Islāmy; Fiqh al-Mar’ah . Results Shahrur’s interpretations on women’s issues are: a) relationships between teenagers of the opposite sex without marriage or living together are “halal” if they follow their will without a contract and are accompanied by syecih, or permission; b) the maximum limit of the hijab is to cover the entire body except the face and palms. In contrast, the minimum limit covers the juyūb, including cleavage under the armpits, body parts, genitals, and buttocks. Apart from these, it does not include intimate parts and adapts to the community. c) Women’s intimate parts are shown only to the seven groups: brothers, fathers, children of a sibling, parents of one’s wives, and their children; d) Polygamy has both an upper limit and a lower limit. Shahrur allows polygamy under two conditions: widows with children whose husbands left them to protect them; polygamy has two limitations: a limit for quantity and a limit for quality; and e) the law of adultery has a lower and upper limit. Conclusion According to Shahrur, women’s issues are divided into four limits: sometimes they are at the upper limit and sometimes at the lower limit. Shahrur’s linguistic approach finally led him to draw the conclusion that the product of Islamic law is highly dependent on the sociocultural context.

                Hydatidosis is a pathology that is still common. Hydatid cysts commonly involves the liver and lung. Cases of multi visceral echinococcosis with atypical localization are rare. We, herein, report the case of a 53-year-old Maghrebi farmer with multiple organ hydatidosis including 13 hydatid cysts involving the lungs, the liver, the left heart ventricle, the left kidney, the abdomen cavity, the muscles (psoas, adductors), and the subcutaneous gluteal area. The majority of these cysts were already treated surgically, and some of them were due to be removed.

                Background Haematological abnormalities following renal transplantation are frequently observed and have a significant effect on survival and graft outcomes. The pattern of haematological abnormalities varies globally. Few studies have been conducted in Asian countries. We aimed to evaluate the patterns of haematological abnormalities in post-transplant recipients in our center during the first year after post-renal transplant and the association of post-transplant anemia with graft function. Methods This single-center retrospective study was conducted on renal transplantation recipients between 2014 and 2019. The study included all patients who received kidney transplants from live/cadaveric donors and had follow-up data collected up to 12 months after the transplant. The outcome studied was the prevalence of haematological abnormalities and the association between post-transplant anemia (PTA) and graft function in post-transplant recipients. Results A total of 106 renal transplant recipients were included in the study. The prevalence of PTA was 98% in the first week, 75% at one month, 35% at three months, 32% at six months, and 27% at 12 months. The other cytopenia cases were leukopenia (43.4%), thrombocytopenia (33.2%), and pancytopenia (15.1%). Post-transplant erythrocytosis was observed in 17.9% of patients. 18 patients with severe PTA in the first week of transplant had significant allograft dysfunction (p=0.04). Patients with and without PTA had similar graft functions at six and 12 months (p=0.50). Conclusions Haematological abnormalities are common in renal transplant recipients. PTA is highly prevalent during the first week and improves over time. Other haematological abnormalities observed were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and post-transplant erythrocytosis. Leucopenia was primarily drug-induced, and thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia were frequently caused by infections in our cohort. Additionally, severe PTA was significantly associated with graft dysfunction in the first week post-transplant, whereas similar graft function was observed at 6 and 12 months post-transplant, irrespective of the presence or absence of PTA.

                Introduction: The COVID-19 virus has impacted people worldwide, causing significant changes in their lifestyles. Since the emergence of the epidemic, attempts have begun to prepare a vaccine that can eliminate the virus and restore balance to life in the entire world. Over the past two years, countries and specialized companies have competed to obtain a license from the World Health Organization for the vaccines that were discovered. After the appearance of vaccines in the health community, comparisons and fears of their side effects began, but people don’t get an answer to the question of which is the best vaccine. Methods: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, the New England Journal of Medicine, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases were searched for literature on the COVID-19 vaccine and its side effects. we surveyed the literature on the COVID-19 vaccine’s side effects and the sorts of side effects observed after vaccination. Depending on data from the literature, we compared these vaccines in terms of side effects, then we analyzed the gaps and obstacles of previous studies and made proposals to process these gaps in future studies. Results: Overall, 17 studies were included in this scoping systematic review as they fulfilled the criteria specified, the majority of which were cross-sectional and retrospective cross-sectional studies. Most of the side effects were mild, self-limiting, and common. Thus, they usually resolve within 1–3 days after vaccination. Factors associated with higher side effects included advanced age, allergic conditions, those taking other medications (particularly immunosuppressive ones), those with a history of type II diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, COVID-19 infection, and female sex. Our meta‐analyses also found that mRNA vaccines looked to be more effective, while inactivated vaccinations had fewer side effects. Conclusion: This review shows that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe to administer and induces protection.
