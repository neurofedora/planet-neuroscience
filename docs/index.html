	<p>The corticocortical vestibular network (CVN) plays an important role in maintaining balance and stability. In order to clarify the specific relationship between the CVN and the balance ability of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we recruited 30 MCI patients in the community. According to age and sex, they were 1:1 matched to 30 older adults with normal cognitive function. We evaluated balance ability and performed MRI scanning in the two groups of participants. We analyzed functional connectivity within the CVN based on the region of interest. Then, we performed a Pearson correlation analysis between the functional connection and the Berg Balance Scale scores. The research results show that compared with the control group, there were three pairs of functional connections (hMST_R&amp;amp;ndash;Premotor_R, PFcm_R&amp;amp;ndash;SMA_L, and hMST_L&amp;amp;ndash;VIP_R) that were significantly decreased in the CVNs of the MCI group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Further correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between hMST_R&amp;amp;ndash;Premotor_R functional connectivity and BBS score (r = 0.364, p = 0.004). The decline in balance ability and increase in fall risk in patients with MCI may be closely related to the change in the internal connection mode of the corticocortical vestibular network.</p>

	<p>Background: Monitoring the depth of anesthesia by electroencephalogram (EEG) based on the prefrontal cortex is an important means to achieve accurate regulation of anesthesia for subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) under general anesthesia in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). However, no previous study has conducted an in-depth investigation into this monitoring data. Here, we aimed to analyze the characteristics of prefrontal cortex EEG during DBS with propofol general anesthesia in patients with PD and determine the reference range of parameters derived from the depth of anesthesia monitoring. Additionally, we attempted to explore whether the use of benzodiazepines in the 3 days during hospitalization before surgery impacted the interpretation of the EEG parameters. Materials and Methods: We included the data of 43 patients with PD who received STN DBS treatment and SedLine monitoring during the entire course of general anesthesia with propofol in a single center. Eighteen patients (41.86%) took benzodiazepines during hospitalization. We divided the anesthesia process into three stages: awake state before anesthesia, propofol anesthesia state, and shallow anesthesia state during microelectrode recording (MER). We analyzed the power spectral density (PSD) and derived parameters of the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; prefrontal EEG, including the patient state index (PSI), spectral edge frequency (SEF) of the left and right sides, and the suppression ratio. The baseline characteristics, preoperative medication, preoperative frontal lobe image characteristics, preoperative motor and non-motor evaluation, intraoperative vital signs, internal environment and anesthetic information, and postoperative complications are listed. We also compared the groups according to whether they took benzodiazepines before surgery during hospitalization. Results: The average PSI of the awake state, propofol anesthesia state, and MER state were 89.86 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.89, 48.68 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.65, and 62.46 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.08, respectively. The preoperative administration of benzodiazepines did not significantly affect the PSI or SEF, but did reduce the total time of suppression, maximum suppression ratio, and the PSD of beta and gamma during MER. Regarding the occurrence of postoperative delirium and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, there was no significant difference between the two groups (chi-square test, p = 0.48; Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test, p = 0.30). Conclusion: For the first time, we demonstrate the reference range of the derived parameters of the depth of anesthesia monitoring and the characteristics of the prefrontal EEG of patients with PD in the awake state, propofol anesthesia state, and shallow anesthesia during MER. Taking benzodiazepines in the 3 days during hospitalization before surgery reduces suppression and the PSD of beta and gamma during MER, but does not significantly affect the observation of anesthesiologists on the depth of anesthesia, nor affect the postoperative delirium and MMSE scores.</p>

	<p>The investigation of the perception of others&amp;amp;rsquo; actions and underlying neural mechanisms has been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive stimulus set covering the human behavioral repertoire. To fill this void, we present a video set showing 100 human actions recorded in natural settings, covering the human repertoire except for emotion-driven (e.g., sexual) actions and those involving implements (e.g., tools). We validated the set using fMRI and showed that observation of the 100 actions activated the well-established action observation network. We also quantified the videos&amp;amp;rsquo; low-level visual features (luminance, optic flow, and edges). Thus, this comprehensive video set is a valuable resource for perceptual and neuronal studies.</p>

	<p>Cholinergic muscarinic stimulation of vast areas of the limbic brain induced a well-documented polydipsia in laboratory rats. This excessive water-drinking behavior has not received any convincing biological and physiological interpretation for the last 50 years. This review offers such an interpretation and suggests that cholinergically induced drinking response, mostly by carbachol, is associated with activation of the ascending mesolimbic cholinergic system that serves for initiation of emotional aversive arousal of the organism. The ascending cholinergic system originates from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, has a diffuse nature, and affects numerous subcortical limbic structures. It is proposed that the carbachol-induced drinking response is related to the state of anxiety and does not serve the regulation of thirst. Instead, the response is anxiety-induced polydipsia that might occur as a soothing procedure that decreases the aversiveness of the negative emotional state induced by carbachol. It is concluded that carbachol-induced water-drinking behavior is a rewarding process that contributes to alleviating the feeling of anxiety by bringing some relief from the cholinergically induced aversive state, and it is a homologue to anxiety-driven polydipsia in humans.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is composed of various subregions: CA1, CA2, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG). Despite the abundant hippocampal research literature, until recently, CA2 received little attention. The development of new genetic and physiological tools allowed recent studies characterizing the unique properties and functional roles of this hippocampal subregion. Despite its small size, the cellular content of CA2 is heterogeneous at the molecular and physiological levels. CA2 has been heavily implicated in social behaviors, including social memory. More generally, the mechanisms by which the hippocampus is involved in memory include the reactivation of neuronal ensembles following experience. This process is coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). Recent evidence suggests that CA2 plays an important role in the generation of SWRs. The unique connectivity and physiological properties of CA2 pyramidal cells make this region a computational hub at the core of hippocampal information processing. Here, we review recent findings that support the role of CA2 in coordinating hippocampal network dynamics from a systems neuroscience perspective.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mature parvalbumin interneuron function in prefrontal cortex requires activity during a postnatal sensitive period</a></h4>

              
                In their seminal findings, Hubel and Wiesel identified sensitive periods in which experience can exert lasting effects on adult visual cortical functioning and behavior via transient changes in neuronal activity during development. Whether comparable sensitive periods exist for non-sensory cortices, such as the prefrontal cortex, in which alterations in activity determine adult circuit function and behavior is still an active area of research. Here, using mice we demonstrate that inhibition of prefrontal parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons during the juvenile and adolescent period, results in <i>persistent</i> impairments in adult prefrontal circuit connectivity, in vivo network function, and behavioral flexibility that can be reversed by targeted activation of PV interneurons in adulthood. In contrast, reversible suppression of PV interneuron activity in adulthood produces no lasting effects. These findings identify an activity-dependent sensitive period for prefrontal circuit maturation and highlight how abnormal PV interneuron activity during development alters adult prefrontal circuit function and cognitive behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep learning-driven insights into super protein complexes for outer membrane protein biogenesis in bacteria</a></h4>

              
                To reach their final destinations, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of gram-negative bacteria undertake an eventful journey beginning in the cytosol. Multiple molecular machines, chaperones, proteases, and other enzymes facilitate the translocation and assembly of OMPs. These helpers usually associate, often transiently, forming large protein assemblies. They are not well understood due to experimental challenges in capturing and characterizing protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially transient ones. Using AF2Complex, we introduce a high-throughput, deep learning pipeline to identify PPIs within the <i>Escherichia coli</i> cell envelope and apply it to several proteins from an OMP biogenesis pathway. Among the top confident hits obtained from screening ~1500 envelope proteins, we find not only expected interactions but also unexpected ones with profound implications. Subsequently, we predict atomic structures for these protein complexes. These structures, typically of high confidence, explain experimental observations and lead to mechanistic hypotheses for how a chaperone assists a nascent, precursor OMP emerging from a translocon, how another chaperone prevents it from aggregating and docks to a β-barrel assembly port, and how a protease performs quality control. This work presents a general strategy for investigating biological pathways by using structural insights gained from deep learning-based predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A choline-releasing glycerophosphodiesterase essential for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and blood stage development in the malaria parasite</a></h4>

              
                The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum synthesizes significant amounts of phospholipids to meet the demands of replication within red blood cells. De novo phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis via the Kennedy pathway is essential, requiring choline that is primarily sourced from host serum lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). LysoPC also acts as an environmental sensor to regulate parasite sexual differentiation. Despite these critical roles for host lysoPC, the enzyme(s) involved in its breakdown to free choline for PC synthesis are unknown. Here we show that a parasite glycerophosphodiesterase (PfGDPD) is indispensable for blood stage parasite proliferation. Exogenous choline rescues growth of PfGDPD-null parasites, directly linking PfGDPD function to choline incorporation. Genetic ablation of PfGDPD reduces choline uptake from lysoPC, resulting in depletion of several PC species in the parasite, whilst purified PfGDPD releases choline from glycerophosphocholine in vitro. Our results identify PfGDPD as a choline-releasing glycerophosphodiesterase that mediates a critical step in PC biosynthesis and parasite survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Computational design of peptides to target NaV1.7 channel with high potency and selectivity for the treatment of pain</a></h4>

              
                The voltage-gated sodium Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channel plays a key role as a mediator of action potential propagation in C-fiber nociceptors and is an established molecular target for pain therapy. ProTx-II is a potent and moderately selective peptide toxin from tarantula venom that inhibits human Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 activation. Here we used available structural and experimental data to guide Rosetta design of potent and selective ProTx-II-based peptide inhibitors of human Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels. Functional testing of designed peptides using electrophysiology identified the PTx2-3127 and PTx2-3258 peptides with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 7 nM and 4 nM for hNa<sub>V</sub>1.7 and more than 1,000-fold selectivity over human Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 channels. PTx2-3127 inhibits Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 currents in mouse and human sensory neurons and shows efficacy in rat models of chronic and thermal pain when administered intrathecally. Rationally-designed peptide inhibitors of human Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels have transformative potential to define a new class of biologics to treat pain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fiber-specific structural properties relate to reading skills in children and adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that the cross-sectional relationship between reading skills and white matter microstructure, as indexed by fractional anisotropy, is not as robust as previously thought. Fixel-based analyses yield fiber-specific micro- and macrostructural measures, overcoming several shortcomings of the traditional diffusion tensor model. We ran a whole-brain analysis investigating whether the product of fiber density and cross-section (FDC) related to single-word reading skills in a large, open, quality-controlled data set of 983 children and adolescents ages 6-18. We also compared FDC between participants with (n = 102) and without (n = 570) reading disabilities. We found that FDC positively related to reading skills throughout the brain, especially in left temporoparietal and cerebellar white matter, but did not differ between reading proficiency groups. Exploratory analyses revealed that among metrics from other diffusion models - DTI, DKI, and NODDI - only the orientation dispersion and neurite density indexes from NODDI were associated (inversely) with reading skills. The present findings further support the importance of left-hemisphere dorsal temporoparietal white matter tracts in reading. Additionally, these results suggest future DWI studies of reading and dyslexia should be designed to benefit from advanced diffusion models, include cerebellar coverage, and consider continuous analyses that account for individual differences in reading skill.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ultrastructural effects of sleep and wake on the parallel fiber synapses of the cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                Multiple evidence in rodents shows that the strength of excitatory synapses in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus is greater after wake than after sleep. The widespread synaptic weakening afforded by sleep is believed to keep the cost of synaptic activity under control, promote memory consolidation, and prevent synaptic saturation, thus preserving the brain’s ability to learn day after day. The cerebellum is highly plastic and the Purkinje cells, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, are endowed with a staggering number of excitatory parallel fiber synapses. However, whether these synapses are affected by sleep and wake is unknown. Here, we used serial block face scanning electron microscopy to obtain the full 3D reconstruction of more than 7000 spines and their parallel fiber synapses in the mouse posterior vermis. This analysis was done in mice whose cortical and hippocampal synapses were previously measured, revealing that average synaptic size was lower after sleep compared to wake with no major changes in synapse number. Here, instead, we find that while the average size of parallel fiber synapses does not change, the number of branched synapses is reduced in half after sleep compared to after wake, corresponding to ~16% of all spines after wake and ~8% after sleep. Branched synapses are harbored by two or more spines sharing the same neck and, as also shown here, are almost always contacted by different parallel fibers. These findings suggest that during wake, coincidences of firing over parallel fibers may translate into the formation of synapses converging on the same branched spine, which may be especially effective in driving Purkinje cells to fire. By contrast, sleep may promote the off-line pruning of branched synapses that were formed due to spurious coincidences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lack of evidence for increased transcriptional noise in aged tissues</a></h4>

              
                Aging is often associated with a loss of cell type identity that results in an increase in transcriptional noise in aged tissues. If this phenomenon reflects a fundamental property of aging remains an open question. Transcriptional changes at the cellular level are best detected by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). However, the diverse computational methods used for the quantification of age-related loss of cellular identity have prevented reaching meaningful conclusions by direct comparison of existing scRNAseq datasets. To address these issues we created Decibel, a Python toolkit that implements side-to-side four commonly used methods for the quantification of age-related transcriptional noise in scRNAseq data. Additionally, we developed Scallop, a novel computational method for the quantification of membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster. Cells with a greater Scallop membership score are transcriptionally more stable. Application of these computational tools to seven aging datasets showed large variability between tissues and datasets, suggesting that increased transcriptional noise is not a universal hallmark of aging. To understand the source of apparent loss of cell type identity associated with aging, we analyzed cell type-specific changes in transcriptional noise and the changes in cell type composition of the mammalian lung. No robust pattern of cell type-specific transcriptional noise alteration was found across aging lung datasets. In contrast, age-associated changes in cell type composition of the lung were consistently found, particularly of immune cells. These results suggest that claims of increased transcriptional noise of aged tissues should be reformulated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Maximizing CRISPRi efficacy and accessibility with dual-sgRNA libraries and optimal effectors</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) enables programmable, reversible, and titratable repression of gene expression (knockdown) in mammalian cells. Initial CRISPRi-mediated genetic screens have showcased the potential to address basic questions in cell biology, genetics, and biotechnology, but wider deployment of CRISPRi screening has been constrained by the large size of single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries and challenges in generating cell models with consistent CRISPRi-mediated knockdown. Here, we present next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA libraries and effector expression constructs that enable strong and consistent knockdown across mammalian cell models. First, we combine empirical sgRNA selection with a dual-sgRNA library design to generate an ultra-compact (1-3 elements per gene), highly active CRISPRi sgRNA library. Next, we compare CRISPRi effectors to show that the recently published Zim3-dCas9 provides an excellent balance between strong on-target knockdown and minimal nonspecific effects on cell growth or the transcriptome. Finally, we engineer a suite of cell lines with stable expression of Zim3-dCas9 and robust on-target knockdown. Our results and publicly available reagents establish best practices for CRISPRi genetic screening.

                The coadaptation or genetic coupling of senders and receivers of sex signals in some animals has been described, but no empirical evidence shows whether sex pheromones and their receptors undergo coadaptation in mammals. In this study of the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), we found markedly higher levels of two predominant male pheromones (2-heptanone and MUP13) in the North China subspecies [R. n. humiliatus (RNH)] than in the Northeast China subspecies [R. n. caraco (RNC)] by gas or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Coincidently, two vomeronasal receptor genes (Vom1r68 and Vom2r53) were found to be expressed at higher levels in RNH females than in RNC females and were thus considered candidate receptors for 2-heptanone and MUP13, respectively. An immunofluorescence analysis showed that these two VR receptors colocalized with mTmG on the membrane of HEK293-T cells. We also verified the responsiveness of Vom1r68 to 2-heptanone and Vom2r53 to MUP13 in HEK293-T cells by calcium imaging. In conclusion, we screened and identified the receptors of two pheromones based on the coadaptation of pheromones and their receptors, which further verified their coevolution.

	<p>Activated microglia potentially cause neurodegeneration in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD, but the modulator of microglial release of MMP-9 remains obscure. Given the modulatory effect of chloride intracellular channel protein 2 (CLIC2) on MMPs, we aimed to determine the role of CLIC2 in regulating microglial MMP expression and activation. We found that CLIC2 is expressed in microglia and neurons in rat brain tissue and focused on the function of CLIC2 in primary cultured microglia. Exposure to recombinant CLIC2 protein enhanced microglial invasion activity, and its knockdown abolished this activity. Moreover, increased activation of MMP-9 was confirmed by the addition of the CLIC2 protein, and CLIC2 knockdown eliminated this activation. Additionally, increased expression of CLIC2 was observed in PD-modeled tissue. In conclusion, CLIC2 increases MMP-9 activity in the microglia, which are involved in PD pathogenesis.</p>

	<p>Objective: To compare established clinical outcome assessments for predicting behind the wheel driving readiness and driving simulator results across age groups and in traumatic brain injury. Methods: Participants included adults who had a traumatic brain injury ranging in age from 31 to 57 years and a non-impaired adult population ranging in age from 18 to 80 years. Physical and cognitive outcomes measures were collected included range of motion and coordination, a &amp;amp;ldquo;Rules of the Road Test&amp;amp;rdquo; a &amp;amp;ldquo;Sign Identification Test,&amp;amp;rdquo; Trails A and B, and the clock drawing test. Visual measures included the Dynavision D2 system and motor-free visual perceptual test-3 (MVPT-3). Finally, the driving simulators (STI&amp;amp;Ograve; version M300) metro drive assessment was used, which consisted of negotiating several obstacles in a metropolitan area including vehicles abruptly changing lanes, pedestrians crossing streets, and negotiating construction zones. Results: Our findings suggest that the standard paper-pencil cognitive assessments and sign identification test significantly differentiate TBI from a non-impaired population (Trails A, B and Clock drawing test p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). While the driving simulator did not show as many robust differences with age, the TBI population did have a significantly greater number of road collisions (F3, 78 = 3.5, p = 0.02). We also observed a significant correlation between the cognitive assessments and the simulator variables. Conclusions: Paper-pencil cognitive assessments and the sign identification test highlight greater differences than the STI Driving Simulator between non-impaired and TBI populations. However, the driving simulator may be useful in assessing cognitive ability and training for on the road driving.</p>

	<p>Increasing evidence shows that children with Communication Disorders (CDs) may show gross, fine, and visual-motor difficulties compared to children with typical development. Accordingly, the present study aims to characterize gross, fine and visual-motor skills in children with CDs, distinguishing children with CDs into three subgroups, i.e., with Language Disorders (LD), Speech Sound Disorders (SSD), and LD+SSD. In Experiment 1, around 60% of children with CDs (4 to 7 years; 21 with LD, 36 with SSD, and 90 with LD+SSD) showed clinical/borderline scores in balance skills, regardless of the type of communication deficit. However, children with LD, SSD, and LD+SSD did not differ in gross and fine motor skills. In Experiment 2, a higher percentage of children with CDs (4 to 7 years; 34 with LD, 62 with SSD, 148 with LD+SSD) obtained clinical/borderline scores in Visual Perception skills. Moreover, children with LD+SSD performed significantly worsen in Visual Perception and Fine Motor Coordination skills compared to children with SSD only. Our results underlined that CDs are generally associated with gross motor difficulties and that visual-motor difficulties are related to the type of communication deficit. Paying earlier attention to the motor skills of children with CDs could help clinicians design effective interventions.</p>

	<p>This study explored how working memory resources contributed to reading comprehension using tasks that focused on maintenance of verbal information in the phonological store, the interaction between the central executive and the phonological store (WMI), and the storage of bound semantic content in the episodic buffer (immediate narrative memory). We analysed how performance in these tasks was related to text decoding (reading speed and accuracy), listening and reading comprehension. The participants were 62 monolingual and 36 bilingual children (mean age nine years, SD = 9 months) enrolled in the same Italian primary school. Bilingual children were born to immigrant parents and had a long history of exposure to Italian as a second language. The regression analyses showed that reading accuracy and listening comprehension were associated with reading comprehension for monolingual and bilingual children. Two working memory components&amp;amp;mdash;WMI and immediate narrative memory&amp;amp;mdash;exhibited indirect effects on reading comprehension through reading accuracy and listening comprehension, respectively. Such effects occurred only for monolingual children. We discuss the implications of such findings for text reading and comprehension in monolinguals and bilinguals.</p>

	<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the brain activity of a group of people can be used to forecast choices at the population level. In this study, we attempted to neuroforecast aggregate consumer behavior of Internet users. During our electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking study, participants were exposed to 10 banners that were also used in the real digital marketing campaign. In the separate online study, we additionally collected self-reported preferences for the same banners. We explored the relationship between the EEG, eye-tracking, and behavioral indexes obtained in our studies and the banners&amp;amp;rsquo; aggregate efficiency provided by the large food retailer based on the decisions of 291,301 Internet users. An EEG-based engagement index (central beta/alpha ratio) significantly correlated with the aggregate efficiency of banners. Furthermore, our multiple linear regression models showed that a combination of eye-tracking, EEG and behavioral measurements better explained the market-level efficiency of banner advertisements than each measurement alone. Overall, our results confirm that neural signals of a relatively small number of individuals can forecast aggregate behavior at the population level.</p>

	<p>Brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs) are becoming more popular in the neurological rehabilitation field, and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) is a type of brain oscillation rhythm that can be captured and analyzed in BCIs. Previous reviews have testified to the efficacy of the BCIs, but seldom have they discussed the motor task adopted in BCIs experiments in detail, as well as whether the feedback is suitable for them. We focused on the motor tasks adopted in SMR-based BCIs, as well as the corresponding feedback, and searched articles in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and Scopus and found 442 articles. After a series of screenings, 15 randomized controlled studies were eligible for analysis. We found motor imagery (MI) or motor attempt (MA) are common experimental paradigms in EEG-based BCIs trials. Imagining/attempting to grasp and extend the fingers is the most common, and there were multi-joint movements, including wrist, elbow, and shoulder. There were various types of feedback in MI or MA tasks for hand grasping and extension. Proprioception was used more frequently in a variety of forms. Orthosis, robot, exoskeleton, and functional electrical stimulation can assist the paretic limb movement, and visual feedback can be used as primary feedback or combined forms. However, during the recovery process, there are many bottleneck problems for hand recovery, such as flaccid paralysis or opening the fingers. In practice, we should mainly focus on patients&amp;amp;rsquo; difficulties, and design one or more motor tasks for patients, with the assistance of the robot, FES, or other combined feedback, to help them to complete a grasp, finger extension, thumb opposition, or other motion. Future research should focus on neurophysiological changes and functional improvements and further elaboration on the changes in neurophysiology during the recovery of motor function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of Retinogeniculate Synaptic Function in the DBA/2J Mouse Model of Glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons comprise the optic nerve and carry information to the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which is then relayed to the cortex for conscious vision. Glaucoma is a blinding neurodegenerative disease that commonly results from intraocular pressure (IOP)-associated injury leading to RGC axonal pathology, disruption of RGC outputs to the brain, and eventual apoptotic loss of RGC somata. The consequences of elevated IOP and glaucomatous pathology on RGC signaling to the dLGN are largely unknown yet are likely to contribute to vision loss. Here, we used anatomic and physiological approaches to study the structure and function of retinogeniculate (RG) synapses in male and female DBA/2J (D2) mice with inherited glaucoma before and after IOP elevation. D2 mice showed progressive loss of anterograde optic tract transport to the dLGN and vGlut2 labeling of RGC axon terminals while patch-clamp measurements of RG synaptic function showed that synaptic transmission was reduced in 9-month and 12-month D2 mice because of the loss of individual RGC axon inputs. TC neuron dendrites had reduced Sholl complexity at 12 months, suggestive of delayed reorganization following reduced synaptic input. There was no detectable change in RGC density in 11- to 12-month D2 retinas, quantified as the number of ganglion cell layer-residing somata immuno-positive for NeuN and immuno-negative for the amacrine marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Thus, observed synaptic defects appear to precede RGC somatic loss. These findings identify glaucoma-associated and IOP-associated deficits in an important subcortical RGC projection target, shedding light on processes linking IOP to vision loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Robust and brain-like working memory through short-term synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leo Kozachkov, John Tauber, Mikael Lundqvist, Scott L. Brincat, Jean-Jacques Slotine, Earl K. Miller</p>

Working memory has long been thought to arise from sustained spiking/attractor dynamics. However, recent work has suggested that short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) may help maintain attractor states over gaps in time with little or no spiking. To determine if STSP endows additional functional advantages, we trained artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with and without STSP to perform an object working memory task. We found that RNNs with and without STSP were able to maintain memories despite distractors presented in the middle of the memory delay. However, RNNs with STSP showed activity that was similar to that seen in the cortex of a non-human primate (NHP) performing the same task. By contrast, RNNs without STSP showed activity that was less brain-like. Further, RNNs with STSP were more robust to network degradation than RNNs without STSP. These results show that STSP can not only help maintain working memories, it also makes neural networks more robust and brain-like.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian inference of multi-point macromolecular architecture mixtures at nanometre resolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter A. Embacher, Tsvetelina E. Germanova, Emanuele Roscioli, Andrew D. McAinsh, Nigel J. Burroughs</p>

Gaussian spot fitting methods have significantly extended the spatial range where fluorescent microscopy can be used, with recent techniques approaching nanometre (nm) resolutions. However, small inter-fluorophore distances are systematically over-estimated for typical molecular scales. This bias can be corrected computationally, but current algorithms are limited to correcting distances between pairs of fluorophores. Here we present a flexible Bayesian computational approach that infers the distances and angles between multiple fluorophores and has several advantages over these previous methods. Specifically it improves confidence intervals for small lengths, estimates measurement errors of each fluorophore individually and infers the correlations between polygon lengths. The latter is essential for determining the full multi-fluorophore 3D architecture. We further developed the algorithm to infer the mixture composition of a heterogeneous population of multiple polygon states. We use our algorithm to analyse the 3D architecture of the human kinetochore, a macro-molecular complex that is essential for high fidelity chromosome segregation during cell division. Using triple fluorophore image data we unravel the mixture of kinetochore states during human mitosis, inferring the conformation of microtubule attached and unattached kinetochores and their proportions across mitosis. We demonstrate that the attachment conformation correlates with intersister tension and sister alignment to the metaphase plate.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fine-scale diversity of microbial communities due to satellite niches in boom and bust environments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yulia Fridman, Zihan Wang, Sergei Maslov, Akshit Goyal</p>

Recent observations have revealed that closely related strains of the same microbial species can stably coexist in natural and laboratory settings subject to boom and bust dynamics and serial dilutions, respectively. However, the possible mechanisms enabling the coexistence of only a handful of strains, but not more, have thus far remained unknown. Here, using a consumer-resource model of microbial ecosystems, we propose that by differentiating along Monod parameters characterizing microbial growth rates in high and low nutrient conditions, strains can coexist in patterns similar to those observed. In our model, boom and bust environments create satellite niches due to resource concentrations varying in time. These satellite niches can be occupied by closely related strains, thereby enabling their coexistence. We demonstrate that this result is valid even in complex environments consisting of multiple resources and species. In these complex communities, each species partitions resources differently and creates separate sets of satellite niches for their own strains. While there is no theoretical limit to the number of coexisting strains, in our simulations, we always find between 1 and 3 strains coexisting, consistent with known experiments and observations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic causal modelling shows a prominent role of local inhibition in alpha power modulation in higher visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frederik Van de Steen, Dimitris Pinotsis, Wouter Devos, Nigel Colenbier, Iege Bassez, Karl Friston, Daniele Marinazzo</p>

During resting-state EEG recordings, alpha activity is more prominent over the posterior cortex in eyes-closed (EC) conditions compared to eyes-open (EO). In this study, we characterized the difference in spectra between EO and EC conditions using dynamic causal modelling. Specifically, we investigated the role of intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity—within the visual cortex—in generating EC-EO alpha power differences over posterior electrodes. The primary visual cortex (V1) and the bilateral middle temporal visual areas (V5) were equipped with bidirectional extrinsic connections using a canonical microcircuit. The states of four intrinsically coupled subpopulations—within each occipital source—were also modelled. Using Bayesian model selection, we tested whether modulations of the intrinsic connections in V1, V5 or extrinsic connections (or a combination thereof) provided the best evidence for the data. In addition, using parametric empirical Bayes (PEB), we estimated group averages under the winning model. Bayesian model selection showed that the winning model contained both extrinsic connectivity modulations, as well as intrinsic connectivity modulations in all sources. The PEB analysis revealed increased extrinsic connectivity during EC. Overall, we found a reduction in the inhibitory intrinsic connections during EC. The results suggest that the intrinsic modulations in V5 played the most important role in producing EC-EO alpha differences, suggesting an intrinsic disinhibition in higher order visual cortex, during EC resting state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Seasonal timing on a cyclical Earth: Towards a theoretical framework for the evolution of phenology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John S. Park, Eric Post</p>

Phenology refers to the seasonal timing patterns commonly exhibited by life on Earth, from blooming flowers to breeding birds to human agriculture. Climate change is altering abiotic seasonality (e.g., longer summers) and in turn, phenological patterns contained within. However, how phenology should evolve is still an unsolved problem. This problem lies at the crux of predicting future phenological changes that will likely have substantial ecosystem consequences, and more fundamentally, of understanding an undeniably global phenomenon. Most studies have associated proximate environmental variables with phenological responses in case-specific ways, making it difficult to contextualize observations within a general evolutionary framework. We outline the complex but universal ways in which seasonal timing maps onto evolutionary fitness. We borrow lessons from life history theory and evolutionary demography that have benefited from a first principles-based theoretical scaffold. Lastly, we identify key questions for theorists and empiricists to help advance our general understanding of phenology.

The notion of epigenetic “marks” used by molecular biologists is conceptually disconnected from the idea of Waddington’s epigenetic “landscape” that is used by systems biologists and biophysicists. Recent advances suggest that these 2 distinct schools of thought could be united.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The RNA export and RNA decay complexes THO and TRAMP prevent transcription-replication conflicts, DNA breaks, and CAG repeat contractions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rebecca E. Brown, Xiaofeng A. Su, Stacey Fair, Katherine Wu, Lauren Verra, Robyn Jong, Kristin Andrykovich, Catherine H. Freudenreich</p>

Expansion of structure-forming CAG/CTG repetitive sequences is the cause of several neurodegenerative disorders and deletion of repeats is a potential therapeutic strategy. Transcription-associated mechanisms are known to cause CAG repeat instability. In this study, we discovered that Thp2, an RNA export factor and member of the THO (suppressors of transcriptional defects of <i>h</i><i>pr1Δ</i> by overexpression) complex, and Trf4, a key component of the TRAMP (Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation) complex involved in nuclear RNA polyadenylation and degradation, are necessary to prevent CAG fragility and repeat contractions in a <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> model system. Depletion of both Thp2 and Trf4 proteins causes a highly synergistic increase in CAG repeat fragility, indicating a complementary role of the THO and TRAMP complexes in preventing genome instability. Loss of either Thp2 or Trf4 causes an increase in RNA polymerase stalling at the CAG repeats and other genomic loci, as well as genome-wide transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), implicating TRCs as a cause of CAG fragility and instability in their absence. Analysis of the effect of RNase H1 overexpression on CAG fragility, RNAPII stalling, and TRCs suggests that RNAPII stalling with associated R-loops are the main cause of CAG fragility in the <i>thp2Δ</i> mutants. In contrast, CAG fragility and TRCs in the <i>trf4Δ</i> mutant can be compensated for by RPA overexpression, suggesting that excess unprocessed RNA in TRAMP4 mutants leads to reduced RPA availability and high levels of TRCs. Our results show the importance of RNA surveillance pathways in preventing RNAPII stalling, TRCs, and DNA breaks, and show that RNA export and RNA decay factors work collaboratively to maintain genome stability.

                SCA1, a lethal polyglutamine (polyQ) neurodegenerative disease, displays motor and cognitive impairments. Here, CRISPR-Cas9 was used to mutate the nuclear localization sequence of ATXN1-polyQ in a knockin SCA1 mouse model. The results indicate that ATXN1-polyQ nuclear localization contributes to all SCA1-like phenotypes. However, disease-associated changes in gene expression differ between affected brain regions.

                Li and Jakobs report that Spp1 knockout mice are more susceptible to retinal ganglion cell loss in age, glaucoma, and traumatic optic neuropathy. Spp1 deficiency impairs mitochondrial function and phagocytosis and increases expression of inflammatory markers, whereas Spp1 overexpression strongly increases ganglion cell survival and protects visual function.

                Hfq is an RNA chaperon that binds to small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and matches them with mRNAs, thus regulating their fate. Goldberger et al. show that, upon stress, Hfq undergoes phase separation and condenses at the cell poles with RNA. This process is important for its role as sRNA-mRNA matchmaker.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epithelia delimits glial apical polarity against mechanical shear to maintain glia-neuron architecture</a></h4>

              
                For an organ to maintain proper architecture and function, its different component cell-types must coordinate their cell-shapes with each other through life. While cell-intrinsic developmental mechanisms driving homotypic cell-cell coordination are known, how heterotypic cells collectively regulate cell-shape is less-clear. We report that, in a sense-organ, epithelial cells delimit and maintain polarity domains of contacting glia, and thereby, associated neuron shapes throughout life. Briefly, Hsp co-chaperone UNC-23/BAG2 keeps epithelial apical domains from deforming with animal movement. Epithelial apical domains stretch aberrantly and progressively in adult unc-23 mutant animals, which in an FGFR-dependent manner, dislocates glial apical cytoskeleton proteins SMA-1/{beta}H-Spectrin and actin. This alters glial apical polarity and cell shape, and concomitantly, associated neuron-ending shape. Notably, UNC-23 acts temporally at a developmental critical period to maintain glia-neuron shape in adults, and spatially within a defined anatomical zone. Lastly, intervention in either epithelia, glia or neuron ameliorate or phenocopy unc-23 neural defects. Epi/endothelia resist mechanical stress and contact glia-neuron units across central/peripheral nervous systems and species, and all components of the identified molecular pathway are conserved and disease-relevant. Thus, we posit that analogous epithelia-glia mechanobiological coupling may broadly regulate glia-neuron shapes through animal life.

                The learning of new motor skills constitutes an inseparable part of our lives. Motor consolidation refers to the offline processing of motor memories following the acquisition of new motor skills. The animal literature suggests that the primary motor cortex (M1) plays a key role in motor memory consolidation, and structural and functional plasticity in M1 following motor consolidation have been demonstrated. However, the mechanisms supporting motor memory consolidation and plasticity in the human M1 are not well understood. Initial human neuroimaging studies show that the initial stages of motor learning in humans are accompanied by short-term temporal dynamics of the brain main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, Glutamate (Glu) and GABA, in M1, but it remains unclear how these relate to the question of motor memory consolidation. Here, we show that early Glu and GABA modifications in M1 following motor skill learning may play vital roles in supporting motor memory consolidation and neural plasticity that take place over longer time scales. Using a multimodal magnetic resonance approach implemented on ultra-high field 7T scanner in healthy young adults (n=36), we found increased Glu and decreased GABA in M1 during the initial offline period following learning to support consolidation-related local and inter-regional functions of M1, such as motor memory reactivation and increased functional connectivity with the striatum. These neurochemical changes also correlated with overnight structural and functional plasticity expressed as increased M1 grey matter volume and functional connectivity, while Glu modifications also correlated with adaptive behavior, as reflected by improvements in skill performance. Our results provide intriguing microscale mechanistic evidence to the potential distinctive roles of Glu and GABA in promoting motor memory consolidation and plasticity in the human M1. They also highlight a role for early neurochemical modifications to memory consolidation and plasticity in the human brain and may hold important clinical implications in rehabilitative settings such as in stroke and brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinction between slow waves and delta waves sheds light to sleep homeostasis and their association to hippocampal sharp waves ripples</a></h4>

              
                Cortical slow waves and delta waves are hallmarks of NREM sleep and key elements in physiological processes such as memory consolidation and sleep homeostasis. However, no clear distinction has been made between the two types of electrophysiological events. We introduce a new distinction between slow waves, large amplitude waves on filtered LFP cortical signals, and delta waves, characterized by an inversion between deep and superficial layers and the co-occurrence with a cortical down state. Detection of slow waves, as large amplitude waves during NREM sleep, reveals that a large portion of them does not share the properties of delta waves and does not co-occur with cortical down states. Therefore, we distinguish type-1 slow waves, that are associated to a down state, from type-2 slow waves. We show that 1) only type-1 slow waves undergo strong homeostatic regulations and 2) type- 2 slow waves create confusion about the temporal link with hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. Thus, we confirm that delta waves detected with our new method can be used as a proxy for down state. Altogether, this confirms the importance of a robust and accurate definition of delta waves to understand the fine neurophysiological mechanisms at stake during NREM sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social defeat induces REM sleep fragmentation through the PFC-VLPO pathway</a></h4>

              
                The brainstem and hypothalamic structures implementing the daily cycles of wake, REM and NREM sleep have now been identified in remarkable detail. However, sleep structure dynamically adapts to environmental stressors, likely requiring top-down cortical feedback that is as yet unidentified. Here, we investigate the role of projections from prefrontal cortex (PFC), a key hub in stress regulation, to the ventro-lateral preoptic areas (VLPO), a master regulator of sleep states. Using ex vivo optogenetics, we demonstrate that activation of PFC terminals induces monosynaptic excitatory glutamatergic currents in VLPO NREM-promoting neurons. In vivo, activation of PFC-VLPO projections interrupts ongoing REM in favour of NREM, leading to fragmented REM bouts. Remarkably, chemogenetic inhibition of PFC-VLPO projections has no effect in baseline conditions but it blocks the REM fragmentation induced by Social Defeat Stress. Therefore, the PFC-VLPO pathway provides a top-down regulation specifically recruited in stressful conditions to induce short, fragmented REM bouts and favor NREM sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Validation of the EEG signal of the URGOnight neurofeedback device, associated with a new SMR detection method</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor (SMR) neurofeedback is a promising therapy for several health disorders but is still not widely used due to the high cost of the equipment. URGOnight offers a low-cost solution to democratize these therapies by providing an at-home EEG headband with dry electrodes connected to a mobile application. The first aim of this study is both to validate the URGOnight EEG signal and to compare it to Enobio-20, a medical grade EEG device. The second aim of the study is to propose a new method to detect SMR rhythm based on its oscillatory properties and discriminate it from alpha oscillations. In our study, we compared the URGOnight headband EEG signal (C3/C4) to Enobio- 20 (CP3/CP4), placed on subjects simultaneously equipped with the two headbands. All subjects (n=33) performed a dual blocking task inspired by Kulhman (1978) based on the blocking effect of movement and eyes opening on SMR and alpha respectively. This task was followed by SSVEP stimulations to evaluate the frequency response of the two EEG devices. The performance of the EEG headbands was statistically identical for most of the characteristics of the EEG signal, including the frequency response to SSVEP (from 4Hz to 20Hz). The main difference was a larger amplitude in the 8-15Hz due to the location of the reference in URGOnight that did not impair the detection of both alpha and SMR. In addition, we show that our new method allows to discriminate alpha and SMR rhythms based on their oscillatory properties with a single recording site (C3/C4). The method is fast enough to be used in real time. We show that the detected SMR rhythm is modulated by movement as opposed to the 12-15Hz frequency band often used as indicator of SMR in most neurofeedback studies. Altogether, our results validate the quality of the EEG recordings obtained with URGOnight since it gives similar results as the one obtained with Enobio-20, a validated EEG medical grade system. In addition, we provide a new method allowing the identification and the separation of the alpha and SMR with a single recording site C3/C4. This method opens up a new research lead to improve SMR neurofeedback efficiency and thus of its clinical possibilities by focusing on the reinforcement of the SMR oscillation strictly speaking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Calcium signals tune AMPK activity and mitochondrial homeostasis in dendrites of developing neurons</a></h4>

              
                AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) governs multiple pathways regulating mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis. AMPK overactivation is a hallmark of some neurodegenerative diseases, leading to excessive mitochondrial fission and mitophagy and subsequent degeneration of neuronal processes. Here we demonstrate that AMPK is involved in activity-dependent dendritic outgrowth of developing hippocampal neurons. AMPK deficiency phenocopies the inhibition of neuronal activity, inducing dendritic hypotrophy with abnormally elongated mitochondria. In growing dendrites, AMPK is activated by neuronal activity and dynamically oscillates in synchrony with calcium spikes, and this AMPK oscillation is inhibited by CaMKK2 knockdown. AMPK activation leads to phosphorylation of MFF and ULK1, which initiate mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, respectively. Dendritic mitochondria in AMPK-depleted neurons exhibit impaired fission and mitophagy and display multiple signs of dysfunction. Thus, AMPK activity is finely tuned by the calcium-CaMKK2 pathway and regulates mitochondrial homeostasis by facilitating removal of damaged components in rapidly growing neurons during normal brain development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Head motion correction shapes functional network estimates: evidence from healthy and Parkinson's disease cohorts</a></h4>

              
                An open discussion in studies of intrinsic brain functional connectivity is the mitigation of head motion-related artifacts, particularly in the presence of peculiar symptomatology such as in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies show that Independent Component Analysis (ICA) denoising improves the reproducibility of functional connectivity findings by detecting sources of non-neural signals. However, there is still no consensus about which pre-processing pipeline should be applied in natural high motion populations such as PD, particularly in relation to novel functional network descriptions derived from dynamic connectivity analyses. In this study, we investigated how different pre-processing pipelines affect intrinsic brain connectivity metrics, both static and dynamic, derived from a group of young healthy controls (HC) and a group of PD participants. A total of 20 HC and 20 PD subjects participated in this 3 T MRI study. Resting-state functional MRI images were used to test the effects of the pre-processing pipeline of static (sFC) and temporal-varying functional connectivity (dFC) estimations. Both MRI datasets were pre-processed using three different workflows differing in the motion correction approach: (i) standard motion realignment (mc); (ii) motion outlier detection and deweighting based on image intensity change estimations (DVARS) and (iii) ICA-based noise removal using reference noise features (AROMA). Furthermore, the PD dataset was also processed with a fourth method by applying an ICA-based denoising (FIX), previously trained on the HC group. sFC analysis was performed using Group ICA, by temporally concatenating different pre-processing types in pairs of different runs. Two types of dFC analyses were considered: innovation-driven co-activation patterns (iCAPs) and co-activation patterns (CAPs). CAPs allow dFC estimations that do not require the deconvolution of the hemodynamic response function and its derivative, thus potentially being less sensitive to head-motion related noise. We found that regardless of substantial head motion differences in the two groups, sFC results were consistent across denoising strategies. Conversely, dFC was extremely sensitive to denoising strategies, particularly for the PD group with the transient-based dFC analyses. Indeed, the use of the peak-based dFC framework enables the detection of time-varying networks but in a way that is highly dependent on the motion correction pipeline. In conclusion, we show that dynamic functional network representations are highly sensitive to both head motion and to fMRI denoising methods. These findings stress the importance of considering and reporting these experimental aspects to help with the reproducibility and interpretation of different studies. Future work is needed to further investigate transient-based dFC strategies that are more robust to head motion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of stimulus periodicity on spinal cord stimulation-induced artificial sensations in rodents</a></h4>

              
                Sensory feedback is critical for effectively controlling brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) and neuroprosthetic devices. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is proposed as a technique to induce artificial sensory perceptions in rodents, monkeys, and humans. However, to realize the full potential of SCS as a sensory neuroprosthetic technology, a better understanding of the effect of SCS pulse train parameter changes on sensory detection and discrimination thresholds is necessary. Here we investigated whether stimulation periodicity impacts rat's ability to detect and discriminate SCS-induced perceptions at different frequencies. By varying the coefficient of variation (CV) of interstimulus pulse interval, we showed that at lower frequencies, rats could detect highly aperiodic SCS pulse trains at lower amplitudes (i.e., decreased detection thresholds). Furthermore, rats learned to discriminate stimuli with subtle differences in periodicity, and the just-noticeable differences (JNDs) from a highly aperiodic stimulus were smaller than those from a periodic stimulus. These results demonstrate that the temporal structure of an SCS pulse train is an integral parameter for modulating sensory feedback in neuroprosthetic applications.

                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that is rapidly growing in popularity for studying causal brain-behavior relationships. However, its dose-dependent direct neural mechanisms and indirect sensory co-stimulation effects remain hotly debated. Understanding how TMS modulates neural activity at different scales and how stimulation parameters affect brain responses is vital for the rational design of TMS protocols. Studying these mechanisms in humans is challenging due to the limited spatiotemporal resolution of available non-invasive neuroimaging methods. Here, we leverage invasive recordings of local field potentials in non-human primates and show that mesoscale early TMS-evoked potentials are dose and location dependent. Further, we employ several control conditions to dissociate direct neural responses from auditory and somatosensory co-activation. These results provide crucial evidence regarding TMS neural effects at the brain circuit level. Our findings are highly relevant for interpreting human TMS studies and biomarker developments for TMS target engagement in clinical applications.

	<p>Attentional bias to sleep-related information is thought to be a core feature for developing and/or maintaining insomnia. This study used a hallmark measure of attentional bias, the dot-probe task, to determine whether this bias toward sleep-related stimuli was a function of the severity of insomnia symptoms. A sample of 231 volunteers (175 females; mean age of 26.91 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.05 years) participated in this online study, filling out the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and performing a visual dot-probe task. After categorizing individuals based on the ISI score into normal, subclinical, and moderate/severe sleep groups, we only found a marginally significant interaction between sleep groups and the type of stimuli on RTs, suggesting that subclinical and moderate/severe sleep groups reported slower RTs for sleep-related words than for neutral words. When we calculated the attentional bias score (ABS), we found that ABS significantly differed from zero in the moderate/severe sleep group only, suggesting a disengagement for sleep-related information as a function of the severity of insomnia symptoms. This finding seems to suggest that insomnia is related to greater difficulties in shifting away from sleep-related stimuli.</p>

	<p>Lactate is a universal metabolite produced and released by all cells in the body. Traditionally it was viewed as energy currency that is generated from pyruvate at the end of the glycolytic pathway and sent into the extracellular space for other cells to take up and consume. In the brain, such a mechanism was postulated to operate between astrocytes and neurons many years ago. Later, the discovery of lactate receptors opened yet another chapter in the quest to understand lactate actions. Other ideas, such as modulation of NMDA receptors were also proposed. Up to this day, we still do not have a consensus view on the relevance of any of these mechanisms to brain functions or their contribution to human or animal physiology. While the field develops new ideas, in this brief review we analyze some recently published studies in order to focus on some unresolved controversies and highlight the limitations that need to be addressed in future work. Clearly, only by using similar and overlapping methods, cross-referencing experiments, and perhaps collaborative efforts, we can finally understand what the role of lactate in the brain is and why this ubiquitous molecule is so important.</p>

	<p>Previous research consistently reported that subjects that were exclusively breastfed (eBF) vs. not-exclusively breastfed (neBF) during infancy (0&amp;amp;ndash;6 months) showed increased scores of general intelligence measures (e.g., the intelligence quotient). However, the existent literature largely neglected whether breastfeeding also affects specific cognitive processes, such as attention and working memory (WM) capacity. We tested whether eBF vs. neBF subjects showed performance differences in relation to these two core cognitive functions. The Attention Network Test (ANT), to measure alerting, orienting, and conflict, and the Change Colour Task (CCT), to measure visuospatial WM capacity, were administered to 144 participants divided according to age (6-, 10-, and 18-year-old participants) and breastfeeding (eBF or neBF during 0&amp;amp;ndash;6 months of life). Importantly, the sub-groups were homogenous in terms of maternal education, a factor potentially affecting the relation between breastfeeding and cognition. While we found increased performance as a function of participants&amp;amp;rsquo; age in both tasks, we failed to observe effects related to breastfeeding, as evidenced by Bayesian analyses. These findings highlight for the first time that the pattern of nutrition provided during early infancy does not appear to affect the development of attention and WM capacity, at least starting from the age considered in the present study.</p>

	<p>Automatic detection of epileptic seizures is important in epilepsy control and treatment, and specific feature extraction assists in accurate detection. We developed a feature extraction method for seizure detection based on multi-site synchronous changes and an edge detection algorithm. We investigated five chronic temporal lobe epilepsy rats with 8- and 12-channel detection sites in the hippocampus and limbic system. Multi-site synchronous changes were selected as a specific feature and implemented as a seizure detection method. For preprocessing, we used magnitude-squared coherence maps and Canny edge detection algorithm to find the frequency band with the most significant change in synchronization and the important channel pairs. In detection, we used the maximal cross-correlation coefficient as an indicator of synchronization and the correlation coefficient curves&amp;amp;rsquo; average value and standard deviation as two detection features. The method achieved high performance, with an average 96.60% detection rate, 2.63/h false alarm rate, and 1.25 s detection delay. The experimental results show that synchronization is an appropriate feature for seizure detection. The magnitude-squared coherence map can assist in selecting a specific frequency band and channel pairs to enhance the detection result. We found that individuals have a specific frequency band that reflects the most significant synchronization changes, and our method can individually adjust parameters and has good detection performance.</p>

	<p>Prognosis of prolonged Disorders of Consciousness (pDoC) is influenced by patients&amp;amp;rsquo; clinical diagnosis and Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) total score. We compared the prognostic accuracy of a novel Consciousness Domain Index (CDI) with that of clinical diagnosis and CRS-R total score, for recovery of full consciousness at 6-, 12-, and 24-months post-injury. The CDI was obtained by a combination of the six CRS-R subscales via an unsupervised machine learning technique. We retrospectively analyzed data on 143 patients with pDoC (75 in Minimally Conscious State; 102 males; median age = 53 years; IQR = 35; time post-injury = 1&amp;amp;ndash;3 months) due to different etiologies enrolled in an International Brain Injury Association Disorders of Consciousness Special Interest Group (IBIA DoC-SIG) multicenter longitudinal study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to assess the association between outcomes and the CDI, compared to clinical diagnosis and CRS-R. The CDI, the clinical diagnosis, and the CRS-R total score were significantly associated with a good outcome at 6, 12 and 24 months. The CDI showed the highest univariate prediction accuracy and sensitivity, and regression models including the CDI provided the highest values of explained variance. A combined scoring system of the CRS-R subscales by unsupervised machine learning may improve clinical ability to predict recovery of consciousness in patients with pDoC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Basal Forebrain Chemogenetic Inhibition Converts the Attentional Control Mode of Goal-Trackers to That of Sign-Trackers</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Sign tracking versus goal tracking in rats indicate vulnerability and resistance, respectively, to Pavlovian cue-evoked addictive drug taking and relapse. Here, we tested hypotheses predicting that the opponent cognitive-behavioral styles indexed by sign tracking versus goal tracking include variations in attentional performance which differentially depend on basal forebrain projection systems. Pavlovian Conditioned Approach (PCA) testing was used to identify male and female sign-trackers (STs) and goal-trackers (GTs), as well as rats with an intermediate phenotype (INTs). Upon reaching asymptotic performance in an operant task requiring the detection of visual signals (hits) as well as the reporting of signal absence for 40 min per session, GTs scored more hits than STs, and hit rates across all phenotypes correlated with PCA scores. STs missed relatively more signals than GTs specifically during the last 15 min of a session. Chemogenetic inhibition of the basal forebrain decreased hit rates in GTs but was without effect in STs. Moreover, the decrease in hits in GTs manifested solely during the last 15 min of a session. Transfection efficacy in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB), but not substantia innominate (SI) or nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), predicted the behavioral efficacy of chemogenetic inhibition in GTs. Furthermore, the total subregional transfection space, not transfection of just cholinergic neurons, correlated with performance effects. These results indicate that the cognitive-behavioral phenotype indexed by goal tracking, but not sign tracking, depends on activation of the basal forebrain-frontal cortical projection system and associated biases toward top-down or model-based performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Central role of macrophages and nucleic acid release in Myasthenia Gravis thymus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease mediated by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The thymus plays a primary role in AChR-MG and is characterized by a type I interferon (IFN) signature linked to IFN-β. We investigated if AChR-MG was characterized by an IFN-I signature in the blood, and further investigated the chronic thymic IFN-I signature.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Serum levels of IFN-β and IFN-α subtypes, and mRNA expression for IFN-I subtypes and IFN-stimulated genes in PBMCs were analyzed. The contribution of endogenous nucleic acids in thymic expression of IFN-I subtypes was investigated in human thymic epithelial cell cultures and the mouse thymus. By immunohistochemistry, thymic CD68<sup>+</sup> and CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages were analyzed in AChR-MG. To investigate the impact of a decrease in thymic macrophages, mice were treated with an anti-CSF1R antibody.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>No IFN-I signature was observed in the periphery emphasizing that the IFN-I signature is restricted to the MG thymus. Molecules mimicking endogenous dsDNA signalization (Poly(dA:dT) and 2′3’-cGAMP), or dexamethasone-induced necrotic thymocytes increased IFN-β and α-AChR expression by thymic epithelial cells, and in the mouse thymus.</p>
<p>A significant decrease in thymic macrophages was demonstrated in AChR-MG. In mice, a decrease in thymic macrophages led to an increase of necrotic thymocytes associated with IFN-β and α-AChR expression.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that the decrease of thymic macrophages in AChR-MG impairs the elimination of apoptotic thymocytes favoring the release of endogenous nucleic acids from necrotic thymocytes. In this inflammatory context, thymic epithelial cells may overexpress IFN-β, which specifically induces α-AChR, resulting in self-sensitization and thymic changes leading to AChR-MG.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was performed to investigate whether ticagrelor/aspirin versus clopidogrel/aspirin can further reduce the residual risk of stroke recurrence in patients with positive diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events II (CHANCE-2) trial.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with DWI data in the CHANCE-2 trial were included and divided into those with and without acute infarction according to their DWI findings. The primary efficacy outcome and safety outcome were stroke recurrence and moderate to severe bleeding within 3 months of follow-up, respectively.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 6,412 patients enrolled in the CHANCE-2 trial, 5,796 (90.4%) patients with DWI data were included in the subgroup analysis. A total of 4,369 patients (75.4%) had an acute infarction on DWI. Patients with positive DWI had higher risk of recurrent stroke (8.1%) than those without infarction (2.2%) within 3-month follow-up. Compared with clopidogrel/aspirin, ticagrelor/aspirin was associated with lower risk of stroke in patients with positive DWI (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.80; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) than in those negative DWI (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.55–2.72; <i>P</i> = .63), with a significant interaction association (<i>P</i> for interaction = .049). The risk of moderate to severe bleeding was similar between ticagrelor/aspirin and clopidogrel/aspirin treatment in different groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study demonstrate that imaging evaluation should be emphasized before targeting the best candidates for genotype-guided dual antiplatelet therapy in future clinical research and practice.</p>

<p>In AD, the earliest and most consistent associations across all time points included depression, erectile dysfunction, gait abnormalities, hearing loss, and nervous and musculoskeletal symptoms. Cardiomegaly, urinary incontinence, non-epithelial skin cancer, and pneumonia were not significant until 1 year before dementia diagnosis. In VaD, the earliest and most consistent associations across all time points included abnormal EKG, cardiac dysrhythmias, cerebrovascular disease, non-epithelial skin cancer, depression, and hearing loss. Atrial fibrillation, occlusion of cerebral arteries, essential tremor, and abnormal reflexes were not significant until 1 year before dementia diagnosis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that some health conditions are associated with future dementia beginning at least 5 years before dementia diagnosis and are consistently seen over time, while others only reach significance closer to the date of diagnosis. These results also show that there are both shared and distinctive health conditions associated with AD and VaD. These results reinforce the need for medical intervention and treatment to lessen the impact of health comorbidities in the aging population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Mediation of Successful Reperfusion Effect through Infarct Growth and Cerebral Edema: A Pooled, Patient‐level Analysis of EXTEND‐IA Trials and SELECT Prospective Cohort</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Reperfusion therapy is highly beneficial for ischemic stroke. Reduction in both infarct growth and edema are plausible mediators of clinical benefit with reperfusion. We aimed to quantify these mediators and their interrelationship.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a pooled, patient-level analysis of EXTEND-IA trials and SELECT study, we employed a mediation analysis framework to quantify infarct growth and cerebral edema(midline shift) mediation effect on successful reperfusion(mTICI≥2b) association with functional outcome(mRS distribution). Further, we evaluated an additional pathway to the original hypothesis, where infarct growth mediated successful reperfusion effect on midline shift.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>542/665(81.5%) eligible patients achieved successful reperfusion. Baseline clinical and imaging characteristics were largely similar between those achieving successful vs unsuccessful reperfusion. Median(IQR) infarct growth was 12.3(1.8-48.4)ml and median(IQR) midline shift was 0(0,2.2)mm. Of 249(37%) demonstrating a midline shift of ≥1mm, median(IQR) shift was 2.75(1.89, 4.21)mm).</p>
<p>Successful reperfusion was associated with reductions in both predefined mediators; infarct growth (β, −1.19; 95%CI, −1.51to−0.88;p&lt;0.001) and midline shift (aOR:0.36,95%CI:0.23-0.57,p&lt;0.001). Successful reperfusion association with improved functional outcome (acOR:2.68; 95%CI:1.86-3.88,p&lt;0.001), became insignificant (acOR:1.39, 95%CI:0.95-2.04,p=0.094) when infarct growth and midline shift were added to the regression model. Infarct growth and midline shift explained 45% and 34% of successful reperfusion effect. Analysis considering alternative hypothesis demonstrated consistent results.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this mediation analysis from a pooled, patient-level cohort, a significant proportion(~80%) of successful reperfusion effect on functional outcome was mediated through reduction in infarct growth and cerebral edema. Further studies are required to confirm our findings, detect additional mediators to explain successful reperfusion residual effect and identify novel therapeutic targets to further enhance reperfusion benefits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Polygenic effect on tau pathology progression in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Polygenic variation accounts for a substantial portion of the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but its effect on the rate of fibrillar-tau accumulation as a key driver of dementia symptoms is unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We combined the to-date largest number of genetic risk variants of AD (n = 85 lead SNPs) from recent GWAS to generate a PGS. We assessed longitudinal tau-PET, amyloid-PET, and cognition in 231 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Using the PGS, together with global amyloid-PET, we predicted the rate of tau-PET increases in Braak-stage regions-of-interest and cognitive decline. We also assessed PGS-risk enrichment effects on the required sample size in clinical trials targeting tau pathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that a higher PGS was associated with higher rates of tau-PET accumulation, in particular at elevated amyloid-PET levels. Tau-PET increases mediated the association between PGS and faster cognitive decline. Risk enrichment through high PGS afforded sample size savings by 34%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that the PGS predicts faster tau progression and thus cognitive decline, showing utility to enhance statistical power in clinical trials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Seasonal Variation in Neurologic Hospitalizations in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Certain neurologic diseases have been noted to vary by season, and this is important for understanding disease mechanisms and risk factors, but seasonality has not been systematically examined across the spectrum of neurologic disease, and methodologic guidance is also lacking.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using nationally representative data from the National Inpatient Sample, a stratified 20% sample of all non-federal acute care hospitalizations in the United States, we calculated the monthly rate of hospitalization for 14 neurologic diseases from 2016 to 2018. For each disease, we assessed seasonality of hospitalization using chi-squared, Edward, and Walter-Elwood tests and seasonal time series regression models. Statistical tests were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using Bonferroni correction.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Meningitis, encephalitis, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and multiple sclerosis had statistically significant seasonality according to multiple methods of testing. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, status epilepticus, myasthenia gravis, and epilepsy had significant seasonality according to Edwards and Walter-Elwood tests but not chi-square tests. Seasonal time series regression illustrated seasonal variation in all 14 diseases of interest, but statistical testing for seasonality within these models using the Kruskal-Wallis test only achieved statistical significance for meningitis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Seasonal variation is present across the spectrum of acute neurologic disease, including some conditions for which seasonality has not previously been described, and can be examined using multiple different methods. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal Effects of Asymptomatic C9orf72 Carriership on Brain Morphology</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated effects of <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion and gene expression on longitudinal cerebral changes before symptom onset.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 79 asymptomatic family members (AFMs) from 9 families with <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion. Twenty-eight AFMs carried the mutation (C9+). Participants had up to 3 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, after which we compared motor cortex and motor tracts between C9+ and C9− AFMs using mixed effects models, incorporating kinship to correct for familial relations and lessen effects of other genetic factors. We also compared cortical, subcortical, cerebellar, and connectome structural measurements in a hypothesis-free analysis. We correlated regional <i>C9orf72</i> expression in donor brains with the pattern of cortical thinning in C9+ AFMs using meta-regression. For comparison, we included 42 C9+ and 439 C9− patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in this analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>C9+ AFM motor cortex had less gyrification and was thinner than in C9− AFMs, without differences in motor tracts. Whole brain analysis revealed thinner cortex and less gyrification in parietal, occipital, and temporal regions, smaller thalami and right hippocampus, and affected frontotemporal connections. Thinning of bilateral precentral, precuneus, and left superior parietal cortex was faster in C9+ than in C9− AFMs. Higher <i>C9orf72</i> expression correlated with thinner cortex in both C9+ AFMs and C9+ ALS patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion carriers, brain MRI reveals widespread features suggestive of impaired neurodevelopment, along with faster decline of motor and parietal cortex than found in normal aging. <i>C9orf72</i> expression might play a role in cortical development, and consequently explain the specific brain abnormalities of mutation carriers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sodium channel slow inactivation normalizes firing in axons with uneven conductance distributions</a></h4>

              
                The Na+ channels that are important for action potentials show rapid inactivation, a state in which they do not conduct, although the membrane potential remains depolarized1,2. Rapid inactivation is a determinant of millisecond scale phenomena, such as spike shape and refractory period. Na+ channels also inactivate orders of magnitude more slowly, and therefore have impacts on excitability over much longer time scales than those of a single spike or a single inter-spike interval3-9. Here, we focus on the contribution of slow inactivation to the resilience of axonal excitability10,11 when ion channels are unevenly distributed across the axonal membrane. We study models in which the voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels are unevenly distributed along axons with different variances, capturing the heterogeneity that biological axons display12. In the absence of slow inactivation many conductance distributions result in spontaneous tonic activity. Faithful axonal propagation is achieved with the introduction of Na+ channel slow inactivation. This "normalization" effect depends on relations between the kinetics of slow inactivation and the firing frequency. Consequently, neurons with characteristically different firing frequencies will need to implement different sets of channel properties to achieve resilience. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of the intrinsic biophysical properties of ion channels in normalizing axonal function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Independent inhibitory control mechanisms for aggressive motivation and action</a></h4>

              
                Social behaviors, like other motivated behaviors, frequently consist of a flexible motivated-seeking or approach phase followed by social action. Dysregulated social behavior may arise from changes to motivation, wherein individuals fail to enter a motivated seeking state, or may be in the execution of the social action itself. However, it is unclear how the brain generates and gates this flexible motivation-to-action sequence, and whether aggressive motivation and action are controlled by separate circuit mechanisms. Here, we record populations of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus ventrolateral area (VMHvl) of male mice at cellular resolution during "free" aggression and also during an aggression operant task, where the behaviors that precede attack are stereotyped. We find that this population encodes the temporal sequence of aggressive motivation to action and that the temporal selectivity of neurons is invariant to differences in motivated behavior. To test whether motivation and action could be independently regulated, we focused on two key inhibitory inputs to the VMHvl: a source of local inhibition (VMHvl shell) and the primary source of long-range inhibition (the medial preoptic area, MPO). While we find that the VMHvl receives broad monosynaptic inhibitory input from both inputs, optogenetic perturbation of these inputs during recording reveals temporal selectivity during aggressive motivation and action, suggesting specificity of function. Encoding models applied to population calcium recordings of these inhibitory inputs during naturalistic social interactions and during the social operant task further reveal that these inputs have different temporal dynamics during aggression: VMHvl shellvgat+ activity peaks at the start of aggressive interactions, while MPO-VMHvlvgat+ activity peaks at behaviorally aligned endpoints of aggressive interactions. Finally, using closed-loop optogenetic stimulation timed to specific phases of the aggression-operant task, we find a double-dissociation of the effects on aggressive motivation and action: activation of MPO-VMHvlvgat+, even briefly and temporally distant from the initiation of aggression, produces long-lasting motivational deficits, delaying the initiation of aggression and generating behaviors consistent with an unmotivated state. In contrast, activation of VMHvl shellvgat+ produces acute action-related deficits, causing an exit from an attack state. Fitting a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to behavior further corroborates these findings by showing that MPO-VMHvlvgat+ stimulation prolongs a low motivation state and VMHvl shellvgat+ promotes exit from an attack state. Together, these data demonstrate how separable inhibitory circuits in the hypothalamus can independently gate the motivational and action phases of aggression through a single locus of control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal monitoring of maternal care and maternal neglect</a></h4>

              
                Parental care is required to ensure the health and survival of offspring. Caretaking in mammals is challenging as infants are largely helpless and require near-continual oversight over prolonged periods. Mouse pups in particular cannot thermoregulate, and will succumb to hypothermia unless kept warm by an adult caretaker or an insulating nest. Parents must balance caretaking behaviors with other activities important for survival such as regulating their own temperature and foraging for food or water, which necessarily involve periods of pup neglect. To understand in high detail the consequential decision-making involved in care of infant pups, we built a new system for long-term 24/7 continuous monitoring of mouse homecage behaviors, including thermal imaging, video recording from above, side and directly under the nest, with environmental controls to standardize housing conditions across animals. We monitored single dams and their offspring, before, during and after parturition, from initial mating over four consecutive litters. We found that about half of the animals had high litter survival rates ( high-pup-survival dams) but the other half had little to no pups survive ( low-pup-survival dams). The relative amount of litter survival did not change or improve across litters in absence of intervention: Low-pup-survival dams continued to neglect pups and nest-building across litters, losing nearly all offspring within a day after birth. We could predict which animals would become low-pup-survival dams by inspecting the nests they built a few days before parturition. Low-pup-survival dams minimally engaged with nest building, and after birth, generally avoided pups and the nest. Nest quality deteriorated due to movement of the dam in and out of the nest, exacerbating temperature loss and mortality of the litter. In contrast, high-pup-survival dams spent a considerable amount of time rebuilding and adjusting the nest over the first postnatal day and beyond. Remarkably, if we co-housed low-pup-survival dams with a high-pup-survival dam and her litter, when the low-pup-survival dam was bred again and singly-housed, litter survival rates thereafter were consistently much higher along with increased attention toward pups and nest. Thus, even under well-controlled and ideal lab housing conditions, mouse maternal care can be remarkably variable, with continued nest rebuilding as the most important factor in ensuring high litter survival rates. Furthermore, despite some animals perseverating in maternal neglect and losing their pups, caretaking and nest-building can improve after interactions with experienced and successful parents.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lower socioeconomic status is associated with greater neural responses to deviance in the ambient environment</a></h4>

              
                The early life experience of people varies by socioeconomic status, raising the question of how this difference is reflected in the adult brain. An important aspect of brain function is the ability to focus on a task while maintaining the ability to detect salient changes in the task-irrelevant background. Here we ask whether SES, as measured by perceived social standing, is reflected by the way brain signals, measured with an electroencephalogram, correlate with detecting changes in irrelevant information. We study electrical brain activities in the frontocentral region to a series of auditory tones composed of "standard" (80%) stimuli randomly interspersed by "deviant" (20%) stimuli while subjects were engaged in visual tasks. In study 1, participants focused on a silent documentary movie with captions (N = 16); in study 2, participants (N = 42) focused on image sequences incorporating neutral or negative content. Both studies showed stronger automatic change detection indexed by mismatch negativity (MMN) in lower SES individuals, regardless of sound features, emotional content, or study types. In addition, a larger MMN was observed despite comparable task performance across SES. Our study indicates low SES participants higher sensitivity to detect ambient auditory changes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modality-specific and modality-general representations of reward value in frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Standard neuroeconomics theories state that the value of different classes of stimuli, for instance the hedonic value of food versus music, is transformed to a common reference scale that is independent of their sensory properties. However, adaptive behaviour in a multimodal and dynamic environment requires that our brain also encodes information about the sensory features of reward predicting stimuli. Whether and how a common code for value could integrate information about the sensory features of rewarding stimuli remains inadequately understood. By employing stimuli from auditory and visual modalities as reward predicting cues in a value-based decision-making task, we were able to vary the reward value and sensory modality independently and dissociate neural codes of auditory and visual rewards in frontal areas using fMRI. Univariate fMRI analysis revealed modality-specific and modality-general value representations in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), respectively. Crucially, modality-specific representations were highly selective as they were only activated when participants believed that the corresponding sensory modality was associated with reward and were absent when the task involved instruction-based rather than value-based choices. Moreover, we show that modality-specific value representations are supported by the presence of the effective connectivity between each primary sensory area and the corresponding OFC activation and further between modality-specific value representations in OFC and vmPFC, only when the sensory modality to be chosen is associated with reward and absent otherwise. Our results indicate the presence of both modality-specific and modality-general representations of reward value and reveal mechanisms through which the interaction between the sensory cortices and the two types of representation guides value-based decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Determinants of Motor Neuron Functional Subtypes Important for Locomotor Speed</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion requires precise control of the strength and speed of muscle contraction and is achieved by recruiting functionally-distinct subtypes of motor neurons (MNs). MNs are essential to movement and differentially susceptible in disease, but little is known about how MNs acquire functional subtype-specific molecular features during development. Using single cell RNA profiling in larval zebrafish, we identify novel and conserved molecular signatures for MN functional subtypes, and identify genes expressed in both early post-mitotic and mature MNs. Assessing MN development in genetic mutants, we define a molecular program essential for MN functional subtype specification. Two evolutionarily-conserved transcription factors, Prdm16 and Evi1, are both functional subtype-specific determinants integral for fast MN development. Loss of prdm16 or evi1 causes fast MNs to develop transcriptional profiles and innervation similar to slow MNs. These results reveal the molecular diversity of vertebrate spinal MNs and demonstrate that functional subtypes are specified through intrinsic transcriptional codes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Apical size and deltaA expression predict adult neural stem cell decisions along lineage progression</a></h4>

              
                The maintenance of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain depends on their activation frequency and division mode. We use long-term intravital imaging of NSCs in the zebrafish adult telencephalon to link activation and division mode with predictive cellular and molecular parameters. We reveal that apical surface area and expression of the Notch ligand DeltaA predict NSC activation frequency, while deltaA expression marks NSC commitment to neurogenesis. We also find that deltaA-negative NSCs constitute the bona fide self-renewing NSC pool and systematically engage in asymmetric divisions generating a self-renewing deltaAneg and a neurogenic deltaApos NSC. Finally, modulation of Notch signaling during imaging indicates that the prediction of activation frequency by apical size, and the asymmetric divisions of deltaAneg NSCs, are functionally independent of Notch. These results provide dynamic qualitative and quantitative readouts of NSC lineage progression in vivo and support a hierarchical organization of NSCs in differently fated sub-populations.

	<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent, inheritable, and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. Children with a family history of ADHD are at elevated risk of having ADHD and persisting its symptoms into adulthood. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of having or not having positive family risk factor in the neuroanatomy of the brain in children with ADHD. Cortical thickness-, surface area-, and volume-based measures were extracted and compared in a total of 606 participants, including 132, 165, and 309 in groups of familial ADHD (ADHD-F), non-familial ADHD (ADHD-NF), and typically developed children, respectively. Compared to controls, ADHD probands showed significantly reduced gray matter surface area in the left cuneus. Among the ADHD subgroups, ADHD-F showed significantly increased gray matter volume in the right thalamus and significantly thinner cortical thickness in the right pars orbitalis. Among ADHD-F, an increased volume of the right thalamus was significantly correlated with a reduced DSM-oriented t-score for ADHD problems. The findings of this study may suggest that a positive family history of ADHD is associated with the structural abnormalities in the thalamus and inferior frontal gyrus; these anatomical abnormalities may significantly contribute to the emergence of ADHD symptoms.</p>

	<p>Growing evidence highlights the potential of innovative rehabilitative interventions such as cognitive remediation and neuromodulation, aimed at reducing relapses in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Enhancing their effectiveness requires a thorough description of the neural correlates of cognitive alterations in AUD. Past related attempts, however, were limited by the focus on selected neuro-cognitive variables. We aimed to fill this gap by combining, in 22 AUD patients and 18 controls, an extensive neuro-cognitive evaluation and metrics of intrinsic connectivity as highlighted by resting-state brain activity. We addressed an inherent property of intrinsic activity such as intra-network coherence, the temporal correlation of the slow synchronous fluctuations within resting-state networks, representing an early biomarker of alterations in the functional brain architecture underlying cognitive functioning. AUD patients displayed executive impairments involving working-memory, attention and visuomotor speed, reflecting abnormal coherence of activity and grey matter atrophy within default mode, in addition to the attentional and the executive networks. The stronger relationship between fronto-lateral coherent activity and executive performance in patients than controls highlighted possible compensatory mechanisms counterbalancing the decreased functionality of networks driving the switch from automatic to controlled behavior. These results provide novel insights into AUD patients&amp;amp;rsquo; cognitive impairments, their neural bases, and possible targets of rehabilitative interventions.</p>

	<p>Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a rare group of heterogeneous genetic and metabolic disorders, caused by loss of functions of several enzymes that are involved in glycosaminoglycan catabolism. Their progressive accumulations in cells, tissues, and consequently, organs lead to several clinical manifestations, such as musculoskeletal involvement. Indeed, the most common manifestation in the central nervous system is represented by cervical spinal stenosis due to bony alterations or dural thickening. Cervical involvement can commonly cause myelopathy and instability exerting severe symptoms. A prompt diagnosis and treatment of the aforementioned conditions is mandatory to ensure a better quality of life in patients with such debilitating disorders. Nevertheless, a clear consensus about their management (i.e., surgical or not) is still lacking, leading to an inevitable delay. This review aims to investigate and discuss the main causes of myelopathy in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses, available therapeutic strategies, and the impact and role of surgery on the neurological outcome.</p>

	<p>Recently, B&amp;amp;auml;chinger et al. developed a software that measures the angle between the vestibular aqueduct proximal to the vestibule and the distal vestibular aqueduct on computed tomography (CT) scans and found differences in the vestibular aqueduct angle between the hypoplastic and degenerative categories of Meniere&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (MD). Hypoplastic radiological findings were associated with the development of bilateral MD and hypoplastic changes were not found outside of fetal temporal bones and individuals with MD. The purpose of this study is to examine how the software developed by B&amp;amp;auml;chinger et al. performs when applied to a large dataset of adult patients with varied otologic diagnoses. Adult patients who underwent high resolution flat panel CT scans without intravenous contrast (n = 301) were retrospectively reviewed. Measurements of the angle of the vestibular aqueduct were made using the previously developed software tool. The tool could be applied to measure the vestibular aqueduct angle in most CT scans of the temporal bones (n = 572 ears, 95%). While the majority of ears fell within the normal range of &amp;amp;lt;120 degrees (n = 462, 80%), fourteen ears (2.3%) in 13 patients were found to have vestibular aqueduct angles that meet criteria for hypoplastic MD (&amp;amp;gt;140 degrees). Only one of the 13 patients had a diagnosis of MD and not in the ear in the hypoplastic category. An inconsistent pattern of other otologic diagnoses were found among the 13 individuals meeting criteria for hypoplastic MD. Although prior reports indicate the software has prognostic value in individuals with MD, these results suggest that the software may have lower positive predictive value when applied to a large population of individuals with varied otologic diagnoses.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative measures of topographic and divergent/convergent connectivity in diffusion MRI of the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Spatial features of connections, such as topography and divergence/convergence, reflect the information-processing mechanisms crucial for understanding and modeling the brain. However, this has not yet been comprehensively investigated. Using diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data, we developed a topographic factor (TF) and divergence/convergence factor (DC) to quantitatively explore the spatial connectivity patterns of one entire hemisphere of the human cerebral cortex. In the analysis, the early sensory areas, which are located far away from the center of the cerebral cortex, exhibited high topographic connectivity. In contrast, the limbic system, which is located proximal to the center, showed high divergence/convergence in two types of connectivity: one region to another region at the region-to-region level, and one region to all other regions at the global level. Topography had anti-correlation with divergence/convergence over the cerebral cortex, and the two types of divergence/convergence displayed positive correlation with each other. These results suggest that topographic and divergent/convergent connectivity are spatially organized with respect to cytoarchitecture over the cerebral cortex to optimize energy efficiency and information transfer performance in the cerebral cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The forward variable selection based optimized decoding toolbox for neuroimaging data</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning (ML) applications have attracted increasing interest in multiple scientific fields, including neuroimaging data research. However, optimizing feature selection from high-dimensional neuroimaging data has been challenging using standard ML algorithms. Here, we introduce an efficient ML package incorporating a forward variable selection (FVS) algorithm that optimizes the identification of neural features for both classification and regression models. In this study, we applied the FVS approach to a neuroimaging dataset and demonstrated the effectiveness of this novel approach. In the ML framework, the best ML model for an input neuroimaging dataset can be automatically selected. Moreover, the toolbox can be executed in a parallel environment for efficient computation. The parallelized FVS algorithm iteratively selects the best feature pair compared against the previous steps to maximize the predictive performance. As a proof of concept, we obtained regional gray matter volume data extracted using an automated brain structure parcellation method from 1,113 samples acquired from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset, and examined the performance on classifiers and regression models predicting sex and age, respectively. The FVS approach significantly improved the accuracy of the ML algorithm over the counterpart model without FVS. Furthermore, the use of parallel computation considerably reduced the computational burden of the FVS approach for the analysis of high-dimensional MRI data. The proposed method could be used to more effectively identify the best model and detect a specific number of brain regions whose functions should be investigated in future studies. The results revealed that the parallelized FVS toolbox may be a promising tool to efficiently improve the performance of classification and regression models on MRI data and should be applicable to other neuroimaging data and more.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Formal cooperation in macaque monkeys obtained via single-payoff change from formal coordination games</a></h4>

              
                Coordination and cooperation are hallmarks of the behavior of social animals. Coordination requires common choices to obtain maximum benefit, whereas cooperation requires to forgo immediate selfish outcome for later common maximum benefit. A well validated economic game for investigating cooperation is Prisoner Dilemma (PD). Recent studies show that monkeys cooperate to a limited extent when playing an iterated PD. In our experiment, macaque monkeys made choices on a touchscreen to obtain juice reward whose amount depended on the choices of both animals. We designed four coordination games and two cooperation games (iterated PD) that differed only in a single payoff (the so-called temptation) while all other payoffs remained constant. The increasing temptation payoff resulted in performance that varied somewhat in the coordination game (probability of common choice between p = 0.55 and p = 0.70) but dropped in both cooperation games while nevertheless remaining significant (p = 0.28 to p = 0.68). The response time of the second player increased significantly when the first player chose the cooperative option across all games, suggesting reciprocation; further, the animals seemed to benefit from seeing the action of the other player, indicating that the choices incorporated a social component. Taken together, our results demonstrate good cooperation in the iterated PD by macaque monkeys after being primed with coordination games.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced progranulin increases tau and alpha-synuclein inclusions and alters phenotypes of tauopathy mice via glucocerebrosidase</a></h4>

              
                Comorbid proteinopathies are observed in many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease (AD), increase with age, and influence clinical outcomes, yet the mechanisms remain ill-defined. Here, we show that reduction of progranulin (PGRN), a lysosomal protein associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy, also increases tau inclusions, causes concomitant accumulation of -synuclein and worsens mortality and disinhibited behaviors in tauopathy mice. The increased inclusions paradoxically protect against spatial memory deficit and hippocampal neurodegeneration. PGRN reduction with tau pathology attenuates activity of {beta}-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), a protein previously associated with synucleinopathy, while increasing glucosylceramide (GlcCer)-positive tau inclusions. In neuronal culture, GCase inhibition enhances tau aggregation induced by AD-tau. Furthermore, purified GlcCer directly promotes tau aggregation in vitro. Neurofibrillary tangles in human tauopathies are also GlcCer-immunoreactive. Thus, in addition to TDP-43, PGRN regulates tau- and synucleinopathies via GCase and GlcCer. A lysosomal PGRN-GCase pathway may be a common therapeutic target for age-related comorbid proteinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Figure-ground segmentation based on motion in the archerfish</a></h4>

              
                Object detection and recognition is a complex computational task that is thought to rely critically on the ability to segment an object from the background. Mammals exhibit varying figure-ground segmentation capabilities, ranging from primates that can perform well on figure-ground segmentation tasks to rodents that perform poorly. To explore figure-ground segmentation capabilities in teleost fish, we studied how the archerfish, an expert visual hunter, performs figure-ground segmentation. We trained archerfish to discriminate foreground objects from the background, where the figures were defined by motion as well as by discontinuities in intensity and texture. Specifically, the figures were defined by grating, naturalistic texture, and random noise moving in counterphase with the background. The archerfish performed the task well and could distinguish between all three types of figures and grounds. Their performance was comparable to that of primates and outperformed rodents. These findings suggest the existence of a complex visual process in the archerfish visual system that enables the delineation of figures as distinct from backgrounds, and provide insights into object recognition in this animal.

                <p>The occurrence of motor/vocal tics, i.e. “extra-movements” and/or “extra-vocalizations”, is the leading diagnostic criterion for tic disorders. We show that extra-movements are common also in healthy controls, so that a surplus of movements per se is not indicative of the presence of a tic disorder. This questions the usefulness of DSM-5 criteria for tic disorders in clinical practice. Apparently, it is not solely a surplus of movements which defines tic disorders. Instead, movement characteristics and patterns seem to play a crucial role.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers that differentiate migraine from cluster headache patients and imaging features that are shared.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, functional and structural MRI data were obtained from 20 migraineurs, 20 cluster headache patients and 15 healthy controls. Support vector machine algorithms and a stepwise removal process were used to discriminate headache patients from controls, and subgroups of patients. Regional between-group differences and association between imaging features and patients’ clinical characteristics were also investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The accuracy for classifying headache patients from controls was 80%. The classification accuracy for discrimination between migraine and controls was 89%, and for cluster headache and controls it was 98%. For distinguishing cluster headache from migraine patients, the MRI	 classifier yielded an accuracy of 78%, while MRI-clinical combined classification model achieved an accuracy of 99%. Bilateral hypothalamic and periaqueductal gray (PAG) functional networks were the most important MRI features in classifying migraine and cluster headache patients from controls. The left thalamic network was the most discriminative MRI feature in classifying migraine from cluster headache patients. Compared to migraine, cluster headache patients showed decreased functional interaction between the left thalamus and cortical areas mediating interoception and sensory integration. The presence of restlessness was the most important clinical feature in discriminating the two groups of patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Functional biomarkers, including the hypothalamic and PAG networks, are shared by migraine and cluster headache patients. The thalamo-cortical pathway may be the neural substrate that differentiates migraine from cluster headache attacks with their distinct clinical features.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Changes in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) may contribute to disease progression. Here, we systematically quantified ultrastructural and subcellular characteristics of the axon-myelin unit in MS NAWM and determined how this correlates with low grade inflammation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human brain tissue obtained with short post-mortem delay and fixation at autopsy enables systematic quantification of ultrastructural characteristics. In this study, we performed high-resolution immunohistochemistry and quantitative transmission electron microscopy to study inflammation and ultrastructural characteristics of the axon-myelin unit in MS NAWM (n=8) and control white matter (WM) in the optic nerve.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the MS NAWM, there were more activated and phagocytic microglia cells (HLA<sup>+</sup>P2RY12<sup>-</sup> and Iba1<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup>) and more T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>) compared to control WM, mainly located in the perivascular space. In MS NAWM compared to control WM there were, as expected, longer paranodes and juxtaparanodes and larger overlap between paranodes and juxtaparanodes. There was less compact myelin wrapping, a lower g-ratio, and a higher frequency of axonal mitochondria. Changes in myelin and axonal mitochondrial frequency correlated positively with the number of active and phagocytic microglia and lymphocytes in the optic nerve.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data suggest that in MS NAWM myelin detachment and uncompact myelin wrapping occurs, potassium channels are unmasked at the nodes of Ranvier, and axonal energy demand is increased, or mitochondrial transport is stagnated, accompanied by increased presence of activated and phagocytic microglia and T cells. These sub-clinical alterations to the axon-myelin unit in MS NAWM may be contributing to disease progression.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In addition to typical nasal symptoms, patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) will further lead to symptoms related to brain function such as hyposmia, anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, memory loss, etc., which seriously affect the quality of life of patients and bring a heavy burden to the patient's family and society. Some scholars have speculated that there may be potential “nose-brain communication” mechanism in AR that rely on neuro-immunity. This mechanism plays an important role in AR-associated brain response process. However, no study has directly demonstrated which neural circuits will change in the connection between the nose and brain during the onset of AR, and the mechanism which underlines this question is also lack. Focusing on the topic of “nose-brain communication”, this paper systematically summarizes the latest research progress between AR and related brain responses and discusses the mechanism of AR-related neurological phenotypes. Hope new diagnostic and therapeutic targets to ameliorate the brain function-related symptoms and improve the quality of life of AR patients will be developed.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Opioid receptor architecture for the modulation of brainstem functions</a></h4>

              
                Opioids produce profound and diverse effects on a range of behaviors, many driven by brainstem activity; however, the presence of opioid and opioid-like receptors at this level has been poorly studied outside of nociceptive structures and components of respiratory circuitry. While previous studies identified expression of {micro}, {delta}, {kappa}, and nociceptin opioid and opioid-like receptors in the brainstem, patterns have not been fully delineated, and neither has receptor coexpression nor the behavioral implications of their expression in most structures. We aimed to elucidate expression patterns for all four receptors across somatosensory-motor, auditory, and respiratory brainstem circuits; identify recurring themes to provide insight into the mechanisms by which exogenous opioids affect broader brainstem circuits; and characterize the function of endogenous opioids in subcortical processing and behavior modulation. Using a fluorescent reporter mouse line for each receptor, we created a comprehensive atlas of brainstem receptor distribution and identified novel expression patterns in modality-specific circuits. Each receptor showed unique expression patterns across the brainstem with minimal correlation between receptors. Orofacial somatosensory-motor circuits expressed all four receptors, though generally in distinct regions, suggesting differential opiate modulation of afferent and efferent trigeminal signaling. Within the auditory circuits, receptors segregated along the vertical and horizontal processing pathways with minimal colocalization. Finally, the respiratory circuit strongly expressed the {micro} opioid receptor in multiple crucial structures with minimal presence of the other three receptors. We further assessed the functional significance of these expression patterns, using the respiratory circuitry as an example, by characterizing respiratory responses to selective opioid agonists, finding that each agonist caused unique alterations in breathing pattern and/or breath shape. Together, these results establish a comprehensive atlas of opioid and opioid-like receptor expression throughout the brainstem, laying the essential groundwork for further evaluation of opioid neuromodulation across the broad spectrum of behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic oscillations in the midbrain dopaminergic nuclei in mice</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine release in the forebrain by midbrain ventral tegmental nucleus (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) neurons is implicated in reward processing, goal-directed learning, and decision-making. Rhythmic oscillations of neural excitability underlie coordination of network processing, and have been reported in these dopaminergic nuclei at several frequency bands. This paper provides a comparative characterization of several frequencies of oscillations of local field potential and single unit activity, highlighting some behavioral correlates. We recorded from optogenetically identified dopaminergic sites in mice training in operant olfactory and visual discrimination tasks. Rayleigh and Pairwise Phase Consistency (PPC) analyses revealed some VTA/SNc neurons phase-locked to each frequency range, with fast spiking interneurons (FSIs) prevalent at 1-2.5 Hz (slow) and 4 Hz bands, and dopaminergic neurons predominant in the theta band. More FSIs than dopaminergic neurons were phase-locked in the slow and 4 Hz bands during many task events. The highest incidence of phase-locking in neurons was in the slow and 4 Hz bands, and occurred during the delay between the operant choice and trial outcome (reward or punishment) signals. These data provide a basis for further examination of rhythmic coordination of activity of dopaminergic nuclei with other brain structures, and its impact for adaptive behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reach corrections toward moving targets are faster than reach corrections toward jumping targets</a></h4>

              
                Visually guided reaching is a common motor behavior that engages subcortical circuits to mediate rapid corrections. These circuits help us successfully grasp objects we see, even if those objects move during the reach. Although these neural mechanisms have evolved for interaction with the physical world, they are almost always studied in the context of reaching toward virtual targets displayed on a computer or projection screen. Virtual targets are unrealistic both because they cannot be physically grasped and because they generally move by "jumping" from one place to another instantaneously. Recent work has indicated that various aspects of "real" visual stimuli, including proximity and graspability, elicit distinct neural activity. In this study, we instructed participants to perform rapid reaches to physical targets. On some trials, these targets either moved realistically (continuously from one position to another) or unrealistically (jumping instantaneously to an equivalent position). Participants were consistently faster in correcting their reach trajectories when the target moved continuously.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping whole brain effects of infrared neural stimulation with positron emission tomography</a></h4>

              
                The combination of neuroimaging and targeted neuromodulation is a crucial tool to gain a deeper understanding of neural networks at a circuit level. Infrared neurostimulation (INS) is a promising optical modality that allows to evoke neuronal activity with high spatial resolution without need for the introduction of exogenous substances in the brain. Here, we report the use of whole-brain functional [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging during INS in the dorsal striatum, performed using a multifunctional soft neural probe. We demonstrate the possibility to identify multi-circuit connection patterns in both cortical and subcortical brain regions within a single scan. By using a bolus plus infusion FDG-PET scanning protocol, we were able to observe the metabolic rate evolution in these regions during the experiments and correlate its variation with the onset of the INS stimulus. Due to the focality of INS and the large amount of viable molecular targets for PET, this novel approach to simultaneous imaging and stimulation is highly versatile. This pilot study can pave the way to further understand the brain connectivity on a global scale.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Release of large synaptic DCV proteins is triggered by Ca2+-independent Rugose-localized complexin phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal dense-core vesicles (DCVs) contain neuropeptides and much larger proteins such as the 70 kDa protease TPA, which contributes to long-term potentiation and synaptic growth. Rather than using full collapse exocytosis that is common in endocrine cells, DCVs at a native intact synapse, the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, release their contents via fusion pores formed by kiss and run exocytosis. Here fluorogen activating protein (FAP) imaging reveals the limited permeability range of synaptic DCV fusion pores and then shows that this constraint is circumvented by cAMP-induced extra fusions with dilating pores that result in DCV emptying. These Ca2+ independent full fusions require PKA-R2, a PKA phosphorylation site on the fusion clamp protein complexin and the acute presynaptic function of Rugose/Neurobeachin, a PKA-R2 anchor implicated in learning and autism. Therefore, localized Ca2+-independent signaling triggers the opening of dilating fusion pores to release large DCV cargo proteins that cannot pass through fusion pores that normally dominate Ca2+-dependent synaptic protein release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxytocin enhances the triangular association among behavioral performance, resting state, and task-state functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                The role of oxytocin (OT) in social behavior and social brain networks has been widely documented. However, the effect of OT on the association between social behavior and brain functional connectivity (FC) is yet to be comprehensively explored. In this study, using a face-perception task and multiple connectome-based predictive (CPM) models, we aimed to: 1) determine whether OT could enhance the association between task behavioral performance, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), and task-state functional connectivity (tsFC), and 2) if so, determine the role of OT in enhancing this triangular association. We found that both rsFC and tsFC could independently and significantly predict task performance in the OT group, but not in the placebo (PL) group. In addition, the correlation coefficient between rsFC and tsFC was substantially higher in the OT group than in the PL group. The strength of these associations could be partly explained by OT altering the brains FCs related to social cognition and face-perception in both resting and task states, mainly in brain regions such as the limbic system, prefrontal cortex (PFC), temporal poles (TP), and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Together, these results suggest that neuropeptides can increase the consistency of individual differences in different modalities (e.g., behavioral and brain level data).

	<p>This paper reviews the principles identified in analytic neuroscience that could be used in the setup of an international project, &amp;amp;ldquo;Hippocrates&amp;amp;rdquo; (H-project), named after the author of the endocrine theory of temperaments. The H-project can aim to summarize the findings in functional neurochemistry of consistent behavioural patterns (CBPs) in health (such as temperament traits) and psychopathology (symptoms of psychiatric disorders); to have systematically structured neurochemical investigations; to have an analysis of CBPs that include all ranges of behavioural histories and to have these modules complemented by regional contrasts related to climate, diets and other bio-environmental factors. The review highlights the benefits of constructivism and illustrates the contrast between constructivism and current approaches in terms of analytic and methodological aspects. (1) &amp;amp;ldquo;Where&amp;amp;rdquo; the neurochemical biomarkers should be measured: the review expands the range of needed measurements to out-of-brain systems, including environmental factors, and explores the concept of Specialized Extended Phenotype. (2) &amp;amp;ldquo;What&amp;amp;rdquo; should be measured but is missing: the review points to the need for measurement of the &amp;amp;ldquo;Throw &amp;amp;amp; Catch&amp;amp;rdquo; neurochemical relays; behavioural and neuronal events contributing to the consistency of the CBPs but not documented in measurements. (3) Structuring the H-project&amp;amp;rsquo;s setup: the paper briefly describes a proposed earlier neurochemical framework, Functional Ensemble of Temperament that that accommodates the neurochemical continuum between temperament and symptoms of psychiatric disorders. This framework is in line with documented &amp;amp;ldquo;Throw &amp;amp;amp; Catch&amp;amp;rdquo; neurochemical relays and can also be used to organize data about the personal and professional history of an individual.</p>

	<p>It is generally believed that working memory (WM) is dysfunctional in depression. However, whether this impaired performance originates from impaired encoding, maintenance or both stages is still unclear. Here, we aimed to decompose the abnormal characteristics of encoding and maintenance in patients with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD). Thirty patients and thirty-nine healthy controls completed a spatial working memory task where the encoding time and the retention time could vary under different load levels. Encoding performance was assessed by comparing accuracies between short and long encoding times, and maintenance performance was assessed by comparing accuracies between short and long retention times. The results show a lower performance in depression than the controls. However, while the decreased accuracy by long retention (vs. short retention) was increased by a short encoding time in the control group, the retention performance of the depression group did not further suffer from the short encoding time. The generally impaired encoding, together with limited maintenance of immunity against the constrained encoding time, suggests a common bias for fixed internal processing over external processing in recurrent MDD. The paradigm provided in this study can be a convenient and efficient clinical test for assessing the WM encoding and maintenance function.</p>

	<p>Bilateral cingulotomy is a procedure applied to patients with obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD). This report presents the structural changes occurring within the forceps minor and arcuate fascicles nerve fibers after a successful bilateral anterior cingulotomy in the patient with refractory OCD. Cingulotomy mainly affects the values of FA, MD, and ADC in the treatment of the examined nerve bundles. This structural reorganization coexists with a good clinical effect. However, it is necessary to expand the study group and to investigate the correlation between the parameters of diffusion and anisotropy and the patient&#039;s clinical condition (Y-BOCS scale).</p>

	<p>Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), a central disorder of hypersomnolence, is associated with mood, anxiety or hyperactivity mental disorders. Association with psychotic episode or schizophrenia is rare and could be the source of diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. Their frequency in the national narcolepsy database has not been systematically studied. The aim of the presented study was to calculate the frequency of NT1 patients diagnosed with psychosis and/or schizophrenia, to identify clinical characteristics of these cases, and to look for narcoleptic and psychotic symptoms during re-evaluation years later. We identified three (4%) cases diagnosed with a psychotic episode in the course of NT1. They were diagnosed with NT1 by age &amp;amp;le;18 years. In the re-evaluation (mean follow-up 9.8 years), we identified one case with a dual diagnosis of NT1 and schizophrenia; two cases were diagnosed with a solitary psychotic episode in the course of NT1. NT1 patients diagnosed in the age &amp;amp;le;18 years are at higher risk of psychotic episode, and this may be related to higher vulnerability during the ongoing neurodevelopmental period. Comorbid schizophrenia with NT1 in the Slovakian Narcolepsy Database was within the prevalence expected in the general population. The solitary psychotic episode in the course of NT1 did not reduce the possibility of subsequent symptomatic treatment afterwards.</p>

	<p>The X chromosome gene PLP1 encodes myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), the most prevalent protein in the myelin sheath surrounding the central nervous system. X-linked dysmyelinating disorders such as Pelizaeus&amp;amp;ndash;Merzbacher disease (PMD) or spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2) are typically caused by point mutations in PLP1. Nevertheless, numerous case reports have shown individuals with PLP1 missense point mutations which also presented clinical symptoms and indications that were consistent with the diagnostic criteria of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord with no current cure. Computational structural biology methods were used to assess the impact of these mutations on the stability and flexibility of PLP structure in order to determine the role of PLP1 mutations in MS pathogenicity. The analysis showed that most of the variants can alter the functionality of the protein structure such as R137W variants which results in loss of helix and H140Y which alters the ordered protein interface. In silico genomic methods were also performed to predict the significance of these mutations associated with impairments in protein functionality and could suggest a better definition for therapeutic strategies and clinical application in MS patients.</p>

	<p>There have been numerous detractors and supporters relating to attempts to merge the neurosciences and the knowledge base of related contributing disciplines with the field of education. Some have argued that this is a &amp;amp;ldquo;bridge too far&amp;amp;rdquo;. The predominant view is that the relationship between neuroscience and the classroom has been neither significantly examined, nor applied. What is needed is a specially trained class of professionals whose role it would be to guide the introduction of cognitive neuroscience into educational practice in a sensible and ethical manner. Neuroeducators would play a pivotal role in assessing the quality of evidence purporting to be relevant to education, assessing who is best placed to employ newly developed knowledge, as well as with what safeguards, in addition to investigating how to deal with unexpected consequences of implemented research findings. This special issue of the &amp;amp;ldquo;The Brain Goes to School&amp;amp;rdquo; aims to provide support for the development of training programs that truly integrate curriculum design and classroom instruction with the developmental cognitive neurosciences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sounding the Alarm: Sex Differences in Rat Ultrasonic Vocalizations during Pavlovian Fear Conditioning and Extinction</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Pavlovian fear conditioning is a prevalent tool in the study of aversive learning, which is a key component of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Adult rats can exhibit various threat-related behaviors, including freezing, motor responses, and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). While these responses can all signal aversion, we know little about how they relate to one another. Here we characterize USVs emitted by male and female rats during cued fear acquisition and extinction, and assess the relationship between different threat-related behaviors. We found that males consistently emitted &gt;22 kHz calls (referred to here as "alarm calls") than females, and that alarm call frequency in males, but not females, related to the intensity of the shock stimulus. Interestingly, 25% of males and 45% of females did not emit any alarm calls at all. Males that did make alarm calls had significantly higher levels of freezing than males who did not, while no differences in freezing were observed between female Alarm callers and Non-alarm callers. Alarm call emission was also affected by the predictability of the shock; when unpaired from a tone cue, both males and females started emitting alarm calls significantly later. During extinction learning and retrieval sessions, males were again more likely than females to emit alarm calls, which followed an extinction-like reduction in frequency. Collectively these data suggest sex dependence in how behavioral readouts relate to innate and conditioned threat responses. Importantly, we suggest that the same behaviors can signal sex-dependent features of aversion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Using SuperClomeleon to Measure Changes in Intracellular Chloride during Development and after Early Life Stress</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Intraneuronal chloride concentrations ([Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB>) decrease during development resulting in a shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA responses via chloride-permeable GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors. This GABA shift plays a pivotal role in postnatal brain development, and can be strongly influenced by early life experience. Here, we assessed the applicability of the recently developed fluorescent SuperClomeleon (SClm) sensor to examine changes in [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> using two-photon microscopy in brain slices. We used SClm mice of both sexes to monitor the developmental decrease in neuronal chloride levels in organotypic hippocampal cultures. We could discern a clear reduction in [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> between day <I>in vitro</I> (DIV)3 and DIV9 (equivalent to the second postnatal week <I>in vivo</I>) and a further decrease in some cells until DIV22. In addition, we assessed alterations in [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of postnatal day (P)9 male SClm mouse pups after early life stress (ELS). ELS was induced by limiting nesting material between P2 and P9. ELS induced a shift toward higher (i.e., immature) chloride levels in layer 2/3 cells in the mPFC. Although conversion from SClm fluorescence to absolute chloride concentrations proved difficult, our study underscores that the SClm sensor is a powerful tool to measure physiological changes in [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> in brain slices.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The performance of lipid profiles and ratios as a predictor of arterial stiffness measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity in type 2 diabetic patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early identification of arterial stiffness in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients before the manifestation of atherosclerosis would be clinically beneficial. Our study aimed to explore the correlation of lipid profiles and ratios with arterial stiffness, and construct a predictive model for arterial stiffness in T2DM patients using those parameters. Methods: One hundred and eighty-four adult T2DM patients in the diabetes outpatient clinic at the Dr. Soetomo general academic hospital were enrolled in this cross-sectional study in 2015 and 2019. Sociodemographic, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) data were collected from all subjects. The subjects were divided into a group with arterial stiffness (ba-PWV > 18 m/sec) and without arterial stiffness (ba-PWV ≤ 18 m/sec). A correlation test was used to evaluate the association, and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves analysis were used to determine the cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity. The risk analysis model was calculated using bivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The group with arterial stiffness had higher lipid profiles: total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and lipid ratios. A significant positive correlation was found between TC, TG, LDL-C, and all lipid ratios with ba-PWV. A negative correlation was found between HDL-C and ba-PWV. All lipid ratio parameters can be used as predictors of arterial stiffness, especially non-HDL-C with cut-off value: 150 mg/dL (sensitivity 96.8% and specificity 52.9%) and TG/HDL-C ratio with cut-off value: 4.51 (sensitivity 81.0% and specificity 74.2%). Elevated TG/HDL-C ratio and non-HDL-C displayed higher risk (OR: 12.293 and 16.312; p < 0.05) of having arterial stiffness compared to other lipid ratios. Conclusions: Lipid profiles and lipid ratios, especially TG/HDL-C ratio and non-HDL-C, are potential biochemical markers for arterial stiffness in T2DM patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Health literacy on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccinations in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Health literacy on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects people’s capability to ascertain their health and health care quality during the pandemic. The objective of this study was to determine the levels of health literacy about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccinations (Vaccines and Vaccinations literacy-VL) in the Indonesian adult general population, assessing the perceptions of the respondents about current adult immunization and beliefs about vaccinations in general, and analyzing correlations of these variables with the VL levels. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a rapid survey was administered via the Internet. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics; the internal consistency of the VL scales was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient; the inter-correlation between the functional and interactive-critical VL questions, the underlying components (factors) and each question’s load on the components were identified using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). An alpha level lesser than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Responses to functional- and interactive/ critical- VL questions were acceptable and showed internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.817 and 0.699, respectively), lowest values observed were 0.806 for functional scale and 0.640 for the interactive-critical scale. The PCA demonstrated that there were two components accounting for 52.45% of the total variability. Approximately 60% of respondents were females (n=686). Almost all respondents used the internet to seek information regarding COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccinations. Many used at least one social media actively with 74.4% of respondents sometimes believing the validity of this information. Conclusions: High scores were observed in both functional- and interactive/ critical-VL, and were quite in a balance between sexes in the prior VL and higher in females for the latter; these were also closely related to the educational level and age group. It is crucial to increase public health literacy in managing the pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Helicobacter pylori prevalence in Indonesia: Higher infection risk in Eastern region population [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection status in Indonesia might be higher than the actual prevalence. A comprehensive epidemiologic study is necessary to explore infection susceptibility by demographic characteristics, especially between Indonesia’s Eastern and Western regions. Methods: We included our recent survey and data from our previous studies with 1,172 endoscopic examinations from 19 cities throughout Indonesia from January 2014 to March 2017. H. pylori infection was diagnosed based on the combination of four different tests. Using a criterion of one positive result between four tests, we found that 190 subjects (190/1,158; 16.4%) were H. pylori positive. A total of 939 subjects were analyzed for risk factors of sociodemographic characteristics to H. pylori infection. Results: Prevalence was slightly higher in the Eastern region compared with the Western region of Indonesia (79/277; 59.4% vs. 54/529; 40.6%). Living in the Eastern region imposes a higher risk of infection (OR 5.33, 95%CI 1.17–24.26). Timor ethnicity had the highest prevalence (15/28; 53.6%), followed by Buginese ethnic (21/74; 28.4%), and Papuan ethnic (18/64; 28.1%) in the Eastern region. As an ethnicity with a high prevalence (37/109; 33.9%), Batak was an outlier among the low prevalence areas in the Western region. In general, age, living in the Eastern region, Batak ethnicity, Protestant, Catholic, and alcohol drinking were independent risk factors associated with H. pylori infection in Indonesia (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.02–1.05; OR 5.33, 95%CI 1.17–24.26; OR 5.89, 95%CI 1.58–21.94; OR 5.47, 95%CI 2.16–13.86; OR 5.05, 95%CI 1.43–17.80; OR 2.30, 95%CI 1.14–4.61, respectively). Conclusions: Several ethnicities and habits were concluded to increase the risk of infection as the interaction of host, agent, and environment is inseparable in affecting disease susceptibility.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Manual annotation of Drosophila genes: a Genomics Education Partnership protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Annotating the genomes of multiple species allows us to analyze the evolution of their genes. While many eukaryotic genome assemblies already include computational gene predictions, these predictions can benefit from review and refinement through manual gene annotation. The Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; https://thegep.org/) developed a structural annotation protocol for protein-coding genes that enables undergraduate student and faculty researchers to create high-quality gene annotations that can be utilized in subsequent scientific investigations. For example, this protocol has been utilized by the GEP faculty to engage undergraduate students in the comparative annotation of genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway in 27 Drosophila species, using D. melanogaster as the reference genome. Students construct gene models using multiple lines of computational and empirical evidence including expression data (e.g., RNA-Seq), sequence similarity (e.g., BLAST and multiple sequence alignment), and computational gene predictions. Quality control measures require each gene be annotated by at least two students working independently, followed by reconciliation of the submitted gene models by a more experienced student. This article provides an overview of the annotation protocol and describes how discrepancies in student submitted gene models are resolved to produce a final, high-quality gene set suitable for subsequent analyses. The protocol can be adapted to other scientific questions (e.g., expansion of the Drosophila Muller F element) and species (e.g., parasitoid wasps) to provide additional opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in genomics research. These student annotation efforts can substantially improve the quality of gene annotations in publicly available genomic databases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Expression of Fascin and SALL4 in odontogenic cysts and tumors: an immunohistochemical appraisal. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Various stemness markers (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) have been studied in odontogenic cysts and tumors. However, studies on SALL4 having similar properties of stemness has not been documented. Additionally, insight into fascin as a migratory molecule is less explored. In this study, the expression of SALL4 and fascin were evaluated in ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), dentigerous cyst (DC), radicular cyst (RC), and calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC). Methods: Semi-quantitative analysis of fascin and SALL4 immuno-positive cells was done in a total of 40 cases of ameloblastoma (11 plexiform, 12 follicular, 12 unicystic, and 5 desmoplastic) variants, 6 cases of AOT, 15 each of OKC, DC, RC and 5 of COC. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the association between SALL4 and fascin expression in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Results: Fascin immunopositivity was observed in peripheral ameloblast-like cells, and weak or absent in stellate reticulum-like cells. A moderate to weak immune-reactivity to SALL4 was observed in the cytoplasm of ameloblastoma, epithelial cells of dentigerous and radicular cysts, having a marked inflammatory infiltrate, which is an interesting observation. COC and AOT had negative to weak expressions. No recurrence has been reported. Conclusions: Expression of fascin in ameloblastomas elucidate their role in motility and localized invasion. Its expression in less aggressive lesions like DC, COC, AOT will incite to explore the other functional properties of fascin. SALL4 expression in the cytoplasm of odontogenic cysts and tumors may represent inactive or mutant forms which requires further validation.

                Background: Dracunculus medinensis or "Guinea-worm" is the parasitic worm that causes Dracunculiasis disease. The Cyclops (Meso and Micro Cyclops), which is only spread through drinking from water sources in endemic areas, carries this worm. This study aimed to detect and identify Cyclops in wells water, Jabal Awliya locality Khartoum state, Sudan 2021 Methods: This is a cross sectional study held in Jabal Awliya locality which is located in Khartoum state Sudan from 2021-2022. The locality is one of the seven localities in the state which is considered as the main gate for the refugees from South Sudan, Chad and Ethiopia where Dracunculus medinensis has not been eradicated yet. The population is 274,321. Results: A total of 264 samples were collected,132 from well’s water and 132 from post wells water sources. Well’s water contamination with cyclops was found to be 2.4% while post well’s contamination was found to be 8.9%. The species reported by microscopy are: Afrocyclops, Mesocyclops and Microcyclops. Significant statistical difference between well’s and post well’s contamination was found (p-value 0.02). Conclusions: In conclusion, it is apparent that well’s water as well as dam water are contaminated with copepods (Afro-, Meso- and Microcyclops). Hence Residents in the research regions are at hazard for Dracunculus infection whenever larvae make their way to the water sources since mesocyclops and microcyclops are recognized Guinea worm vectors. Since no apparent water treatment system has been found in the areas under study, it is crucial that water sources in this area be treated before consumption in order to reduce the risk of illness.  Awareness by the worm as well as the disease should be raised in order to ensure that the larvae from the hosts will not be carried to the wells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Environmental perceptions of global business travel by Swiss companies in the Zurich airport region [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This article presents findings from research conducted before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on companies located in the Zurich airport region of Switzerland, regarding the needs for global business travel and its impacts. Methods: The study involved a mixed methods approach. Five hypotheses were tested using inferential statistics on data obtained from pre-tested closed questions in a web-based survey. Deeper context was explored through an interview-based case-study conducted at a Swiss pharma company. Results: Supporting alternative hypothesis 3 (Ha(3)), a significant positive relationship was found between travel frequency and business growth, F(1, 100) = 11.31, p = 0.0011. Supporting Ha(4), corporate culture had a significant positive relationship with business travel frequency (F(1, 100) = 15.50, p = 0.0002) and average trip length (F(1, 100) = 6.39, p = 0.01). And thirdly supporting Ha(5), corporate social responsibility had a significant relationship with global business travel (91%). Ho(2) and Ho(3) were accepted. The case study found that smart corporate travel policies and regulations should be instantiated to enhance our environment, which would also benefit employee wellbeing. Travel can be reduced significantly despite being demonstrated that physical co-presence is important for building trust. The case study suggests tools to support the monitoring and management of global business travel by organizations. Conclusions: COVID-19 has impacted travel for business significantly, and future research will be necessary to assess its impact. The article explores the ongoing research in this area, and several relevant implications are proposed for future leaders. The case study found willingness to pay both corporate and individual green taxes, and a deficiency in corporate communication around the environment. Business travel is needed to build trust; however, it can be reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between polymorphisms within the gene coding for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha with outcomes of treatment in a sample of Iraqi patients with ankylosing spondylitis taking etanercept: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a progressive, chronic inflammatory illness with an unclear etiology that explicitly targets the vertebral column, peripheral joints, and extraarticular tissues. The purpose of this research was to investigate if the existence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) gene at positions -1031T/C (rs199964), -857C/T (rs1799724) and -806C/T (rs4248158) in a sample of Iraqi AS patients could influence the patients' outcomes with etanercept. Methods: Sixty patients with established AS receiving only etanercept were selected to enroll in this study, with a mean age of 40.75±8.67 years; 51 patients were male. Patients were classed as "responders" if they obtained a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 50 clinical response and as "non-responders" if they did not achieve a BASDAI 50 clinical improvement after at least six months of treatment. After polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product amplification of the purified blood DNA, the promoter region of TNF-α gene SNPs was established by Sanger sequencing. Results: This research found a significant difference in the TT genotype of rs1799964, P = 0.02, in the responder group, in contrast to the TC genotype of rs1799964, which was significantly more frequent in the non-responder group, P = 0.01. The wild TT genotype of rs1799964 seemed to enhance the probability of being a responder. Nevertheless, the heterozygote TC genotype of rs1799964 showed a negative and significant correlation for responsiveness to etanercept. Conclusion: The TT genotype of rs1799964 is associated with a higher likelihood of responding to ETN, suggesting that it is a valuable diagnostic for predicting response in Iraqi AS patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">CHARACTERIZATION OF BY-PRODUCTS WITH HIGH FAT CONTENT DERIVED FROM THE PRODUCTION OF BOVINE GELATIN [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gelatin is a protein obtained by partial hydrolysis of collagen contained in skins, connective tissue and/or animal bones, which are by-products of the meat industry. The main raw material to produce bovine gelatin is the dermis of the skin, but there is a variation in fat and moisture content depending on the bovine skin origin. As a contribution to the circular economy and sustainability, these by-products with high fat content and the fat released from them during the gelatin production process can be managed for food industries, mainly in the development or formulation of animal feed. Methods: For the initial physicochemical characterization, moisture, fat, protein and ashes content were determined. Once the by-products with high fat content were identified, alteration parameters such as acidity, peroxide and saponification indexes were evaluated. Additionally, thermal, rheological and fatty acid composition characterization was carried out in order to study the possible applications of the by-products. Results and Discussion: The results showed that some of the by-products presented fat content values lower than 15.0%, so the viability of their use is limited. On the other hand, some by-products have more than 30% fat content, however, they can only be removed manually, and the efficiency of this process is low. By-products removed from the supernatant in the extractors presented 99.9 and 98.9% of fat, and there is the possibility of conditioning a mechanical method for their extraction. The determination of alteration and oxidation parameters, thermal and rheological characterization, fatty acid profile and solid fat content were carried out only on these by-products. According to the characterization, these by-products could be valued and used in the formulation of animal feed, however, they present some limitations for some applications such as biodiesel production or food industry.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors contributing to moral distress among intensive care nurses: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The intensive care unit (ICU) is a busy and complex workplace, and several work-related and personal factors are known to make ICU nurses more vulnerable to moral distress than other healthcare professionals. It is crucial to identify these factors to guide future studies and preventive strategies. This scoping review explores such factors to present current knowledge on the factors that trigger moral distress and to guide future research by reviewing studies to explore and summarize factors that trigger moral distress in ICU nurses.   Methods: The PubMed, EBSCO, and CINAHL Plus databases were searched to identify potentially relevant studies published between 2011 to 2022. Inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed studies published in English that provided results regarding factors causes or correlated to moral distress in ICU nurses. After removing 63 duplicates, 371 papers were excluded after title and abstract screening, leaving 47 articles for full-text screening. A further 30 articles were excluded as their outcomes did not include factors that caused moral distress, or were not specific to ICU nurses, so 17 studies were eventually analysed using qualitative content analysis through an inductive approach. The findings of the articles were extracted and coded independently by two authors, and data were grouped and categorized. Results: The content categories of factors contributing to ICU nurses' moral distress were organized into themes and subthemes. Four major themes were identified: Powerlessness, end-of-life care, ineffective teamwork, and personal characteristics of ICU nurses.   Conclusions: This review highlights the factors that contribute to moral distress in critical care nurses, which are mainly attributable to the organizational climate and the nature of the ICU clinical environment. Descriptive and intervention studies (experimental or action research) must investigate causality between identified variables to inform management strategies to improve support for ICU nurses’ coping relative to moral distress.

                Background: The goal was to determine the thickness and width of the knee joint meniscus at their different regions. The objective was to compare the dimensions at these regions and over the right- and left-sided specimens. Methods: The present study included 50 adult cadaveric knee joints, and 100 menisci (50 medial menisci and 50 lateral menisci) were studied. The meniscus was distributed into anterior, middle and posterior parts. Thickness and width at the mid-point of these three parts were determined by using the Vernier caliper. Results: The breadth of the medial meniscus was 8.38 ± 1.64 mm, 7.68 ± 1.92 mm and 13.93 ± 2.69 mm at the anterior, middle and posterior one-third regions. Same measurements for the lateral menisci at these regions were 9.84 ± 1.78 mm, 8.82 ± 2.01 mm and 10.18 ± 2.23 mm, respectively. The thickness of the medial meniscus was 4.49 ± 0.78 mm, 4.07 ± 0.81 mm and 4.79 ± 0.93 mm at these regions. The lateral meniscus thickness was 3.82 ± 0.69 mm, 4.43 ± 0.98 mm and 4.36 ± 0.8 mm, respectively. Conclusion: It is believed that this data is enlightening to the arthroscopic surgeon during the meniscus transplantation either by using synthetic material or allograft as the proper sizing of the meniscus is important to prevent complications due to inaccurate sizing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of serum leptin and adiponectin levels on breast cancer in postmenopausal Iraqi women: an observational Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor and the second most significant cause of death for women in Iraq, behind cardiovascular diseases. Obesity has been linked to a substantial increase in the risk of breast cancer. Adipose tissue functions as an endocrine gland, controlling the body's metabolism by secreting adipokines, which play a significant role in metabolism and inflammatory reactions. Methods: Overall, 90 postmenopausal women participated in this research. Of these, 60 patients with breast cancer were recruited at Baghdad's Oncology Teaching Hospital between October 2021 and February 2022: 30 were obese with a body mass index (BMI) of > 30 kg/m2 (group 1), and 30 were not obese (group 2). The third group consisted of 30 participants without breast cancer or obesity (group 3). Each person donated five milliliters of venous blood. The blood levels of adiponectin and leptin are determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Results: Control individuals who were not obese (group 3) had greater blood adiponectin levels than patients with cancer who were both obese and non-obese (groups 1 and 2), with no significant difference in serum adiponectin levels seen between groups 1 and 2. The findings also showed that group 1 (patients with breast cancer and obesity) had greater serum leptin levels than both group 2 (patients with breast cancer without obesity) and the control group (group 3), with no significant difference in serum leptin levels between groups 2 and 3. Conclusions: Adiponectin levels in the blood of women with breast cancer and obesity were low which may be due to high BMI, which reduces adiponectin's protective effects. Conversely, Leptin levels were more significant in the blood of women with breast cancer and obesity than in the control group, which may be due to its pro-inflammatory effects in obesity, among other variables.

                Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common oral cancers with a high mortality rate. The biodiversity source in Indonesia makes areca nut a potential antioxidant in treating disease. Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the chemotherapeutic effect of areca nut extract in 4-nutriquinoline-1-oxide (NQO)-tumor-induced rats. Methods:  Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Group 1 served as the control group, group 2 was 4NQO-induced rats without treatment, and groups 3 and 4 were given 4NQO-tumor inducer with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract, respectively. The rats in groups 2,3, and 4 received 30 ppm of 4NQO tumor inducer in drinking water for 12 weeks. In the end, all rats were euthanized and the tongue was removed. The body, liver, kidney, heart, and lungs weights were measured. Tongue tumor volume and dysplasia lesions were analyzed. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor and stromal area were scored semi-quantitatively associating the infiltrate grade (0-3) and analyzed histologically. Results: There were significant differences in body weight loss between the initial and final phases in groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The areca nut at doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW significantly reduced the tumor size compared with groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The incidence of OSCC in rats with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract after 22 weeks was 0%, but the dysplasia lesions were observed at 28.57% and 85.71%, respectively. The highest mean of stromal TILs was in group 3 and there were significant differences in stromal TILs between groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05). Conclusion: Areca nut extract exerts a chemotherapeutic activity in 4NQO-induced rats by inducing infiltrating lymphocytes in the stromal tumor area on the OSCC lesion of the tongue.

                The recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic displayed weaknesses in the healthcare infrastructures worldwide and exposed a lack of specialized personnel to cover the demands of a massive calamity. We have developed a portable ventilator that uses real-time vitals read from the patient to estimate -- through artificial intelligence -- the optimal operation point. The ventilator has redundant telecommunication capabilities; therefore, the remote assistance model can protect specialists and relatives from highly contagious agents. Additionally, we have designed a system that automatically publishes information in a proprietary cloud centralizer to keep physicians and relatives informed. The system was tested in a residential last-mile connection, and transaction times below the second were registered. The timing scheme allows us to operate up to 200 devices concurrently on these lowest-specification transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) services, promptly transmitting data for online processing and reporting. The ventilator is a proof of concept of automation that has behavioral and cognitive inputs to cheaply, yet reliably, extend the installed capacity of the healthcare systems and multiply the response of the skilled medical personnel to cover high-demanding scenarios and improve service quality.

                α-Synuclein belongs to a family of highly conserved proteins that includes β- and γ-synucleins [1]. α-Synuclein is highly expressed throughout the brain and is particularly enriched in the synaptic terminals of neurons [2,3]. It has gained notoriety due to its link to PD and other neurodegenerative diseases termed synucleinopathies [4]. Therefore, research on the pathological role of α-synuclein has grown rapidly, while fewer studies have focused on the physiological function(s) of α-synuclein. Multiple therapeutic strategies aim at reducing α-synuclein levels but have failed so far in clinical trials, indicating a need for better understanding of α-synuclein’s biology and pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Optogenetics and electron tomography for structure-function analysis of cochlear ribbon synapses</a></h4>

              
                Ribbon synapses of cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) are specialized to indefatigably transmit sound information at high rates. To understand the underlying mechanisms, structure-function analysis of the active zone (AZ) of these synapses is essential. Previous electron microscopy studies of synaptic vesicle (SV) dynamics at the IHC AZ used potassium stimulation, which limited the temporal resolution to minutes. Here, we established optogenetic IHC stimulation followed by quick freezing within milliseconds and electron tomography to study the ultrastructure of functional synapse states with good temporal resolution in mice. We characterized optogenetic IHC stimulation by patch-clamp recordings from IHCs and postsynaptic boutons revealing robust IHC depolarization and transmitter release. Ultrastructurally, the number of docked SVs increased upon short (17-25 ms) and long (48-76 ms) light stimulation paradigms. We did not observe enlarged SVs or other morphological correlates of homotypic fusion events. Our results indicate a rapid recruitment of SVs to the docked state upon stimulation and suggest that univesicular release prevails as the quantal mechanism of exocytosis at IHC ribbon synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">On the origin of universal cell shape variability in a confluent epithelial monolayer</a></h4>

              
                Cell shape is fundamental in biology. The average cell shape can influence crucial biological functions, such as cell fate and division orientation. But cell-to-cell shape variability is often regarded as noise. In contrast, recent works reveal that shape variability in diverse epithelial monolayers follows a nearly universal distribution. However, the origin and implications of this universality remain unclear. Here, assuming contractility and adhesion are crucial for cell shape, characterized via aspect ratio (r), we develop a mean-field analytical theory for shape variability. We find that all the system-specific details combine into a single parameter α that governs the probability distribution function (PDF) of r; this leads to a universal relation between the standard deviation and the average of r. The PDF for the scaled r is not strictly but nearly universal. In addition, we obtain the scaled area distribution, described by the parameter μ, α and μ together can distinguish the effects of changing physical conditions, such as maturation, on different system properties. We have verified the theory via simulations of two distinct models of epithelial monolayers and with existing experiments on diverse systems. We demonstrate that in a confluent monolayer, average shape determines both the shape variability and dynamics. Our results imply that cell shape distribution is inevitable, where a single parameter describes both statics and dynamics and provides a framework to analyze and compare diverse epithelial systems. In contrast to existing theories, our work shows that the universal properties are consequences of a mathematical property and should be valid in general, even in the fluid regime.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fan cells in lateral entorhinal cortex directly influence medial entorhinal cortex through synaptic connections in layer 1</a></h4>

              
                Standard models for spatial and episodic memory suggest that the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) send parallel independent inputs to the hippocampus, each carrying different types of information. Here, we evaluate the possibility that information is integrated between divisions of the entorhinal cortex prior to reaching the hippocampus. We demonstrate that, in mice, fan cells in layer 2 (L2) of LEC that receive neocortical inputs, and that project to the hippocampal dentate gyrus, also send axon collaterals to layer 1 (L1) of the MEC. Activation of inputs from fan cells evokes monosynaptic glutamatergic excitation of stellate and pyramidal cells in L2 of the MEC, typically followed by inhibition that contains fast and slow components mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, respectively. Inputs from fan cells also directly activate interneurons in L1 and L2 of MEC, with synaptic connections from L1 interneurons accounting for slow feedforward inhibition of L2 principal cell populations. The relative strength of excitation and inhibition following fan cell activation differs substantially between neurons and is largely independent of anatomical location. Our results demonstrate that the LEC, in addition to directly influencing the hippocampus, can activate or inhibit major hippocampal inputs arising from the MEC. Thus, local circuits in the superficial MEC may combine spatial information with sensory and higher order signals from the LEC, providing a substrate for integration of 'what' and 'where' components of episodic memories.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary divergence in the conformational landscapes of Tyrosine vs Serine/Threonine Kinases</a></h4>

              
                Inactive conformations of protein kinase catalytic domains where the DFG motif has a 'DFG-out' orientation and the activation loop is folded present a druggable binding pocket that is targeted by FDA-approved 'type-II inhibitors' in the treatment of cancers. Tyrosine Kinases (TKs) typically show strong binding affinity with a wide spectrum of type-II inhibitors while Serine/Threonine Kinases (STKs) usually bind more weakly which we suggest here is due to differences in the folded to extended conformational equilibrium of the activation loop between TKs vs. STKs. To investigate this, we use sequence covariation analysis with a Potts Hamiltonian statistical energy model to guide absolute binding free-energy molecular dynamics simulations of 74 protein-ligand complexes. Using the calculated binding free energies together with experimental values, we estimated free-energy costs for the large-scale (~17-20Å) conformational change of the activation loop by an indirect approach, circumventing the very challenging problem of simulating the conformational change directly. We also used the Potts statistical potential to thread large sequence ensembles over active and inactive kinase states. The structure-based and sequence-based analyses are consistent; together they suggest TKs evolved to have free-energy penalties for the classical 'folded activation loop' DFG-out conformation relative to the active conformation that is, on average, 4-6 kcal/mol smaller than the corresponding values for STKs. Potts statistical energy analysis suggests a molecular basis for this observation, wherein the activation loops of TKs are more weakly 'anchored' against the catalytic loop motif in the active conformation, and form more stable substrate-mimicking interactions in the inactive conformation. These results provide insights into the molecular basis for the divergent functional properties of TKs and STKs, and have pharmacological implications for the target selectivity of type-II inhibitors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortical activity during naturalistic music listening reflects short-range predictions based on long-term experience</a></h4>

              
                Expectations shape our experience of music. However, the internal model upon which listeners form melodic expectations is still debated. Do expectations stem from Gestalt-like principles or statistical learning? If the latter, does long-term experience play an important role, or are short-term regularities sufficient? And finally, what length of context informs contextual expectations? To answer these questions, we presented human listeners with diverse naturalistic compositions from Western classical music, while recording neural activity using MEG. We quantified note-level melodic surprise and uncertainty using various computational models of music, including a state-of-the-art transformer neural network. A time-resolved regression analysis revealed that neural activity over fronto-temporal sensors tracked melodic surprise particularly around 200 ms and 300–500 ms after note onset. This neural surprise response was dissociated from sensory-acoustic and adaptation effects. Neural surprise was best predicted by computational models that incorporated long-term statistical learning – rather than by simple, Gestalt-like principles. Yet, intriguingly, the surprise reflected primarily short-range musical contexts of less than ten notes. We present a full replication of our novel MEG results in an openly available EEG dataset. Together, these results elucidate the internal model that shapes melodic predictions during naturalistic music listening.

                A wide range of neurological diseases with impaired motor functioning of the upper extremities are accompanied by impairments of somatosensory functioning, which are often undescribed but can provide crucial information for diagnostics, treatment selection, and follow-up. Therefore, a reliable description of the functional representation of the digits in the somatosensory cortex would be a highly valuable, but currently lacking, tool in the clinical context. Task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of passive tactile stimulation provides an indirect, but valid description of the layout of the digit map in the primary somatosensory cortex. However, to fulfill the specific requirements for clinical application, the presently established approaches need to be adapted and subsequently assessed for feasibility and retest reliability, in order to provide informative parameters for the description of the evoked digit activations. Accordingly, the present high-field 3T fMRI study compares the performance of two established digit mapping designs - travelling wave (TW) and blocked design (BD) - for passive tactile stimulation of the five digits, adapted to reduce the time requirements to just below 15 minutes. To be able to assess the retest reliability unaffected by any clinical conditions, the study was performed on neurotypical participants. The results show that both stimulation designs evoke significant and distinct activation clusters in the primary somatosensory cortex of all participants for all five digits. The average spatial locations of the center of gravities across participants show the common succession of distinct digit representation along the central sulcus. The cortical extent elicited activation, which is generally larger for the thumb and the index finger, also shows comparable average values across the two approaches. Less overlap of activation between neighboring digits was obtained in BD, consistent with the distinct single digit neuronal representations. A high retest reliability was obtained for the location of the digit activation, displaying stable center of gravity locations across sessions for both stimulation designs. This is contrasted by only medium to low retest reliability for the extent and overlap of the digit activations, indicating discrepancies across sessions. These results demonstrate the capacity of shortened fMRI digit mapping approaches (both TW and BD) to obtain the full layout of single digit cortical activations on the level of the individual, which together with the high reliability of the location of the digit representation over time indicates both approaches are clinically applicable.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliability of resting-state functional connectivity in the human spinal cord: assessing the impact of distinct noise sources</a></h4>

              
                The investigation of spontaneous fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal has recently been extended from the brain to the spinal cord, where it has also generated initial interest from a clinical perspective. A number of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated robust functional connectivity between the time-series of BOLD fluctuations in bilateral dorsal horns and between those in bilateral ventral horns, in line with the functional neuroanatomy of the spinal cord. A necessary step prior to extension to clinical studies is assessing the reliability of such resting-state signals, which we aimed to do here in a group of 45 healthy young adults at the clinically prevalent field-strength of 3T. When investigating connectivity in the entire cervical spinal cord, we observed fair to good reliability for dorsal-dorsal and ventral-ventral connectivity, whereas reliability was poor for within- and between-hemicord dorsal-ventral connectivity. Considering how prone spinal cord fMRI is to noise, we extensively investigated the impact of distinct noise sources and made two crucial observations: removal of physiological noise led to a reduction in functional connectivity strength and reliability - due to the removal of stable and participant-specific noise patterns - whereas removal of thermal noise considerably increased the detectability of functional connectivity without a clear influence on reliability. Finally, we also assessed connectivity within spinal cord segments and observed that while the pattern of connectivity was similar to that of whole cervical cord, reliability at the level of single segments was consistently poor. Taken together, our results demonstrate the presence of reliable resting-state functional connectivity in the human spinal cord even after thoroughly accounting for physiological and thermal noise, but at the same time urge caution if focal changes in connectivity (e.g. due to segmental lesions) are to be studied, especially in a longitudinal manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Membrane association is required for Stmn2-mediated axon protection</a></h4>

              
                Axon integrity is essential for functional connectivity in the nervous system. The degeneration of stressed or damaged axons is a common and sometimes initiating event in neurodegenerative disorders. Cellular factors that preserve axon integrity have an important influence on the fate of a damaged axon. Stathmin-2 (Stmn2) is an axon maintenance factor that is depleted in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and replenishment of Stmn2 can restore neurite outgrowth in diseased neurons. Stathmins have a well-documented role in microtubule dynamics during neurodevelopment, yet mechanisms responsible for Stmn2-mediated axon maintenance in injured neurons are not known. We demonstrate that membrane association of Stmn2 is critical for its axon-protective activity. Axonal enrichment of Stmn2 is driven by palmitoylation as well as tubulin interaction. We discover that another Stathmin, Stmn3, co-migrates with Stmn2-containing vesicles and undergoes regulated degradation through DLK-JNK signaling. The Stmn2 membrane targeting domain is both necessary and sufficient for localization to a specific vesicle population and confers sensitivity to DLK-dependent degradation. Our findings reveal a broader role for DLK in tuning the local abundance of palmitoylated Stathmins in axon segments. Moreover, palmitoylation is a critical component of Stathmin-mediated axon protection and defining the Stmn2-containing vesicle population will provide important clues toward mechanisms of axon maintenance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Somatomotor Beta Bursts Mediate the Negative Impact of PTSD Severity on Conflict Monitoring</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control deficits are associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and may explain how reminders of past traumatic events intrude upon daily experiences of people who have experienced trauma. Lateralized somatomotor beta-band desynchronization, an electrophysiological signature of controlled movement, indexes the downstream output of cognitive control processes. Recent evidence suggests that somatomotor beta activity does not manifest as rhythmic oscillations, but instead as discrete and stochastic burst-like events. Here, we quantified the rates of lateralized somatomotor beta bursts (beta burst rates; BBR) evoked during a flanker cognitive control paradigm among United States military veterans from Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom (OEF/OIF) who show varying degrees of PTSD. We found BBR reflected both response direction and conflict monitoring during processing of stimuli that evoked response conflict. Impaired behavioral performance and increased peri-response BBR were related to greater posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS). Critically, increased BBR mediated the link between PTSS and decreased conflict monitoring accuracy. Results suggest that poor cognitive control in PTSS reflects a failure to adaptively disinhibit target motor representations, rather than a failure to inhibit distractor representations. Thus, BBR reveal limited representation of target stimuli as a primary contributor to impaired cognitive control in PTSD. Because BBR were robustly associated with behavioral performance and exhibited high statistical reliability the index may carry utility for appraising individual differences in cognitive control in other brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in the effects of salience and reward on impulse control and action selection</a></h4>

              
                Impulse control and adequate decision making are vital functions when it comes to detection and adherence to societal rules, especially in critical circumstances such as the Covid pandemic. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that increasing the salience of environmental cues would be most effective in improving impulse control, as assessed in a stop-signal task, in subjects with low environmental susceptibility as indexed by low pre-stimulus EEG alpha power. In addition, we anticipated that an external-reward intervention improves performance during a Go/No go task, especially in individuals with low task-induced motivation as indexed by low theta/ beta power ratios. High salience of stop signals enhanced stopping performance but there was no difference in responsivity to the salience intervention between participants with high and low EEG alpha power. Individuals with low theta/ beta power ratios responded more accurately when rewards were at stake. Together these results suggest that increasing the salience of external cues may help impulse control in general, whereas the effectiveness of external-reward interventions is higher in individuals with low task-induced motivation.

                The primary motor cortex (M1) is known to be spatially organized in terms of muscles and body parts, notwithstanding some overlap. However, the classical view is largely static, neglecting potential representational changes on a fast time scale. To address potential representational dynamics, we probed the mutual information between M1 signals recorded across the cortical sheet and electromyography (EMG) activity from a set of muscles while a macaque monkey performed planar reaches. Here, we demonstrated that the spatial organization of the M1 encoding was in fact quite dynamic throughout the course of a reaching movement such that a given cortical site maximally encoded different muscles at different times. Despite these rapid representational changes, a proximal-to-distal gradient of the upper limb representation was preserved particularly close to movement onset. Representation was most stable close to movement onset, with characteristic topographic maps, possibly serving functional needs. This study bridges the important gap between flexible motor encoding and static motor maps, emphasizing the importance of considering space and time together in motor representation studies.

                Human memory is selective and not all experiences are remembered. Both monetary rewards/incentives and curiosity have been found to motivate and facilitate learning by dopaminergic midbrain projections to the hippocampus during encoding. In this study, we examined potential brain mechanisms during early consolidation period that jointly or independently contribute to these facilitating effects. Participants (N = 50) watched 36 videos of magic tricks and rated their "subjective feelings of curiosity" while the availability of extrinsic incentives was manipulated between groups. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired before, during, and after learning, and memory for magic tricks was assessed one week after. Our analysis focused on the change in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the dopaminergic midbrain and the anterior hippocampus, a dopaminergic consolidation mechanism previously reported in the context of extrinsically motivated learning. Changes in RSFC were correlated with behavioural measures of learning, i.e., the total number of items encoded and the curiosity-driven memory benefit. We found that brain-behaviour correlations differed depending on the availability of extrinsic incentives. More specifically, the correlation between the total number of items encoded and RSFC change was significantly different in the incentivised compared to the control group. The curiosity-driven memory benefit, however, did not correlate with changes in RSFC in either of the groups. In sum, this suggests that curiosity-motivated learning might be supported by different consolidation mechanisms compared to extrinsically motivated learning and that extrinsic incentives influence consolidation mechanisms supporting learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How much data do we need? Lower bounds of brain activation states to predict human cognitive ability</a></h4>

              
                Human functional brain connectivity can be temporally decomposed into states of high and low cofluctuation, defined as coactivation of brain regions over time. Despite their low frequency of occurrence, states of particularly high cofluctuation have been shown to reflect fundamentals of intrinsic functional network architecture (derived from resting-state fMRI) and to be highly subject-specific. However, it is currently unclear whether such network-defining states of high cofluctuation also contribute to individual variations in cognitive abilities, which strongly rely on the interactions among distributed brain regions. By introducing CMEP, an eigenvector-based prediction framework, we show that functional connectivity estimates from as few as 20 temporally separated time frames (< 3% of a 10 min resting-state fMRI scan) are significantly predictive of individual differences in intelligence (N = 281, p < .001). In contrast and against previous expectations, individual's network-defining time frames of particularly high cofluctuation do not achieve significant prediction of intelligence. Multiple functional brain networks contribute to the prediction, and all results replicate in an independent sample (N = 831). Our results suggest that although fundamentals of person-specific functional connectomes can be derived from few time frames of highest brain connectivity, temporally distributed information is necessary to extract information about cognitive abilities from functional connectivity time series. This information, however, is not restricted to specific connectivity states, like network-defining high-cofluctuation states, but rather reflected across the entire length of the brain connectivity time series.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cx26 heterozygous mutations cause hyperacusis-like hearing sensitivity enhancement and increase susceptibility to noise</a></h4>

              
                Gap junction gene GJB2 (Cx26) mutations cause >50% of nonsyndromic hearing loss. Its recessive hetero-mutation carriers, who have no deafness, occupy ~10-20% of the general population. Here, we report an unexpected finding that these heterozygote carriers have hearing over-sensitivity and active cochlear amplification increased. Mouse models show that Cx26 hetero-deletion reduced endocochlear potential (EP) generation in the cochlear lateral wall and caused outer hair cell electromotor protein prestin compensatively upregulated to increase active cochlear amplification and hearing sensitivity. The increase of active cochlear amplification also increased sensitivity to noise; exposure of daily-level noise could cause Cx26+/- mice permanent hearing threshold shift leading to hearing loss. This study demonstrate that Cx26 recessive heterozygous mutations are not harmless for hearing as previously considered and can cause hyperacusis-like hearing over-sensitivity. The data also indicate that GJB2 hetero-mutation carriers are vulnerable to noise and should avoid noise exposure in daily-life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unraveling the therapeutic mechanism of deep-brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for patients suffering from otherwise therapy-resistant psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. Modulation of cortico-striatal circuits has been suggested as a mechanism of action. To gain mechanistic insight, we monitored neuronal activity in cortico-striatal regions in a mouse model for compulsive behavior, while systematically varying clinically-relevant parameters of internal-capsule DBS. DBS showed dose-dependent effects on both brain and behavior: An increasing, yet balanced, number of excited and inhibited neurons was recruited, scattered throughout cortico-striatal regions, while compulsive grooming decreased. Such neuronal recruitment did not alter basic brain function such as resting-state activity, and only occurred in awake animals, indicating a dependency on network activity. In addition to these widespread effects, we observed specific involvement of the medial orbitofrontal cortex in therapeutic outcomes, which was corroborated by optogenetic stimulation. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insight into how DBS exerts its therapeutic effects on compulsive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential and overlapping effects between exogenous and endogenous attention shape perceptual facilitation during visual processing</a></h4>

              
                Visuospatial attention is not a monolithic process and can be divided into different functional systems. In this framework, exogenous attention reflects the involuntary orienting of attention resources following a salient event, whereas endogenous attention corresponds to voluntary orienting based on the goals and intentions of individuals. Previous work shows that these attention processes map onto distinct functional systems, yet evidence suggests that they are not fully independent. In the current work, we investigated the differential and overlapping effects of exogenous and endogenous on visual processing of sensory events. Specifically, we combined spatial cueing of visuospatial attention, electroencephalography (EEG), and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to examine where and when the effects of exogenous and endogenous attention were maximally different and maximally similar. Critically, MVPA provided new insights by examining whether classifiers trained to decode the cueing effect for one attention process (e.g., exogenous attention) can successfully decode the cueing effect for the other attention process (e.g., endogenous attention), and vice versa. These analyses revealed differential effects between exogenous and endogenous early after target onset (<200ms post-target). In turn, both shared similar processing later (~300ms post-target). We combined principal component analyses, single-trial event-related potentials, and mediation analysis to determine whether these effects contribute to the facilitation effects observed at the behavioral level after exogenous and endogenous spatial cueing. We uncovered that three EEG components (i.e., a posterior ipsilateral component, a posterior contralateral one, and a central one) shape the cueing effects of exogenous and endogenous attention at various times after target onset. Altogether, our study combines the strengths of MVPA, single-trial analysis, and meditation modelling to provide a comprehensive account about overlapping and differential processes of endogenous and exogenous, and how these dynamics relate to perceptual facilitation in the context of visuospatial attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A combined DTI-fMRI approach for optimizing the delineation of posteromedial vs. anterolateral entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the entorhinal cortex (EC), attempts have been made to identify the human homologue regions of the medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subdivision using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, there are still discrepancies between entorhinal subdivisions depending on the choice of connectivity seed regions and the imaging modality used. While DTI can be used to follow the white matter tracts of the brain, fMRI can identify functionally connected brain regions. In this study, we used both DTI and resting-state fMRI in 103 healthy adults to investigate both structural and functional connectivity between the EC and associated cortical brain regions. Differential connectivity with these regions was then used to predict the locations of the human homologues of MEC and LEC. Our results from combining DTI and fMRI support a subdivision into posteromedial (pmEC) and anterolateral (alEC) EC and reveal a discrete border between the pmEC and alEC. Furthermore, the EC subregions obtained by either imaging modality showed similar distinct connectivity patterns: While pmEC showed increased connectivity preferentially with the default mode network, the alEC exhibited increased connectivity with regions in the dorsal attention and salience networks. Optimizing the delineation of the human homologues of MEC and LEC with a combined, cross-validated DTI-fMRI approach allows to define a likely border between the two subdivisions and has implications for both cognitive and translational neuroscience research.
