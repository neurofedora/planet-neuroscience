                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. The purpose of this study was to descriptively characterize and explore the differences in the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20-40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the descriptive relationship between the relative abundance of periodontopathogens and nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected from all participants. Genomic DNA was isolated and pooled in equimolar quantities from all individuals within each group to create three pooled libraries: type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3). Sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity were measured using bioinformatic methods, and all analyses of sequencing data were strictly descriptive and exploratory. Salivary nitrite/nitrate concentrations were measured on individual, un-pooled samples. Results The salivary microbiota among people with type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease (G2; G3) was observed to have greater bacterial diversity and abundance than that of patients without periodontal disease (G1), according to descriptive alpha-diversity analysis. The G3 group exhibited the largest relative abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a key periodontopathogen. Descriptive analysis also suggested that periodontopathic bacteria and nitrate-reducing bacteria have different community structures across the groups. Furthermore, comparison of individual salivary samples showed that nitrite/nitrate concentration was significantly lower in the G3 group compared to the G1 group (p< 0.05). Conclusion Results of this exploratory study suggest that the relationship between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in the salivary microbiome varies among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis. These distinct microbial features observed may be microbiological characteristics associated with the progression of periodontal disease in this population, warranting further validation as potential indicators for early management.

                Introduction Prion diseases are mortal neurodegenerative disorders, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Due to its heterogenous clinical presentation diagnosis uncertainties are common. In this paper we explore CJD diagnostic challenges focusing on differential diagnosis and diagnostic delays. Methods We report a case of a patient who was misclassified and evaluated by several medical specialties before the CJD suspicion. A systematic review of the literature of the CJD case reports focused on the timely and differential diagnosis was carried out in Medline and Embase until May 2023. Results Patient with diagnosis was made due to the form of presentation and clinical evolution, neuroimaging and the presence of protein 14-3-3. In systematic review, fifteen articles were selected, who reported 31 cases of CJD with problems in the timely diagnosis and incorrect initial diagnosis, the main initial differential diagnoses were psychiatry exacerbation, myelopathy, epilepsy, stroke, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and autoimmune encephalitis. The most common clinical onset was psychobehavioral disturbances (apathy, confusion and sleep disturbance), extrapyramidal signs and cognitive impairment. The diagnosis delay was from one to eighteen months. Conclusion A discussion of the case report and the diagnostic challenges reported in the literature was made. Patients can present a wide range of symptoms. It is recommended to consider CJD for the differential diagnosis in patients with behavioral symptoms, and cognitive impairment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06280">Assessing the Information Content of Individual Spikes in Population-Level Models of Neural Spiking Activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, there have been major advances in clusterless decoding algorithms for neural data analysis. These algorithms use the theory of marked point processes to describe the joint activity of many neurons simultaneously, without the need for spike sorting. In this study, we examine information-theoretic metrics to analyze the information extracted from each observed spike under such clusterless models. In an analysis of spatial coding in the rat hippocampus, we compared the entropy reduction between spike-sorted and clusterless models for both individual spikes observed in isolation and when the prior information from all previously observed spikes is accounted for. Our analysis demonstrates that low-amplitude spikes, which are difficult to cluster and often left out of spike sorting, provide reduced information compared to sortable, high-amplitude spikes when considered in isolation, but the two provide similar levels of information when considering all the prior information available from past spiking. These findings demonstrate the value of combining information measures with state-space modeling and yield new insights into the underlying mechanisms of neural computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06492">Quantification of Planar Cortical Magnification with Optimal Transport and Topological Smoothing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human visual system exhibits non-uniform spatial resolution across the visual field, which is characterized by the cortical magnification factor (CMF) that reflects its anatomical basis. However, current approaches for quantifying CMF using retinotopic maps derived from BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are limited by the inherent low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI data and inaccuracies in the topological relationships of the retinotopic maps. In this study, we introduced a new pipeline to quantify planar CMF from retinotopic maps generated from the population receptive field (pRF) model. The pipeline projected the 3D pRF solutions onto a 2D planar disk, using optimal transport (OT) to preserve local cortical surface areas, and applied topological smoothing to ensure that the resulting retinotopic maps maintain their topology. We then estimated 2D CMF maps from the projected retinotopic maps on the planar disk using the 1-ring patch method. Applying this pipeline to the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7T dataset, we revealed previously unobserved CMF patterns across the visual field and demonstrated individual differences among the 181 subjects. The pipeline was further validated on the New York University (NYU) 3T dataset, showing reliable and repeatable results. Our study provided new analytical methods and offered novel insights into visual processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06934">Visual Function Profiles via Multi-Path Aggregation Reveal Neuron-Level Responses in the Drosophila Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting individual neurons' responses and spatial functional properties in complex visual tasks remains a key challenge in understanding neural computation. Existing whole-brain connectome models of Drosophila often rely on parameter assumptions or deep learning approaches, yet remain limited in their ability to reliably predict dynamic neuronal responses. We introduce a Multi-Path Aggregation (MPA) framework, based on neural network steady-state theory, to build a whole-brain Visual Function Profiles (VFP) of Drosophila neurons and predict their responses under diverse visual tasks. Unlike conventional methods relying on redundant parameters, MPA combines visual input features with the whole-brain connectome topology. It uses adjacency matrix powers and finite-path optimization to efficiently predict neuronal function, including ON/OFF polarity, direction selectivity, and responses to complex visual stimuli. Our model achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.84+/-0.12 for ON/OFF responses, outperforming existing methods (0.33+/-0.59), and accurately captures neuron functional properties, including luminance and direction preferences, while allowing single-neuron or population-level blockade simulations. Replacing CNN modules with VFP-derived Lobula Columnar(LC) population responses in a Drosophila simulation enables successful navigation and obstacle avoidance, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in guiding embodied behavior. This study establishes a "connectome-functional profile-behavior" framework, offering a whole-brain quantitative tool to study Drosophila visual computation and a neuron-level guide for brain-inspired intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05990">Memory-Amortized Inference: A Topological Unification of Search, Closure, and Structure</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.05990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary ML separates the static structure of parameters from the dynamic flow of inference, yielding systems that lack the sample efficiency and thermodynamic frugality of biological cognition. In this theoretical work, we propose \textbf{Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI)}, a formal framework rooted in algebraic topology that unifies learning and memory as phase transitions of a single geometric substrate. Central to our theory is the \textbf{Homological Parity Principle}, which posits a fundamental dichotomy: even-dimensional homology ($H_{even}$) physically instantiates stable \textbf{Content} (stable scaffolds or ``what''), while odd-dimensional homology ($H_{odd}$) instantiates dynamic \textbf{Context} (dynamic flows or ``where''). We derive the logical flow of MAI as a topological trinity transformation: \textbf{Search $\to$ Closure $\to$ Structure}. Specifically, we demonstrate that cognition operates by converting high-complexity recursive search (modeled by \textit{Savitch's Theorem} in NPSPACE) into low-complexity lookup (modeled by \textit{Dynamic Programming} in P) via the mechanism of \textbf{Topological Cycle Closure}. We further show that this consolidation process is governed by a topological generalization of the Wake-Sleep algorithm, functioning as a coordinate descent that alternates between optimizing the $H_{odd}$ flow (inference/wake) and condensing persistent cycles into the $H_{even}$ scaffold (learning/sleep). This framework offers a rigorous explanation for the emergence of fast-thinking (intuition) from slow-thinking (reasoning) and provides a blueprint for post-Turing architectures that compute via topological resonance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06134">Physics-Informed Neural Koopman Machine for Interpretable Longitudinal Personalized Alzheimer's Disease Forecasting</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.06134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early forecasting of individual cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is central to disease evaluation and management. Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($\alpha$) and biological ($\beta$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression.

                arXiv:2502.11105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rational framework is proposed to explain how we accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded memory. Memory is stored as statistics organized into structures that are repeatedly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. Repeated summarization requires an intensive ongoing process guided by heuristics that help optimize the memory for future needs. Sensory input is rapidly encoded as simple statistics that are progressively elaborated into more abstract constructs. This framework differs from previous accounts of memory by reliance on statistics as a representation of memory, the use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics at each summarization step, and the hypothesis of a process that is complex and expensive. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.

                arXiv:2504.06199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prolonged alcohol use results in neuroadaptations that mark more severe and treatment-resistant alcohol use. The goal of this study was to identify functional connectivity brain patterns underlying Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)-related characteristics in fifty-five adults (31 female) who endorsed heavy alcohol use. We hypothesized that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the Salience (SN), Frontoparietal (FPN), and Default Mode (DMN) networks would reflect self-reported recent and lifetime alcohol use, laboratory-based alcohol seeking, urgency, and sociodemographic characteristics related to AUD. To test our hypothesis, we combined the triple network model (TNM) of psychopathology with a multivariate data-driven approach, regularized partial least squares (rPLS), to unfold concurrent functional connectivity (FC) patterns and their association with AUD-related characteristics. We observed three concurrent associations of interest: i) drinking and age-related cross communication between the SN and both the FPN and DMN; ii) family history density of AUD and urgency anticorrelations between the SN and FPN; and iii) alcohol seeking and sex-associated SN and DMN interactions. These findings provide an integrative interpretation for many individual findings reported in the literature relating functional connectivity signatures and AUD factors. Moreover, we identified a set of neural mechanisms and brain regions concomitant with AUD-related characteristics that can serve as potential treatment targets across clinical and preclinical models.

Abstract: Human intelligence, the most evident and accessible form of source of reasoning, hosted by biological hardware, has evolved and been refined over thousands of years, positioning itself today to create new artificial forms and preparing to self--design their evolutionary path forward. Beginning with the advent of foundation models, the rate at which human and artificial intelligence interact with each other has exceeded any anticipated quantitative figures. The close engagement led both bits of intelligence to be impacted in various ways, which naturally resulted in complex confluences that warrant close scrutiny. Recent advances, such as DeepSeek, exemplify this interplay: the novel contributions, we argue, draw indirect inspiration from biological principles like modular neural specialization and sparse episodic encoding, addressing computational bottlenecks while aligning with human-inspired scalability. In the sequel, using a novel taxonomy, we shall explore this interplay between human and machine intelligence, focusing on the crucial role humans play in developing ethical, responsible, and robust intelligent systems. We briefly delve into various aspects of implementation inspired by the mechanisms underlying neuroscience and human cognition. In addition, we propose future perspectives, capitalizing on the advantages of symbiotic designs to suggest a human-centered direction for next-generation developments, focusing on the augmentation role of AI. We finalize this evolving document with some thoughts and open questions yet to be addressed by the broader community.

                arXiv:2503.09980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) has brought increasing attention to their energy use during training and inference. Here, we establish the thermodynamic bounds on energy consumption in quasi-static analog DNNs by mapping modern feedforward architectures onto a physical free-energy functional. This framework provides a direct statistical-mechanical interpretation of quasi-static DNNs. As a result, inference can proceed in a thermodynamically reversible manner, with vanishing minimal energy cost, in contrast to the Landauer limit that constrains digital hardware. Importantly, inference corresponds to relaxation to a unique free-energy minimum with F_{\min}=0, allowing all constraints to be satisfied without residual stress. By comparison, training overconstrains the system: simultaneous clamping of inputs and outputs generates stresses that propagate backward through the architecture, reproducing the rules of backpropagation. Parameter annealing then relaxes these stresses, providing a purely physical route to learning without an explicit loss function. We further derive a universal lower bound on training energy, E< 2NDkT, which scales with both the number of trainable parameters and the dataset size.

                arXiv:2510.04391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational role of imagination remains debated. While classical accounts emphasize reward maximization, emerging evidence suggests imagination serves a broader function: accessing internal world models (IWMs). Here, we employ psychological network analysis to compare IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs) through imagination vividness ratings. Using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2) and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (PSIQ), we construct imagination networks from three human populations (Florida, Poland, London; N=2,743) and six LLM variants in two conversation conditions. Human imagination networks demonstrate robust correlations across centrality measures (expected influence, strength, closeness) and consistent clustering patterns, indicating shared structural organization of IWMs across populations. In contrast, LLM-derived networks show minimal clustering and weak centrality correlations, even when manipulating conversational memory. These systematic differences persist across environmental scenes (VVIQ-2) and sensory modalities (PSIQ), revealing fundamental disparities between human and artificial world models. Our network-based approach provides a quantitative framework for comparing internally-generated representations across cognitive agents, with implications for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired approach to computer vision that can lead to more efficient processing of visual data with reduced energy consumption. However, maintaining homeostasis within these networks is challenging, as it requires continuous adjustment of neural responses to preserve equilibrium and optimal processing efficiency amidst diverse and often unpredictable input signals. In response to these challenges, we propose the Asynchronous Bioplausible Neuron (ABN), a dynamic spike firing mechanism to auto-adjust the variations in the input signal. Comprehensive evaluation across various datasets demonstrates ABN's enhanced performance in image classification and segmentation, maintenance of neural equilibrium, and energy efficiency.

Abstract: The integration of advanced technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), into manufacturing processes is attracting significant attention, paving the way for the development of intelligent systems that enhance efficiency and automation. This paper uses the term "Gentelligent system" to refer to systems that incorporate inherent component information (akin to genes in bioinformatics-where manufacturing operations are likened to chromosomes in this study) and automated mechanisms. By implementing reliable fault detection methods, manufacturers can achieve several benefits, including improved product quality, increased yield, and reduced production costs. To support these objectives, we propose a hybrid framework with a dominance-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. This mechanism enables simultaneous optimization of feature selection and classification performance by exploring Pareto-optimal solutions in a single run. This solution helps monitor various manufacturing operations, addressing a range of conflicting objectives that need to be minimized together. Manufacturers can leverage such predictive methods and better adapt to emerging trends. To strengthen the validation of our model, we incorporate two real-world datasets from different industrial domains. The results on both datasets demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of our approach.

                arXiv:2512.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA) is a nature-inspired algorithm that imitates chimpanzees' individual intelligence and hunting behaviors. In this algorithm, the hunting process consists of four steps: driving, blocking, chasing, and attacking. Because of the novelty of ChOA, the steps of the hunting process have been modeled in a simple way, leading to slow and premature convergence similar to other iterative algorithms. This paper proposes six spiral functions and introduces two novel hybrid spiral functions (SEB-ChOA) to address these deficiencies. The performance of SEB-ChOA is evaluated on 23 standard benchmarks, 20 benchmarks of the IEEE CEC-2005 test suite, 10 cases from the IEEE CEC06-2019 test suite, and 12 constrained real-world engineering problems from IEEE CEC-2020. The SEB-ChOA variants are compared with three groups of optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as well-known optimizers; Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), Ant Lion Optimization (ALO), and Henry Gas Solubility Optimization (HGSO) as recently developed optimizers; and jDE100 and DISHchain1e+12, the winners of the IEEE CEC06-2019 competition. Additional comparisons are made with EBOwithCMAR and CIPDE as strong secondary baselines. The SEB-ChOA methods achieve top-ranked results on nearly all benchmarks and show competitive performance compared to jDE100 and DISHchain1e+12. Statistical results indicate that SEB-ChOA outperforms PSO, GA, SMA, MPA, ALO, and HGSO while producing results comparable to those of jDE100 and DISHchain1e+12.

                arXiv:2512.06137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regularization for the deep linear network (DLN) using the entropy formula introduced in arXiv:2509.09088. The equilibria and gradient flow of the free energy on the Riemannian manifold of end-to-end maps of the DLN are characterized for energies that depend symmetrically on the singular values of the end-to-end matrix.
  The only equilibria are minimizers and the set of minimizers is an orbit of the orthogonal group. In contrast with random matrix theory there is no singular value repulsion. The corresponding gradient flow reduces to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation whose solution gives explicit relaxation rates toward the minimizers. We also study the concavity of the entropy in the chamber of singular values. The entropy is shown to be strictly concave in the Euclidean geometry on the chamber but not in the Riemannian geometry defined by the DLN metric.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06966">Neuro-Vesicles: Neuromodulation Should Be a Dynamical System, Not a Tensor Decoration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Neuro-Vesicles, a framework that augments conventional neural networks with a missing computational layer: a dynamical population of mobile, discrete vesicles that live alongside the network rather than inside its tensors. Each vesicle is a self contained object v = (c, kappa, l, tau, s) carrying a vector payload, type label, location on the graph G = (V, E), remaining lifetime, and optional internal state. Vesicles are emitted in response to activity, errors, or meta signals; migrate along learned transition kernels; probabilistically dock at nodes; locally modify activations, parameters, learning rules, or external memory through content dependent release operators; and finally decay or are absorbed.
  This event based interaction layer reshapes neuromodulation. Instead of applying the same conditioning tensors on every forward pass, modulation emerges from the stochastic evolution of a vesicle population that can accumulate, disperse, trigger cascades, carve transient pathways, and write structured traces into topological memory. Dense, short lived vesicles approximate familiar tensor mechanisms such as FiLM, hypernetworks, or attention. Sparse, long lived vesicles resemble a small set of mobile agents that intervene only at rare but decisive moments.
  We give a complete mathematical specification of the framework, including emission, migration, docking, release, decay, and their coupling to learning; a continuous density relaxation that yields differentiable reaction diffusion dynamics on the graph; and a reinforcement learning view where vesicle control is treated as a policy optimized for downstream performance. We also outline how the same formalism extends to spiking networks and neuromorphic hardware such as the Darwin3 chip, enabling programmable neuromodulation on large scale brain inspired computers.

                arXiv:2512.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While surrogate backpropagation proves useful for training deep spiking neural networks (SNNs), incorporating biologically inspired local signals on a large scale remains challenging. This difficulty stems primarily from the high memory demands of maintaining accurate spike-timing logs and the potential for purely local plasticity adjustments to clash with the supervised learning goal. To effectively leverage local signals derived from spiking neuron dynamics, we introduce Dopamine-Modulated Spike-Synchrony-Dependent Plasticity (DA-SSDP), a synchrony-based rule that is sensitive to loss and brings a synchrony-based local learning signal to the model. DA-SSDP condenses spike patterns into a synchrony metric at the batch level. An initial brief warm-up phase assesses its relationship to the task loss and sets a fixed gate that subsequently adjusts the local update's magnitude. In cases where synchrony proves unrelated to the task, the gate settles at one, simplifying DA-SSDP to a basic two-factor synchrony mechanism that delivers minor weight adjustments driven by concurrent spike firing and a Gaussian latency function. These small weight updates are only added to the network`s deeper layers following the backpropagation phase, and our tests showed this simplified version did not degrade performance and sometimes gave a small accuracy boost, serving as a regularizer during training. The rule stores only binary spike indicators and first-spike latencies with a Gaussian kernel. Without altering the model structure or optimization routine, evaluations on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (+0.42\%), CIFAR-100 (+0.99\%), CIFAR10-DVS (+0.1\%), and ImageNet-1K (+0.73\%) demonstrated consistent accuracy gains, accompanied by a minor increase in computational overhead.

                arXiv:2512.07602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks excel at event-driven sensing yet maintaining task-relevant context over long timescales. However building these networks in hardware respecting both tight energy and memory budgets, remains a core challenge in the field. We address this challenge through novel algorithm-hardware co-design effort. At the algorithm level, inspired by the cortical fast-slow organization in the brain, we introduce a neural network with an explicit slow memory pathway that, combined with fast spiking activity, enables a dual memory pathway (DMP) architecture in which each layer maintains a compact low-dimensional state that summarizes recent activity and modulates spiking dynamics. This explicit memory stabilizes learning while preserving event-driven sparsity, achieving competitive accuracy on long-sequence benchmarks with 40-60% fewer parameters than equivalent state-of-the-art spiking neural networks. At the hardware level, we introduce a near-memory-compute architecture that fully leverages the advantages of the DMP architecture by retaining its compact shared state while optimizing dataflow, across heterogeneous sparse-spike and dense-memory pathways. We show experimental results that demonstrate more than a 4x increase in throughput and over a 5x improvement in energy efficiency compared with state-of-the-art implementations. Together, these contributions demonstrate that biological principles can guide functional abstractions that are both algorithmically effective and hardware-efficient, establishing a scalable co-design paradigm for real-time neuromorphic computation and learning.

                arXiv:2512.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how protein mutations affect protein structure is essential for advancements in computational biology and bioinformatics. We introduce PRIMRose, a novel approach that predicts energy values for each residue given a mutated protein sequence. Unlike previous models that assess global energy shifts, our method analyzes the localized energetic impact of double amino acid insertions or deletions (InDels) at the individual residue level, enabling residue-specific insights into structural and functional disruption. We implement a Convolutional Neural Network architecture to predict the energy changes of each residue in a protein mutation. We train our model on datasets constructed from nine proteins, grouped into three categories: one set with exhaustive double InDel mutations, another with approximately 145k randomly sampled double InDel mutations, and a third with approximately 80k randomly sampled double InDel mutations. Our model achieves high predictive accuracy across a range of energy metrics as calculated by the Rosetta molecular modeling suite and reveals localized patterns that influence model performance, such as solvent accessibility and secondary structure context. This per-residue analysis offers new insights into the mutational tolerance of specific regions within proteins and provides higher interpretable and biologically meaningful predictions of InDels' effects.

                arXiv:2512.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural architectures such as LSTM and GRU remain widely used in sequence modeling, but they continue to face two core limitations: redundant gate-specific parameters and reduced ability to retain information across long temporal distances. This paper introduces the Quantum-Leap LSTM (QL-LSTM), a recurrent architecture designed to address both challenges through two independent components. The Parameter-Shared Unified Gating mechanism replaces all gate-specific transformations with a single shared weight matrix, reducing parameters by approximately 48 percent while preserving full gating behavior. The Hierarchical Gated Recurrence with Additive Skip Connections component adds a multiplication-free pathway that improves long-range information flow and reduces forget-gate degradation. We evaluate QL-LSTM on sentiment classification using the IMDB dataset with extended document lengths, comparing it to LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM reference models. QL-LSTM achieves competitive accuracy while using substantially fewer parameters. Although the PSUG and HGR-ASC components are more efficient per time step, the current prototype remains limited by the inherent sequential nature of recurrent models and therefore does not yet yield wall-clock speed improvements without further kernel-level optimization.

                arXiv:2512.06658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a monochrome multi-task diffractive network architecture that leverages illumination phase multiplexing to dynamically reconfigure its output function and accurately implement a large group of complex-valued linear transformations between an input and output aperture. Each member of the desired group of T unique transformations is encoded and addressed with a distinct 2D illumination phase profile, termed "phase key", which illuminates the input aperture, activating the corresponding transformation at the output field-of-view. A common diffractive optical network, optimized with T phase keys, demultiplexes these encoded inputs and accurately executes any of the T distinct linear transformations at its output. We demonstrate that a diffractive network composed of N = 2 x T x Ni x No optimized diffractive features can realize T distinct complex-valued linear transformations, accurately executed for any complex field at the input aperture, where Ni and No refer to the input/output pixels, respectively. In our proof-of-concept numerical analysis, T = 512 complex-valued transformations are implemented by the same monochrome diffractive network with negligible error using illumination phase diversity. Compared with wavelength-multiplexed diffractive systems, phase-multiplexing architecture significantly lowers the transformation errors, potentially enabling larger-scale optical transformations to be implemented through a monochrome processor. Phase-multiplexed multi-task diffractive networks would enhance the capabilities of optical computing and machine-vision systems.

                arXiv:2512.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of the ArcGD optimiser. The evaluation is conducted initially on a non-convex benchmark function and subsequently on a real-world ML dataset. The initial comparative study using the Adam optimiser is conducted on a stochastic variant of the highly non-convex and notoriously challenging Rosenbrock function, renowned for its narrow, curved valley, across dimensions ranging from 2D to 1000D and an extreme case of 50,000D. Two configurations were evaluated to eliminate learning-rate bias: (i) both using ArcGD's effective learning rate and (ii) both using Adam's default learning rate. ArcGD consistently outperformed Adam under the first setting and, although slower under the second, achieved super ior final solutions in most cases. In the second evaluation, ArcGD is evaluated against state-of-the-art optimizers (Adam, AdamW, Lion, SGD) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset across 8 diverse MLP architectures ranging from 1 to 5 hidden layers. ArcGD achieved the highest average test accuracy (50.7%) at 20,000 iterations, outperforming AdamW (46.6%), Adam (46.8%), SGD (49.6%), and Lion (43.4%), winning or tying on 6 of 8 architectures. Notably, while Adam and AdamW showed strong early convergence at 5,000 iterations, but regressed with extended training, whereas ArcGD continued improving, demonstrating generalization and resistance to overfitting without requiring early stopping tuning. Strong performance on geometric stress tests and standard deep-learning benchmarks indicates broad applicability, highlighting the need for further exploration. Moreover, it is also shown that a variant of ArcGD can be interpreted as a special case of the Lion optimiser, highlighting connections between the inherent mechanisms of such optimisation methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07142">Winning the Lottery by Preserving Network Training Dynamics with Concrete Ticket Search</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.07142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis asserts the existence of highly sparse, trainable subnetworks ('winning tickets') within dense, randomly initialized neural networks. However, state-of-the-art methods of drawing these tickets, like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), are computationally prohibitive, while more efficient saliency-based Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) techniques suffer from a significant accuracy-sparsity trade-off and fail basic sanity checks. In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes. CTS's subnetworks outperform saliency-based methods across all sparsities, but its advantage over LTR is most pronounced in the highly sparse regime.

Abstract: Analog computing at the edge is an emerging strategy to limit data storage and transmission requirements, as well as energy consumption, and its practical implementation is in its initial stages of development. Translating properties of biological neurons into hardware offers a pathway towards low-power, real-time edge processing. Specifically, resonator neurons offer selectivity to specific frequencies as a potential solution for temporal signal processing. Here, we show a fabricated Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) mixed-signal Resonate-and-Fire (R&F) neuron circuit implementation that emulates the behavior of these neural cells responsible for controlling oscillations within the central nervous system. We integrate the design with asynchronous handshake capabilities, perform comprehensive variability analyses, and characterize its frequency detection functionality. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale integration within neuromorphic systems, thereby advancing the exploitation of bio-inspired circuits for efficient edge temporal signal processing.

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering an unknown low-dimensional vector from noisy, underdetermined observations. We focus on the Generalized Projected Gradient Descent (GPGD) framework, which unifies traditional sparse recovery methods and modern approaches using learned deep projective priors. We extend previous convergence results to robustness to model and projection errors. We use these theoretical results to explore ways to better control stability and robustness constants. To reduce recovery errors due to measurement noise, we consider generalized back-projection strategies to adapt GPGD to structured noise, such as sparse outliers. To improve the stability of GPGD, we propose a normalized idempotent regularization for the learning of deep projective priors. We provide numerical experiments in the context of sparse recovery and image inverse problems, highlighting the trade-offs between identifiability and stability that can be achieved with such methods.

Abstract: DreamerV3 is a state-of-the-art online model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm known for remarkable sample efficiency. Concurrently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering superior parameter efficiency and interpretability. To mitigate KANs' computational overhead, variants like FastKAN leverage Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to accelerate inference. In this work, we investigate integrating KAN architectures into the DreamerV3 framework. We introduce KAN-Dreamer, replacing specific MLP and convolutional components of DreamerV3 with KAN and FastKAN layers. To ensure efficiency within the JAX-based World Model, we implement a tailored, fully vectorized version with simplified grid management. We structure our investigation into three subsystems: Visual Perception, Latent Prediction, and Behavior Learning. Empirical evaluations on the DeepMind Control Suite (walker_walk) analyze sample efficiency, training time, and asymptotic performance. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing our adapted FastKAN as a drop-in replacement for the Reward and Continue predictors yields performance on par with the original MLP-based architecture, maintaining parity in both sample efficiency and training speed. This report serves as a preliminary study for future developments in KAN-based world models.

                arXiv:2505.13078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many crucial tasks of image processing and computer vision are formulated as inverse problems. Thus, it is of great importance to design fast and robust algorithms to solve these problems. In this paper, we focus on generalized projected gradient descent (GPGD) algorithms where generalized projections are realized with learned neural networks and provide state-of-the-art results for imaging inverse problems. Indeed, neural networks allow for projections onto unknown low-dimensional sets that model complex data, such as images. We call these projections deep projective priors. In generic settings, when the orthogonal projection onto a lowdimensional model set is used, it has been shown, under a restricted isometry assumption, that the corresponding orthogonal PGD converges with a linear rate, yielding near-optimal convergence (within the class of GPGD methods) in the classical case of sparse recovery. However, for deep projective priors trained with classical mean squared error losses, there is little guarantee that the hypotheses for linear convergence are satisfied. In this paper, we propose a stochastic orthogonal regularization of the training loss for deep projective priors. This regularization is motivated by our theoretical results: a sufficiently good approximation of the orthogonal projection guarantees linear stable recovery with performance close to orthogonal PGD. We show experimentally, using two different deep projective priors (based on autoencoders and on denoising networks), that our stochastic orthogonal regularization yields projections that improve convergence speed and robustness of GPGD in challenging inverse problem settings, in accordance with our theoretical findings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107223">Human neurocomputational mechanisms of guilt-driven and shame-driven altruistic behavior</a></h4>

              
                Although prior research has examined the psychological and neural correlates of guilt and shame, the cognitive antecedents that trigger them, as well as their transformation into social behavior, remain insufficiently understood. We developed a novel task to investigate how two cognitive antecedents, harm and responsibility, elicit guilt and shame, and how these emotions subsequently drive compensatory behavior, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling in human participants. Behaviorally, we found that harm had a stronger impact on guilt, whereas responsibility had a stronger impact on shame. Moreover, compared to shame, guilt exerted a greater effect on compensation. Computational modeling results indicated that the integration of harm and responsibility by individuals is consistent with the phenomenon of responsibility diffusion. The fMRI results revealed that brain regions associated with inequity representation (posterior insula) and value computation (striatum) encode this integrated measure. Individual differences in responsibility-driven shame sensitivity were associated with activity in theory-of-mind regions (e.g. temporoparietal junction). Guilt-driven and shame-driven compensatory behavior recruited distinct neural substrates, with shame-driven compensatory sensitivity being more strongly linked to activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in cognitive control. Our findings provide computational, algorithmic, and neural accounts of guilt and shame.

">Leveraging unbiased LC-MS analysis to identify histone post-translational modifications associated with age-related decline of learning and memory</a></h4>

              
                Age-associated cognitive decline is a significant societal challenge, with several neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease becoming prevalent. Normal ageing is associated with several molecular, cellular, and metabolic hallmarks, including epigenetic mechanisms. In particular, dysregulation of post-translational modifications on histone tails is emerging as a mechanism associated with functional decline. The hippocampus is a region of the brain that is essential for the formation of episodic and spatial memories, which are particularly susceptible to age-related decline. In this perspective manuscript, we have used mass spectrometry as an unbiased method to profile histone tail post-translational modifications both at baseline and after contextual fear conditioning (CFC) from young and aged mouse hippocampi to identify age- and activity-dependent changes. Using this approach, we identify epigenetic marks not widely studied in ageing and in activity-induced learning. We propose a framework on how to integrate these epigenetic marks into current knowledge and discuss how to use this new analysis to formulate novel hypotheses that will broaden this field of ageing research. We believe that this work will be of interest to scientists, clinicians and the wider public by making a significant contribution to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for age-associated cognitive decline and by reporting the identification of new mechanisms to focus on.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hippocampal theta and gamma rhythms are often viewed as discrete channels supporting distinct cognitive operations. In particular, “gamma multiplexing” models propose that slow and fast gamma bands independently encode separate information streams or memory processes. Here, we present an alternative view: hippocampal oscillations form an interdependent process, governed by an energy cascade akin to turbulent flow across scales. In this framework, large-amplitude, low-frequency rhythms drive energy transfer to higher-frequency oscillations, rather than acting as isolated carriers of segregated information. Using laminar local field potential recordings in freely moving mice, we show that optogenetic inactivation of the medial entorhinal cortex or CA1 reduces theta power, leading to proportional reductions across the entire gamma spectrum (60–100 Hz). These data support the perspective that the putative ‘slow gamma’ component (30–50 Hz) potentially reflects higher-order theta harmonics rather than a distinct, independent rhythm. Moreover, locally generated gamma remains tightly coupled to theta, supporting an interdependent frequency spectrum modulated by network excitation. These findings challenge gamma multiplexing models and instead support an energy cascade framework, in which hippocampal gamma emerges from hierarchical, theta-driven oscillatory dynamics. Recognizing gamma as part of an interdependent, turbulence-like process reconciles contradictions in prior research and redefines how hippocampal oscillations contribute to cognition.</p>

                Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Twin (DT) technology, and the Metaverse have created new opportunities for transforming STEM education and workforce preparation. However, existing learning systems remain fragmented and lack an integrated, human-centered framework capable of supporting high-fidelity simulations, adaptive learning, and real-time competence development aligned with Industry 5.0. This study addresses this gap by developing a unified AI-Based Digital Twins Metaverse (AI-DTM) framework aimed at strengthening STEM employability skills and fostering adaptive expertise in higher education. This research employed a conceptual–analytical design comprising three structured phases: (1) a systematic conceptual synthesis guided by PRISMA 2020 to identify technological, pedagogical, and human-centric mechanisms relevant to AI, DTs, and Metaverse-based learning; (2) construction of an integrated AI-DTM framework through theoretical mapping, concept modeling, and iterative refinement; and (3) expert validation involving specialists in AI systems, digital twins, immersive learning, and instructional design. Evidence from interdisciplinary literature across AI-enhanced learning, DT-enabled simulation, and XR-based experiential environments informed the development of the framework. The resulting AI-DTM framework integrates AI-driven learner modeling, real-time DT simulations, and immersive Metaverse environments to create a unified, adaptive ecosystem. Key outcomes include: (a) personalized learning pathways supported by intelligent analytics and automated feedback; (b) high-fidelity, risk-free simulations that replicate authentic STEM work processes; (c) immersive and collaborative virtual experiences that enhance engagement, problem-solving, and teamwork; and (d) continuous competence profiling enabling the development of adaptive expertise. The framework demonstrates strong alignment with Industry 5.0 principles, supporting human–AI collaboration, data-driven decision-making, and future workforce readiness. This study provides a novel, scalable model that advances the design of AI-enabled learning ecosystems by integrating AI, Digital Twins, and Metaverse technologies into a cohesive architecture. The AI-DTM framework offers theoretical and practical contributions for enhancing STEM employability skills, strengthening adaptive expertise, and guiding institutions.

                The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework is a pivotal tool for organizing mechanistic knowledge and linking it to adverse outcomes of regulatory significance. However, the integration of test method information, particularly New Approach Methods (NAMs), within the central repository for AOP knowledge, (the AOP-Wiki), has been suboptimal, limiting the framework’s utility for regulatory decision-making. The Methods2AOP collaboration, comprised of various international stakeholders, was established to address this gap and enhance the role of test methods within the AOP framework. This paper reviews their work emphasizing the importance of linking detailed test method information and conceptually proposes how it may be included in the AOP knowledgebase. The Methods2AOP collaboration proposes using ontologies to standardize and structure information, thereby facilitating interoperability, enabling reusability, and establishing clear connections between test methods and Key Events (KEs). A conceptual model is presented to demonstrate qualitative similarities between concepts in key event components and structured methods information. The implementation of Methods2AOP recommendations would increase the clarity and transparency of method descriptions, which could support regulatory acceptance and a wider adoption of NAMs. The broad community of stakeholders impacted by this work stands to benefit from the Methods2AOP recommendations through enhanced regulatory decisions, increased visibility and scientific impact, new market opportunities, and the accelerated adoption of NAMs in regulatory affairs. In summary, the Methods2AOP collaboration presents a comprehensive effort to formally standardize the integration of test methods into the AOP framework, thereby fostering a more robust, and transparent system that aligns with the goals of the scientific and regulatory communities.

                Background Corruption, a multifaceted governance issue, impacts public well-being globally. The recent trends reveal a rise in suicide rates across the Americas, while all other regions show declines over twenty years of time. This study investigates corruption’s effect on suicide in 26 American countries, considering moderating factors of unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. Methods This study analysed latest two decades of available data, using stepwise panel regression method to investigate the effects of corruption and economic variables on suicide across income levels. Data were sourced from Transparency International, World Bank and the World Health Organization. Initially, unit root tests and CUSUM plots were used to ensure the stability and stationarity of the dataset, and model specification were validated through F test, LM test and Hausman test to select the ideal econometric model - POLS, REM, or FEM for the study. Results A strong suicide rate persistence revealed, particularly in high-income countries, where the lagged suicide variable showed a coefficient of 0.8063 (p < 0.001). Corruption significantly impacted suicide rates in upper-middle-income countries (coefficient = -0.0268, p < 0.05), with higher corruption perceptions scores correlating with lower suicide rates. Additionally, unemployment acted as a significant moderator, intensifying the corruption’s adverse impact on suicide with a coefficient of 0.0022 (p < 0.001) in upper-middle income nations. Economic growth demonstrated a minor protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, with an interaction coefficient of -0.0005 (p < 0.1), suggesting slight suicide reduction linked to economic stability. Conclusion This study found that corruption, unemployment, and economic growth significantly influence suicide rates across the Americas. Corruption exacerbates suicide risks in upper-middle-income countries, while unemployment amplifies this effect. Economic growth offers a slight protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, suggesting that economic stability may help mitigate suicide rates.

                Background Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and the emergence of drug resistance, systemic toxicity, and limited efficacy of current therapies highlight the need for safer and more effective treatment. Natural products have emerged as promising sources of multi-target anticancer agents. A. cardamomum has demonstrated preliminary anticancer potential, yet the bioactive constituents and their molecular mechanisms in breast cancer remain poorly elucidated. Methods This study integrated in silico approaches to investigate the therapeutic potential of A. cardamomum seed extract against breast cancer. LC–MS analysis identified phytochemical compounds, followed by network pharmacology to determine their potential targets and molecular pathways. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity predictions were assessed through ADMET and Lipinski’s rule of five analyses to evaluate drug-likeness and safety. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to evaluate binding affinity and structural stability of compounds with key oncogenic proteins. Results LC-MS profiling identified 22 distinct compounds in A. cardamomum seeds. ADMET and Lipinski analyses demonstrated that most compounds possessed high gastrointestinal absorption, favorable oral bioavailability, and low toxicity risk. Network pharmacology highlighting SRC, TNF-α, Caspase-3, and EGFR as central nodes in the protein-protein interaction network. Molecular docking identified compounds C17 and C20 as the most promising bioactives, showing strong binding affinities and interactions similar to control ligands. MD simulations confirmed their stable complexes, indicating conformational stability and robust ligand–protein interactions. Conclusion This study highlights the promising multi-target anticancer potential of A. cardamomum seeds. Compounds C17 and C20 were identified as lead candidates with strong and stable interactions with key breast cancer-related proteins and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. These results suggest that A. cardamomum could serve as a potential source for developing new plant-based therapies against breast cancer. Further in vitro and in vivo investigations are warranted to validate their efficacy and safety.

                Background Adolescent depression affects approximately 13% of youth globally, often emerging before age 14 and leading to long-term impairments in social, academic, and emotional functioning. Evidence suggests that mentalization-based treatment (MBT), particularly its adolescent adaptation, may reduce depressive symptoms by strengthening reflective functioning. Methods This single-arm pilot study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a short-term, family-inclusive MBT intervention for 15 adolescents aged 10–14 years with mild-to-moderate depression in Valparaíso, Chile. The intervention consists of 12 weekly sessions delivered in three phases: shared formulation, promotion of individual and family mentalization, and evaluation of therapeutic progress. Feasibility outcomes include recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. Secondary outcomes include changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms, family cohesion, and therapeutic processes. Qualitative interviews with adolescents, caregivers, and therapists will complement quantitative data. Results The study will generate parameters on feasibility, adherence, and acceptability, as well as preliminary estimates of clinical and process outcomes to inform the design of a future randomized controlled trial. Conclusions Findings will guide the cultural adaptation and potential scaling of adolescent and family MBT within the Chilean public health system. This protocol outlines the methodological framework and expected contributions of the study to clinical practice and research on adolescent depression.

                Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, characterized by villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Despite advances in serological testing, duodenal biopsy remains the diagnostic gold standard, especially in atypical or patchy disease. This retrospective study at King Fahd University Hospital (KFUH), Saudi Arabia, evaluated the diagnostic contribution of biopsies from the duodenal bulb (D1) and distal duodenum (D2) in 224 patients assessed for suspected CD between August 2023 and August 2024. Clinical, serological [IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG2), anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA), deamidated gliadin peptide], and histopathological data were analyzed. Sixty-five patients (29%) were diagnosed with CD. Villous atrophy, mucosal flattening, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes were strongly associated with CD (p ≤ 0.001), and positive anti-TG2 and EMA correlated with Marsh grade. Combined D1 and D2 sampling improved diagnostic yield, underscoring the value of integrating histology and serology in evaluating classical and non-classical CD presentations.

                <p>by Dmitry Amakhin, Anton Chizhov, Guillaume Girier, Mathieu Desroches, Jan Sieber, Serafim Rodrigues</p>

In this article we demonstrate a general protocol for constructing systematically experimental steady-state bifurcation diagrams for electrophysiologically active cells. We perform our experiments on entorhinal cortex neurons, both excitatory (pyramidal neurons) and inhibitiory (interneurons). A slowly ramped voltage-clamp electrophysiology protocol serves as closed-loop feedback controlled experiment for the subsequent current-clamp open-loop protocol on the same cell. In this way, the voltage-clamped experiment determines dynamically stable and unstable (hidden) steady states of the current-clamp experiment. The transitions between observable steady states and observable spiking states in the current-clamp experiment provide partial evidence for stability and bifurcations of the steady states. This technique for completing steady-state bifurcation diagrams in a model-independent way expands support for model validation to otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase space. Overlaying the voltage-clamp and current-clamp protocols leads to an experimental validation of the classical <i>slow-fast dissection</i> method introduced by J. Rinzel in the 1980s and routinely applied ever since in order to analyse slow-fast neuronal models. Our approach opens doors to observing further complex hidden states with more advanced control strategies, allowing to control real cells beyond pharmacological manipulations.

                <p>by Rainey Lyons, Vanja Dukic, David M. Bortz</p>

Characteristics of individuals in a population, such as age and size, play a key role in determining how populations change over time. In contexts of population dynamics, identifying effective model features, such as fecundity and mortality rates, is generally a complex and computationally intensive process, especially when the dynamics are heterogeneous across the population. In this work, we propose a Weak form Scientific Machine Learning-based method for selecting appropriate model ingredients from a library of scientifically feasible functions used to model structured populations. This paper presents extensions of the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) method to select the best-fitting ingredients from noisy time-series histogram data. This extension includes learning heterogeneous dynamics and also learning the boundary processes (such as birth) of the model directly from the data. We additionally incorporate a cross-validation method which helps fine tune the recovered boundary process hyperparameters to the data.
Several test cases are considered, demonstrating the method’s performance for several standard models from population modeling, including age and size-structured models. Through these examples, we examine both the advantages and limitations of the method, with a particular focus on the distinguishability of terms in the library.

Understanding how the human brain processes body movements is essential for clarifying the mechanisms underlying social cognition and interaction. This study investigates the encoding of biomechanically possible and impossible body movements in occipitotemporal cortex using ultra-high field 7Tesla fMRI. By predicting the response of single voxels to impossible/possible movements using a computational modelling approach, our findings demonstrate that a combination of low-level, postural, biomechanical, and categorical features significantly predicts neural responses in the ventral visual cortex, particularly within the extrastriate body area (EBA), underscoring the brain’s sensitivity to biomechanical plausibility.

                <p>by Gota Morishita, Carsten Murawski, Nitin Yadav, Shinsuke Suzuki</p>

Learning by observing others’ experiences is a hallmark of human intelligence. While the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying observational learning are well understood, less is known about whom people prefer to learn from in the context of observational learning. One hypothesis posits that learners prefer individuals who exhibit a high degree of decision noise, ‘free riding’ on the costly exploration of others. An alternative hypothesis is that learners prefer individuals with low decision noise, as lower decision noise is often associated with better performance. In a preregistered experiment, we found that most participants preferred to learn from low-noise (high-performing) individuals. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that participants who preferred low-noise individuals tended to rely on imitation of others’ actions. These findings offer a potential computational account of how learning styles are related to partner selection in social learning.

                <p>by Longqiang Wang, Xiao Wu, Atanu Paul, Jun Yao, Bin Wang</p>

The breast and ovarian tumor suppressor BRCA1 is a cell cycle-regulated protein and tumors with reduced BRCA1 protein level may share molecular features of <i>BRCA1</i>-mutant tumor and respond to PARPi therapy. Here, we identify that BRCA1 protein stability is controlled through ubiquitin lysine 11 (K11)-linkage modification under the regulation of Cezanne deubiquitinating enzyme, APC/C E3 ligase, and Ube2S E2 conjugating enzyme in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Cezanne-deficiency leads to increased BRCA1 K11-ubiquitination, decreased BRCA1 protein level, and increased cellular sensitivity to PARPi. The BRCA1 K11-linked ubiquitination is carried out through a degron on BRCA1 that is recognized by APC/C cofactor Cdh1. Tumor expression and mutational analyses indicate that Cezanne low or Ube2S high expression is associated with “BRCAness” and correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Thus, our study has demonstrated a ubiquitin K11-linked ubiquitination pathway that regulates BRCA1 protein stability, dysregulation of which predicts BRCA1-deficiency that may be effectively targeted with PARPi therapy.

                <p>by Eudald Pascual-Carreras, Kathrin Garschall, Patrick R. H. Steinmetz</p>

Animals with lifelong growth adjust their growth rates to nutrient availability, yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we studied how food supply and TOR signaling regulate the cell cycle in a multipotent population of Vasa2-/Piwi1-expressing cells in the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>. We discovered that starvation induces a reversible G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> cell cycle arrest in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells and that cell cycle re-entry upon refeeding is dependent on TOR signaling. In addition, the length of the refeeding stimulus after starvation determines the proportion of cells that re-enter S-phase. Remarkably, prolonged starvation delayed both refeeding-induced TOR signaling activation and S-phase re-entry, and led to a global decrease in the active histone mark H3K27ac in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells. This strongly suggests that <i>Nematostella</i> Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells undergo starvation-controlled quiescence deepening, a phenomenon previously described only in unicellular eukaryotes and mammalian cell culture. The nutritional control of quiescence and cell proliferation may thus be a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved strategy underlying the environmental regulation of indeterminate growth in animals.

The hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors (HCAR2 and HCAR3), also known as prototypical metabolite-sensing receptors, are key targets for treating dyslipidemia and metabolic disorders. While HCAR2 activation, but not HCAR3 activation, is associated with side effects of cutaneous flushing, the structural features and ligand preferences of HCAR3 remain less understood. Here, we used Sf9 cells to express HCAR3-Gi and HCAR2-Gi complexes, and present cryo-EM structures of HCAR3-Gi complexes with agonists compound 6O (3.31 Å), D-phenyllactic acid (3.05 Å), IBC293 (3.26 Å), and acifran (3.18Å), as well as HCAR2-Gi complex with agonist acifran (2.72 Å). Our findings reveal the mechanism behind 6O’s highest affinity to HCAR3, attributed to its full occupation of both R1 and R2 regions of the orthosteric binding pocket. Moreover, combined with cAMP assay in HEK-293 cells, we have elucidated that the ligand selectivity between HCAR3 and HCAR2 depended on <i>π</i>–<i>π</i> interaction with F107<sup>3.32</sup> (L107<sup>3.32</sup> in HCAR2) and ligand-binding pocket size difference, facilitated by key residues difference V/L83<sup>2.60</sup>, Y/N86<sup>2.63</sup>, and S/W91<sup>23.48</sup>. Collectively, these structural insights lay the groundwork for developing HCAR3-specific drugs, potentially avoiding HCAR2-induced adverse effects.

                Background To present a decade-long evaluation of the Turkish Pediatric Endocrinology Subspecialty Board Examination (TPEBE), focusing on its structural evolution, psychometric performance, and candidates’ perceptions. Methods This cross-sectional study analyzed examination data from 2015–2025, encompassing 263 sittings (261 eligible candidates) and post-exam survey responses from 217 participants. Examination metrics included mean scores, pass rates, and reliability coefficients (Cronbach’s α) for multiple-choice question (MCQ) and key feature problem (KFP) components. Survey items assessed perceptions of exam difficulty, fairness, relevance, and organization using a 9-point Likert scale. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results Mean total scores declined following the 2019 inclusion of KFPs (x̄=52.9±9.05 in 2025), while reliability improved progressively (MCQ α=0.53–0.90; KFP α=0.31–0.85). Pass rates varied from 22.6% to 85.0%. Male candidates scored higher on MCQs and total scores (p<0.05), but gender differences in KFP performance and overall pass rates were not statistically significant. Candidates rated the examination highly for organization (x̄=7.75±1.54) and clinical relevance of KFPs (x̄=7.35±1.59), though exam duration received the lowest satisfaction (x̄=5.14±2.97). Qualitative feedback emphasized the educational value of KFPs and recommended extended testing time. Conclusions Over ten years, the TPEBE has evolved into a psychometrically robust and educationally valuable certification process. The balanced integration of MCQs and KFPs has strengthened construct validity and candidate engagement. These examinations are expected to gain broader recognition by institutions and regulators as a benchmark for educational and professional achievement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1370/v1?src=rss">Influence of spark polarity on the tubular Electrostatic precipitators characterization for CH4 and CO gases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Methane (CH₄) and carbon monoxide (CO) remain two of the most critical air pollutants due to their significant environmental and health risks. This study investigates the enhancement of pollutant removal efficiency in plasma-based systems by examining how spark discharge polarity affects gas treatment performance under sub-atmospheric pressure. Using a tubular electrostatic precipitator (ESP) operated at 15, 20, and 25 kV and pressures of 380, 406, and 508 Torr, we measured key plasma parameters including discharge current, electron temperature and density, ozone (O3) generation, specific energy input (SEI), and gas removal efficiency under both positive and negative polarity conditions. Our results show that higher electron temperatures and discharge currents increase the availability of energetic electrons capable of enhancing molecular dissociation and pollutant removal. Negative polarity produced a more active plasma, yielding maximum removal efficiencies of 88% for CH₄ and 87% for CO at 25 kV and 380 Torr, driven by intensified formation of reactive species such as O•, OH•, and O3 that promote oxidative degradation. SEI increased with voltage, reaching 873 J/L under optimal conditions, in close correlation with peak removal performance. The system exhibited a 20.3°C rise in outlet gas temperature within 120 seconds, indicating substantial energy deposition while maintaining non-thermal plasma behavior. These findings demonstrate that pollutant removal in ESP systems is governed primarily by plasma-chemical reactions rather than electrostatic collection, and they provide a practical pathway for optimizing spark-driven ESP reactors for indoor air purification applications targeting low concentrations of CH₄ and CO.

                Background The South African Constitution recognizes equal access to education as a fundamental human right for all individuals. However, despite progressive legislative frameworks, students with physical disabilities continue to face infrastructural, attitudinal, and systemic barriers that hinder full participation in higher education institutions. Aim This study explored the lived experiences of students with physical disabilities at a university in KwaZulu-Natal. Methods This study employed a phenomenological qualitative study design using semi-structured interviews to explore the lived experiences of students with physical disabilities at a university in KwaZulu-Natal. Purposive sampling was used to recruit eight participants across different colleges, who shared their in-depth perspectives and experiences through in-person and virtual interviews. Data were analysed thematically. Results Seven main themes emerged from the data. These include: (1) inadequate and misaligned accessibility to campus infrastructure, (2) stakeholder influence on the lack of an adequate, accommodating environment, (3) inaccessible and insufficient transport services, (4) inconsistencies and gaps in disability support services, (5) attitudinal barriers, (6) positive peer interactions and social inclusion, and (7) student-driven future recommendations. Conclusion The findings highlight that while peer support fosters a sense of belonging, systemic barriers persist. These findings underscore the need for proactive, consultative, and equity-driven approaches that prioritize universal design, stakeholder accountability, and the meaningful inclusion of students with physical disabilities in decision-making processes. Contribution The findings underscore the need for alignment between policy and practice through student consultation in decision-making and enhancing stakeholder awareness of students’ grievances.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-886/v2?src=rss">Revisiting the Governance–Dividend Nexus: The Mediating Role of Corporate Social Responsibility [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Despite plentiful research on the link between corporate governance (CG) and dividend policy, the mediating impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the CG –dividend policy link remains unexplored. This study investigates the mediating impact of CSR on the CG –dividend policy link, and explores the mechanism through which CSR mediates this relationship. Methods Firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are considered as a study sample. The data collection period ranged from 2012 to 2021. The final sample included 15,800 firm-year observations. Results The results findings indicate that firms with strong CG tend to pay low dividends, consistent with the substitution hypothesis, in which dividends and CG act as substitutes for each other. In addition to establishing a direct link between CG and dividend policy, our study significantly contributes to the extant literature by presenting both theoretical proposition and empirical evidence on the mediation effect of CSR in the above-mentioned relationship. We find that CSR mediates the corporate governance- dividend policy relationship, which implies that in comparison to corporate governance, CSR has a more dominating impact on firms’ dividend policy decisions, and better-governed firms are more likely to engage in CSR activities to protect their stakeholders; consequently, they prefer to hold or invest cash instead of paying dividends because CSR engagements lower the cost of equity capital. These findings were corroborated by a set of robustness tests. Conclusions Our results have several implications for firms, regulators, and investors. Firms can use high dividend payouts to compensate for poor investor protection and to maintain good relationships with investors. When making investment decisions, investors are advised to consider socially responsible firms because of their strong CG structure. Finally, policy makers should give special consideration to CSR in order to reduce environmental and social problems and to enhance the related standards to ensure the safety and security of all stakeholders and hence reduce global accusation and pressure.

                Background In the context of 21st century education, creative thinking is a key competency required to navigate complex and rapidly changing global challenges. However, in the digital era, students’ creative thinking skills are often insufficiently developed due to the lack of attention to learning profiles, interests, and readiness. In social studies learning, this issue limits students’ opportunities to explore and express creative ideas. Methods This study aimed to design and implement a hypermedia e-module based on differentiated learning, called EduHYPE-IPS, to enhance elementary school students’ creative thinking skills. The research employed a Research and Development (R&D) with ten stages the Borg and Gall model. The participants were fifth-grade students from six elementary schools in Majalengka and Yogyakarta, selected purposively. Data were collected through creative thinking tests and response questionnaires from students and teachers, and analyzed using descriptive and comparative statistics to determine validity, practicality, and effectiveness. Results The developed e-module achieved a high level of validity, with an average expert validation score of 92.45% across media, content, and language aspects. Field trials demonstrated an improvement in students’ creative thinking, with an average N-Gain of 22.46% in the control class and 51.81% in the experimental class. Both students and teachers responded very positively, indicating that EduHYPE-IPS was engaging, user-friendly, and effective in supporting differentiated learning. Conclusions The findings confirm that the hypermedia e-module meets the criteria of being valid, practical, and effective. EduHYPE-IPS can serve as an innovative digital learning resource to foster creativity in primary education and as a practical tool for teachers to design engaging, student-centered lessons integrating technology with differentiated teaching strategies.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA) is a dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion in <i>ATN1</i>, which encodes the transcriptional co-repressor Atrophin-1. DRPLA features motor, cognitive, and epileptic symptoms and shares pathogenic mechanisms with other polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders, including protein misfolding, impaired autophagy, and transcriptional dysregulation. To understand disease mechanisms, we performed RNA-seq on HEK293T cells stably over-expressing wild-type or pathogenic ATN1. Cells expressing pathogenic ATN1 exhibited a distinct transcriptomic profile, including disruptions in synaptic organization, extracellular matrix remodeling, ion channel expression, and neurotransmission. Several genes tied to neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and oncogenic pathways were fully activated or silenced. Dysregulated pathways also included inflammation, chromatin remodeling, stress responses, and redox imbalance. Heat shock protein expression changes suggested proteotoxic stress and impaired protein quality control, with some findings conserved in a previously reported <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> model of DRPLA. The transcriptomic signatures that we describe here expand understanding of the normal functions of ATN1 and the biology of disease of DRPLA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-948/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Gastro-bronchial fistula complicating a sleeve gastrectomy: from a glimmer of hope to a plight [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Bariatric surgery, particularly sleeve gastrectomy (SG), has emerged as an effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity. Despite its benefits, howver, it may result in severe complications. One rare but serious postoperative issue is the development of a gastrobronchial fistula (GBF), a condition with a challenging diagnosis and management pathway due to its insidious nature. Case Presentation We report the case of a 36-year-old woman who underwent sleeve gastrectomy in 2015. The early postoperative course was complicated by a gastric fistula that was managed with double pigtail stents. Subsequently, the patient developed recurrent bronchopulmonary infections, and imaging in 2017 revealed a GBF connecting the gastric remnant to the bronchial tree. Initial endoscopic management with stenting failed because of migration. Definitive surgical management involved complex adhesiolysis and creation of tension-free fistula-jejunal anastomosis. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient remains asymptomatic. Discussion Gastrothoracic fistula post-bariatric surgery is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. Their development is often linked to the insufficient treatment of early gastric leaks or collections. Diagnosis is frequently delayed owing to nonspecific respiratory symptoms. Endoscopic approaches have show limited success, and surgical management, often complex, is frequently necessary. Multidisciplinary strategies, including endoscopic and surgical options, are vital for achieving favorable outcomes. Conclusion Gastrobronchial fistulas represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge following sleeve gastrectomy. A high index of suspicion, long-term follow-up, and tailored multidisciplinary approach are essential for effective management and resolution. Awareness of this rare complication should prompt early detection and intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality.

<p>Recapitulative schema of different exploratory levels of the evolutionary impact on human neurological diseases.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Clinical neuroscience focuses on the mechanisms of brain function, but this approach falls short of insights into how the central nervous system (CNS) evolved, both in health and disease. Here, we discuss evolutionary concepts relevant to understanding human brain diseases, on the genetic, subcellular, cellular, connectomic, behavioral, and cultural levels. By revisiting common neurological diseases, we discuss evolved residues from our ancestors, mechanisms of exaptation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and human longevity with the consequent outpacing of biological evolution by cultural evolution. An evolution-based conceptual framework can propel transdisciplinary research targeting the constraints imposed by and compensatory adaptations involved in human-specific neurological diseases.

<p>ASDs are neurodevelopmental disorders of social behavior deficits and repetitive / restricted behaviors, affecting 1 in 31 children in the U.S. Pharmacological interventions for the core symptoms of ASD are lacking. ASD genetics are highly heterogenous, with hundreds of genes conferring risk, though these genes are beginning to converge on shared molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms, representing potential new paths for treatment development.

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and the presence of repetitive and restricted behaviors. ASDs are clinically and genetically heterogeneous with hundreds of genes identified through large-scale whole exome and genome sequencing studies contributing to risk. Recent studies are beginning to illuminate shared mechanisms across ASD-associated genes at the molecular, cellular, circuit, and behavioral levels, identifying neurogenesis and excitatory-inhibitory neuron development as points of biological convergence. These functional analyses of ASD genes provide substantial promise for gaining a deeper understanding of ASD pathophysiology and elucidating novel therapeutic targets.

                <p>Reversing the aging process may yield significant benefits in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), as accelerated biological aging is observed in this population. Secondary analyses of 2 previously conducted dietary interventions including a 6-month modified ketogenic diet in 39 participants and an 8-week randomized comparison of intermittent and daily calorie restriction versus a weight-stable regimen in 36 participants demonstrated significant decreases in metabolomic age (mAge) following the ketogenic diet (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and intermittent calorie restriction (<i>p</i> = 0.04), whereas daily calorie reduction had no effect. These findings indicate that fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) can reverse accelerated metabolomic aging in PwMS. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1278–1282</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle activities (LA) are strongly related, and both are associated with dementia risk. We investigated the influence of SES and LA on brain atrophy and cognitive decline considering amyloid-beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated 221 older adults (mean age, 67.1 ± 8.2 years) who underwent cognitive testing annually over a median follow-up period of 3.4 years. Longitudinal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was available for 181 participants. Measures of SES and LA were collected using questionnaires and combined to SES and LA scores using a latent variable approach. We used linear mixed-effects models to investigate if SES and LA are independently or interactively with Aβ and WMH load associated with decline in domains language, processing speed/attention, executive function, and episodic memory. Mediation models assessed whether these associations were explained by gray matter atrophy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SES and LA were associated with better cognitive performance at baseline, but were not associated with cognitive decline over time. In interaction with brain pathologies, higher LA reduced the detrimental effects of Aβ and WMH load on language decline, whereas higher SES reduced the detrimental effects of Aβ pathology on episodic memory decline. Individuals with low SES showed faster Aβ-related gray matter atrophy, which mediated the association between Aβ and episodic memory decline but not language decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that multiple resilience mechanisms underlie the protective effects of SES and LA on cognitive decline. Interventions targeting SES-related risk factors may be most effective when implemented early, before neurodegenerative changes begin. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1222–1236</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The understanding of neurofilament light chain (NfL) presence and release in oligodendrocytes is limited. This study aims to determine the NfL expression in oligodendrocytes, investigate whether excess ɑ-synuclein (α-syn) impacts NfL expression, release, and functions in oligodendrocytes, as well as detect plasma NfL-positive oligodendrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (ODEVs) changes in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls (HCs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>NfL expression in oligodendrocytes was assessed using RNAscope and immunofluorescence staining in human and mouse brain slices, as well as flow cytometry in mouse brain single-cells. The MO3.13 oligodendrocyte cell line was used to mimic MSA pathology with α-syn overexpression or preformed fibril treatment. NfL levels were detected in cell line, brain tissues and condition media, and the differences between MSA pathology and controls were compared. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were quantified using nano-scale flow cytometry in a cohort of 101 MSA patients, 96 PD patients, and 97 HCs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both <i>NEFL</i> mRNA and NfL protein showed co-localization with typical oligodendrocyte marker anti-2,3-cyclic nucleotide-3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). A total of 58.5% of CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes co-expressed NfL. Increased α-syn load elevates NfL expression in both oligodendrocyte cell line and MSA patient brain slices. NfL overexpression inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, but did not affect α-syn-induced cell viability deficits. α-Syn promoted oligodendrocytic NfL release via extracellular vesicles. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were elevated in MSA patients compared to PD and HCs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest additional cellular roles for NfL in oligodendrocytes beyond its established function in neurons and have potential implications for the neurodegenerative pathophysiology of MSA. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1364–1379</p>

<p>This study demonstrates that intranasal Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell (WJ-MSC) administration at 3 or 10 days post-insult reduced the lesion size and sensorimotor impairment following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury in mice. WJ-MSCs expressed receptors for HI-upregulated chemokines and migrated from the nasal cavity into the meninges and brain parenchyma. WJ-MSCs inhibited neuroinflammation and boosted neuroregeneration via their secretome. Intranasal WJ-MSC therapy remains effective in conjunction with hypothermia, underscoring its translational potential as noninvasive adjunct to current clinical care. Created with <a target="_blank"

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) caused by perinatal asphyxia is a primary cause of long-term neurological morbidity. Hypothermia is the sole available clinical intervention despite its limited efficacy. Intranasal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) show promise for the treatment of HIBI. This study explores the efficacy, migration, treatment window, and therapeutic mechanisms of intranasally applied Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) in a neonatal HIBI mouse model, and assesses its therapeutic benefit in conjunction with hypothermia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Nine-day-old C57BL/6 mice underwent hypoxia-ischemia (HI), with or without hypothermia, and were intranasally dosed with 0.1 to 2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> WJ-MSCs, at 3 or 10 days post-HI. WJ-MSCs were traced using different techniques. Neurogenesis was examined 2 days post-treatment. Neuroinflammation, sensorimqotor outcome, and neuronal tissue loss was assessed 28 days post-HI. Additionally, anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative properties of WJ-MSCs were investigated in non-contact co-cultures with microglia and neural stem cells, and by secretome profiling.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Intranasally delivered WJ-MSCs reduced HI-induced lesion size and sensorimotor impairments. WJ-MSCs expressed multiple receptors for upregulated chemokines in the HI-lesion, and migrated from the nasal cavity into the meninges and brain parenchyma. WJ-MSCs secreted a broad spectrum of immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative proteins, and inhibited neuroinflammation and boosted neuroregeneration <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. WJ-MSC potency was sustained across different donors. Importantly, intranasal WJ-MSCs augmented the therapeutic benefits of hypothermia following neonatal HIBI in mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78002?af=R">Cross‐Sectional FDG in Down Syndrome and Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Directly compare the brain glucose patterns seen with [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) between 2 genetically determined forms of Alzheimer's disease: Down syndrome (DS) and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional analyses of FDG were performed in individuals with DS (n = 76) from the Alzheimer Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome (ABC-DS), ADAD (n = 297), and neurotypical familial controls (n = 188) from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN). Within-group linear regression models and generalized additive models were performed for select regional FDG uptake measures (isthmus cingulate and inferior parietal, precuneus, middle temporal gyrus, and precentral gyrus). Age, sex, apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 carrier status, and cortical amyloid burden were included within these analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Even 20 years before expected onset of clinical symptoms, FDG uptake was lower for DS compared to neurotypical familial controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). ADAD baseline FDG was similar to neurotypical familial controls until 7 years before expected symptom onset. Both symptomatic individuals with DS and ADAD had lower FDG compared to neurotypical familial controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). A higher amyloid burden was associated with lower FDG for both genetic forms, with similar rates of decline in FDG uptake for DS and ADAD who were amyloid positive.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Brain glucose metabolism is substantially lower for people with DS, even in individuals who are cognitively stable. The patterns of FDG decline are distinct in these 2 genetically determined forms of AD. The diagnostic utility of FDG-PET is specific to the genetic form of AD.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78003?af=R">Predictive Value of Plasma Biomarkers in Tau‐PET Transitions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine the predictive value of amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) versus the plasma ratio of phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217) to non-phosphorylated tau217 (%p-tau217) for tau-PET transitions (T− to T+). The added value of combining plasma amyloid-β 42 and amyloid-β 40 (Aβ42/40) and %p-tau217 into an amyloid probability score (APS2) was also assessed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) participants had plasma markers measured at via mass spectrometry (MS), an amyloid-PET scan, and a tau-PET (meta-temporal region of interest [ROI]) negative scan (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR] &lt;1.29) at the index (baseline) date, along with one or more follow-up tau-PET scans. The BioFINDER-2 cohort was used for validation. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and apolipoprotein (<i>APOE</i>) ε4 were used to assess predictors, with scaling to the interquartile range (IQR) for comparability of hazard ratios (HR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 255 tau-PET negative MCSA participants (median age: 71.9 years), 37 converted to tau-PET positive (median follow-up time: 3.81 years). Higher %p-tau217 (HR: 1.52 [95% CI: 1.28–1.80]), amyloid-PET centiloid (HR: 1.47 [95% CI: 1.20–1.79]), and APS2 (HR: 1.62 [95% CI: 1.22–2.16]) predicted tau-PET conversion. However, Aβ42/40 (HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.54–1.66]) was not associated with tau-PET conversion. In the BioFINDER-2 cohort (605 tau-negative, median age: 70.2), 33 converted to tau-positive (median follow-up time: 2 years), with higher %p-tau217 (HR: 1.80 [95% CI: 1.50–2.17]), amyloid-PET centiloid (HR: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.77–2.97]), and lower Aβ42/40 (HR: 2.38 [95% CI: 1.17–4.83]) predicting conversion.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In two cohorts, %p-tau217 was associated with tau-PET conversion, comparable to amyloid-PET. APS2 also predicted conversion in the MCSA cohort, whereas Aβ42/40 predicted conversion in the BioFINDER-2 cohort, which had more individuals with cognitive impairment.

<p>Graphical abstract illustrating the study design, experimental workflow, and key findings from single-cell profiling of peripheral mononuclear cells in multiple sclerosis patients undergoing anti-CD20 therapy, revealing disease- and treatment-associated immune signatures.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate disease-related and anti-CD20 therapy-related changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using multi-omics single-cell analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Targeted single-cell sequencing of transcriptomes and epitopes was performed on PBMCs isolated from 64 blood samples collected from MS patients at baseline and at 3 time points following anti-CD20 treatment, alongside HC. Multicolor spectral flow cytometry was performed on 15 of the samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cell cluster analysis identified a subpopulation of classical monocytes with significantly high interleukin-1 beta (<i>IL1B</i>) expression and a pro-inflammatory profile compared to other monocyte clusters. This monocyte cluster expressed genes of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as <i>CXCL8</i>, <i>CCL3</i>, <i>CCL4</i>, and <i>TNFα</i> and was a major cell transmitter subset within the intercellular communication network. The IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster was prevalent in HC (8.1% of PBMCs), but reduced in untreated MS patients (0.8% of PBMCs). High <i>CXCR4</i> expression and Gene Ontology-term analysis indicated that IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes from MS patients had central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating abilities in contrast to HC, likely regulated by <i>LEF1</i>. After anti-CD20 treatment, IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes showed changes in pro-inflammatory gene expression and <i>MYC</i>-associated regulatory networks, and their abundance increased 6-fold in the blood.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our single-cell analysis identified a unique peripheral IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster with a suggested CNS-infiltrating cellular phenotype that may explain its lower abundance in the blood of untreated compared to anti-CD20 treated MS patients. Treatment-associated changes in this population may contribute to the non-B cell related effects of anti-CD20 therapy. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1283–1298</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease is a heterogeneous group of genetic neuropathies, with &gt;90 genes identified. Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been linked to CMT. <i>DARS2</i>, encoding the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, has been typically associated with leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation. This study aimed to investigate the association between biallelic <i>DARS2</i> variants and axonal CMT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated 5 individuals from 3 unrelated families with axonal CMT and biallelic <i>DARS2</i> variants. Functional studies in fibroblasts assessed their effects on DARS2 expression, localization, and mitochondrial function. Enzymatic activity was evaluated in HEK293 cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 5 individuals, including 4 adults, presented with childhood-onset progressive axonal CMT. None had leukoencephalopathy, but one showed central nervous system involvement, with intellectual disability and epilepsy. Genetic analysis identified compound heterozygous <i>DARS2</i> variants: family A, p.Ser238Phe and p.Arg336Cys; family B, p.Ser238Phe and p.Ile25Thrfs*38; family C, c.492+2T&gt;C and p.Pro503Leu. Functional studies revealed reduced DARS2 protein levels, mitochondrial network abnormalities, and impaired mitochondrial function. p.Ser238Phe behaves as a hypomorphic allele, whereas p.Pro503Leu reduced DARS2 enzymatic activity by 75%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings expand the <i>DARS2</i>-related disease spectrum, establishing a novel association with axonal CMT. Hypomorphic variants, such as p.Ser238Phe, when paired with more deleterious variants, result in isolated axonal CMT, whereas more severe combinations—although not as deleterious as those seen in leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation—result in axonal CMT with central nervous system involvement, albeit without leukoencephalopathy. These observations raise the possibility that <i>DARS2</i>-associated diseases form a continuum rather than representing strictly distinct central or peripheral nervous system disorders.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In Parkinson's disease (PD), the power of beta oscillations (± 13–30 hertz [Hz]) from subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFPs) is associated with motor symptoms. Beta power can be used for adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) algorithms based upon symptom fluctuations. The time course of beta power modulations after levodopa intake at home remains to be described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ten-minute averages of beta peak power were recorded in 33 patients with PD treated with STN-DBS for a median duration of 134 days during the titration phase. Median beta power after scheduled medication intakes (n = 24,103) and the effects of peak frequency, stun effect, stimulation amplitude, levodopa dose, and preoperative levodopa response were analyzed using cluster-based permutation testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Beta power was significantly reduced between 30 and 140 minutes after intake for stimulation amplitudes between 0 and 2.1 mA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). This response was seen in low (12.7–20.5 Hz) but not high (21.5–30.3 Hz) beta frequencies. Significant clusters were found regardless of stun effect and preoperative levodopa response, during low stimulation amplitudes (&lt; 1 mA), and for 100 and 150 mg but not 50 mg doses. A linear mixed-effects model for the area under the curve (AUC) levodopa beta response (30–180 min) revealed a dose–response relationship, a stronger negative response in low-beta compared with high-beta frequencies, and no significant effect of stimulation amplitude.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>STN beta power responds to levodopa during low to moderate stimulation amperages, depending on the beta peak frequency and dose, which is informative for aDBS implementation. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1352–1363</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78031?af=R">Identification of New KCNT1‐Epilepsy Drugs by In Silico, Cell, and Drosophila Modeling</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hyperactive KCNT1 potassium channels, caused by gain-of-function mutations, are associated with a range of epilepsy disorders. Patients typically experience drug-resistant seizures and, in cases with infantile onset, developmental regression can follow. KCNT1-related disorders include epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. There are currently no effective treatments for KCNT1 epilepsies, but suppressing overactive channels poses a potential strategy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the KCNT1 channel structure we in silico screened a library of known drugs for those predicted to block the channel pore to inhibit channel activity. Cellular KCNT1 channel inhibition was analyzed using electrophysiology and <i>Drosophila</i> bang-sensitive assays were used to analyze seizure suppression. Brain penetration of one drug was analyzed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in a mouse.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eight known drugs were investigated in vitro for their effects on patient-specific mutant KCNT1 channels, with 4 drugs showing significant reduction of K<sup>+</sup> current amplitudes. The action of the 4 drugs was then analyzed in vivo and 2 were found to reduce the seizure phenotype in humanized <i>Drosophila</i> KCNT1 epilepsy models. One drug, antrafenine, was shown to cross the blood–brain barrier in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identified a known drug, antrafenine, that reduces KCNT1 channel activity, reduces seizure activity in <i>Drosophila</i>, and crosses the blood–brain barrier in the mouse, suggesting its potential applicability as a new treatment for KCNT1 epilepsy. The sequential in silico, in vitro, and in vivo mechanism-based drug selection strategy used here may have broader application for other human disorders where a disease mechanism has been identified.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78060?af=R">Prioritizing Modifiable Risk Factors for Dementia Prevention across the Spectrum of Genetic Susceptibility: A Prospective Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Various modifiable risk factors have been identified for dementia, but it remains unclear whether these associations and importance vary according to genetic predisposition.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 182,473 dementia-free individuals from United Kingdom (UK) Biobank cohort. We calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and population-attributable fractions (PAF) of 11 modifiable risk factors (smoking status, drinking status, diet, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, education, depression, social contact, and air pollution) for dementia in general population and across various genetic groups based on <i>APOE</i> genotypes and a weighted polygenic-risk score (PRS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During 12.42-year follow-up, a total of 2,065 incident all-cause dementia (ACD) cases were documented. Low social contact, diabetes, and abdominal obesity were top 3 modifiable risk factors associated with an increased risk of dementia, especially in low <i>APOE</i> risk (ε2ε2 or ε2ε3) group. The HRs associated with low social contact, diabetes, and abdominal obesity were 3.86 (95% CI: 2.08–7.17), 2.18 (95% CI: 1.43–3.32) and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.88–1.89) for dementia in the low <i>APOE</i> risk. The same patterns were also observed in PRS groups. In terms of PAFs, abdominal obesity contributed the most in low genetic risk groups (PAF: 13.68 to 15.73%). In contrast, less education was the largest contributor in high <i>APOE</i> and high PRS groups (PAF: 11.35% [95% CI: 5.32–17.38%] and 11.24% [95% CI: 4.40–18.07%], respectively), followed by hypertension (PAF: 9.09% [95% CI: 2.01–16.17%] and 5.29% [95% CI: −2.72 to 13.29%], respectively). Overall, the total PAF decreased with increasing genetic risk, particularly for metabolic risk factors.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight the importance of personalized risk assessments and the development of tailored interventions based on genetic background to prevent dementia more effectively. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1210–1221</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The efficacy and safety of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) as an adjunct to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in large vessel occlusion strokes (LVOS) remain uncertain, with recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) yielding conflicting results. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of IAT following successful EVT in patients with LVOS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, <a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, the Cochrane Library databases, and the International Stroke Conference 2025 abstracts to identify RCTs evaluating IAT following successful EVT from January 2015 to February 2025. The primary outcome was the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–1 at 90 days). Secondary outcomes included 90-day functional independence (mRS = 0–2). Safety measures included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality at 90 days. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420250651602).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The primary pooled analysis of 6 RCTs (<i>N</i> = 1,974) showed that IAT significantly increased the likelihood of achieving excellent functional outcome at 90 days (mRS = 0–1: odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21–1.80, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with a notable effect in anterior circulation (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.18–1.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but not in posterior circulation LVOS (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.83–2.74, <i>p</i> = 0.18). Among thrombolytic drugs, alteplase was most strongly associated with favorable outcomes (mRS = 0–1: OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.31–2.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), followed by tenecteplase (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.08–1.89, <i>p</i> = 0.01). No significant safety concerns were observed, as there was no increase in the odds of sICH (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.75–1.75, <i>p</i> = 0.51) or 90-day mortality (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.79–1.26, <i>p</i> = 0.99). Sensitivity analyses for all outcomes yielded consistent results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IAT following successful EVT significantly enhances the likelihood of achieving an excellent functional outcome, particularly in anterior circulation strokes. Although the benefit in posterior circulation strokes remains uncertain, the lack of significant differences in sICH risk and mortality across thrombolytic drugs and stroke locations support the safety of IAT.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70025?af=R">Targeted Proteomics upon Treatment with Tofersen Identifies Novel Response Markers for Superoxide Dismutase 1‐Linked Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tofersen is the first effective and approved therapy for superoxide dismutase 1 (<i>SOD1</i>)-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS [SOD1-ALS]). Following treatment with tofersen, neurofilament levels in patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum seem to respond earlier than clinical parameters. This evidence prompted us to hypothesize that this novel treatment could provide an opportunity to identify additional biomarkers responsive to therapy in SOD1-ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated a panel of 120 neural, glial, and inflammatory markers in CSF and serum samples longitudinally collected from a total of 28 SOD1-ALS patients at baseline, and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment with tofersen, followed by validation with conventional methodology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a set of proteins, including neurofilament light chain, neurofilament heavy chain, amyloid-beta 1–40 and amyloid-beta 1–42, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), whose CSF levels both differed between SOD1-ALS and the control group, and were responsive to tofersen at 3 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Another group of markers, including the neuropentraxin (NPTX) family members NPTX1, NPTX2 and NPTXR, did not separate untreated SOD1-ALS from controls, but was responsive to tofersen. At 12 months on tofersen the levels of neurofilament light chain, neurofilament heavy chain, NPTX1, NPTX2, and NPTXR remained reduced compared with baseline, and correlated with the clinical response to tofersen. Consistent with increasing CSF pleocytosis and intrathecal immunoglobulin production, inflammatory markers were significantly increased after 12 months of treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results highlight a complex, time-dependent differential response of CSF biomarkers to tofersen treatment, and may pave the way for developing a panel of responsive proteins to make biomarker endpoints more robust in clinical trials for SOD1-ALS and beyond.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78070?af=R">Detecting Awareness in the Intensive Care Unit Using Functional Near‐Infrared Spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Signs of awareness after acute severe brain injury are critical for informing goals-of-care decisions, ranging from the continuation of aggressive life-sustaining therapy to comfort-focused end-of-life measures. However, awareness may go undetected in some critically ill patients when assessed using bedside behavioral neurological examination. Here, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify covert awareness in acute brain injured patients who are unable to follow behavioral commands.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a prospective, consecutive cross-sectional study of 32 critically ill patients in a single intensive care unit (ICU). All had acute brain injuries from various causes and lacked behavioral command-following on bedside examination, as determined by using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, an optical bedside neuroimaging technique, we assessed brain activity while patients were instructed to perform a mental imagery task in which a positive response was dependent upon preserved awareness. We referred to this phenomenon as covert awareness.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 32 acutely brain injured patients (mean age = 63, ± 12 years, 15 females), 8 (25%) were able to willfully modulate their brain activity when instructed to imagine playing a game of tennis—providing evidence of covert awareness despite no observable behavioral signs that this was the case. We found no association between covert awareness and 3-month functional outcomes using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy detected preserved consciousness in 25% of patients who lacked behavioral command following in an intensive care setting. This finding highlights the need for further research to assess the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques in the clinical assessment of critically ill patients. Such methods could ensure that goals of care decisions are based on a more accurate understanding of a patient's level of awareness. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1201–1209</p>

                Background The Ichu River serves as the primary water source for urban consumption, agricultural irrigation, and several local industrial operations in the Huancavelica region; however, increasing anthropogenic pressures including untreated municipal wastewater, mining effluents, agricultural runoff, and expanding urbanization have significantly deteriorated its water quality. These combined stressors highlight the need for an integrated assessment to understand the extent of contamination and associated human health risks. Methods The investigation measured water quality and health-related risks by analyzing physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and microbial pollutants at eight sampling points, site 1 (S1) through (S8). Results The research data showed that water quality worsened progressively from upstream to downstream locations such as turbidity, TDS, conductivity, and BOD levels increased. Oil pollution and oxygen depletion arose from a reduction in dissolved oxygen from 6.3 to 4.5 mg/L at the different sampling sites (S1 to S8). Heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in the samples exceeded the standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) established standards because of mining and industrial wastewater and local wastewater discharge. The presence of excessive Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliforms in microbial tests proved that the water was severely contaminated by fecal matter. Principal Component Analysis showed that heavy metals exist with microbial pollution and organic load as the main sources of water quality decline, and pollution indicators were found to establish powerful relationships with depleted oxygen levels. Conclusion The severe contamination risks found in this study justify immediate pollution control measures, wastewater treatment enforcement, and sustainable watershed management practices. Urgent action is necessary because vital parameters surpass the standards set by the WHO and (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to avoid enduring environmental damage and health problems. This research demonstrates the value of continuing water quality assessments while enforcing policies and raising public awareness to improve the water quality of the Ichu River.

                Background Sea cucumbers can be explored as alternative raw materials by the pharmaceutical and fishery industries as anticancer agents because they contain potential bioactive compounds. Methods This study aimed to determine the anticancer activity of Paracaudina australis extract against breast cancer cells (T47D) using an MTT assay. The secondary metabolites found in P.australis are steroids, terpenoids, saponins, and phenolics. The Thin-Layer Chromatography test results are indicated by Rf values, and steroid compounds in the ethyl acetate fraction are included in the standard Rf values. The isolates obtained were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, High-performance liquid chromatography, and UV-Visual spectrophotometry. Results The isolated compounds were Dihydrocholesterol and Cholestan-3-ol, with a molecular formula (C27H48O). The ion weight and molecular mass of the compound were m/z 388,7. Conclusions These compounds may be responsible for the anticancer activity of P.australis. The IC50 of Isolate F4 was 25,3 μg/ml, and IC50 of Isolate F7,8 was 13,76 μg/ml.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103817">PPARγ mediated enhanced lipid biogenesis fuels Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth in a drug-tolerant hepatocyte environment</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) infection of the lungs, besides producing prolonged cough with mucus, also causes progressive fatigue and cachexia with debilitating loss of muscle mass. While anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug therapy is directed toward eliminating bacilli, the treatment regimen ignores the systemic pathogenic derailments that probably dictate TB-associated mortality and morbidity. Presently, it is not understood whether Mtb spreads to metabolic organs and brings about these impairments. Here, we show that Mtb creates a replication-conducive milieu of lipid droplets in hepatocytes by upregulating transcription factor PPARγ and scavenging lipids from the host cells. In hepatocytes, Mtb shields itself against the common anti-TB drugs by inducing drug-metabolizing enzymes. Infection of the hepatocytes in the in vivo aerosol mice model can be consistently observed post-week, 4 along with enhanced expression of PPARγ and drug-metabolizing enzymes. Moreover, histopathological analysis indeed shows the presence of Mtb in hepatocytes along with granuloma-like structures in human biopsied liver sections. Hepatotropism of Mtb during the chronic infectious cycle results in immuno-metabolic dysregulation that could magnify local and systemic pathogenicity, altering clinical presentations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104242">Rapid rebalancing of co-tuned ensemble activity in the auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory information is represented by small varying neuronal ensembles in sensory cortices. In the auditory cortex (AC), repeated presentations of the same sound activate differing ensembles, indicating high trial-by-trial variability in activity even though the sounds activate the same percept. Efficient processing of complex acoustic signals requires that these sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles actively interact in order to provide a constant percept. Thus, the differing ensembles might interact to process the incoming sound inputs. Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation in awake mice to study how increased activity of single cells affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity when the frequency of the presented pure tone matched their tuning property, while non-co-tuned neurons were unaffected. Activity decrease was greater for non-stimulated co-tuned neurons with higher frequency selectivity. Co-tuned and non-co-tuned neurons were spatially intermingled. Our results show that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the larger network. The rebalanced network activity due to external stimulation remained constant. These effects suggest that co-tuned ensembles in AC interact and rapidly rebalance their activity to maintain encoding network dynamics, and that the rebalanced network is persistent.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93097">Theory of active self-organization of dense nematic structures in the actin cytoskeleton</a></h4>

              
                The actin cytoskeleton is remarkably adaptable and multifunctional. It often organizes into nematic bundles such as contractile rings or stress fibers. However, how a uniform and isotropic actin gel self-organizes into dense nematic bundles is not fully understood. Here, using an active gel model accounting for nematic order and density variations, we identify an active patterning mechanism leading to localized dense nematic structures. Linear stability analysis and nonlinear finite element simulations establish the conditions for nematic bundle self-assembly and how active gel parameters control the architecture, orientation, connectivity, and dynamics of self-organized patterns. Finally, we substantiate with discrete network simulations the main requirements for nematic bundle formation according to our theory, namely increased active tension perpendicular to the nematic direction and generalized active forces conjugate to nematic order. Our work portrays actin gels as reconfigurable active materials with a spontaneous tendency to develop patterns of dense nematic bundles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101140">Asynchronous mouse embryo polarization leads to heterogeneity in cell fate specification</a></h4>

              
                The first lineage allocation in mouse and human embryos separates the inner cell mass (ICM) from the outer trophectoderm (TE). This symmetry-breaking event is executed through polarization of cells at the 8 cell stage and subsequent asymmetric divisions, generating polar (TE) and apolar (ICM) cells. Here, we show that mouse embryo polarization is unexpectedly asynchronous. Cells polarizing at the early and late 8 cell stage have distinct molecular and morphological properties that direct their following lineage specification, with early polarizing cells being biased towards producing the TE lineage. More recent studies have also implicated heterogeneities between cells prior to the 8 cell stage in the first lineage allocation: cells exhibiting reduced methyltransferase CARM1 activity at the 4 cell stage are predisposed towards the TE fate. Here, we demonstrate that reduced CARM1 activity and upregulation of its substrate BAF155 promote early polarization and TE specification. These findings provide a link between asymmetries at the 4 cell stage and polarization at the 8 cell stage, mechanisms of the first lineage allocation that had been considered separate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97364">A modular platform to display multiple hemagglutinin subtypes on a single immunogen</a></h4>

              
                Next-generation influenza vaccines aim to elicit cross-reactive humoral responses to multiple influenza subtypes. Such increased breadth would not only improve seasonal vaccines but may afford ‘universal’ protection against influenza subtypes, including those with pandemic potential. Here, we describe a ‘beads-on-a-string (BOAS)’ immunogen that tandemly links up to eight distinct hemagglutinin (HA) head domains from circulating and non-circulating influenzas. These BOAS are immunogenic in the murine model and elicit comparable serum responses to each individual component. Notably, we also find that BOAS elicit cross-reactive responses to influenza subtypes not included in the immunizing immunogen. Furthermore, BOAS conjugation to protein-based ferritin nanoparticles does not significantly augment serum responses suggesting that our BOAS platform is sufficient for eliciting cross-reactive responses without off-target effects induced by the nanoparticle scaffold. Finally, vaccination with a mixture of the same HA head domains is not sufficient to elicit the same neutralization profile as the BOAS immunogens or nanoparticles. This mix-and-match immunogen design strategy is a robust platform for eliciting responses to multiple influenza subtypes via a single immunogen, and a potential platform for other viral glycoproteins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106397">Deep learning reveals endogenous sterols as allosteric modulators of the GPCR–Gα interface</a></h4>

              
                Endogenous intracellular allosteric modulators of GPCRs remain largely unexplored, with limited binding and phenotype data available. This gap arises from the lack of robust computational methods for unbiased cavity identification, cavity-specific ligand design, synthesis, and validation across GPCR topology. Here, we developed Gcoupler, an AI-driven generalized computational toolkit that leverages an integrative approach combining de novo ligand design, statistical methods, Graph Neural Networks, and bioactivity-based ligand prioritization for rationally predicting high-affinity ligands. Using Gcoupler, we interrogated intracellular metabolites that target and regulate the GPCR–Gα interface (Ste2p–Gpa1p), affecting pheromone-induced programmed cell death in yeast. Our computational analysis, complemented by experimental validations, including genetic screening, multi-omics, site-directed mutagenesis, biochemical assays, and physiological readouts, identified endogenous hydrophobic metabolites, notably sterols, as direct intracellular allosteric modulators of Ste2p. Molecular simulations coupled with biochemical signaling assessment in site-directed Ste2p mutants further confirmed that metabolites binding to GPCR–Gα obstruct downstream signaling, possibly via a cohesive effect. Finally, by utilizing isoproterenol-induced, GPCR-mediated human and neonatal rat cardiac hypertrophy models, we observed that elevated metabolite levels attenuate hypertrophic response, reinforcing the evolutionary relevance of this mechanism.

">Protective effect of prior knowledge in ageing</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception depends on both sensory input and prior knowledge, and the quality of these information sources changes across the lifespan. As people age, accumulated knowledge, and its influence on perception, tend to increase, while declines in low-level visual functions reduce input quality and bias perception toward prior information. Yet, the combined effects of these changes on higher-level visual perception remain unclear, partly because concurrent cognitive decline may complicate the use of stored knowledge. In this study, we examined how prior knowledge shapes visual perception in younger (<40 years) and older (>60 years) adults using ambiguous two-tone images, whose recognition depends on prior knowledge. Providing participants with the original photographs used to generate the two-tones triggered perceptual reorganisation, improving recognition in both groups. Although older adults recognised fewer two-tones overall - a pattern linked to reduced visual acuity - they showed a comparable benefit from prior knowledge when cued. These findings suggest that, despite age-related sensory decline, the ability to draw on prior knowledge remains robust in older adulthood and may help preserve perceptual function.

">Curvature-based machine learning method for automated segmentation of dendritic spines</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in connectomics have been led by high-resolution reconstruction of large volumes of neural tissues using electron microscopy (EM), providing unprecedented insights into brain structure and function. Dendritic spines--dynamic protrusions on neuronal dendrites--play crucial roles in synaptic plasticity, influencing learning, memory, and various neurological disorders. However, current spine analysis methods often rely on manual annotation of subcellular features, limiting their ability to handle the complexity of spines in dense dendritic networks. This paper introduces a novel automated computational framework that integrates discrete differential geometry, machine learning, and 3D image processing to analyze dendritic spines in these intricate environments. By generating distributions of spine morphology from high resolution images including many thousands of spines, our approach captures subtle variations in spine shapes, offering a nuanced understanding of their roles in synaptic function. This framework is tested on multiple EM datasets, with the aim of enhancing our understanding of synaptic plasticity and its alterations in disease states. The proposed method is poised to accelerate neuroscience research by providing a scalable, objective, and comprehensive solution for spine analysis, uncovering insights into the role of spine geometry for neural function.

">From Ions to Chaos: exploring a whole-brain modelling framework in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                Computational neuroscience offers powerful tools for understanding brain function in both healthy and diseased states. However, detailed data on microscale mechanisms - such as those involved in genetics and pharmacology - are often derived from mouse experiments and further lack integration into whole-brain models. In this work, we bridge microscale ion-channel dynamics and macroscale network behavior by employing the Larter-Breakspear neural mass model on The Virtual Brain platform with a mouse brain connectome. Our simulations reproduced key findings from prior computational studies with the Larter-Breakspear model, demonstrating its cross-species translation to the mouse. This included the emergence of chaotic dynamics and network synchrony as a function of coupling and delay parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Calcium, Sodium, and Potassiumrelated parameters each critically shape the global dynamic regimes and that the response to external stimuli is highly sensitive to calcium concentrations. This work represents the first integration of the Larter- Breakspear model into a mouse-scale connectome, validating previous results in a new context. In addition, it establishes a framework for a detailed exploration of synchrony, ion dependency, and stimulus reactivity. By linking molecular simulations, genetic data, and mouse electrophysiology, this approach holds promise for mechanistic insights into neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and epilepsy.

">Sleep disturbance is associated with increased repetitive sensorimotor behaviour in autism but not in learning/intellectual disabilities or ADHD: A comparative study</a></h4>

              
                The interplay of sleep and sensorimotor processing is a fundamental neurobiological process crucial for well-being. Individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions like autism, ADHD, and intellectual/learning disabilities frequently experience both significant sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours. Although a link between these domains is established, it is unclear whether this relationship and its functional impact are consistent across different neurodevelopmental conditions. In a cross-sectional dataset of individuals aged 5-21 (n = 212), we investigated whether the interplay between sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours differs between individuals diagnosed with autism (IQ>70), ADHD, a learning disability (IQ<70), as well as typically developed controls. We also examined whether interactions between sleep and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours predicts distinct functional outcomes between neurodevelopmental groups. We found that individuals with autism (IQ>70) were most strongly affected by both sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours. Crucially, we show that while a robust bidirectional link between sleep and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours exists across the entire sample, sleep problems amplify repetitive sensorimotor behaviours more strongly only in autistic people than in typical controls. Contrary to previous work, we found that learning disabled children and adolescents engaged in more repetitive sensorimotor behaviour but did not experience more sleep disturbance. Although the interaction between sleep problems and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours did not determine functional outcomes in autistic people, the interplay of sleep problems and repetitive sensorimotor behaviour impaired social awareness in people with ADHD. These findings challenge a transdiagnostic view that treats the reinforcement between sleep and sensorimotor problems as a general marker of neurodevelopmental conditions. Understanding the distinct pathways between sleep and waking behaviours is a critical step toward developing personalized, mechanistic interventions targeting specific sleep and sensory impairment profiles in different neurodevelopmental conditions.

">Brain-immune interactions generate pathogen-specific sickness states</a></h4>

              
                In nature, animals encounter diverse pathogens that trigger specific peripheral defense programs and elicit sickness behavior, a set of stereotyped physiological and behavioral changes thought to promote host fitness. Most studies to date have relied on one or a few mouse models of infection, limiting insights into pathogen-specific neuroimmune interactions that generate sickness. We hypothesized that different pathogens might elicit distinct sickness states by engaging different cell types and brain circuits. Using inflammatory models representing bacterial, viral, allergic, parasitic or colitis conditions, we assessed sickness across scales: organismal (behavior and physiology); cellular (brain-wide neural activity); and molecular (single-cell in situ transcriptomics in hypothalamus areas associated with social and homeostatic functions affected during sickness). Remarkably, immune challenges elicited unique repertoires of changes across all scales. Our findings reveal pathogen-specific sickness states encoded by the brain across scales, thereby broadening our understanding of how infections make us sick.

">Detection and quantification of planar traveling waves in the EEG using spherical phase fitting</a></h4>

              
                Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the spatiotemporal dynamics of oscillatory brain activity. Recordings at various scales have shown oscillations propagating as waves over cortical space, both at small and large scales. The most common waves observed in the EEG are planar waves, formed by a synchronized wavefront propagating in a consistent direction (e.g., posterior-anterior). These waves have been linked to diverse perceptual and cognitive measures. However, their quantification has faced issues due to the inherently noisy EEG signal and its ambiguous spatial localization. Existing methods employ restrictive windows of analysis (e.g., lines of electrodes) or rely on wave motifs extracted from the data. A specific algorithm for detecting planar waves is still lacking. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis pipeline for this purpose, comprising three steps: first, genuine oscillatory activity is extracted from the EEG as clusters. The spatial phase gradient is then fit using a spherical wave model. Finally, stable waves are extracted from the time series of fits. We validate our method using simulations over a physiological range of parameters. Using a forward model, we test EEG wave detection for propagation along different pathways at the source level. Lastly, we apply our analysis to real EEG recordings, targeting alpha oscillations during visual stimulation and at rest. In summary, our method provides a reliable algorithm for detecting planar waves in the EEG. Given the emerging functional roles of traveling waves in perception and cognition, this could potentially be utilized in a wide range of future studies.

">Coordination of spike timing among the neurons of the cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                We tend to think of neurons as either excitatory or inhibitory, but certain neurons chemically inhibit their downstream targets while electrically exciting their neighbors. For example, in the cerebellum, molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) inhibit Purkinje cells (P-cells) via release of GABA but promote spiking in each other via gap junctions. What is gained by having an inhibitory neuron excite its neighbor? Here, we recorded activities of P-cells and MLIs as marmosets performed saccadic eye movements and found that spike timing in pairs of neighboring neurons of the same type exhibited a mathematical regularity: as firing rates increased, rate of spikes that were within 1ms of each other grew disproportionately while 2-4ms intervals were suppressed. To uncover the purpose of this coordination, during saccades we recorded thousands of neuron triplets in which two MLIs converged onto a single target P-cell. When the MLIs spiked within 1ms of each other, they produced superposition of their individual effects on their target; a deep inhibition followed by a post-inhibitory rebound. However, when the MLIs spiked 2-4ms apart, the two spikes interfered with each other, producing partial cancellation. Thus, electrical coupling between inhibitory neurons orchestrated their spike timing so that as firing rates increased, the temporal intervals that induced downstream superposition were promoted while the intervals that caused interference were suppressed.

">Effects of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis on Bladder Function and Properties of Pelvic Ganglion Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) has substantial impacts on autonomic function. In part, MS results in loss of normal autonomic activity that contributes to disease-associated pathology such as neurogenic bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. Yet little is known of the impacts of MS on peripheral autonomic neurons that directly innervate these target organs. In this study, we measured changes in properties of neurons of the mouse major pelvic ganglion (MPG) associated with two different levels of severity in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Our data show that bladder function and physiological properties of MPG neurons are altered in association with EAE, and differ between less and more severe clinical scores associated with disease progression. EAE results in decreased bladder function measured by decreased urine output and increased micturition pressures. In the most severely affected animals, action potentials (APs) show increased half-widths as a result of decreased maximum decay slopes leading to overall broader and longer APs and lower maximum firing frequency. These changes in AP properties are associated with differences in ion channel subunit expression as well. KCNA1-4, KCNN3, SCN2A1 and SCN3A mRNA levels in MPGs decreased with disease severity. Taken together, our data indicate that peripheral autonomic neurons are fundamentally altered in EAE, suggesting that longer-term therapeutic approaches for MS could target these neurons directly to potentially help ameliorate neurogenic target organ dysfunction.

">Convergent pathways with impaired inhibition at the frontal cortex are the outcome of differential alterations in the male and female schizophrenia model</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is associated with impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and disrupted synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), yet the biological mechanisms underlying these deficits may differ between sexes. Here, we used a double-hit rat model, combining perinatal NMDA receptor blockade and post-weaning social isolation, to dissect sex-specific alterations in inhibitory circuit maturation, synaptic plasticity, and prefrontal function. Male double-hit rats exhibited robust schizophrenia-like behaviors, reduced parvalbumin (PV), OTX2, and perineuronal net (PNN) expression, decreased GAD67 levels, and increased DNA damage in PV interneurons, together indicating impaired inhibitory maturation and weakened plasticity. In contrast, females showed milder behavioral deficits but displayed increased PV and OTX2 intensities, enhanced cFos activation in excitatory neurons, and transcriptomic upregulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and synapse assembly pathways, suggesting a state of heightened or dysregulated plasticity. Despite these divergent molecular trajectories, in vivo electrophysiology revealed a shared functional endpoint in both sexes: a shift from paired-pulse inhibition to facilitation during basolateral amygdala-evoked responses, reflecting impaired GABAB-mediated inhibitory feedback. Pharmacological blockade of GABAB, but not GABAA, receptors reproduced this phenotype, identifying GABAB signaling as a key mechanism underlying cortical disinhibition. Altogether, our findings reveal that males and females reach convergent prefrontal inhibitory deficits through sex-specific molecular pathways, underscoring the importance of sex as a biological variable in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia.

">Characterising longitudinal dynamics of infant neurodevelopment using functional change point detection</a></h4>

              
                Habituation is an early-developing cognitive process linked to early learning whereby irrelevant stimuli are filtered out; it can be assessed using neuroimaging tools, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, conventional fNIRS analysis approaches typically assume linear time invariance and analyse summary statistics of the data, potentially limiting insight into the nature of the changing evoked haemodynamic response. Functional data analysis (FDA) is a branch of statistics which treats entire mathematical functions as the unit of analysis rather than discrete points; within this framework, functional change point (FCPt) detection can identify significant changes in data structure, such as the mean haemodynamic response function. Using infant fNIRS data from a rural Gambian population (n= 204) recorded using a habituation and novelty detection paradigm, the use of functional change point detection with wild binary segmentation was implemented to identify structural changes in the evoked haemodynamic response. Group-level analysis from participants assessed at 5-, 8- and 12mo of age identified structural change corresponding to the evoked haemodynamic response in locations consistent with previous analyses. Further analyses indicated consistent habituation at 8- and 12mo and an age-related shift in the timing of decreasing haemodynamic responses, suggesting older infants in the first year of life habituate more rapidly to auditory stimuli. These results provide novel evidence to support the use of FDA and FCPt detection in the fNIRS field more widely, as well as improving understanding of the development of habituation during early infancy.

">Striatal ensembles specify and control granular forelimb actions</a></h4>

              
                The ability of the brain to control specific fine actions is crucial for survival. The striatum is a critical brain center for both movement and learning, and its dysfunction underlies numerous movement disorders. Whereas activity in the striatum has been classically viewed as invigorating and reinforcing movements, recent studies suggest that striatal activity encodes specific movements. However, it is not known how granular this activity is, and if it indeed controls specific ongoing movements. We designed a task where mice performed two minimally-different forelimb actions, consisting of a push or pull isometric force on an immobile joystick, and imaged the activity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsolateral striatum using 2-photon microscopy. We observed that striatal activity encoded both the preparation and execution of specific actions, even when those actions were not reinforced. Furthermore, both populations of D1 and D2-MSNs - classically viewed as promoting versus inhibiting movement - equally encoded action identity. We developed a closed-loop system to model and stimulate action-specific neural ensembles deep in the brain, using holographic optogenetics through a GRIN lens. Stimulation of action-specific ensembles of both D1- and D2-MSNs increased the force of ongoing actions, but only when the ensemble stimulated was congruent with the ongoing action. These results reveal that specific ensembles of both D1- and D2-MSNs causally control specific ongoing actions, as granular as different muscle co-contractions of the same forelimb. Such granularity provides a mechanistic framework for understanding how striatal dysfunction can produce highly specific movement impairments in Huntington's disease and dystonia.

">Distinct cellular and transcriptional mechanisms mediate an antioxidant therapeutic response in 22q11-deleted upper layer cortical projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                We characterized cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic response in vitro and in vivo to the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), which in the LgDel 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome mouse model restores growth and connectivity of upper layer cortical projection neurons (Layer 2/3 PNs) and improves cognitive performance. NAC treatment of primary cultured LgDel L 2/3 PNs does not restore these neurons to a wild type (WT) state. Rather than returning to the bimodal dendrite and axon size distribution seen in WT, LgDel L 2/3 PN dendrite and axon growth in vitro increases unimodally in response to NAC. In parallel, altered expression of 22q11-deleted genes and presumed downstream targets are unchanged. Instead, novel antioxidant defense and neuronal growth genes are differentially expressed: some generally NAC-regulated, others responsive only in the context of 22q11 deletion. Apparently, NAC ameliorates L 2/3 PN developmental pathology without restoring WT cell states or typical expression of mutant genes or their downstream targets. NAC also elicits differential expression of antioxidant defense genes in 22q11-deleted L 2/3 PN - but not L 5/6 counterparts - in the developing postnatal LgDel mouse cortex, rather than modulating 22q11 genes or downstream targets. These NAC-dependent, L 2/3 PN-selective in vivo cellular and transcriptional changes differ substantially from those in primary culture. Thus, despite some in vitro and in vivo parallels, the NAC therapeutic response that diminishes oxidative stress-related L 2/3 PN circuit and behavioral pathology due to 22q11 deletion has a unique in vivo signature.

">Genetic Background and Sex Modulate Androgen Responses in Human Brain Microphysiological System</a></h4>

              
                Sex steroids shape human brain development, yet the cellular and molecular consequences of androgen addition need further exploration. Here, we used a human neural organoid model - brain microphysiological system (bMPS), derived from nine induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines to model the impact of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent non-aromatizable androgen. All lines differentiated reproducibly into electrically active, neuron-glia-oligodendrocyte organoids expressing robust androgen-signaling components. DHT was bioavailable, elicited nuclear androgen receptor (AR) translocation and increased organoid size in most cell lines, consistent with androgen-responsive mTOR and metabolic pathway activation. Bulk RNA-seq across nine lines revealed that transcriptional responses varied across donor backgrounds, but DHT-responsive genes converged on mitochondrial energetics, lysosomal function, glycoprotein processing, apoptosis, and mTOR signaling. Cell-type expression profiling showed an androgen-driven shift primarily in male lines toward astrocytic profiles with reductions in oligodendrocyte, oligodendrocyte progenitor (OPC), excitatory, and inhibitory neuronal signatures, supported by immunohistochemistry and AR enrichment in astrocytes and OPCs. DHT also altered neurodevelopmental pathways, increasing variation in synaptic pruning and decreasing variation in neuronal migration, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis and seizure status of donors moderating these effects more strongly than sex. Baseline transcriptional differences distinguished iPSC lines which responded more strongly to DHT from weak responders: responders displayed enhanced synaptic maturity and reduced ECM gene expression. Using isogenic XX/XY lines, we found that differences in sex-chromosome expression exceeded DHT-induced changes and that DHT decreased expression of inhibitory neuron genes in males and increased it in females. Finally, DHT induced extensive DNA methylation changes, targeting HOX genes, patterning, and synaptic genes. Collectively, these findings reveal that androgen signaling shapes transcription, cell populations, and epigenetic landscapes in a genetic background-dependent manner. This work contributes to understanding how androgens influence human brain development and highlights how in vitro models can contribute to representing inter-individual variability in neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Brain-AI Alignment in Naturalistic Movies</a></h4>

              
                Naturalistic paradigms offer a powerful window into human cognition, but it remains difficult to link rich, continuous movie content to distributed brain activity in an interpretable way. In this study, I use a multimodal large language model (Gemini) as an automated "semantic annotator" to bridge naturalistic movie stimuli, brain responses, and cognitive performance. Using the Human Connectome Project movie-watching dataset, I segmented the film into 293 overlapping clips, prompted Gemini to rate each clip on 11 psychologically interpretable dimensions, and simultaneously extracted clip-wise BOLD activation patterns from the fMRI images in 360 cortical parcels. In this way, the AI and the brain effectively "watch" the same movies in parallel. For each parcel, I then fit linear regression models to predict clip-to-clip variation in movie-evoked responses from these features. Gemini-derived features robustly predicted movie-evoked responses in temporal, medial parietal, and lateral frontal association cortex, but explained little variance in unimodal somatosensory, dorsal parietal, insular, and piriform regions. Feature-weight maps recapitulated known functional specializations, and features with the largest global influence overlapped with the most explainable parcels. Partial least squares analysis revealed that individual differences in resting-state connectivity strength and semantic explainability covaried along an asymmetric intrinsic axis: strongly integrated sensory-opercular systems at rest were associated with poorer AI predictability, whereas a smaller set of dorsal and medial association regions showed enhanced alignment. Finally, regional AI explainability in medial parietal and left perisylvian association areas was positively related to fluid and crystallized cognitive abilities. Together, these findings demonstrate that prompt-defined, interpretable features from foundation models provide a simple and scalable framework for quantifying brain-AI alignment in naturalistic settings, offering a practical bridge between biological and artificial semantic representations.

">Visual Semantic Encoding and Identification of Naturalistic Movies via High-Density Diffuse Optical Tomography</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain represents meaning in real-world contexts is essential for both fundamental neuroscience and clinical applications. Brain encoding and decoding models from naturalistic stimuli provide a powerful window into semantic representations. Yet, existing approaches rely on a constrained scanning environment, or on conventional fNIRS, which has been limited to sparse sampling and/or block-design paradigms. Here, we tested whether high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), an advanced high-density tomographic optical imaging method, can support semantic encoding and decoding using naturalistic movies. We collected 3.5 hours of naturalistic movie viewing data from six participants using stimuli labeled with 1,708 categories. Encoding models robustly predicted voxel-level responses, yielding single semantic category maps consistent with prior fMRI studies. In complementary decoding analyses, we showed that DOT responses captured sufficient semantic content to identify which clips participants viewed. To assess organization across individuals, we identified a shared low-dimensional semantic space that captures common semantic dimensions. Finally, clustering analyses revealed interpretable higher-order semantic dimensions like social and animate agents, objects vs natural organisms, and textural scenes, consistently mapped across the cortex. These findings demonstrate that DOT can recover distributed, high-dimensional semantic representations from naturalistic movies, bridging fMRI-level semantic mapping with the accessibility of optical imaging.

">Region-specific associations between cerebral arterial elasticity and grey matter volume: Evidence for lateral prefrontal vulnerability</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ageing is associated with increased cardiovascular health risks and disproportionate atrophy in frontotemporal brain. Regional cerebral arterial elasticity correlates with regional grey matter volume, with stronger associations frontally and in older adults. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is linked to preserved brain structure and greater arterial elasticity, while sex differences exist in the timing of vascular versus structural changes. This study examines whether regional cerebral arterial elasticity in frontotemporal cortex mediates the association between age and corresponding grey matter volume decline, and whether sex and/or CRF moderate this relationship. Methods: We analysed data from 162 healthy adults (60-70 years) with structural MRI and diffuse optical tomography of the cerebral arterial pulse (Pulse-DOT) from the ACTIVate cohort. CRF was estimated from demographic and physiological measures. Pulse Relaxation Function (PReFx), an optical index of regional arterial elasticity, was measured across 28 frontal, temporal, and parietal regions of interest (ROI). Grey matter (GM) volume was quantified for corresponding ROIs. Mediation and moderated mediation models tested whether PReFx mediated the relationship between age and GM volume at bilateral frontal and temporal ROIs, and whether biological sex or CRF moderated this relationship. Results: Regional bivariate correlations identified associations between age, PReFx and GM volume across multiple ROIs, which PReFx and GM volume being associated primarily in left frontal and temporal areas. PReFx partially mediated the effect of age on GM volume in a left mid-inferior frontal ROI, accounting for approximately 16% of the total age effect and this relationship was only evident in females. Although higher CRF was associated with greater PReFx, it did not moderate the relationship between age, PReFx and GM volume. Conclusions: Consistent with cascade models of neurovascular aging, cerebral arterial stiffening was found to partially explain the effect of increasing age on frontal GM volume, even in this highly age-restricted and high functioning cohort. This effect was only significant over the left prefrontal cortex, consistent with greater vulnerability of frontal brain and associated cognitive functions. It was also exclusively present in females, who had better cardiovascular health, larger grey matter volume and greater arterial elasticity than males. These findings are consistent with pulse-DOT measures of cerebral arterial elasticity being more sensitive to subclinical brain structural variability.

This study used functional MRS (fMRS) to investigate whether socially-laden stimuli modulate excitatory or inhibitory neurometabolites, and whether modulation relates to social function. Forty neurotypical adults (18-40 years; 20 male) underwent 3T MRI, with fMRS data acquired using a J-difference edited MRS sequence. GABA+macromolecules (GABA+) and glutamate+glutamine (Glx) were quantified in a right social brain region (superior temporal/temporoparietal junction [STG/TPJ]) and a control region (occipital cortex). Participants viewed a fixation cross (rest; 5 min), silent video clips of social interaction, and a flashing checkerboard as control stimulus (5 min each; counterbalanced). The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) assessed social function. There were no significant differences between resting and functional (social or checkerboard) GABA+ or Glx levels (ps<.05), although Bayesian analyses showed evidence for decreased STG/TPJ GABA+ and increased occipital cortex Glx for checkerboard compared to rest. Higher SRS-2 scores were associated with higher resting STG/TPJ Glx but not GABA+, and functional metabolite levels were not associated with SRS-2 scores (ps>.1). Sliding time window analyses suggest reduced Glx in social brain during social and visual stimulation. Despite sound data collection and analysis techniques, shifts in Glx and GABA+ following social stimuli were minimal. Future research could utilise more challenging social stimuli and examine alternate social brain regions.

">Transcranial focused ultrasound induces source localizable cortical activation in resting state humans when applied concurrently with transcranial electric stimulation</a></h4>

              
                The effects of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) on the human brain are poorly understood. Currently, the field is at odds with whether tFUS is subthreshold modulating the brain's excitability towards other stimuli, producing suprathreshold neural stimulation on its own, or if it even has a spatially specific non-auditory induced affect. Herein, we investigated the ability of tFUS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and a novel combination of the two (transcranial electro-acoustic stimulation; tEAS) to evoke cortical target-location specific activity in 27 resting state humans with whole brain electroencephalography recordings. In none of the exogenous event related potentials did tFUS or tDCS result in location-specific activations. However, the co-modulatory combination of tEAS did, providing evidence that tFUS has a location-specific subthreshold modulatory effect. We propose a minimally modified Hodgkin Huxley model that explains our results and provides a unifying framework for the field-wide observed effects (or lack thereof) of tFUS.

">Cognitive effects of placebo antipsychotics: Investigating their mechanisms using event-related potentials (ERPs) in a cognitive test and a self-referential task</a></h4>

              
                Placebos modulate neurocognitive processes. We examined whether a fully deceptive antipsychotic-placebo changes cognition not only by enhancing arousal and attention but also by changing self-representations, namely, by adding that of being under a treatment related to psychosis and by weakening the binding of experience to reality. Drug-naive healthy participants (N = 83) were split into a group (N = 40) who took a pill described as an antipsychotic and a no- pill control group (N = 43). Participants performed a cognitive test (CogTest), that is, a semantic categorization task and a self-referential role judgment task (SRT). Behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. In the CogTest, placebos showed faster response times and higher accuracy than no-pills. This cognitive improvement was associated with more negative occipito-temporal early ERPs (OTEEs), larger central P2s (CentP2s), and larger late positive potentials (LPPs), with the latter correlating with response times. As in the literature, CentP2s were maximal in the SRT, possibly because it maximally stimulates the binding of the stimulus to long-term self-representations. The larger CentP2s and LPPs for placebos than for no-pills in the CogTest were thus tentatively related to the binding of the stimulus with egocentric self-representations, temporarily enriched by the addition of the representation of being on drug. On the contrary, the more negative OTEEs were related to a weaker binding to allocentric ones, preventing a strong binding of experience with reality. The smaller N400s observed for placebos than for no-pills in both tasks were related to greater openness to new experiences.

">Crossmodal attention develops in the first year of life: Cortical signatures of tactile to visual exogenous spatial cuing at 8 but not 5 months of age</a></h4>

              
                Adults are able to orient their attention between different (often fleeting) sensory cues that present to different senses ("crossmodal attention"), but we cannot assume that this is the case in early life. Here we report the findings of a study in which we probed the presence of tactile to visual crossmodal links in spatial attention using event related potentials (ERP) gathered from the scalp electroencephalograms (EEG) of 5- (n = 19) and 8-month-old (n = 19) infants. Whilst recording EEG, we presented 5- and 8-month-old participants with vibrotactile stimuli on one of their hands, followed by visual stimuli on the same (Congruent) or the opposite (Incongruent) hand, or no touch at all (No probe). During the presentation of these stimuli the infants' eyes were oriented centrally. We subtracted No probe trials from Congruent and Incongruent trials to yield visual evoked potentials (VEPs) free from the influence of prior somatosensory processing. Comparably to prior findings in adults, 8-month-olds' first negative component of the VEP was enhanced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the probe when the visual probe was spatially congruent with the tactile cue. No crossmodal effect was observed in the 5-month-olds, indicating developments in the crossmodal coordination of attention in the first year of life.

">Causal inference and functional dynamics of a visuomotor network demonstrate excitatory/inhibitory alterations in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Balanced excitation and inhibition are fundamental for stable brain dynamics. In multiple sclerosis (MS), this balance is thought to be altered, yet its impact on the visuomotor network function and disease progression remains unclear. This study uses information from Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and The Virtual Brain (TVB) alongside clinical measures to provide a causal and network-level perspective on MS pathophysiology. We defined a visuomotor network based on previous work, including bilateral primary visual cortex (V1), left primary motor cortex (M1), left supplementary motor and premotor cortex (SMAPMC), left cingulate cortex (CC), left superior parietal lobule (SPL), and right cerebellar lobule VI (CR). We analysed data from 9 healthy volunteers (HV) and 17 people with MS (pwMS) who underwent multimodal MRI including a visually-guided variable grip-force event-related task and resting-state functional MRI, as well as diffusion-weighted imaging. Our DCM analysis indicated that the best-fitting model was the same for both groups, suggesting preserved visuomotor network architecture. However, pwMS showed altered effective connectivity during task (from SPL to M1: excitatory in HV, inhibitory in pwMS) and rest (from V1 to M1: excitatory in HV, inhibitory in pwMS; from SPL to M1, from M1 to SMAPMC, and from CR to V1: inhibitory in HV, excitatory in pwMS). During task execution, grip-force modulations revealed altered feedback connectivity patterns in pwMS as motor demand increased, indicating a shift from the positive coupling seen in HV to negative coupling across most connections. Effective connectivity alterations in task and resting-state fMRI were associated with clinical measures, including disability and motor reaction time. Connectivity changes involved visuomotor and cerebellar circuits and differed between task execution and rest, indicating context-specific network dynamics. Network-level simulations further linked reduced excitatory gain to slower responses, showing the role of excitation/inhibition balance in performing a visuomotor task. Together, these findings identify excitatory and inhibitory alterations as key mechanisms of network functional disruption in MS and demonstrate the potential of multiscale modelling to bridge neurophysiological alterations with clinical performance.

">Dual role of Spreading Depolarization in the epileptic focus</a></h4>

              
                Spreading Depolarizations (SDs) are often associated with epileptic discharges. While SDs are traditionally thought contributing to the postictal depression and termination of epileptic discharges, seizures may also occur during SDs or may even follow SDs suggesting that interactions between SD and seizures are more complex. Here, we examined the interactions between SD and epileptic activity by spatially separating the epileptic focus and the site of SD initiation. Epileptic focus was induced by local intracortical injection of the potassium channel blocker 4-AP combined with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine, whereas extrinsic SDs were evoked by distal high potassium application. We found that extrinsic SDs promoted seizure-like events (SLEs) when the SD wave approached the epileptic focus, followed by suppression of epileptic activity when SD spread through the focus. The timing of SLE relatively SD varied at different recordings sites, with SLEs occurring before, during or after SD arrival depending on electrode position along the trajectory of SD propagation between the SD initiation site and the epileptic focus. During intracortical recordings, the proconvulsive effects of SD were associated with a wave of pre-SD neuronal excitation reaching the epileptic focus. The epileptic focus per se also demonstrated a resistance to the SD invasion. Thus, the interactions between SD and epileptic focus are not limited to postictal depression, and SDs may also promote epileptic activity in the hyperexcitable cortex.

">A multivariate pattern metric of individualized hemispheric functional asymmetry</a></h4>

              
                Functional asymmetry is a fundamental feature of human brain organization, yet existing measures of functional connectivity asymmetry rely mainly on univariate indices that miss distributed pattern structure. We introduce the Pattern Dissimilarity of Hemispheric Functional Connectivity (PDHC), a multivariate metric that quantifies the pattern-level distance between each individual's left- and right-hemisphere connectivity architecture. In over one thousand adults, PDHC showed high test-retest reliability, cross-atlas robustness, and strong individual specificity. Network analyses indicated that hemispheric similarity is anchored in conserved sensorimotor and subcortical systems, whereas higher-order networks drive divergence. Developmental data from infancy through early adulthood revealed a characteristic trajectory: dissimilarity declines sharply early in life and increases modestly thereafter. Twin and Turner syndrome samples further demonstrated moderate heritability and sensitivity to X-chromosome dosage. PDHC thus provides a reliable and individualized metric of hemispheric functional architecture, offering a scalable tool for probing lateralization across development, genetics, cognition, and clinical conditions.

">Microbiome-behavior coupling shapes infant adaptation to early maternal unpredictability</a></h4>

              
                We asked whether infant microbiome composition, together with infants' behavioral responses to early maternal unpredictability, can offer novel mechanistic insights into behavioral phenotypic variation in human development. Maternal unpredictability was computed as the entropy rate of transitions among maternal sensory signals during naturalistic mother-infant interaction (n=256 dyads; 2-6 months). Infant visual orienting behavior (VOB) was indexed by infants' simultaneous gaze shifts to and from the mother. Higher maternal unpredictability predicted more frequent VOB shifts, indicating a mature-for-age profile, and longitudinally forecast poorer inhibitory control at 19-28 months. A subgroup of infants with high maternal unpredictability and high VOB had inhibitory control outcomes closer to those of infants who experienced low maternal unpredictability, suggesting VOB strategy might buffer against the effects of high maternal unpredictability. In participants with metagenomic data (n=93), VOB was associated with taxonomic and functional gut microbial profiles along a Bifidobacterium breve to Bifidobacterium longum axis. Neuroactive gene-set enrichment analysis linked VOB to increase in tryptophan synthesis and glutamate synthesis genes. In contrast, maternal unpredictability showed depletions of GABA and tryptophan synthesis in the unique-effects model and, when VOB and the maternal unpredictability by VOB term were included, enrichment of acetate synthesis and quinolinic acid degradation. Notably, the maternal unpredictability by VOB interactions for tryptophan and glutamate were negative, indicating that the VOB-pathway coupling attenuates as unpredictability increases. Together, these findings support a framework in which maternal unpredictability is the environmental challenge, infant VOB expresses the behavioral strategy, and microbial metabolism modulates whether that strategy is biochemically feasible.

">From Skin to Cortex: End-to-End Spiking Neural Network Simulation of Tactile Information Flow</a></h4>

              
                Autonomous systems and neuroprosthetic devices demand real-time tactile processing under strict energy and latency constraints. Designing these systems using neuromorphic principles, where communication is event-based and node activity is sparse, could improve their speed and energy efficiency. Here we present an end-to-end spiking neural network model of the ascending tactile pathway, from mechanoreceptors in the skin in humans (or whisker follicles in rodents) to cortical neurons, that operates in an event-driven neuromorphic fashion. The model comprises distinct anatomical stages: three types of mechanoreceptor afferents, the trigeminal ganglion, the brainstem, the thalamic nucleus, and three cortical layers, connected in a feed-forward hierarchy. We demonstrate the model responses to both rodent whisker deflection and human fingertip skin displacement, using information-theoretic analysis, pairwise correlation, and stimulus decoding at each layer. Our results show that tactile information is efficiently encoded and transformed at each stage: stimulus features are represented with high fidelity and reduced redundancy as signals ascend. Notably, simple linear or Bayesian decoders can reliably classify stimulus features from single-neuron activity in the thalamus and cortex for low-noise inputs, highlighting the emergence of robust neural representations. This open-source model is the first to include the mechanosensory periphery in a full tactile pathway simulation, enabling researchers to study how perturbations at any stage affect tactile encoding. Moreover, the network is well-suited for deployment on low-power, real-time neuromorphic hardware, facilitating the development of multi-layer signal processing and tactile navigation algorithms.

">Inner-ear delivery of AAV2-retro robustly labels lateral olivocochlear efferents but results in off-target transfection in the contralateral cochlea and the brain</a></h4>

              
                Gene delivery via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) is a valuable tool for understanding the organization and function of auditory neuronal circuitry. In this study, we explored the use of AAVs injected into the inner ear to transfect the lateral olivocochlear (LOC) pathway, a poorly understood ipsilateral component of the auditory efferent feedback system. AAV serotypes exhibit a wide range of properties, including cell type selectivity and the capacity for retrograde transport, but none of the AAV serotypes used for inner ear delivery have been reported to successfully transfect the LOC pathway. Here, we show that unilateral inner ear delivery of AAV2-retro robustly labeled the LOC pathway. However, the ability of AAV2-retro to diffuse via the cochlear aqueduct from the perilymph into the cerebrospinal fluid resulted in off-target transfection in the brain and the labeling of LOC projections in the contralateral cochlea. The extent of contralateral transfection of LOC neurons depended on the age of the animal and the amount of virus delivered to the inner ear. These findings highlight the importance of considering the dosage and properties of AAV serotype when interpreting experimental results.

">S100A8/A9 Inhibition Reduces Splenic Myelopoiesis and Improves Outcomes After Stroke</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundNeutrophils are among the earliest immune cells to infiltrate the ischemic brain and contribute to secondary neuronal damage. The alarmin S100 calcium-binding protein A8/A9 (S100A8/A9), predominantly released by neutrophils, is upregulated during this process. Although the bone marrow is recognised as the principal site of neutrophil production via myelopoiesis, the role of the spleen as an immune-responsive organ remains incompletely understood.

MethodsIn this study, we employed a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in male C57Bl/6 mice and examined immune responses 24 hours post-stroke in the blood, bone marrow and spleen using flow cytometry. To understand the role of S100A8/A9 in modulating stroke-induced myelopoiesis, we administered a small molecule inhibitor of S100A8/A9, ABR-215757, before and after stroke.

ResultsNeutrophils and S100A8/A9 were found in the infarcted brain tissue. Interestingly, we observed a marked increase in splenic neutrophils, accompanied by an expansion of myeloid progenitors, indicating activation of extramedullary myelopoiesis. Given our previous work showing that S100A8/A9 promotes myelopoiesis, we pharmacologically inhibited S100A8/A9 to determine if this would modulate stroke-induced myelopoiesis. Treatment with ABR-215757 at 24 hours post-stroke led to reduced splenic myelopoiesis, reversed neutrophilia, enhanced forelimb grip strength, and a one-third reduction in infarct size.

ConclusionThese findings identify the spleen as a key contributor to neutrophil production following stroke and suggest that targeting S100A8/A9 may attenuate post-stroke inflammation and improve neurological recovery.

<p>I outline my personal journey in hippocampal research from joining the O'Keefe lab in 1991 to the present, with a focus on earlier experimental and computational investigations of spatial cognition and neural representations in rodents, with some reference to extensions to humans and to other aspects of cognition. These recollections are organized around place cells and the role of theta rhythmicity, the importance of environmental boundaries, the operation of a wider system for spatial memory and imagery, grid cells, and the neural mechanisms of navigation in humans. I conclude with some reflections on the collaborative and exciting ecosystem that supported all of these endeavors.</p>

                Microglia are the brain's primary innate immune cells, which maintain neural homeostasis through surveillance, debris clearance, and synaptic remodeling. Dark microglia represent a distinct state of microglia that came into recent focus due to their excessive physical contact with synapses in contexts of pathological synapse loss, predominantly in neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. Dark microglia are identified by their unique ultrastructural features, exhibiting a dark, condensed appearance under electron microscopy. They display signs of cellular stress and appear to be engaged in synaptic pruning. Here, we review recent advances in understanding these intriguing cells in the mammalian brain, from new molecular insights into their origin to their emerging functional roles across the lifespan, in both health and disease.

">Serotonin Engages Divergent 5-HT Receptor Pathways for Cell Type-Resolved Modulation of Prefrontal Layer 5 Microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Background and Purpose: Serotonin (5-HT) is a key neuromodulator in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), yet its cell type-specific effects across excitatory and inhibitory microcircuits remain incompletely understood. We aimed to determine how 5-HT shapes intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission in defined neuronal populations of the medial PFC (mPFC). Experimental Approach: We performed whole-cell recordings from morphologically and electrophysiologically characterised layer 5 (L5) neurons in rat mPFC. Pyramidal neurons were classified into adaptive-spiking high input resistance (ASH), adaptive-spiking low input resistance (ASL), and regular-spiking (RS) types; interneurons were categorised as non-fast-spiking (nFS), regular-fast-spiking (rFS), and stuttering-fast-spiking (sFS) interneurons. These cell types exhibited distinct membrane properties, firing patterns, and axonal projections. We assessed serotonergic modulation using bath-applied 5-HT and subtype-specific receptor mechanisms. Key Results: 5-HT produced divergent postsynaptic responses across pyramidal neuron subtypes: ASH and RS neurons depolarised via 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) activation, whereas ASL neurons exhibited 5-HT1AR-mediated hyperpolarisation. Among interneurons, rFS and sFS cells depolarised through ionotropic 5-HT3ARs, while nFS interneurons were largely unaffected. At the synaptic level, 5-HT suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission between pyramidal neurons via presynaptic 5-HT1BRs, and conversely enhanced GABAergic transmission from FS interneurons via presynaptic 5-HT3ARs. Conclusions & Implications: Serotonin exerts bidirectional, cell type-specific serotonergic modulation of local microcircuits that acts to suppress excitation while facilitating inhibition. This balanced and targeted regulation, arising from distinct distributions of somatodendritic and presynaptic 5-HT receptors, provides a mechanistic basis for serotonergic influence on attention, cognitive flexibility, and emotional regulation.

">mTORC1-Dependent Signaling in Layer 5b Neurons Is Required for Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation relies on activity-dependent neuronal plasticity, particularly in deep-layer cortical neurons that integrate long-range inputs from medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. In the neocortex, apical tuft dendrites of layer 5b pyramidal neurons receive direct input from the MTL within cortical layer 1, and their activation is critical for associative learning. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable learning-induced plasticity in these neurons remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that activity-dependent, mTORC1-regulated translation in layer 5b neurons contributes to learning and memory. Using in vivo paradigms such as exposure to an enriched environment (EE) and in vitro models of network activation by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP), combined with cell type-specific translational profiling (RiboTag), we identify candidate mRNAs associated with experience-dependent plasticity. We further show that pharmacological inhibition of canonical mTORC1 signaling during memory-relevant tasks abrogated memory consolidation. Our findings identify the mTORC1 pathway as a central regulator of learning-induced protein translation and cortical plasticity.

                <p>Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is classically linked to associative learning, signaling relationships between predictive cues and outcomes. Yet, dopamine is also strongly modulated by novelty, a nonassociative factor that has received comparatively little attention. Here, we used optical dopamine sensors in awake, behaving male and female mice to define how novelty alters the temporal dynamics of dopamine release during aversive learning. We manipulated novelty in three ways: (1) omitting expected footshocks, (2) introducing novel neutral cues concurrently with shock-predictive stimuli, and (3) presenting novel stimuli in an unpaired fashion within a context. Across all conditions, manipulations robustly increased dopamine release and in some cases altered the directionality of cue-evoked dopamine responses. Notably, these effects extended beyond the immediate stimulus window, altering subsequent responses to both conditioned cues and footshocks. Together, these findings demonstrate that changes in the environment that extend beyond prediction-based learning can exert a powerful and sustained influence on dopamine signaling, reshaping how aversive cues and outcomes are represented in the brain.</p>

                <p>by Madeleine Ammar, Laurel Fogarty, Anne Kandler</p>

One of the most controversial and actively debated questions about both human and non-human animal culture concerns its relationship with adaptation – under what circumstances might we expect culture, and the ability to learn socially from others, to be beneficial, and favored by natural selection? Existing theory posits that the benefit of social learning depends on the rate at which the environment changes, and recent work has shown that this relationship is mediated by how much information an individual can retain over time - by memory. Based on extensive ethnographic research, vertical learning—social learning from parent to offspring—appears to be an extremely salient and important type of social learning. Here we develop large-scale agent-based simulation models to investigate the evolutionary relationship between vertical social learning in particular and the memory and retention of cultural information.
We show that the benefit of vertical learning depends on how quickly those information is forgotten and on the exact way in which individuals innovate. This work points to the importance of a complex interplay between the size of cultural repertoires, the benefits of cultural preservation, changing selective environments, and the mechanism of innovation - none of which can be fully understood in isolation.

                <p>by Justin Reynolds, Chongle Pan</p>

Deep neural networks can model the nonlinear architecture of polygenic traits, yet the reliability of attribution methods to identify the genetic variants driving model predictions remains uncertain. We introduce a benchmarking framework that quantifies three aspects of interpretability: attribution recall, attribution precision, and stability, and apply it to deep learning models trained on UK Biobank genotypes for standing height prediction. After quality control, feed-forward neural networks were trained on more than half a million autosomal variants from approximately 300 thousand participants and evaluated using four attribution algorithms (Saliency, Gradient SHAP, DeepLIFT, Integrated Gradients) with and without SmoothGrad noise averaging. Attribution recall was assessed using synthetic spike-in variants with known additive, dominant, recessive, and epistatic effects, enabling direct measurement of sensitivity to diverse genetic architectures. Attribution precision estimated specificity using an equal number of null decoy variants that preserved allele structure while disrupting genotype-phenotype correspondence. Stability was measured by the consistency of variant-level attributions across an ensemble of independently trained models. SmoothGrad increased average recall across effect types by approximately 0.16 at the top 1% of the most highly attributed variants and improved average precision by about 0.06 at the same threshold, while stability remained comparable with median relative standard deviations of 0.4 to 0.5 across methods. Among the evaluated attribution methods, Saliency achieved the highest composite score, indicating that its simple gradient formulation provided the best overall balance of recall, precision, and stability.

                <p>by Gaston Sivori, Tomoki Fukai</p>

One of the remarkable properties of cortical neurons is their innate ability to detect spike patterns in continuous but noisy information streams. As animals learn behaviorally relevant information quickly, pattern detection by neurons should also be rapid. However, how pattern-selective neuronal responses rapidly develop, tune, and remain robust has not been fully understood. Here, we propose a biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rule to learn patterned synaptic inputs rapidly. Our rule facilitates intracellular “self-supervised” learning of intermittently and repeatedly co-activated presynaptic-neuron communities, as in a machine-learning-based rule derived previously for temporal pattern segmentation. Importantly, this model proposes that a spike-triggered transient increase in somatodendritic coupling dramatically boosts the crediting of synapses responsible for the learned response. This boosting effect is essential for rapid pattern learning of single neurons at a high signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, we demonstrate in recurrent networks how the rule recruits pre-configured cell assemblies for even faster, few-shot learning of multiple patterns. Our results illuminate the self-supervisory role of backpropagating action potentials for rapid pattern learning.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision impairment, which significantly impacts working-class populations, necessitating accurate and early diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional DR classification relies on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models and extensive preprocessing. In this work, we propose a novel approach leveraging pre-trained models for feature extraction, followed by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for refined embedding representation. The extracted feature vectors are structured as a graph, where GCN enhances embeddings before classification. The proposed model incorporates quality assessment by predicting a confidence score through a dedicated fully connected layer, trained to align with ground truth quality using binary cross-entropy loss. Uncertainty estimation is achieved by calculating the variance across multiple stochastic passes, providing a measure of the model’s prediction reliability. We evaluate the proposed DR detection approach on APTOS2019, Messidor-2, and EyePACS datasets, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Using MobileViT as the main feature extractor, we reached a remarkable 98.45% accuracy, 98.45% F1-Score, and 98.06% Kappa on the APTOS2019 dataset. The DenseNet-169 proved to be the best backbone of the pipeline for the Messidor-2 dataset, with an accuracy of 94.90%, F1-Score of 94.87%, and Kappa of 93.63%. Additionally, for external validation, the model demonstrated strong generalization capability on the EyePACS dataset, where DenseNet-169 achieved 97.38% accuracy, 97.37% F1-Score, and 96.72% Kappa, while MobileViT obtained 96.02% accuracy, 96.02% F1-Score, and 95.03% Kappa. Our innovative architecture incorporates uncertainty estimation and quality assessment techniques, enabling accurate confidence scores and enhancing the model’s reliability in clinical environments. Furthermore, to strengthen interpretability and facilitate clinical validation, Grad-CAM heatmaps were employed to demonstrate the significance of different input regions on the model’s predictions.

                <p>by Yaxun Jia, Zhu Yuan, Lian Zhu, Zuo-lin Xiang</p>

Drug–drug interactions (DDIs) are a significant source of adverse drug events and pose critical challenges to patient safety and clinical decision-making. Extracting DDIs from biomedical literature plays an essential role in pharmacovigilance, yet remains difficult due to data sparsity and high annotation costs. This study presents BioMCL-DDI, a novel few-shot learning framework that integrates meta-learning with contrastive embedding strategies to enable efficient DDI extraction under limited supervision. BioMCL-DDI jointly optimizes prototype-based classification and supervised contrastive representation learning within a unified architecture. The model captures both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, enhancing its generalization in sparse biomedical settings. We evaluate BioMCL-DDI on three benchmark datasets: DDI-2013, DrugBank, and the more recent TAC 2018 DDI Extraction corpus. The model achieves F1 scores of 87.80% on DDI-2013, 86.00% on DrugBank, and 74.85%/74.82% on the two official test sets of TAC 2018, consistently outperforming competitive baselines. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource scenarios. BioMCL-DDI provides a scalable and effective solution for DDI extraction from biomedical texts, with strong potential for integration into clinical decision support systems and biomedical knowledge bases. All our code and data have been publicly released at: https://github.com/Hero-Legend/BioMCL-DDI.

Cardiac fibrosis is a pathological condition associated with many cardiovascular diseases. Atrial fibrosis leads to reduced atrial function, resulting in diminished blood flow and an increased risk of stroke. This reduced function arises from altered myocardial electrophysiological and mechanical properties. Identifying the relative importance of these fibrosis-associated properties can reveal the most significant determinants of left atrial function impairment. In this study, we used a computational framework to investigate the relative importance of various fibrosis-associated properties. Our model, a 3D electromechanical framework coupled with a 0D circulatory model, incorporated patient-specific geometries and fibrosis distributions from clinical imaging data. Nine parameters related to fibrotic remodeling (conduction velocity, ion channel expression levels, cell- and tissue-scale contractility, and stiffness) were analyzed using two sensitivity analysis schemes: a one-factor-at-a-time setup, allowing for analysis of isolated effects, and a fractional factorial design, enabling examination of combined effects. As output, we tracked various metrics derived from model-predicted pressure-volume loops. Impairment of L-type calcium current (I<sub>CaL</sub>) was most detrimental (up to 64% reduction in A-loop area of the left atrial pressure-volume relationship, quantifying work performed during atrial contraction). Conversely, reduced inward rectifier current (I<sub>K1</sub>) led to improved atrial function (up to 27% increase in A-loop area). Detailed analysis of spatiotemporal distributions linked these effects to changes in intracellular calcium handling. Fractional factorial design analysis revealed that combination with other parameter changes blunted the impact of reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> but amplified the impact of reduced I<sub>K1</sub>. Future research focusing on I<sub>K1</sub> and I<sub>CaL</sub> could be highly significant for clinical and scientific advances. Modeling work can help evaluate left atrial function among larger patient cohorts, focusing on strain analysis. Our work could also be extended to spatiotemporal simulations of blood flow and thrombosis, shedding light onto the mechanisms underlying atriogenic stroke.
