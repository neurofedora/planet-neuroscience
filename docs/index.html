                Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm generated by reciprocal chromosomal translocation, t (9; 22) (q34; q11) in the transformed hematopoietic stem cell. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) target the mature proliferating BCR-ABL cells, the major CML driver, and increase overall and disease-free survival. However, mutant clones, pre-existing or due to therapy, develop resistance against TKIs. BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein activates various molecular pathways including the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, JAK2/STAT pathway, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Stimulation of these pathways in TKI resistant CML patients, make them a new target. Moreover, a small proportion of CML cells, leukemic stem cells (LSCs), persist during the TKI therapy and sustain the disease in the patient. Engraftment of LSCs in the bone marrow niche and dysregulation of miRNA participate greatly in the TKI resistance. Current efforts are needed for determining the reason behind TKI resistance, identification, and elimination of CML LSC might be of great need for cancer cure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">NIFtHool: an informatics program for identification of NifH proteins using deep neural networks [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Atmospheric nitrogen fixation carried out by microorganisms has environmental and industrial importance, related to the increase of soil fertility and productivity. The present work proposes the development of a new high precision system that allows the recognition of amino acid sequences of the nitrogenase enzyme (NifH) as a promising way to improve the identification of diazotrophic bacteria. For this purpose, a database obtained from UniProt built a processed dataset formed by a set of 4911 and 4782 amino acid sequences of the NifH and non-NifH proteins respectively. Subsequently, the feature extraction was developed using two methodologies: (i) k-mers counting and (ii) embedding layers to obtain numerical vectors of the amino acid chains. Afterward, for the embedding layer, the data was crossed by an external trainable convolutional layer, which received a uniform matrix and applied convolution using filters to obtain the feature maps of the model. Finally, a deep neural network was used as the primary model to classify the amino acid sequences as NifH protein or not. Performance evaluation experiments were carried out, and the results revealed an accuracy of 96.4%, a sensitivity of 95.2%, and a specificity of 96.7%. Therefore, an amino acid sequence-based feature extraction method that uses a neural network to detect N-fixing organisms is proposed and implemented.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genre analysis of introduction section in electrical engineering undergraduate laboratory reports [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the genre of Engineering Laboratory Reports (ELR) introduction section written by Electrical Engineering Undergraduates in a higher learning institution. The aims of this study are to identify the rhetorical moves and combinations of move patterns used by engineering students to write introduction section of ELR.  Method A genre analysis was conducted to identify writing patterns and convention practices of engineering undergraduate students thus a corpus of N= 35 was selected from electrical engineering students in their final year of study. This study adopted Genre Theory as its theoretical framework, [1] analytical framework and [2] BCU approach for analysis procedure. A pilot test was conducted to determine the model that fits the best to describe moves and steps of ELR. The study benchmarks a move or step to be present in at least 60% of the reports.  Results The finding shows the introduction consists of one main move which is providing background information of the experiment and followed by four subsequent steps which are reference to research purposes, reference to theoretical knowledge in the field, providing an overview of the study and identification of main research apparatus. The move 1 and all four steps identified above are viewed as conventional move and steps of introduction section only among undergraduates in academic context. The exemplification of finding pave ways to address grey areas of improvement in scientific written genre among laboratory instructors and academics. The method employed in this study may be replicated to analyse other sections of scientific and technical reports such as method, result, discussion and conclusion (MRDC).  Conclusion This study posits the importance of collaboration between English for Academic (EAP) practitioners such as English-writing instructors and discipline specific specialist from engineering field to further improve on genre-based writing instruction, and to identify student learning needs.

                Background: Mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and their aggravation have been studied extensively in the general population. However, there are few studies on depression in older adults and the few existing results may be contradictory, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with depression in older adults in two coastal regions of Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study uses an analytical cross-sectional design in a population of older adults, who participated in a non-governmental ambulatory social support program in Callao and Ica, two coastal regions of Peru. We administered an on-site structured questionnaire to record sociodemographic data, the Geriatric Depression Scale by Yesavage to measure depression, and the Barthel Index to assess physical function. In order to determine cognitive impairment as an exclusion criterion, the MEC-30 was used. The association between variables was assessed through contingency tables, using the odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding confidence interval (95% CI) and the X2 test. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: Out of the 244 older adults surveyed, 39% had depressive symptoms, of which 28.3% (n=69) and 10.7% (n=26) were moderately and severely depressive, respectively. The findings significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms were being 76 years old or older [p=0.005, OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29-4.20], not participating in weekly recreational activities [p=0.004, OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.31-3.99] and the presence of comorbidities [p=0.026, OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.07-3.29]. Conclusion: There are few studies exploring depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic; this research shows the importance of mental health care in this population and, particularly, of those who are 76 or older because they suffer from comorbid conditions and have interrupted recreational activities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anxiety level among newly hired nurse in a specialized oncology hospital: An observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Anxiety is common among oncology nurses due to the complexity of oncology patients' needs and demands. The current study aimed to assess the anxiety level among newly hired nurses in a specialized oncology hospital throughout their initial period of employment, deploying a General Nursing Orientation (GNO) and the Clinical Resource Nurse (CRN) role. Methods: A longitudinal one-group repeated measure design was used. Participants' demographics sheet and Sate-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults questionnaire were used. A total of 181 newly hired nurses participated in the study. Results: The anxiety level among newly hired oncology nurses was (mean=38.65, SD=9.58) at the beginning of GNO, and the level of anxiety was highest after 90 days of employment (mean=45.71, SD=7.20). The level of anxiety among newly hired oncology nurses increased gradually from day one of the GNO, the last day of GNO, and finally, after 90 days of employment. Conclusions: Nurses working in oncology workplaces face anxiety. It is important to seek nursing administrators' attention to apply proper strategies to decrease the anxiety level among newly hired nurses to help them smoothly fit into a new team to ensure safe patient care.

                Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the care-seeking behaviour among adolescents with patellofemoral pain (PFP). Methods: This retrospective study included data on 121 adolescents with PFP enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. A questionnaire was sent to the general practitioner (GP) of each adolescent, assessing information on the consultation dates for knee pain, potential diagnoses, and treatment provided. Results: 106/121 adolescents had been in contact with their GP, and 95 medical records of adolescents were available. Of the 95 adolescents with available medical records 60 had consulted their GP for knee pain. The median number of contacts was 1.5 (range 1-7). The GPs initiated treatment for 48 of the 60 adolescents and in most cases it was information and advice (36/48) or pain medication to a minor extent (6/48). Out of the 60 adolescents who consulted their GP 26 were subsequently referred to different types of health care professionals, in 11 out of 26 to physiotherapy, but also to the department of rheumatology or orthopaedics. Conclusions: 63% of adolescents diagnosed with PFP had previously consulted their GP due to knee pain. Several types of treatments were initiated by the GP, but most commonly advice and information were given. Standardized and evidence-based treatment guidelines for adolescent knee pain in general practice are needed

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Collaboration in neuroscience is impeded by the difficulty of sharing primary data, results, and software across labs. Here, we introduce Neuroscience Data Interface (NDI), a platform-independent standard that allows an analyst to use and create software that functions independently from the format of the raw data or the manner in which the data are organized into files. The interface is rooted in a simple vocabulary that describes common apparatus and storage devices used in neuroscience experiments. Results of analyses, and analyses of analyses, are stored as documents in a scalable, queryable database that stores the relationships and history among the experiment elements and documents. The interface allows the development of an application ecosystem where applications can focus on calculation rather than data format or organization. This tool can be used by individual labs to exchange and analyze data, and it can serve to curate neuroscience data for searchable archives.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Seizure prediction is the grand challenge of epileptology. However, effort was devoted to prediction of focal seizures, while generalized seizures were regarded as stochastic events. Long-lasting local field potential (LFP) recordings containing several hundred generalized spike and wave discharges (SWDs), acquired at eight locations in the cortico-thalamic system of absence epileptic rats, were iteratively analyzed in all possible combinations of either two or three recording sites, by a wavelet-based algorithm, calculating the product of the wavelet-energy signaling increases in synchronicity. Sensitivity and false alarm rate of prediction were compared between various combinations, and wavelet spectra of true and false positive predictions were fed to a random forest machine learning algorithm to further differentiate between them. Wavelet analysis of intracortical and cortico-thalamic LFP traces showed a significantly smaller number of false alarms compared with intrathalamic combinations, while predictions based on recordings in Layers IV, V, and VI of the somatosensory-cortex significantly outreached all other combinations in terms of prediction sensitivity. In 24-h out-of-sample recordings of nine Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), containing diurnal fluctuations of SWD occurrence, classification of true and false positives by the trained random forest further reduced the false alarm rate by 71%, although at some trade-off between false alarms and sensitivity of prediction, as reflected in relatively low F1 score values. Results provide support for the cortical-focus theory of absence epilepsy and allow the conclusion that SWDs are predictable to some degree. The latter paves the way for the development of closed-loop SWD prediction-prevention systems. Suggestions for a possible translation to human data are outlined.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Despite significant progress in understanding neural coding, it remains unclear how the coordinated activity of large populations of neurons relates to what an observer actually perceives. Since neurophysiological differences must underlie differences among percepts, <I>differentiation analysis</I>&mdash;quantifying distinct patterns of neurophysiological activity&mdash;has been proposed as an "inside-out" approach that addresses this question. This methodology contrasts with "outside-in" approaches such as feature tuning and decoding analyses, which are defined in terms of extrinsic experimental variables. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging in mice of both sexes to systematically survey stimulus-evoked neurophysiological differentiation (ND) in excitatory neuronal populations in layers (L)2/3, L4, and L5 across five visual cortical areas (primary, lateromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, and anteromedial) in response to naturalistic and phase-scrambled movie stimuli. We find that unscrambled stimuli evoke greater ND than scrambled stimuli specifically in L2/3 of the anterolateral and anteromedial areas, and that this effect is modulated by arousal state and locomotion. By contrast, decoding performance was far above chance and did not vary substantially across areas and layers. Differentiation also differed within the unscrambled stimulus set, suggesting that differentiation analysis may be used to probe the ethological relevance of individual stimuli.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>There is consensus that primary auditory cortex (A1) utilizes a combination of rate codes and temporally precise population codes to represent discreet auditory objects. During the response to auditory streams, forward suppression constrains cortical rate coding strategies, but it may also be well positioned to enhance temporal coding strategies that rely on synchronized firing across neural ensembles. Here, we exploited the rapid temporal dynamics of bat echolocation to investigate how forward suppression modulates the cortical ensemble representation of complex acoustic signals embedded in echo streams. We recorded from auditory cortex of anesthetized free-tailed bats while stimulating the auditory system with naturalistic biosonar pulse-echo sequences covering a range of pulse emission rates. As expected, increasing pulse repetition rate significantly reduced the number of spikes per echo stimulus, but it also increased spike timing precision and doubled the information gain. This increased spike-timing precision translated into more robust inter-neuronal synchronization patterns with &gt;10-dB higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the ensemble level. We propose that forward suppression dynamically mediates a trade-off between the sensitive detection of isolated sounds versus precise spatiotemporal encoding of ongoing sound sequences in auditory cortex.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Over half of all spinal cord injuries (SCIs) are cervical, which can lead to paralysis and respiratory compromise, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Effective treatments to restore breathing after severe upper cervical injury are lacking; thus, it is imperative to develop therapies to address this. Epidural stimulation has successfully restored motor function after SCI for stepping, standing, reaching, grasping, and postural control. We hypothesized that closed-loop stimulation triggered via healthy hemidiaphragm EMG activity has the potential to elicit functional neuroplasticity in spinal respiratory pathways after cervical SCI (cSCI). To test this, we delivered closed-loop, electrical, epidural stimulation (CLES) at the level of the phrenic motor nucleus (C4) for 3 d after C2 hemisection (C2HS) in freely behaving rats. A 2 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 2 Latin Square experimental design incorporated two treatments, C2HS injury and CLES therapy resulting in four groups of adult, female Sprague Dawley rats: C2HS + CLES (<I>n</I> = 8), C2HS (<I>n</I> = 6), intact + CLES (<I>n</I> = 6), intact (<I>n</I> = 6). In stimulated groups, CLES was delivered for 12&ndash;20 h/d for 3 d. After C2HS, 3 d of CLES robustly facilitated the slope of stimulus-response curves of ipsilesional spinal motor evoked potentials (sMEPs) versus nonstimulated controls. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of CLES eliciting respiratory neuroplasticity after C2HS in freely behaving animals. These findings suggest CLES as a promising future therapy to address respiratory deficiency associated with cSCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Complexes of Ghrelin GHS-R1a, GHS-R1b, and Dopamine D1 Receptors Localized in the Ventral Tegmental Area as Main Mediators of the Dopaminergic Effects of Ghrelin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ghrelin receptor, also known as growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1a), is coexpressed with its truncated isoform GHS-R1b, which does not bind ghrelin or signal, but oligomerizes with GHS-R1a, exerting a complex modulatory role that depends on its relative expression. D<SUB>1</SUB> dopamine receptor (D1R) and D5R constitute the two D<SUB>1</SUB>-like receptor subtypes. Previous studies showed that GHS-R1b also facilitates oligomerization of GHS-R1a with D1R, conferring GHS-R1a distinctive pharmacological properties. Those include a switch in the preferred coupling of GHS-R1a from Gq to Gs and the ability of D1R/D5R agonists and antagonists to counteract GHS-R1a signaling. Activation of ghrelin receptors localized in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) seems to play a significant role in the contribution of ghrelin to motivated behavior. In view of the evidence indicating that dopaminergic cells of the VTA express ghrelin receptors and D5R, but not D1R, we investigated the possible existence of functional GHS-R1a:GHS-R1b:D5R oligomeric complexes in the VTA. GHS-R1a:GHS-R1b:D5R oligomers were first demonstrated in mammalian transfected cells, and their pharmacological properties were found to be different from those of GHS-R1a:GHS-R1b:D1R oligomers, including weak Gs coupling and the ability of D1R/D5R antagonists, but not agonists, to counteract the effects of ghrelin. However, analyzing the effect of ghrelin in the rodent VTA on MAPK activation with <I>ex vivo</I> experiments, on somatodendritic dopamine release with <I>in vivo</I> microdialysis and on the activation of dopaminergic cells with patch-clamp electrophysiology, provided evidence for a predominant role of GHS-R1a:GHS-R1b:D1R oligomers in the rodent VTA as main mediators of the dopaminergic effects of ghrelin.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The activation of ghrelin receptors localized in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a significant role in the contribution of ghrelin to motivated behavior. We present evidence that indicates these receptors form part of oligomeric complexes that include the functional ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a, its truncated nonsignaling isoform GHS-R1b, and the dopamine D<SUB>1</SUB> receptor (D1R). The binding of ghrelin to these complexes promotes activation of the dopaminergic neurons of the VTA by activation of adenylyl cyclase&ndash;protein kinase A signaling, which can be counteracted by both GHS-R1a and D1R antagonists. Our study provides evidence for a predominant role of GHS-R1a:GHS-R1b:D1R oligomers in rodent VTA as main mediators of the dopaminergic effects of ghrelin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presynaptic Mitochondrial Volume and Packing Density Scale with Presynaptic Power Demand</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stable neural function requires an energy supply that can meet the intense episodic power demands of neuronal activity. Neurons have presumably optimized the volume of their bioenergetic machinery to ensure these power demands are met, but the relationship between presynaptic power demands and the volume available to the bioenergetic machinery has never been quantified. Here, we estimated the power demands of six motor nerve terminals in female <I>Drosophila</I> larvae through direct measurements of neurotransmitter release and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and via theoretical estimates of Na<sup>+</sup> entry and power demands at rest. Electron microscopy revealed that terminals with the highest power demands contained the greatest volume of mitochondria, indicating that mitochondria are allocated according to presynaptic power demands. In addition, terminals with the greatest power demand-to-volume ratio (~66 nmol&middot;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup>&middot;&micro;l<sup>&ndash;1</sup>) harbor the largest mitochondria packed at the greatest density. If we assume sequential and complete oxidation of glucose by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, then these mitochondria are required to produce ATP at a rate of 52 nmol&middot;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup>&middot;&micro;l<sup>&ndash;1</sup> at rest, rising to 963 during activity. Glycolysis would contribute ATP at 0.24 nmol&middot;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup>&middot;&micro;l<sup>&ndash;1</sup> of cytosol at rest, rising to 4.36 during activity. These data provide a quantitative framework for presynaptic bioenergetics <I>in situ</I>, and reveal that, beyond an immediate capacity to accelerate ATP output from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, over longer time periods presynaptic terminals optimize mitochondrial volume and density to meet power demand.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The remarkable energy demands of the brain are supported by the complete oxidation of its fuel but debate continues regarding a division of labor between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation across different cell types. Here, we exploit the neuromuscular synapse, a model for studying neurophysiology, to elucidate fundamental aspects of neuronal energy metabolism that ultimately constrain rates of neural processing. We quantified energy production rates required to sustain activity at individual nerve terminals and compared these with the volume capable of oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) and glycolysis (cytosol). We find strong support for oxidative phosphorylation playing a primary role in presynaptic terminals and provide the first <I>in vivo</I> estimates of energy production rates per unit volume of presynaptic mitochondria and cytosol.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatiotemporal Control of Noradrenaline-Dependent Synaptic Transmission in Mouse Dorsal Raphe Serotonin Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Activity of dorsal raphe neurons is controlled by noradrenaline afferents. In this brain region, noradrenaline activates G&alpha;<SUB>q</SUB>-coupled &alpha;1-adrenergic receptors (&alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>), causing action potential (AP) firing and serotonin release. <I>In vitro</I>, electrical stimulation elicits vesicular noradrenaline release and subsequent activation of &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB> to produce an EPSC (&alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>-EPSC). The duration of the &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>-EPSC (~27 s) is much longer than that of most other synaptic currents, but the factors that govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB> are poorly understood. Using an acute brain slice preparation from adult male and female mice and electrophysiological recordings from dorsal raphe neurons, we found that the time course of the &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>-EPSC was slow, but highly consistent within individual serotonin neurons. The amount of noradrenaline released influenced the amplitude of the &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>-EPSC without altering the time constant of decay suggesting that once released, extracellular noradrenaline was cleared efficiently. Reuptake of noradrenaline via noradrenaline transporters was a primary means of terminating the &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>-EPSC, with little evidence for extrasynaptic diffusion of noradrenaline unless transporter-dependent reuptake was impaired. Taken together, the results demonstrate that despite slow intrinsic signaling kinetics, noradrenaline-dependent synaptic transmission in the dorsal raphe is temporally and spatially controlled and noradrenaline transporters are critical regulators of serotonin neuron excitability. Given the functionally distinct types of neurons intermingled in the dorsal raphe nucleus and the unique roles of these neural circuits in physiological responses, transporters may preserve independence of each synapse to encode a long-lasting but discrete signal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The dorsal raphe nucleus is the predominant source of serotonin in the brain and is controlled by another monoamine, noradrenaline. In this brain region, noradrenaline activates G-protein-coupled &alpha;1-adrenergic receptors (&alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB>) causing action potential (AP) firing and serotonin release. Despite high interest in pharmacotherapies to enhance serotonin signaling, the factors that govern noradrenaline &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB> signaling have received little attention. Here, we show using mouse brain slices that the time course of &alpha;1-A<SUB>R</SUB> signaling is slow, persisting for tens of seconds. Despite slow intrinsic signaling kinetics, noradrenaline-dependent synaptic transmission in the dorsal raphe is controlled temporally and spatially by efficient noradrenaline transporter-dependent clearance of extracellular noradrenaline. Thus, noradrenaline transporters are critical regulators of serotonin neuron excitability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Integration of Subquantal Neurotransmission by Colocalized G Protein-Coupled Receptors in Presynaptic Terminals</a></h4>

              
                <p>In presynaptic terminals, membrane-delimited G<SUB>i/o</SUB>-mediated presynaptic inhibition is ubiquitous and acts via G&beta; to inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, or directly at SNARE complexes to inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent synaptotagmin-SNARE complex interactions. At CA1-subicular presynaptic terminals, 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> and GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors colocalize. GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, whereas 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptors target SNARE complexes. We demonstrate in male and female rats that GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors alter P<SUB>r</SUB>, whereas 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptors reduce evoked cleft glutamate concentrations, allowing differential inhibition of AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs. This reduction in cleft glutamate concentration was confirmed by imaging glutamate release using a genetic sensor (iGluSnFR). Simulations of glutamate release and postsynaptic glutamate receptor currents were made. We tested effects of changes in vesicle numbers undergoing fusion at single synapses, relative placement of fusing vesicles and postsynaptic receptors, and the rate of release of glutamate from a fusion pore. Experimental effects of P<SUB>r</SUB> changes, consistent with GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptor effects, were straightforwardly represented by changes in numbers of synapses. The effects of 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptor-mediated inhibition are well fit by simulated modulation of the release rate of glutamate into the cleft. Colocalization of different actions of GPCRs provides synaptic integration within presynaptic terminals. Train-dependent presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation forces frequency-dependent recovery of neurotransmission during 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptor activation. This is consistent with competition between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-synaptotagmin and G&beta; at SNARE complexes. Thus, stimulus trains in 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptor agonist unveil dynamic synaptic modulation and a sophisticated hippocampal output filter that itself is modulated by colocalized GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors, which alter presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In combination, these pathways allow complex presynaptic integration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Two G protein-coupled receptors colocalize at presynaptic sites, to mediate presynaptic modulation by G&beta;, but one (a GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptor) inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry whereas another (a 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptor) competes with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-synaptotagmin binding to the synaptic vesicle machinery. We have investigated downstream effects of signaling and integrative properties of these receptors. Their effects are profoundly different. GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors alter P<SUB>r</SUB> leaving synaptic properties unchanged, whereas 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptors fundamentally change properties of synaptic transmission, modifying AMPAR but sparing NMDAR responses. Coactivation of these receptors allows synaptic integration because of convergence of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptor alteration on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the effect of this altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal on 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> receptor signaling. This presynaptic convergence provides a novel form of synaptic integration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stochastic Properties of Spontaneous Synaptic Transmission at Individual Active Zones</a></h4>

              
                <p>Using postsynaptically tethered calcium sensor GCaMP, we investigated spontaneous synaptic transmission at individual active zones (AZs) at the <I>Drosophila</I> (both sexes) neuromuscular junction. Optical monitoring of GCaMP events coupled with focal electrical recordings of synaptic currents revealed "hot spots" of spontaneous transmission, which corresponded to transient states of elevated activity at selected AZs. The elevated spontaneous activity had two temporal components, one at a timescale of minutes and the other at a subsecond timescale. We developed a three-state model of AZ preparedness for spontaneous transmission and performed Monte Carlo simulations of the release process, which produced an accurate quantitative description of the variability and time course of spontaneous transmission at individual AZs. To investigate the mechanisms of elevated activity, we first focused on the protein complexin, which binds the SNARE protein complex and serves to clamp spontaneous fusion. Overexpression of <I>Drosophila</I> complexin largely abolished the high-activity states of AZs, while complexin deletion drastically promoted it. A mutation in the SNARE protein Syntaxin-1A had an effect similar to complexin deficiency, promoting the high-activity state. We next tested how presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients affect the states of elevated activity at individual AZs. We either blocked or promoted Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pharmacologically, and also promoted Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores. These experiments coupled with computations revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients can trigger bursts of spontaneous events from individual AZs or AZ clusters at a subsecond timescale. Together, our results demonstrated that spontaneous transmission is highly heterogeneous, with transient hot spots being regulated by the SNARE machinery and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spontaneous synaptic transmission is a vital component of neuronal communication, since it regulates the neuronal development and plasticity. Our study demonstrated that spontaneous transmission is highly heterogeneous and that nerve terminals create transient "hot spots" of spontaneous release of neuronal transmitters. We show that these hot spots are regulated by the protein machinery mediating the release process and by calcium ions. These results contribute to our understanding of spontaneous synaptic transmission as a dynamic, plastic, and tightly regulated signaling mechanism and unravel fundamental biophysical properties of neuronal communication.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Late-Onset, Short-Term Intermittent Fasting Reverses Age-Related Changes in Calcium Buffering and Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission in Mouse Basal Forebrain Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging is often associated with cognitive decline and recurrent cellular and molecular impairments. While life-long caloric restriction (CR) may delay age-related cognitive deterioration as well as the onset of neurologic disease, recent studies suggest that late-onset, short-term intermittent fasting (IF), may show comparable beneficial effects as those of life-long CR to improve brain health. We used a new optogenetic aging model to study the effects of late-onset (&gt;18 months), short-term (four to six weeks) IF on age-related changes in GABAergic synaptic transmission, intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) buffering, and cognitive status. We used male mice from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse line with stable expression of the channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) variant H134R [VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP] in a reduced synaptic preparation that allows for specific optogenetic light stimulation on GABAergic synaptic terminals across aging. We performed quantal analysis using the method of failures in this model and show that short-term IF reverses the age-related decrease in quantal content of GABAergic synapses. Likewise, short-term IF also reversed age-related changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering and spontaneous GABAergic synaptic transmission in basal forebrain (BF) neurons of aged mice. Our findings suggest that late-onset short-term IF can reverse age-related physiological impairments in mouse BF neurons but that four weeks IF is not sufficient to reverse age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here, we demonstrate plasticity of the aging brain and reversal of well-defined hallmarks of brain aging using short-term intermittent fasting (IF) initiated later in life. Few therapeutics are currently available to treat age-related neurologic dysfunction although synaptic dysfunction occurs during aging and neurologic disease is a topic of intense research. Using a new reduced synaptic preparation and optogenetic stimulation we are able to study age-related synaptic mechanisms in greater detail. Several neurophysiological parameters including quantal content were altered during aging and were reversed with short-term IF. These methods can be used to identify potential therapies to reverse physiological dysfunction during aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Altered Excitation-Inhibition Balance on Decision Making in a Cortical Circuit Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>The synaptic balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) is a fundamental principle of cortical circuits, and disruptions in E/I balance are commonly linked to cognitive deficits such as impaired decision-making. Explanatory gaps remain in a mechanistic understanding of how E/I balance contributes to cognitive computations, and how E/I disruptions at the synaptic level can propagate to induce behavioral deficits. Here, we studied how E/I perturbations may impair perceptual decision-making in a biophysically-based association cortical circuit model. We found that both elevating and lowering E/I ratio, via NMDA receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction at inhibitory interneurons and excitatory pyramidal neurons, respectively, can similarly impair psychometric performance, following an inverted-U dependence. Nonetheless, these E/I perturbations differentially alter the process of evidence accumulation across time. Under elevated E/I ratio, decision-making is impulsive, overweighting early evidence and underweighting late evidence. Under lowered E/I ratio, decision-making is indecisive, with both evidence integration and winner-take-all competition weakened. The distinct time courses of evidence accumulation at the circuit level can be measured at the behavioral level, using multiple psychophysical task paradigms which provide dissociable predictions. These results are well captured by a generalized drift-diffusion model (DDM) with self-coupling, implementing leaky or unstable integration, which thereby links biophysical circuit modeling to algorithmic process modeling and facilitates model fitting to behavioral choice data. In general, our findings characterize critical roles of cortical E/I balance in cognitive function, bridging from biophysical to behavioral levels of analysis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive deficits in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, have been associated with alterations in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I) in cerebral cortical circuits. However, the circuit mechanisms by which E/I imbalance leads to cognitive deficits in decision-making have remained unclear. We used a computational model of decision-making in cortical circuits to study the neural and behavioral effects of E/I imbalance. We found that elevating and lowering E/I ratio produce distinct modes of dysfunction in decision-making processes, which can be dissociated in behavior through psychophysical task paradigms. The biophysical circuit model can be mapped onto a psychological model of decision-making which can facilitate experimental tests of model predictions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Biased Orientation and Color Tuning of the Human Visual Gamma Rhythm</a></h4>

              
                <p>Narrowband  oscillations (NBG: ~20-60 Hz) in visual cortex reflect rhythmic fluctuations in population activity generated by underlying circuits tuned for stimulus location, orientation, and color. A variety of theories posit a specific role for NBG in encoding and communicating this information within visual cortex. However, recent findings suggest a more nuanced role for NBG, given its dependence on certain stimulus feature configurations, such as coherent-oriented edges and specific hues. Motivated by these factors, we sought to quantify the independent and joint tuning properties of NBG to oriented and color stimuli using intracranial recordings from the human visual cortex (male and female). NBG was shown to display a cardinal orientation bias (horizontal) and also an end- and mid-spectral color bias (red/blue and green). When jointly probed, the cardinal bias for orientation was attenuated and an end-spectral preference for red and blue predominated. This loss of mid-spectral tuning occurred even for recording sites showing large responses to uniform green stimuli. Our results demonstrate the close, yet complex, link between the population dynamics driving NBG oscillations and known feature selectivity biases for orientation and color within visual cortex. Such a bias in stimulus tuning imposes new constraints on the functional significance of the visual  rhythm. More generally, these biases in population electrophysiology will need to be considered in experiments using orientation or color features to examine the role of visual cortex in other domains, such as working memory and decision-making.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oscillations in electrophysiological activity occur in visual cortex in response to stimuli that strongly drive the orientation or color selectivity of visual neurons. The significance of this induced " rhythm" to brain function remains unclear. Answering this question requires understanding how and why some stimuli can reliably generate oscillatory  activity while others do not. We examined how different orientations and colors independently and jointly modulate  oscillations in the human brain. Our data show that  oscillations are greatest for certain orientations and colors that reflect known response biases in visual cortex. Such findings complicate the functional significance of  oscillations but open new avenues for linking circuits to population dynamics in visual cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pathways for Memory, Cognition and Emotional Context: Hippocampal, Subgenual Area 25, and Amygdalar Axons Show Unique Interactions in the Primate Thalamic Reuniens Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The reuniens nucleus (RE) is situated at the most ventral position of the midline thalamus. In rats and mice RE is distinguished by bidirectional connections with the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a role in memory and cognition. In primates, many foundational questions pertaining to RE remain unresolved. We addressed these issues by investigating the composition of the rhesus monkey RE in both sexes by labeling for GABA, a marker of inhibitory neurons, and for the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), and calretinin (CR), which label thalamic excitatory neurons that project to cortex. As in rats and mice, the macaque RE was mostly populated by CB and CR neurons, characteristic of matrix-dominant nuclei, and had bidirectional connections with hippocampus and mPFC area 25 (A25). Unlike rodents, we found GABAergic neurons in the monkey RE and a sparser but consistent population of core-associated thalamocortical PV neurons. RE had stronger connections with the basal amygdalar complex than in rats or mice. Amygdalar terminations were enriched with mitochondria and frequently formed successive synapses with the same postsynaptic structures, suggesting an active and robust pathway to RE. Significantly, hippocampal pathways formed multisynaptic complexes that uniquely involved excitatory projection neurons and dendrites of local inhibitory neurons in RE, extending this synaptic principle beyond sensory to high-order thalamic nuclei. Convergent pathways from hippocampus, A25, and amygdala in RE position it to flexibly coordinate activity for memory, cognition, and emotional context, which are disrupted in several psychiatric and neurologic diseases in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The primate RE is a central node for memory and cognition through connections with the hippocampus and mPFC. As in rats or mice, the primate RE is a matrix-dominant thalamic nucleus, suggesting signal traffic to the upper cortical layers. Unlike rats or mice, the primate RE contains inhibitory neurons, synaptic specializations with the hippocampal pathway, and robust connections with the amygdala, suggesting unique adaptations. Convergence of hippocampal, mPFC, and amygdalar pathways in RE may help unravel a circuit basis for binding diverse signals for conscious flexible behaviors and the synthesis of memory with affective significance in primates, whereas disruption of distinct circuit nodes may occur in psychiatric disorders in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Activity-Dependent Increase in Synaptic Inhibition and Parvalbumin Interneuron Recruitment in Dentate Granule Cells and Semilunar Granule Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Strong inhibitory synaptic gating of dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs), attributed largely to fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs), is essential to maintain sparse network activity needed for dentate dependent behaviors. However, the contribution of PV-INs to basal and input-driven sustained synaptic inhibition in GCs and semilunar granule cells (SGCs), a sparse morphologically distinct dentate projection neuron subtype, is currently unknown. In studies conducted in hippocampal slices from mice, we find that although basal IPSCs are more frequent in SGCs and optical activation of PV-INs reliably elicited IPSCs in both GCs and SGCs, optical suppression of PV-INs failed to reduce IPSC frequency in either cell type. Amplitude and kinetics of IPSCs evoked by perforant path (PP) activation were not different between GCs and SGCs. However, the robust increase in sustained polysynaptic IPSCs elicited by paired afferent stimulation was lower in SGCs than in simultaneously recorded GCs. Optical suppression of PV-IN selectively reduced sustained IPSCs in SGCs but not in GCs. These results demonstrate that PV-INs, while contributing minimally to basal synaptic inhibition in both GCs and SGCs in slices, mediate sustained feedback inhibition selectively in SGCs. The temporally selective blunting of activity-driven sustained inhibitory gating of SGCs could support their preferential and persistent recruitment during behavioral tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our study identifies that feedback inhibitory regulation of dentate semilunar granule cells (SGCs), a sparse and functionally distinct class of projection neurons, differs from that of the classical projection neurons, GCs. Notably, we demonstrate relatively lower activity-dependent increase in sustained feedback inhibitory synaptic inputs to SGCs when compared with GCs which would facilitate their persistent activity and preferential recruitment as part of memory ensembles. Since dentate GC activity levels during memory processing are heavily shaped by basal and feedback inhibition, the fundamental differences in basal and evoked sustained inhibition between SGCs and GCs characterized here provide a framework to reorganize current understanding of the dentate circuit processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Suppresses Drift in Cortical Memory Representations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Memory retrieval is thought to depend on the reinstatement of cortical memory representations guided by pattern completion processes in the hippocampus. The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is one of the intermediary regions supporting hippocampal&ndash;cortical interactions and houses neurons that prospectively signal past events in a familiar environment. To investigate the functional relevance of the activity of the LEC for cortical reinstatement, we pharmacologically inhibited the LEC and examined its impact on the stability of ensemble firing patterns in one of the efferent targets of the LEC, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). When male rats underwent multiple epochs of identical stimulus sequences in the same environment, the mPFC maintained a stable ensemble firing pattern across repetitions, particularly when the sequence included pairings of neutral and aversive stimuli. With LEC inhibition, the mPFC still formed an ensemble pattern that accurately captured stimuli and their associations within each epoch. However, LEC inhibition markedly disrupted its consistency across the epochs by decreasing the proportion of mPFC neurons that stably maintained firing selectivity for stimulus associations. Thus, the LEC stabilizes cortical representations of learned stimulus associations, thereby facilitating the recovery of the original memory trace without generating a new, redundant trace for familiar experiences. Failure of this process might underlie retrieval deficits in conditions associated with degeneration of the LEC, such as normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To recall past events, the brain needs to reactivate the activity patterns that occurred during those events. However, such reinstatement of memory traces is not trivial because it goes against the natural tendency of the brain to restructure the activity patterns continuously. We found that dysfunction of a brain region called the LEC worsened the drift of the brain activity when rats repeatedly underwent the same events in the same room and made them behave as if they had never experienced these events before. Thus, the LEC stabilizes the brain activity to facilitate the recovery of the original memory trace. Failure of this process might underlie memory problems in elderly and Alzheimer's disease patients with the degenerated LEC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Task-Related Modulation of Sensorimotor GABA+ Levels in Association with Brain Activity and Motor Performance: A Multimodal MRS-fMRI Study in Young and Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent studies suggest an important role of the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA for motor performance in the context of aging. Nonetheless, as previous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies primarily reported resting-state GABA levels, much less is known about transient changes in GABA levels during motor task performance and how these relate to behavior and brain activity patterns. Therefore, we investigated GABA+ levels of left primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) acquired before, during, and after execution of a unimanual/bimanual action selection task in 30 (human) young adults (YA; age 24.5 &plusmn; 4.1, 15 male) and 30 older adults (OA; age 67.8 &plusmn; 4.9, 14 male). In addition to task-related MRS data, task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired. Behavioral results indicated lower motor performance in OA as opposed to YA, particularly in complex task conditions. MRS results demonstrated lower GABA+ levels in OA as compared with YA. Furthermore, a transient task-related decrease of GABA+ levels was observed, regardless of age. Notably, this task-induced modulation of GABA+ levels was linked to task-related brain activity patterns in SM1 such that a more profound task-induced instantaneous lowering of GABA+ was related to higher SM1 activity. Additionally, higher brain activity was related to better performance in the bimanual conditions, despite some age-related differences. Finally, the modulatory capacity of GABA+ was positively related to motor performance in OA but not YA. Together, these results underscore the importance of transient dynamical changes in neurochemical content for brain function and behavior, particularly in the context of aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Emerging evidence designates an important role to regional GABA levels in motor control, especially in the context of aging. However, it remains unclear whether changes in GABA levels emerge when executing a motor task and how these changes relate to brain activity patterns and performance. Here, we identified a transient decrease of sensorimotor GABA+ levels during performance of an action selection task across young adults (YA) and older adults (OA). Interestingly, whereas a more profound GABA+ modulation related to higher brain activity across age groups, its association with motor performance differed across age groups. Within OA, our results highlighted a functional merit of a task-related release from inhibitory tone, i.e. lowering regional GABA+ levels was associated with task-relevant brain activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sensory-Tactile Functional Mapping and Use-Associated Structural Variation of the Human Female Genital Representation Field</a></h4>

              
                <p>The precise location of the human female genital representation field in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is controversial and its capacity for use-associated structural variation as a function of sexual behavior remains unknown. We used a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-compatible sensory-tactile stimulation paradigm to functionally map the location of the female genital representation field in 20 adult women. Neural response to tactile stimulation of the clitoral region (vs right hand) identified individually-diverse focal bilateral activations in dorsolateral areas of S1 (BA1&ndash;BA3) in alignment with anatomic location. We next used cortical surface analyses to assess structural thickness across the 10 individually most activated vertices per hemisphere for each woman. We show that frequency of sexual intercourse within 12 months is correlated with structural thickness of the individually-mapped left genital field. Our results provide a precise functional localization of the female genital field and provide support for use-associated structural variation of the human genital cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We provide a precise location of the human female genital field in the somatosensory cortex and, for the first time, provide evidence in support of structural variation of the human genital field in association with frequency of genital contact. Our study represents a significant methodological advance by individually mapping genital fields for structural analyses. On a secondary level, our results suggest that any study investigating changes in the human genital field must map the field individually to achieve sufficient precision. Our results pave the way for future research into the plasticity of the human genital cortex as a function of normal or adverse experience as well as changes in pathologic conditions, i.e., sexual dysfunction, sexual deviation, or sexual risk-taking behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Representational Dynamics of Sequential Perceptual Averaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is clear that humans can extract statistical information from streams of visual input, yet how our brain processes sequential images into the abstract representation of the mean feature value remains poorly explored. Using multivariate pattern analyses of electroencephalography recorded while human observers viewed 10 sequentially presented Gabors of different orientations to estimate their mean orientation at the end, we investigated sequential averaging mechanism by tracking the quality of individual and mean orientation as a function of sequential position. Critically, we varied the sequential variance of Gabor orientations to understand the neural basis of perceptual mean errors occurring during a sequential averaging task. We found that the mean-orientation representation emerged at specific delays from each sequential stimulus onset and became increasingly accurate as additional Gabors were viewed. Especially in frontocentral electrodes, the neural representation of mean orientation improved more rapidly and to a greater degree in less volatile environments, whereas individual orientation information was encoded precisely regardless of environmental volatility. The computational analysis of behavioral data also showed that perceptual mean errors arise from the cumulative construction of the mean orientation rather than the low-level encoding of individual stimulus orientation. Thus, our findings provide neural mechanisms to differentially accumulate increasingly abstract features from a concrete piece of information across the cortical hierarchy depending on environmental volatility.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The visual system extracts behaviorally relevant summary statistical representation by exploiting statistical regularity of the visual stream over time. However, how the neural representation of the abstract mean feature value develops in a temporally changing environment remains poorly identified. Here, we directly recover the mean orientation information of sequentially delivered Gabor stimuli with different orientations as a function of their positions in time. The mean orientation representation, which is regularly updated, becomes increasingly accurate with increasing sequential position especially in the frontocentral region. Further, perceptual mean errors arise from the cumulative process rather than the low-level stimulus encoding. Overall, our study reveals a role of higher cortical areas in integrating stimulus-specific information into increasingly abstract task-oriented information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sex-Specific Regulation of {beta}-Secretase: A Novel Estrogen Response Element (ERE)-Dependent Mechanism in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Women have a higher prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) than age-matched men, and loss of estrogen might be partially responsible for the higher risk of AD in aged women. While &beta;-secretase (BACE1) plays an important role in AD pathogenesis, whether BACE1 involved the sex difference in AD pathology remains unclear. This study investigated the hypothesis that estrogen regulates BACE1 transcription via the estrogen response element (ERE) and designated pathways. Using estrogen receptor (ER) knock-out mice and mutagenesis of EREs in HEK293 cells, we demonstrated sex-specific inhibition of BACE1 transcription by estrogen via direct binding to ERE sites and ER&alpha;. We also used a repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA) and showed that an REA&ndash;ERE complex downregulated BACE1. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analysis determined that all three EREs at the BACE1 promoter were required for estradiol-mediated downregulation of BACE1 transcription in mice. Last, we confirmed the impairment of the REA pathway in the cortex of female AD patients. Our study identified an estrogen-specific BACE1 transcriptional regulation pathway from cell and animal models to AD patients.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> With the increase in the aging population and Alzheimer's disease worldwide, an urgent need to find effective approaches to treat or prevent AD. Women have a higher prevalence and incidence of AD than men. Identification of the sex-specific risk for AD may be valuable for disease prevention. This study evaluated several estrogen response element (ERE) sites on the promoter of &beta;-secretase (BACE1), a key enzyme for AD pathology. We demonstrated that estrogen downregulated BACE1 transcription through direct binding and complex formation with ERE and cofactors. Our novel findings provide evidence that an estrogen supplement may decrease the risk of AD in menopausal and postmenopausal women. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the "sex-specific" mechanisms of BACE1 as a role in AD pathogenesis.</p>

                Virulence is a complex mix of microbial traits and host susceptibility that could ultimately lead to disease. The increased prevalence of multidrug resistant infections complicates treatment options, augmenting the need for developing robust computational methods and pipelines that enable researchers and clinicians to rapidly identify the underlying mechanism(s) of virulence in any given sample/isolate. Consequently, the National Center for Biotechnology and Information at the National Institutes of Health hosted an in-person hackathon in Bethesda, Maryland during July 2019 to assist with developing cloud-based methods to reduce reliance on local computational infrastructure. Groups of attendees were assigned tasks that are relevant to identifying relevant tools, constructing pipelines capable of identifying microbial virulence factors, and managing the associated data and metadata. Specifically, the assigned tasks consisted of the following: data indexing, metabolic functions, virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance, mobile elements in enterococci, and metatranscriptomics. The cloud-based framework established by this hackathon can be augmented and built upon by the research community to aid in the rapid identification of microbial virulence factors.

                Introduction: Acne is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous unit with differential pathogenesis. To elucidate the roles of hormones in acne pathogenesis, we conducted a study to evaluate the serum testosterone, estradiol, progesterone levels in women with acne vulgaris. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study, and 175 women with acne vulgaris were examined; their serum estradiol, progesterone, testosterone were analyzed by chemiluminescence technique and compared with the healthy control group. Results: Increased serum hormone levels in women with acne vulgaris were accounted for 29.7%, and hyperandrogenism was accounted for 16.0% of cases. We found significant differences in testosterone levels (mean value, 55.67±25.56 versus 38.37±10.16 ng/dL, p<0.05) respectively in the acne group and the control group. However, the estradiol level of the acne group (323.15±93.31 pmol/L) was lower than the control group (370.94±58.88 pmol/L) with p<0.05). No statistically significant differences were found for progesterone (0.60±0.38 versus 0.50±0.15 ng/mL, p>0.05) levels. Moreover, we did not find the relationship between serum hormone levels and the severity of acne vulgaris. Conclusion: This study showed that the female acne vulgaris patients may have high serum testosterone levels and low serum estradiol levels compared with those of female controls. However, hormone alterations had no correlation with the acne grades.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of freeze-thaw cytoablation on aqueous outflow patterns in ex vivo anterior chamber perfusion cultures and whole eyes [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Porcine eyes have been widely used as ex vivo models in glaucoma research, as they share similar features with human eyes. Freeze-thawing is a non-invasive technique that has been used to obliterate living cells in anterior segment ex vivo cultures, to prepare them for further research such as cellular repopulation. This technique has previously been shown to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) in porcine eyes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether freeze-thaw cytoablation causes corresponding canalogram outflow changes in perfused anterior segment cultures (AFT) and whole porcine eyes (WFT). We hypothesized that the known IOP drop in AFT after trabecular meshwork ablation by freeze-thaw would be accompanied by a similarly large change in the distal outflow pattern. Methods: Two-dye (fluorescein and Texas red) reperfusion canalograms were used to compare the outflow time before and after two -80°C cycles of freeze-thaw. We assigned 28 freshly enucleated porcine eyes to four groups: perfused anterior segment dye controls (ACO, n = 6), perfused whole eye dye controls (WCO, n = 6), freeze-thaw treated anterior segment cultures (AFT, n = 10), and freeze-thaw treated whole eyes (WFT, n = 6). Results: In control groups ACO and WCO, the two different dyes had similar filling times. In AFT, the outflow pattern and filling times were unchanged. In WFT, the temporal superior quadrant filled more slowly (p = 0.042) while all others remained unchanged. The qualitative appearance of distal outflow spaces was altered only in some eyes. Conclusions: Freeze-thaw cytoablation caused neither loss nor leakage of distal outflow structures. Surprisingly, the loss of an intact trabecular meshwork over the entire circumference did not result in a general acceleration of quadrant outflow times. The results validate freeze-thawing as a method to generate an extracellular matrix without major structural changes.

The ability to aggregate experimental data analysis and results into a concise and interpretable format is a key step in evaluating the success of an experiment. This critical step determines baselines for reproducibility and is a key requirement for data dissemination. However, in practice it can be difficult to consolidate data analyses that encapsulates the broad range of datatypes available in the life sciences. We present STENCIL, a web templating engine designed to organize, visualize, and enable the sharing of interactive data visualizations. STENCIL leverages a flexible web framework for creating templates to render highly customizable visual front ends. This flexibility enables researchers to render small or large sets of experimental outcomes, producing high-quality downloadable and editable figures that retain their original relationship to the source data. REST API based back ends provide programmatic data access and supports easy data sharing. STENCIL is a lightweight tool that can stream data from Galaxy, a popular bioinformatic analysis web platform. STENCIL has been used to support the analysis and dissemination of two large scale genomic projects containing the complete data analysis for over 2,400 distinct datasets. Code and implementation details are available on GitHub: https://github.com/CEGRcode/stencil

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evaluating spatially adaptive guidelines for the treatment of gonorrhea to reduce the incidence of gonococcal infection and increase the effective lifespan of antibiotics</a></h4>

In the absence of point-of-care gonorrhea diagnostics that report antibiotic susceptibility, gonorrhea treatment is empiric and determined by standardized guidelines. These guidelines are informed by estimates of resistance prevalence from national surveillance systems. We examined whether guidelines informed by local, rather than national, surveillance data could reduce the incidence of gonorrhea and increase the effective lifespan of antibiotics used in treatment guidelines. We used a transmission dynamic model of gonorrhea among men who have sex with men (MSM) in 16 U.S. metropolitan areas to determine whether spatially adaptive treatment guidelines based on local estimates of resistance prevalence can extend the effective lifespan of hypothetical antibiotics. The rate of gonorrhea cases in these metropolitan areas was 5,548 cases per 100,000 MSM in 2017. Under the current strategy of updating the treatment guideline when the prevalence of resistance exceeds 5%, we showed that spatially adaptive guidelines could reduce the annual rate of gonorrhea cases by 200 cases (95% uncertainty interval: 169, 232) per 100,000 MSM population while extending the use of a first-line antibiotic by 0.75 (0.55, 0.95) years. One potential strategy to reduce the incidence of gonorrhea while extending the effective lifespan of antibiotics is to inform treatment guidelines based on local, rather than national, resistance prevalence.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Known allosteric proteins have central roles in genetic disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by György Abrusán, David B. Ascher, Michael Inouye</p>

Allostery is a form of protein regulation, where ligands that bind sites located apart from the active site can modify the activity of the protein. The molecular mechanisms of allostery have been extensively studied, because allosteric sites are less conserved than active sites, and drugs targeting them are more specific than drugs binding the active sites. Here we quantify the importance of allostery in genetic disease. We show that 1) known allosteric proteins are central in disease networks, contribute to genetic disease and comorbidities much more than non-allosteric proteins, and there is an association between being allosteric and involvement in disease; 2) they are enriched in many major disease types like hematopoietic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, or diseases of the central nervous system; 3) variants from cancer genome-wide association studies are enriched near allosteric proteins, indicating their importance to polygenic traits; and 4) the importance of allosteric proteins in disease is due, at least partly, to their central positions in protein-protein interaction networks, and less due to their dynamical properties.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">There are no equal opportunity infectors: Epidemiological modelers must rethink our approach to inequality in infection risk</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jon Zelner, Nina B. Masters, Ramya Naraharisetti, Sanyu A. Mojola, Merlin Chowkwanyun, Ryan Malosh</p>

Mathematical models have come to play a key role in global pandemic preparedness and outbreak response: helping to plan for disease burden, hospital capacity, and inform nonpharmaceutical interventions. Such models have played a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic, with transmission models—and, by consequence, modelers—guiding global, national, and local responses to SARS-CoV-2. However, these models have largely not accounted for the social and structural factors, which lead to socioeconomic, racial, and geographic health disparities. In this piece, we raise and attempt to clarify several questions relating to this important gap in the research and practice of infectious disease modeling: Why do epidemiologic models of emerging infections typically ignore known structural drivers of disparate health outcomes? What have been the consequences of a framework focused primarily on aggregate outcomes on infection equity? What should be done to develop a more holistic approach to modeling-based decision-making during pandemics? In this review, we evaluate potential historical and political explanations for the exclusion of drivers of disparity in infectious disease models for emerging infections, which have often been characterized as “equal opportunity infectors” despite ample evidence to the contrary. We look to examples from other disease systems (HIV, STIs) and successes in including social inequity in models of acute infection transmission as a blueprint for how social connections, environmental, and structural factors can be integrated into a coherent, rigorous, and interpretable modeling framework. We conclude by outlining principles to guide modeling of emerging infections in ways that represent the causes of inequity in infection as central rather than peripheral mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sparse balance: Excitatory-inhibitory networks with small bias currents and broadly distributed synaptic weights</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ramin Khajeh, Francesco Fumarola, LF Abbott</p>

Cortical circuits generate excitatory currents that must be cancelled by strong inhibition to assure stability. The resulting excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance can generate spontaneous irregular activity but, in standard balanced E-I models, this requires that an extremely strong feedforward bias current be included along with the recurrent excitation and inhibition. The absence of experimental evidence for such large bias currents inspired us to examine an alternative regime that exhibits asynchronous activity without requiring unrealistically large feedforward input. In these networks, irregular spontaneous activity is supported by a continually changing sparse set of neurons. To support this activity, synaptic strengths must be drawn from high-variance distributions. Unlike standard balanced networks, these sparse balance networks exhibit robust nonlinear responses to uniform inputs and non-Gaussian input statistics. Interestingly, the speed, not the size, of synaptic fluctuations dictates the degree of sparsity in the model. In addition to simulations, we provide a mean-field analysis to illustrate the properties of these networks.

     alt="Comparison of prefrontal cortex sucrose seeking ensembles engaged in multiple seeking sessions: Context is key"/>
<p>TetTag mice self-administered sucrose, then underwent two seeking sessions either in the same or distinct environments. Reactivation of a prelimbic cortex ensemble tagged during the first seeking session shifted from being proportional to operant responding (cue reactivity) in the same context to goal directed (sucrose retrieval responding) in the distinct context.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Encoding of memories, including those associated with prior drug or reward, is thought to take place within distinct populations of neurons, termed ensembles. Neuronal ensembles for drug- and reward-seeking have been identified in regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, but much of our understanding of these ensembles is based on experiments that take place in a single reward-associated environment and measure ensemble encoding over short durations of time. In contrast, reward seeking behavior is evident across different reward-associated environments and persists over time. Using TetTag mice and Fos immunohistochemistry, we examined the relationship between persistent sucrose-seeking and ensemble encoding in mice that undergo seeking sessions in the same or different sucrose self-administration contexts 2 weeks apart. We found that prelimbic (PrL) and anterior cingulate cortex ensembles tagged in the first seeking session were highly sensitive to the context in which a second seeking session took place: reactivation of these ensembles was reduced in the same context but elevated in a distinct sucrose self-administration context. Correlational analyses revealed that ensemble reactivation in the PrL was proportional to the persistence of sucrose seeking behavior across sessions in differing ways in female mice. In the same context, reactivation was proportional to the persistence of non-reinforced operant responses, whereas in a distinct context, reactivation was proportional to the persistence of non-reinforced head entries into the sucrose receptacle. This study underlines the importance of the medial prefrontal cortex importance in maintaining a reward-seeking ensemble over time and identifies context-dependent changes in behavioral correlates of ensemble reactivation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the last years, new evidence has increased the attention on sex differences in the development of children with cerebral palsy (CP). Males seem to present with a higher risk for severe motor impairment and in the response to chirurgical and rehabilitative interventions. The published data confirmed a higher incidence of CP in males than in females. The aim of this literature review was to evaluate the impact of the sex on the most important areas that characterized CP: motor function, comorbidities (pain, cognitive impairment, communications skills, epilepsy, sleep, and behavior), and the different kind of interventions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">B Cell Depletion and SARS‐CoV‐2 Vaccine Responses in Neuroimmunologic Patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The study was undertaken to assess the impact of B cell depletion on humoral and cellular immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in patients with various neuroimmunologic disorders on anti-CD20 therapy. This included an analysis of the T cell vaccine response to the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated prospectively humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in 82 patients with neuroimmunologic disorders on anti-CD20 therapy and 82 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. For quantification of antibodies, the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) immunoassay against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) was used. IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays were performed to assess T cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and the Delta variant.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were found less frequently in patients (70% [57/82]) compared with controls (82/82 [100%], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In patients without detectable B cells (&lt;1 B cell/mcl), seroconversion rates and antibody levels were lower compared to nondepleted (≥1 B cell/mcl) patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). B cell levels ≥1 cell/mcl were sufficient to induce seroconversion in our cohort of anti-CD20 treated patients. In contrast to the antibody response, the T-cell response against the Wuhan strain and the Delta variant was more pronounced in frequency (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and magnitude (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) in B-cell depleted compared to nondepleted patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinnation can be attained in patients on anti-CD20 therapy by the onset of B cell repopulation. In the absence of B cells, a strong T cell response is generated which may help to protect against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this high-risk population.

                Jia et al. use simultaneous Neuropixels recordings from six levels of the mouse visual cortical hierarchy to generate cellular-scale, directed graphs of network interactions during sensory stimulation. Unsupervised clustering of functional connections uncovers distinct network modules that span hierarchical levels and engage in feedforward and recurrent processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fibroblast mechanotransduction network predicts targets for mechano-adaptive infarct therapies</a></h4>

              
                Regional control of fibrosis after myocardial infarction is critical for maintaining structural integrity in the infarct while preventing collagen accumulation in non-infarcted areas. Cardiac fibroblasts modulate matrix turnover in response to biochemical and biomechanical cues, but the complex interactions between signaling pathways confounds efforts to develop therapies for regional scar formation. We employed a logic-based ordinary differential equation model of fibroblast mechano-chemo signal transduction to predict matrix protein expression in response to canonical biochemical stimuli and mechanical tension. Functional analysis of mechano-chemo interactions showed extensive pathway crosstalk with tension amplifying, dampening, or reversing responses to biochemical stimuli. Comprehensive drug target screens identified 13 mechano-adaptive therapies that promote matrix accumulation in regions where it is needed and reduce matrix levels in regions where it is not needed. Our predictions suggest that mechano-chemo interactions likely mediate cell behavior across many tissues and demonstrate the utility of multi-pathway signaling networks in discovering therapies for context-specific disease states.

                Targeting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions may halt the pathogenesis of obesity and thereby reduce the prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular disesases, and cancers. The present study was designed to elucidate the mechnaisms by which plant-derived celastrol ameliorated inflammation and lipid accumulation in obesity. The mouse model of diet-induced obesity was induced by feeding high-fat diet for 3 months and subsequently intervented with celastrol for 21 days. Hepatic and adipose tissues were analyzed for lipid accumulation, macrophage activation, and biomarker expression. As result, celastrol effectively reduced body weight, suppressed ER stress, inflammation, and lipogenesis while promoted hepatic lipolysis. RNA-sequencing revealed that celastrol-loaded nanomicelles restored the expression of 49 genes that regulate ER stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism. On the other hand, celastrol-PEG4-alkyne was synthesized for identifying celastrol-bound proteins in RAW264.7 macrophages. ER chaperone GRP78 (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein) was identified by proteomics approach for celastrol binding to the residue Cys<sup>41</sup>. Upon binding and conjugation, celastrol diminished the chaperone activity of GRP78 by 130-fold and reduced ER stress in palmitate-challenged cells, while celastrol analog lacking quinone methide failed to exhibit antiobesity effects. Thus, covalent GRP78 inhibition may induce the reprograming of ER signaling, inflammation, and metabolism against diet-induced obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A homeostatic interferon-lambda response to bacterial microbiota stimulates preemptive antiviral defense within discrete pockets of intestinal epithelium</a></h4>

              
                Interferon-lambda (IFN-λ) protects intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from enteric viruses by inducing expression of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we find that bacterial microbiota stimulate a homeostatic ISG signature in the intestine of specific pathogen-free mice. This homeostatic ISG expression is restricted to IECs, depends on IEC-intrinsic expression of IFN-λ receptor (<i>Ifnlr1</i>), and is associated with IFN-λ production by leukocytes. Strikingly, imaging of these homeostatic ISGs reveals localization to pockets of the epithelium and concentration in mature IECs. Correspondingly, a minority of mature IECs express these ISGs in public single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from mice and humans. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of orally-administered bacterial components to restore localized ISGs in mice lacking bacterial microbiota. Lastly, we find that IECs lacking <i>Ifnlr1</i> are hyper-susceptible to initiation of murine rotavirus infection. These observations indicate that bacterial microbiota stimulate ISGs in localized regions of the intestinal epithelium at homeostasis, thereby preemptively activating antiviral defenses in vulnerable IECs to improve host defense against enteric viruses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">KIF2C regulates synaptic plasticity and cognition in mice through dynamic microtubule depolymerization</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic microtubules play a critical role in cell structure and function. In nervous system, microtubules are the major route for cargo protein trafficking and they specially extend into and out of synapses to regulate synaptic development and plasticity. However, the detailed depolymerization mechanism that regulates dynamic microtubules in synapses and dendrites is still unclear. In this study, we find that KIF2C, a dynamic microtubule depolymerization protein without known function in the nervous system, plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional plasticity of synapses and regulates cognitive function in mice. Through its microtubule depolymerization capability, KIF2C regulates microtubule dynamics in dendrites, and regulates microtubule invasion of spines in neurons in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. Using RNAi knockdown and conditional knockout approaches, we showed that KIF2C regulates spine morphology and synaptic membrane expression of AMPA receptors. Moreover, KIF2C deficiency leads to impaired excitatory transmission, long-term potentiation, and altered cognitive behaviors in mice. Collectively, our study explores a novel function of KIF2C in the nervous system and provides an important regulatory mechanism on how activity-dependent microtubule dynamic regulates synaptic plasticity and cognition behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Heparan sulfate-dependent RAGE oligomerization is indispensable for pathophysiological functions of RAGE</a></h4>

              
                RAGE, a druggable inflammatory receptor, is known to function as an oligomer but the exact oligomerization mechanism remains poorly understood. Previously we have shown that heparan sulfate (HS) plays an active role in RAGE oligomerization. To understand the physiological significance of HS-induced RAGE oligomerization <i>in vivo</i>, we generated RAGE knock-in mice (<i>Ager</i><sup>AHA/AHA</sup>) by introducing point mutations to specifically disrupt HS-RAGE interaction. The RAGE mutant demonstrated normal ligand-binding but impaired capacity of HS-binding and oligomerization. Remarkably, <i>Ager</i><sup>AHA/AHA </sup>mice phenocopied <i>Ager</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice in two different pathophysiological processes, namely bone remodeling and neutrophil-mediated liver injury, which demonstrates that HS-induced RAGE oligomerization is essential for RAGE signaling. Our findings suggest that it should be possible to block RAGE signaling by inhibiting HS-RAGE interaction. To test this, we generated a monoclonal antibody that targets the HS-binding site of RAGE. This antibody blocks RAGE signaling <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, recapitulating the phenotype of <i>Ager</i><sup>AHA/AHA </sup>mice. By inhibiting HS-RAGE interaction genetically and pharmacologically, our work validated an alternative strategy to antagonize RAGE. Finally, we have performed RNA-seq analysis of neutrophils and lungs and found that while <i>Ager</i><sup> -/-</sup> mice had a broad alteration of transcriptome in both tissues compared to wild-type mice, the changes of transcriptome in <i>Ager</i><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice were much more restricted. This unexpected finding suggests that by preserving the expression of RAGE protein (in a dominant-negative form), <i>Ager</i><sup>AHA/AHA </sup>mouse might represent a cleaner genetic model to study physiological roles of RAGE <i>in vivo</i> compared to <i>Ager</i><sup> -/-</sup> mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ribonucleotide reductase, a novel drug target for gonorrhea</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotic resistant <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng)</i> are an emerging public health threat due to increasing numbers of multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms. We identified two novel orally active inhibitors, PTC-847 and PTC-672, that exhibit a narrow spectrum of activity against <i>Ng</i> including MDR isolates. By selecting organisms resistant to the novel inhibitors and sequencing their genomes, we identified a new therapeutic target, the class Ia ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Resistance mutations in <i>Ng</i> map to the N-terminal cone domain of the α subunit, which we show here is involved in forming an inhibited a<sub>4</sub>b<sub>4</sub> state in the presence of the b subunit and allosteric effector dATP. Enzyme assays confirm that PTC-847 and PTC-672 inhibit <i>Ng</i> RNR and reveal that allosteric effector dATP potentiates the inhibitory effect. Oral administration of PTC-672 reduces <i>Ng</i> infection in a mouse model and may have therapeutic potential for treatment of <i>Ng</i> that is resistant to current drugs.

                Angioblasts that form the major axial blood vessels of the dorsal aorta and cardinal vein migrate towards the embryonic midline from distant lateral positions. Little is known about what controls the precise timing of angioblast migration and their final destination at the midline. Using zebrafish, we found that midline angioblast migration requires neighboring tissue rearrangements generated by somite morphogenesis. The somitic shape changes cause the adjacent notochord to separate from the underlying endoderm, creating a ventral midline cavity that provides a physical space for the angioblasts to migrate into. The anterior to posterior progression of midline angioblast migration is facilitated by retinoic acid induced anterior to posterior somite maturation and the subsequent progressive opening of the ventral midline cavity. Our work demonstrates a critical role for somite morphogenesis in organizing surrounding tissues to facilitate notochord positioning and angioblast migration, which is ultimately responsible for creating a functional cardiovascular system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inference of the SARS-CoV-2 generation time using UK household data</a></h4>

              
                The distribution of the generation time (the interval between individuals becoming infected and transmitting the virus) characterises changes in the transmission risk during SARS-CoV-2 infections. Inferring the generation time distribution is essential to plan and assess public health measures. We previously developed a mechanistic approach for estimating the generation time, which provided an improved fit to data from the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019-March 2020) compared to existing models (Hart et al., 2021). However, few estimates of the generation time exist based on data from later in the pandemic. Here, using data from a household study conducted from March-November 2020 in the UK, we provide updated estimates of the generation time. We considered both a commonly used approach in which the transmission risk is assumed to be independent of when symptoms develop, and our mechanistic model in which transmission and symptoms are linked explicitly. Assuming independent transmission and symptoms, we estimated a mean generation time (4.2 days, 95% credible interval 3.3-5.3 days) similar to previous estimates from other countries, but with a higher standard deviation (4.9 days, 3.0-8.3 days). Using our mechanistic approach, we estimated a longer mean generation time (5.9 days, 5.2-7.0 days) and a similar standard deviation (4.8 days, 4.0-6.3 days). As well as estimating the generation time using data from the entire study period, we also considered whether the generation time varied temporally. Both models suggest a shorter mean generation time in September-November 2020 compared to earlier months. Since the SARS-CoV-2 generation time appears to be changing, further data collection and analysis is necessary to continue to monitor ongoing transmission and inform future public health policy decisions.

                The decarboxylation of pyruvate is a central reaction in the carbon metabolism of all organisms. It is catalyzed by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Whereas PFOR reduces ferredoxin, the PDH complex utilizes NAD<sup>+</sup>. Anaerobes rely on PFOR, which was replaced during evolution by the PDH complex found in aerobes. Cyanobacteria possess both enzyme systems. Our data challenge the view that PFOR is exclusively utilized for fermentation. Instead, we show, that the cyanobacterial PFOR is stable in the presence of oxygen <i>in vitro</i> and is required for optimal photomixotrophic growth under aerobic and highly reducing conditions while the PDH complex is inactivated. We found that cells rely on a general shift from utilizing NAD(H)-dependent to ferredoxin-dependent enzymes under these conditions. The utilization of ferredoxins instead of NAD(H) saves a greater share of the Gibbs free energy, instead of wasting it as heat. This obviously simultaneously decelerates metabolic reactions as they operate closer to their thermodynamic equilibrium. It is common thought that during evolution, ferredoxins were replaced by NAD(P)H due to their higher stability in an oxidizing atmosphere. However, utilization of NAD(P)H could also have been favored due to a higher competitiveness because of an accelerated metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NMNAT2 is the major NAD+ provider for vesicular glycolysis generating on-board energy for fast axonal transport cargos</a></h4>

              
                Axonal transport, an ATP demanding process, plays a critical role in maintaining axonal and neuronal health. ATP in neurons is synthesized by glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, both driven by proper NAD+/NADH redox potentials. NMNAT2 is the major neuronal NAD+ synthesizing enzyme and is a key axonal maintenance factor. Here, we show that NMNAT2 co-migrates with fast vesicular cargos in axons and is required for fast axonal transport in the distal axons of cortical neurons. Using SoNar sensor imaging to detect axonal NAD+ and NADH, we show that NMNAT2 is critical in maintaining NAD+/NADH potentials in distal axons. With Syn-ATP sensor imaging to detect synaptic vesicle ATP levels (sv-ATP), we demonstrate that glycolysis is the major provider of sv-ATP and NMNAT2 deletion significantly reduces sv-ATP levels. NAD+ supplementation to NMNAT2 KO neurons restores sv-ATP levels and fast axonal transports in a glycolysis-dependent manner. Together, these data show that NMNAT2 maintains the local NAD+/NADH redox potential and sustains on-board glycolysis to meet the bioenergetic demands of fast vesicular transport in distal axons. Intriguingly, mitochondrial respiration contributes significantly to sv-ATP levels in NMNAT2 KO axons. This finding suggests that NMNAT2 deletion induces metabolic plasticity by engaging mitochondria. Surprisingly, supplying NMN, the substrate for NMNAT2 in NAD+ synthesis, restores sv-ATP and axonal transport in NMNAT2 KO axons with an efficacy similar to NAD+. The restoration of NMNAT2 KO distal axonal sv-ATP levels and vesicle transport by NMN requires mitochondrial respiration, while the rescue by NAD+ is independent of mitochondrial respiration. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that NMN rescues glycolysis to restore axonal transport in NMNAT2 KO axons by taking advantage of the compensatory ATP-generating metabolic pathways triggered by NMNAT2 loss.

                Critical details remain unresolved about the organization of the human auditory cortical hierarchy and its relationship to higher order brain networks. We investigated this organization using diffusion map embedding (DME) applied to resting state intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) obtained in neurosurgical patients. DME was applied to functional connectivity measured between regions of interest (ROIs). ROIs exhibited a hierarchical organization, symmetric between the two hemispheres and robust to the choice of iEEG frequency band, connectivity metric, and imaging modality. Tight clusters of canonical auditory and prefrontal ROIs were maximally segregated in embedding space. Clusters consistent with ventral and dorsal auditory processing streams were paralleled by a cluster suggestive of a third stream linking auditory and limbic structures. Portions of anterior temporal cortex were characterized as global hubs. This approach lays the foundation for elucidating network changes underlying transitions of arousal state, disorders of consciousness, and during active speech and language processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anatomical connectivity profile development constrains medial-lateral topography in the dorsal prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a highly variable, evolutionarily expanded brain region that is engaged in multiple cognitive processes. The subregions of the PFC mature relatively late compared with other brain regions, and the maturation times vary between these subregions. Among these, the dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dmPFC and dlPFC) share a parallel topographic pattern of functional connectivity, while participating in different types of complex behaviors. However, the developmental trajectories of the two areas remain obscure. In this study, we uncovered differences in the developmental trends of the dmPFC and dlPFC. These differences were mainly caused by structural and functional changes in the medial area of the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). The developmentally different arealization patterns were verified using multiple parcellation approaches with multimodal data, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), resting state functional MRI (rfMRI), and a publicly available transcriptomic dataset. Human brain gene expression data was also used to perform downstream analyses, which could inform us about the potential biological mechanisms underlying the developmentally different arealizations. Furthermore, behavioral analyses hinted at the effects of regionalization on ontogeny. In brief, this study revealed a tendency toward a medial-lateral prefrontal division and can provide a fuller understanding of the potential underlying genetic underpinnings as well as of the potential effects on developmental behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pairing-dependent plasticity in a dissected fly brain is input-specific and requires synaptic CaMKII enrichment and nighttime sleep</a></h4>

              
                In Drosophila, in vivo functional imaging studies revealed that associative memory formation is coupled to a cascade of neural plasticity events in distinct compartments of the mushroom body (MB). In-depth investigation of the circuit dynamics, however, will require an ex vivo model that faithfully mirrors these events to allow direct manipulations of circuit elements that are inaccessible in the intact fly. The current ex vivo models have been able to reproduce the fundamental plasticity of aversive short-term memory, a potentiation of the MB intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells; KCs) responses after artificial learning ex vivo. However, this potentiation showed different localization and encoding properties from those reported in vivo and failed to generate the previously reported suppression plasticity in the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs). Here, we develop an ex vivo model that recapitulates behaviorally evoked plasticity in the KCs and MBONs. We demonstrate that this plasticity accurately localizes to the MB '3 compartment and is encoded by a coincidence between KCs activation and dopaminergic input. The formed plasticity is input-specific, requiring pairing of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) pathways; hence we name it pairing-dependent plasticity (PDP). PDP formation requires an intact CaMKII gene and is blocked by previous-night sleep deprivation but is rescued by rebound sleep. In conclusion, we show that our ex vivo preparation recapitulates behavioral and imaging results from intact animals and can provide new insights into mechanisms of memory formation at the level of molecules, circuits, and brain state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Medullary kappa-opioid receptor neurons inhibit pain and itch through a descending circuit</a></h4>

              
                In perilous and stressful situations, the ability to suppress pain can be critical for survival. The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) contains neurons that robustly inhibit nociception at the level of the spinal cord through a top-down modulatory pathway. Although much is known about the role of the RVM in the inhibition of pain, the precise ability to directly manipulate pain-inhibitory neurons in the RVM has never been achieved. We now expose a cellular circuit that inhibits nociception and itch in mice. Through a combination of molecular, tracing, and behavioral approaches, we found that RVM neurons containing the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) inhibit itch and nociception. With chemogenetic inhibition, we uncovered that these neurons are required for stress-induced analgesia. Using intersectional chemogenetic and pharmacological approaches, we determined that RVMKOR neurons inhibit nociception and itch through a descending circuit. Lastly, we identified a dynorphinergic pathway arising from the periaqueductal gray (PAG) that modulates nociception within the RVM. These discoveries highlight a distinct population of RVM neurons capable of broadly and robustly inhibiting itch and nociception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ascending neurons convey behavioral state to integrative sensory and action selection centers in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge of one's own behavioral state---whether one is walking, grooming, or resting---is critical for contextualizing sensory cues including interpreting visual motion and tracking odor sources. Additionally, awareness of one's own posture is important to avoid initiating destabilizing or physically impossible actions. Ascending neurons (ANs), interneurons in the vertebrate spinal cord or insect ventral nerve cord (VNC) that project to the brain, may provide such high-fidelity behavioral state signals. However, little is known about what ANs encode and where they convey signals in any brain. To address this gap, we performed a large-scale functional screen of AN movement encoding, brain targeting, and motor system patterning in the adult fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Using a new library of AN sparse driver lines, we measured the functional properties of 247 genetically-identifiable ANs by performing two-photon microscopy recordings of neural activity in tethered, behaving flies. Quantitative, deep network-based neural and behavioral analyses revealed that ANs nearly exclusively encode high-level behaviors---primarily walking as well as resting and grooming---rather than low-level joint or limb movements. ANs that convey self-motion---resting, walking, and responses to gust-like puff stimuli---project to the brain's anterior ventrolateral protocerebrum (AVLP), a multimodal, integrative sensory hub, while those that encode discrete actions---eye grooming, turning, and proboscis extension---project to the brain's gnathal ganglion (GNG), a locus for action selection. The structure and polarity of AN projections within the VNC are predictive of their functional encoding and imply that ANs participate in motor computations while also relaying state signals to the brain. Illustrative of this are ANs that temporally integrate proboscis extensions over tens-of-seconds, likely through recurrent interconnectivity. Thus, in line with long-held theoretical predictions, ascending populations convey high-level behavioral state signals almost exclusively to brain regions implicated in sensory feature contextualization and action selection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All-optical manipulation of the Drosophila olfactory system.</a></h4>

              
                Thanks to its well-known neuroanatomy, limited brain size, complex behaviour, and extensive genetic methods, Drosophila has become an indispensable model in neuroscience. A vast number of studies have focused on its olfactory system and the processing of odour information. Optogenetics is one of the recently developed genetic tools that significantly advance this field of research, allowing to replace odour stimuli by direct neuronal activation with light. This becomes a universal all-optical toolkit when spatially selective optogenetic activation is combined with calcium imaging to read out neuronal responses. Initial experiments showed a successful implementation to study the olfactory system in fish and mice, but the olfactory system of Drosophila has been so far precluded from an application. To fill this gap, we present here optogenetic tools to selectively stimulate functional units in the Drosophila olfactory system, combined with two-photon calcium imaging to read out the activity patterns elicited by these stimuli at different levels of the brain. This method allows to study the spatial and temporal features of the information flow and reveals the functional connectivity in the olfactory network.

                Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a heterogeneous group of blinding disorders, which result in dysfunction or death of the light-sensing cone and rod photoreceptors. Despite individual IRDs being rare, collectively, they affect up to 1:2000 people worldwide, causing a significant socioeconomic burden, especially when cone-mediated central vision is affected. This study uses the Pde6ccpfl1 mouse model of achromatopsia, a cone-specific vision loss IRD, to investigate the potential gene-independent therapeutic benefits of a histone demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 on cone cell survival. We investigated the effects of GSK-J4 treatment on cone cell survival in vivo and ex vivo and changes in cone-specific gene expression via single-cell RNA sequencing. A single intravitreal GSK-J4 injection led to transcriptional changes in pathways involved in mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, among other key epigenetic pathways, highlighting the complex interplay between methylation and acetylation in healthy and diseased cones. Furthermore, continuous administration of GSK-J4 in retinal explants increased cone survival. Our results suggest that IRD-affected cones respond positively to epigenetic modulation of histones, indicating the potential of this approach in the development of a broad class of novel therapies to slow cone degeneration.

                Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of autism-like symptoms that include sensory hypersensitivity and cortical hyperexcitability. Recent observations in humans and Fmr1 knockout (KO) animal models of FXS suggest abnormal GABAergic signaling. As most studies focused on neuron-centered mechanisms, astrocytes contribution to abnormal inhibition is largely unknown. Here we propose a non-neuronal mechanism of abnormal inhibitory circuit development in FXS. Astrocyte-specific deletion of Fmr1 during postnatal period leads to increased astrocytic GABA levels, but negatively impacts synaptic GABAA receptors and parvalbumin (PV) cell development. Developmental deletion of Fmr1 from astrocytes also affects communications between excitatory neurons and PV cells, impairing sound-evoked gamma synchronization in the cortex, while enhancing baseline and on-going sound-evoked EEG power, and leading to increased locomotor activity and altered social behaviors in adult mice. These results demonstrate a profound role of astrocytic FMRP in the development of inhibitory circuits and shaping normal inhibitory responses.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, multi-factorial neurodegenerative disease, known to involve genetic, aging-related components, but also to be highly sensitive to environmental factors. In particular, ample evidence links pesticides to PD etiology. Here, establishing a field-to-bench paradigm, we have combined record-based exposure assessment in a population-based epidemiologic study of PD with testing in dopaminergic neurons produced from iPSCs to further identify and classify PD-relevant pesticides. First, agricultural pesticide-application records in California enabled us to investigate exposure to nearly 300 specific pesticides and PD risk in a comprehensive, pesticide-wide association study (PWAS). We implicated long-term exposure to 53 pesticide active ingredients in PD risk and identified their relevant co-exposure profiles. Second, to identify which of these pesticides might contribute to PD through direct effects on dopaminergic neurons, we employed a live-cell imaging screening paradigm in which neurons, definitively identified with a tyrosine hydroxylase reporter, were exposed to 43 of the high-risk pesticides. Using detailed morphometric measures, we found 10 pesticides were directly toxic to these neurons. Further, we analyzed pesticides typically used in combinations in cotton farming. Among these "cotton cluster" pesticides, co-exposures resulted in markedly greater toxicity than any single pesticide. Trifluralin was a pivotal driver of toxicity to dopaminergic neurons and led to marked mitochondrial dysfunction. Our field-to-bench paradigm may prove useful to mechanistically dissect pesticide exposure implicated in PD risk, and guide agricultural policy in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Creativity in Verbal Associations is Linked to Semantic Control</a></h4>

              
                While memory is known to play a key role in creativity, previous studies have not isolated the critical component processes and networks. We asked participants to generate links between words that ranged from strongly related to completely unrelated in long-term memory, delineating the neurocognitive processes that underpin more unique versus stereotypical patterns of retrieval. Less creative responses to strongly associated word pairs were associated with greater engagement of episodic memory: in highly familiar situations, semantic and episodic stores converge on the same information. This pattern of retrieval was associated with greater engagement of core default mode network. In contrast, more creative responses to weakly associated word pairs were associated with the controlled retrieval of less dominant semantic information and greater recruitment of the semantic control network, which overlaps with the dorsomedial subsystem of default mode network. Consequently, although both creative/controlled and stereotypical/more automatic patterns of retrieval are associated with activation within default mode network, these processes show little overlap in activation. These findings show that creativity emerges from controlled aspects of semantic cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Capacity and tradeoffs in neural encoding of concurrent speech during Selective and Distributed Attention</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension is severely compromised when several people talk at once, due to limited perceptual and cognitive resources. Under some circumstances listeners can employ top-down attention to prioritize the processing of task-relevant speech. However, whether the system can effectively represent more than one speech input remains highly debated. Here we studied how task-relevance affects the neural representation of concurrent speakers under two extreme conditions: when only one speaker was task-relevant (Selective Attention), vs. when two speakers were equally relevant (Distributed Attention). Neural activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and we analysed the speech-tracking responses to both speakers. Crucially, we explored different hypotheses as to how the brain may have represented the two speech streams, without making a-priori assumptions regarding participants' internal allocation of attention. Results indicate that neural tracking of concurrent speech did not fully mirror their instructed task-relevance. When Distributed Attention was required, we observed a tradeoff between the two speakers despite their equal task-relevance, akin to the top-down modulation observed during Selective Attention. This points to the system's inherent limitation to fully process two speech streams, and highlights the complex nature of attention, particularly for continuous speech.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Fast And Intuitive Method For Calculating Dynamic Network Reconfiguration And Node Flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic interactions between brain regions, either during rest or performance of cognitive tasks, have been studied extensively using a wide variance of methods. Although some of these methods allow elegant mathematical interpretations of the data, they can easily become computationally expensive or difficult to interpret and compare between subjects or groups. Here, we propose an intuitive and computationally efficient method to measure dynamic reconfiguration of brain regions, also termed flexibility. Our flexibility measure is defined in relation to an a-priori set of biologically plausible brain modules (or networks) and does not rely on a stochastic data-driven module estimation, which, in turn, minimizes computational burden. The change of affiliation of brain regions over time with respect to these a-priori template modules is used as an indicator of brain network flexibility. We demonstrate that our proposed method yields highly similar patterns of whole-brain network reconfiguration (i.e., flexibility) during a working memory task as compared to a previous study that uses a data-driven, but computationally more expensive method. This result illustrates that the use of a fixed modular framework allows for valid, yet more efficient estimation of whole-brain flexibility, while the method additionally supports more fine-grained flexibility analyses restricted to biologically plausible brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A mitochondrial blood-based patient stratification candidate biomarker for Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and neuroprotective interventions remain elusive. High throughput biomarkers aimed to stratify patients based on shared etiology is one critical path to the success of disease-modifying therapies in clinical trials. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of PD. Previously, we found brain region-specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage accumulation in neuronal and in vivo PD models, as well as human PD postmortem brain tissue. In this study, to investigate mtDNA damage as a potential blood biomarker for PD, we describe a novel Mito DNADX assay that allows for the accurate real-time quantification of mtDNA damage in a 96-well platform, compatible with assessing large cohorts of patient samples. We found that levels of mtDNA damage were increased in blood derived from early-stage idiopathic PD patients or those harboring the pathogenic LRRK2 G2019S mutation compared to age-matched healthy controls. Given that increased mtDNA damage was also found in non-manifesting LRRK2 mutation carriers, mtDNA damage may begin to accumulate prior to a clinical PD diagnosis. LRRK2 kinase inhibition mitigated mtDNA damage in idiopathic PD models and patient-derived cells. The latter observations further substantiate a mechanistic role for wild-type LRRK2 kinase activity in idiopathic PD and support mtDNA damage reversal as a suitable approach to slow PD-related pathology. In light of recent advances in the field of precision medicine, the analysis of mtDNA damage as a blood-based patient stratification biomarker should be included in future clinical trials.

	<p>In Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients, the progressive nature of the disease and the variability of disabling motor and nonmotor symptoms contribute to the growing caregiver burden of PD partners and conflicts in their relationships. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves PD symptoms and patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life but necessitates an intensified therapy optimization after DBS surgery. This review illuminates caregiver burden in the context of deep brain stimulation, framing both pre- and postoperative aspects. We aim to provide an overview of perioperative factors influencing caregiver burden and wish to stimulate further recognition of caregiver burden of PD patients with DBS.</p>

	<p>Although 20% of the world&amp;amp;rsquo;s suicides occur in India, suicide prevention efforts in India are lagging (Vijayakumar et al., 2021). Identification of risk factors for suicide in India, as well as the development of accessible interventions to treat these risk factors, could help reduce suicide in India. Interoceptive dysfunction&amp;amp;mdash;or an inability to recognize internal sensations in the body&amp;amp;mdash;has emerged as a robust correlate of suicidality among studies conducted in the United States. Additionally, a mindfulness-informed intervention designed to reduce interoceptive dysfunction, and thereby suicidality, has yielded promising initial effects in pilot testing (Smith et al., 2021). The current studies sought to replicate these findings in an Indian context. Study 1 (n = 276) found that specific aspects of interoceptive dysfunction were related to current, past, and future likelihood of suicidal ideation. Study 2 (n = 40) was a small, uncontrolled pre-post online pilot of the intervention, Reconnecting to Internal Sensations and Experiences (RISE). The intervention was rated as highly acceptable and demonstrated good retention. Additionally, the intervention was associated with improvements in certain aspects of interoceptive dysfunction and reductions in suicidal ideation and eating pathology. These preliminary results suggest further testing of the intervention among Indian samples is warranted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Molecular ontology of the parabrachial nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Diverse neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PB) communicate with widespread brain regions. Despite evidence linking them to a variety of homeostatic functions, it remains difficult to determine which PB neurons influence which functions because their subpopulations intermingle extensively. An improved framework for identifying these intermingled subpopulations would help advance our understanding of neural circuit functions linked to this region. Here, we present the foundation of a developmental-genetic ontology that classifies PB neurons based on their intrinsic, molecular features. By combining transcription factor labeling with Cre fate-mapping, we find that the PB is a blend of two, developmentally distinct macropopulations of glutamatergic neurons. Neurons in the first macropopulation express <i>Lmx1b</i> (and, to a lesser extent, <i>Lmx1a</i>) and are mutually exclusive with those in a second macropopulation, which derive from precursors expressing <i>Atoh1</i>. This second, <i>Atoh1</i>-derived macropopulation includes many <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing neurons, but <i>Foxp2</i> also identifies a subset of <i>Lmx1b</i>-expressing neurons in the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) and a population of GABAergic neurons ventrolateral to the PB (“caudal KF”). Immediately ventral to the PB, <i>Phox2b</i>-expressing glutamatergic neurons (some co-expressing <i>Lmx1b</i>) occupy the KF, supratrigeminal nucleus, and reticular formation. We show that this molecular framework organizes subsidiary patterns of adult gene expression (including <i>Satb2</i>, <i>Calca</i>, <i>Grp</i>, <i>Pdyn</i>) and predicts output projections to the amygdala (<i>Lmx1b</i>), hypothalamus (<i>Atoh1</i>), and hindbrain (<i>Phox2b</i>/<i>Lmx1b</i>). Using this molecular ontology to organize, interpret, and communicate PB-related information could accelerate the translation of experimental findings from animal models to human patients.</p>

                Abstract Background Childbirth is a life-transforming intense event to a woman and her family. Even though a variety of non-pharmacological techniques are readily available to alleviate the distress of women in labour, the majority of women are unaware of its benefits. The objective of the study was to explore the impact of a simple non-pharmacological technique i.e., antepartum breathing exercises on maternal outcomes of labour among primigravid women. Methods A single centre prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at the antenatal outpatient clinic of a secondary healthcare institution. Eligible primigravid women were randomized into intervention and standard care groups. Both groups received standard obstetrical care. In addition, the intervention group were taught antepartum breathing exercises and were advised to practise daily and also during the active stage of labour. The primary outcome of the trial was the maternal outcome of labour measured in terms of onset of labour, nature of delivery, duration of labour, and need for augmentation of labour. Data was collected using World Health Organization (WHO) partograph, structured observational record on the outcome of labour. Results A total of 98 (70%) primigravid women who practised antepartum breathing exercises had spontaneous onset of labour. The odds of spontaneous onset of labour after randomization in the intervention group was 2.192 times more when compared to standard care at a (95% confidence interval 1.31–3.36, p<.001). Also, the requirement for augmentation of labour was minimal and there was a reduction in the rate of caesarean deliveries (p <.05) based on the χ2 test. The overall mean duration of labour was less compared to standard care group F(1)= 133.800, p <.001. Conclusion Antepartum breathing exercises during labour can facilitate spontaneous vaginal birth, shorten the duration of labour, and reduce the need for operative interference.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">All eyes on COVID-19, let's not forget Tuberculosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Tuberculosis (TB) is a severe global threat killing more than one million people annually (WHO). With a successful TB control programme in place, there has been a decrease in the number of TB cases and deaths globally over recent years. The World Health Organisation (WHO) End TB Strategy has been momentously shocked by the COVID-19 pandemic and it seems that any success made over recent years is likely to be reversed. We are now more than one year into the pandemic, and the effect COVID-19 has had on TB services is devastating. Hospitals typically dedicated to TB have been converted to COVID-19 hospitals and diagnostic laboratories focus on COVID-19 testing rather than TB. Delivery of TB care is being prioritised for people who have active TB disease whereas prevention and diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI) is being put on hold. This pause can lead to an increase in TB cases and transmission. Here, we discuss the connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and latent TB and highlight the importance of TB prevention management in LTBI post-COVID-19 patients. Community engagement and contact tracing are of high importance in fighting TB in the post-COVID19 era. Getting back on track with TB progress is essential, thus further modelling on the COVID-19 impact on TB burden and its determinants is critical.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cortical Correlates of Gait Compensation Strategies in Parkinson Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gait impairment in persons with Parkinson disease is common and debilitating. Compensation strategies (eg, external cues) are an essential part of rehabilitation, but their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we explored the cortical correlates of 3 categories of strategies: external cueing, internal cueing, and action observation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eighteen participants with Parkinson disease and gait impairment were included. We recorded 126-channel EEG during both stance and gait on a treadmill under 4 conditions: (1) uncued, (2) external cueing (listening to a metronome), (3) internal cueing (silent rhythmic counting), and (4) action observation (observing another person walking). To control for the effects of sensory processing of the cues, we computed relative power changes as the difference in power spectral density between walking and standing for each condition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Relative to uncued gait, the use of all 3 compensation strategies induced a decrease of beta band activity in sensorimotor areas, indicative of increased cortical activation. Parieto-occipital alpha band activity decreased with external and internal cueing, and increased with action observation. Only internal cueing induced a change in frontal cortical activation, showing a decrease of beta band activity compared to uncued gait.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The application of compensation strategies resulted in changed cortical activity compared to uncued gait, which could not be solely attributed to sensory processing of the cueing modality. Our findings suggest there are multiple routes to control gait, and different compensation strategies seem to rely on different cortical mechanisms to achieve enhanced central motor activation in persons with Parkinson disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inference of trajectory presence by tree dimension and subset specificity by subtree cover</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lovemore Tenha, Mingzhou Song</p>

The complexity of biological processes such as cell differentiation is reflected in dynamic transitions between cellular states. Trajectory inference arranges the states into a progression using methodologies propelled by single-cell biology. However, current methods, all returning a best trajectory, do not adequately assess statistical significance of noisy patterns, leading to uncertainty in inferred trajectories. We introduce a tree dimension test for trajectory presence in multivariate data by a dimension measure of Euclidean minimum spanning tree, a test statistic, and a null distribution. Computable in linear time to tree size, the tree dimension measure summarizes the extent of branching more effectively than globally insensitive number of leaves or tree diameter indifferent to secondary branches. The test statistic quantifies trajectory presence and its null distribution is estimated under the null hypothesis of no trajectory in data. On simulated and real single-cell datasets, the test outperformed the intuitive number of leaves and tree diameter statistics. Next, we developed a measure for the tissue specificity of the dynamics of a subset, based on the minimum subtree cover of the subset in a minimum spanning tree. We found that tissue specificity of pathway gene expression dynamics is conserved in human and mouse development: several signal transduction pathways including calcium and Wnt signaling are most tissue specific, while genetic information processing pathways such as ribosome and mismatch repair are least so. Neither the tree dimension test nor the subset specificity measure has any user parameter to tune. Our work opens a window to prioritize cellular dynamics and pathways in development and other multivariate dynamical systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">In silico prediction of HIV-1-host molecular interactions and their directionality</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Haiting Chai, Quan Gu, Joseph Hughes, David L. Robertson</p>

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) continues to be a major cause of disease and premature death. As with all viruses, HIV-1 exploits a host cell to replicate. Improving our understanding of these molecular interactions between virus and human host proteins is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of virus biology, infection and host antiviral activities. This knowledge will potentially permit the identification of host molecules for targeting by drugs with antiviral properties. Here, we propose a data-driven approach for the analysis and prediction of the HIV-1 interacting proteins (VIPs) with a focus on the directionality of the interaction: host-dependency versus antiviral factors. Using support vector machine learning models and features encompassing genetic, proteomic and network properties, our results reveal some significant differences between the VIPs and non-HIV-1 interacting human proteins (non-VIPs). As assessed by comparison with the HIV-1 infection pathway data in the Reactome database (sensitivity > 90%, threshold = 0.5), we demonstrate these models have good generalization properties. We find that the ‘direction’ of the HIV-1-host molecular interactions is also predictable due to different characteristics of ‘forward’/pro-viral versus ‘backward’/pro-host proteins. Additionally, we infer the previously unknown direction of the interactions between HIV-1 and 1351 human host proteins. A web server for performing predictions is available at http://hivpre.cvr.gla.ac.uk/.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Low back pain and associated risk factors among medical students in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Different studies showed the high prevalence of LBP among medical students. However, no study has been conducted on Bangladeshi medical students to estimate the prevalence of LBP. This study determined the prevalence, characteristics, and associated risk factors of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 among randomly selected 270 medical students and medical interns in Faridpur Medical College, Bangladesh, using an online questionnaire. In data analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression were performed, and a p-value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: A total of 207 participants responded fully to the survey, and were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 22.4 ± 1.9 years. The point, 6-month, and 12-month prevalence of LBP was 25.6%, 46.9%, and 63.3%, respectively. In most participants, LBP was localized (53.2%), recurrent (64.9%), non-specific (70.8%), affected for a short period (55%), and relieved without receiving any treatment (60.4%). Participants who had a significantly higher 12-month prevalence of LBP included females (72.2% vs 52.2%), with BMI >25 kg/m2 (73.2% vs 56.7%), those who performed physical activity at low to moderate frequency (72.4% vs 29.5%), those who spent > 6 hours/day by sitting (71.3% vs 45.3%), and those who did not have enough rest time (92.7% vs 56%). Ergonomic features of chairs, such as having back support, adjustable back support, and adjustable sitting surface, significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the outcomes. Conclusion: The prevalence of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh was high, and most of the risk factors associated with the high prevalence of LBP were modifiable. Hence, LBP can be prevented by implementing preventive strategies and providing ergonomic training and physical activity facilities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trap of weights: The reuse of weights in the floating catchment area (FCA) methods to measuring accessibility [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Geographic weights are vital in the floating catchment area (FCA) method of accessibility measurements due to their simulation of spatial barriers in various ways. When modelling population demand, geographical weights with different distance decay coefficients can reflect diverse distance tolerances in facility utilization and could lead to erratic accessibility results. Quantifying accessibility as the sum of weighted supply-demand ratios can alleviate the distance decay coefficient's influence and generate stable geographic patterns. However, the effects of weighted ratios on different FCA models and resources have not been investigated. Methods: To identify impacts of weighted ratios on various FCA variants, this study contrasted the accessibility calculated from the sum of ratios (access) and the sum of weighted ratios (access ratios) within three prevalent FCA models: enhanced two-step FCA (E2SFCA), modified two-step FCA (M2SFCA), and three-step FCA (3SFCA). In addition, the accessibilities of various resources evaluate the stability of the weighted ratios' effect. This study therefore examined the accessibilities to primary schools, job opportunities, and major hospitals in Shanghai. Shanghai is a case study that provides lessons on using big data to measure accessibility in metropolitan areas. Results: Geographic weights can not only mitigate the impact of the distance decay coefficients, but can also eliminate model features, which reduces the performance of the M2SFCA's supply decay and the 3SFCA's population demand adjustment in accessibility results. Moreover, weighted ratios tend to overestimate accessibility in marginal communities that lie within fewer catchments, regardless of the resource type. This tendency can lead to an epistemological trap that creates an inaccurate and counter-intuitive perception of resource distribution in a given area. Conclusions: The results identify a gap between the methodological logic and the empirical perception in accessibility measurements. This study concludes that the use of geographic weights needs to be cautious and epistemologically consistent.

                Background: Patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) have an altered intestinal microbiome, which may facilitate novel diagnostic testing. However, accuracy of microbiome classification models across geographic regions may be limited. Therefore, we sought to examine geographic variation in the microbiome of patients with CD from North America and test the performance of a machine learning classification model across geographic regions. Methods: The RISK cohort included 447 pediatric patients with CD and 221 non-inflammatory bowel disease controls from across North America. Terminal ileum, rectal and fecal samples were obtained prior to treatment for microbiome analysis. We divided study sites into 3 geographic regions to examine regional microbiome differences. We trained and tested the performance of a machine learning classification model across these regions. Results: No differences were seen in the mucosal microbiome of patients with CD across regions or in either the fecal or mucosal microbiomes of controls. Machine learning classification algorithms for patients with CD performed well across regions (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] range of 0.85-0.91) with the best results from terminal ileum. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of microbiome based diagnostic testing in pediatric patients with CD within North America, independently from regional influences.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Scopus based bibliometric and scientometric analysis of occupational therapy publications from 2001 to 2020 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Occupational therapy (OT) is one of the allied health professions that had its first journals way back in 1920. The main objective of this study was to find out the publication trend in the field of OT research for the period of 2001-2020 using the principles of bibliometrics and scientometrics. Methods: The data was retrieved from Scopus from the past 20-years (2001-2020). VOSviewer software was used to find year-wise publications in OT-specific and non-OT-specific Journals along with top journals, countries, organisations, authors, cited articles, and highly used keywords. Results: There was a steady growth of OT articles from the past 20-years. Scopus indexes 16 OT-specific journals are identified. American Journal of Occupational Therapy, British Journal of Occupational Therapy Journal, Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy and Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy are the leading publications and citations. Comparison of OT-specific and non-OT journals inferred that the OT-specific papers are three times more published in non-OT journals. There is a trend in publishing multidisciplinary medical journals than OT journals. The US publishes the highest number of articles, followed by the UK, Australia, Canada, and Germany. Though the US alone produced a considerable number of articles (9517), only five organisations are listed in the top-20, compared to Canada (n=6) and Australia (n=5). Australia represents the highest published authors (n=11/20), and Canada represents a highly cited author from the top-cited publications. The “occupational therapy”, “rehabilitation”, “stroke”, “physical therapy,” and “activities of daily living” are the five common keywords used by OT authors. This study lists top-20 journals along with their CiteScore and Journal Impact Factor. Conclusions: This study will help the budding researchers in OT to select a suitable quality journal for publication and, further, helpful for research promotion, researcher incentivising, grant allocations, and policymakers in the OT field.

                MicroRNA-encoded peptides (miPEPs) increase transcription of their nascent pri-miRNA. Lauressergues et al. show that pri-miRNAs are transcribed in different transcripts with different fates: maturation in miRNAs or translation in miPEPs. We reveal that specificity of miPEPs for their pri-miRNA relies on the presence of their encoding ORF in the pri-miRNA.

                Khan et al. develop a high-affinity monobody to nucleotide-free RAS that, when expressed intracellularly, inhibits oncogenic RAS-mediated signaling and tumorigenesis. This study reveals the feasibility of targeting the nucleotide-free state to inhibit tumors driven by oncogenic RAS mutants that possess elevated nucleotide exchange activity.

                Wibisono et al. discover that neuronal GPCR NMUR-1 modulates C. elegans transcription activity by regulating the expression of transcription factors, which, in turn, controls the expression of distinct immune genes in response to different pathogens. These results uncover a molecular basis for the specificity of C. elegans innate immunity.

                Escape is a fast innate behavior that is most generated by hard-wired circuits. Chen et al. identify the peptide NLP-18 and its receptor CKR-1, a Gαq-protein-coupled receptor, to form an essential signaling pathway for full Ω turn. Thus, cholecystokinin peptidergic signaling modulates an escape circuit to generate robust escape steering

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Neuropeptide signaling and SKN-1 orchestrate differential responses of the proteostasis network to dissimilar proteotoxic insults</a></h4>

              
                Boocholez et al. tested how the proteostasis network responds to dissimilar proteotoxic insults. Using model nematodes, they discovered that distinct toxic aggregative proteins elicit dissimilar responses, which are regulated by neuropeptide signaling. This mechanism differentially activates SKN-1/NRF to modulate the expression of different gene sets.
