              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00008">The Copernican Argument for Alien Consciousness; The Mimicry Argument Against Robot Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On broadly Copernican grounds, we are entitled to default assume that apparently behaviorally sophisticated extraterrestrial entities ("aliens") would be conscious. Otherwise, we humans would be inexplicably, implausibly lucky to have consciousness, while similarly behaviorally sophisticated entities elsewhere would be mere shells, devoid of consciousness. However, this Copernican default assumption is canceled in the case of behaviorally sophisticated entities designed to mimic superficial features associated with consciousness in humans ("consciousness mimics"), and in particular a broad class of current, near-future, and hypothetical robots. These considerations, which we formulate, respectively, as the Copernican and Mimicry Arguments, jointly defeat an otherwise potentially attractive parity principle, according to which we should apply the same types of behavioral or cognitive tests to aliens and robots, attributing or denying consciousness similarly to the extent they perform similarly. Instead of grounding speculations about alien and robot consciousness in metaphysical or scientific theories about the physical or functional bases of consciousness, our approach appeals directly to the epistemic principles of Copernican mediocrity and inference to the best explanation. This permits us to justify certain default assumptions about consciousness while remaining to a substantial extent neutral about specific metaphysical and scientific theories.

                arXiv:2412.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human braingraphs or connectomes are widely studied in the last decade to understand the structural and functional properties of our brain. In the last several years our research group has computed and deposited thousands of human braingraphs to the braingraph.org site, by applying public structural (diffusion) MRI data from young and healthy subjects. Here we describe a recent addition to the {\tt braingraph.org} site, which contains connectomes from healthy and demented subjects between 42 and 95 years of age, based on the public release of the OASIS-3 dataset. The diffusion MRI data was processed with the Connectome Mapper Toolkit v.3.1. We believe that the new addition to the braingraph.org site will become a useful resource for enlightening the aging circuitry of the human brain in healthy and diseased subjects, including those with Alzheimer's disease in several stages.

                arXiv:2412.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synaptic plasticity dynamically shapes the connectivity of neural systems and is key to learning processes in the brain. To what extent the mechanisms of plasticity can be exploited to drive a neural network and make it perform some kind of computational task remains unclear. This question, relevant in a bioengineering context, can be formulated as a control problem on a high-dimensional system with strongly constrained and non-linear dynamics. We present a self-contained procedure which, through appropriate spatio-temporal stimulations of the neurons, is able to drive rate-based neural networks with arbitrary initial connectivity towards a desired functional state. We illustrate our approach on two different computational tasks: a non-linear association between multiple input stimulations and activity patterns (representing digit images), and the construction of a continuous attractor encoding a collective variable in a neural population. Our work thus provides a proof of principle for emerging paradigms of in vitro computation based on real neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01707">The Thermodynamic Model to Study the Slow Afterhyperpolarization in a Single Neuron at Different ATP Levels</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neuron consumes energy from ATP hydrolysis to maintain a far-from-equilibrium steady state inside the cell, thus all physiological functions inside the cell are modulated by thermodynamics. The neurons that manage information encoding, transferring, and processing with high energy consumption, displaying a phenomenon called slow afterhyperpolarization after burst firing, whose properties are affected by the energy conditions. Here we constructed a thermodynamical model to quantitatively describe the sAHP process generated by $Na^+-K^+$ ATPases(NKA) and the Calcium-activated potassium(K(Ca)) channels. The model simulates how the amplitude of sAHP is effected by the intracellular ATP concentration and ATP hydrolysis free energy $\Delta$ G. The results show a trade-off between NKA and the K(Ca)'s modulation on the sAHP's energy dependence, and also predict an alteration of sAHP's behavior under insufficient ATP supply if the proportion of NKA and K(Ca)'s expression quantities is changed. The research provides insights in understanding the maintenance of neural homeostasis and support furthur researches on metabolism-related and neurodegenerative diseases.

                arXiv:2412.00405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a stochastic SEIQR (susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered) epidemic model with a generalized incidence function. Using the Lyapunov method, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the model, ensuring that it remains well-defined over time. Through the application of Young's inequality and Chebyshev's inequality, we demonstrate the concepts of stochastic ultimate boundedness and stochastic permanence, providing insights into the long-term behavior of the epidemic dynamics under random perturbations. Furthermore, we derive conditions for stochastic extinction, which describe scenarios where the epidemic may eventually die out, and V-geometric ergodicity, which indicates the rate at which the system's state converges to its equilibrium. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our theoretical results and assess the model's behavior under different parameters.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06608">Estimating the contribution of early and late noise in vision from psychophysical data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2012.06608v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many psychophysical detection and discrimination tasks human performance is thought to be limited by internal or inner noise when neuronal activity is converted into an overt behavioural response. It is unclear, however, to what extent the behaviourally limiting inner noise arises from early noise in the photoreceptors and the retina, or from late noise in cortex at or immediately prior to the decision stage. Presumably, the behaviourally limiting inner noise is a non-trivial combination of both early and late noises. Here we propose a method to quantify the contributions of early and late noise purely from psychophysical data. Our analysis generalizes classical results for linear systems (Burgess and Colborne, 1988) by combining the theory of noise propagation through a nonlinear network (Ahumada, 1987) with the expressions to obtain the perceptual metric along the nonlinear network (Malo and Simoncelli, 2006; Laparra et al., 2010). We show that from threshold-only data the relative contribution of early and late noise can only be determined if the experiments include substantial external noise in some of the stimuli used during experiments. If experimenters collected full psychometric functions, however, then early and late noise sources can be quantified even in the absence of external noise. Our psychophysical estimate of the magnitude of the early noise assuming a standard cascade of linear and nonlinear model stages is substantially lower than the noise in cone photocurrents computed via an accurate model of retinal physiology (Brainard and Wandell, 2020, ISETBIO). This is consistent with the idea that one of the fundamental tasks of early vision is to reduce the comparatively large retinal noise.

                arXiv:2310.06533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Bayesian parameter inference associated to a class of partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by jump processes. Such type of models can be routinely found in applications, of which we focus upon the case of neuroscience. The data are assumed to be observed regularly in time and driven by the SDE model with unknown parameters. In practice the SDE may not have an analytically tractable solution and this leads naturally to a time-discretization. We adapt the multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo method of [11], which works with a hierarchy of time discretizations and show empirically and theoretically that this is preferable to using one single time discretization. The improvement is in terms of the computational cost needed to obtain a pre-specified numerical error. Our approach is illustrated on models that are found in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08751">Latent Diffusion for Neural Spiking Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.08751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern datasets in neuroscience enable unprecedented inquiries into the relationship between complex behaviors and the activity of many simultaneously recorded neurons. While latent variable models can successfully extract low-dimensional embeddings from such recordings, using them to generate realistic spiking data, especially in a behavior-dependent manner, still poses a challenge. Here, we present Latent Diffusion for Neural Spiking data (LDNS), a diffusion-based generative model with a low-dimensional latent space: LDNS employs an autoencoder with structured state-space (S4) layers to project discrete high-dimensional spiking data into continuous time-aligned latents. On these inferred latents, we train expressive (conditional) diffusion models, enabling us to sample neural activity with realistic single-neuron and population spiking statistics. We validate LDNS on synthetic data, accurately recovering latent structure, firing rates, and spiking statistics. Next, we demonstrate its flexibility by generating variable-length data that mimics human cortical activity during attempted speech. We show how to equip LDNS with an expressive observation model that accounts for single-neuron dynamics not mediated by the latent state, further increasing the realism of generated samples. Finally, conditional LDNS trained on motor cortical activity during diverse reaching behaviors can generate realistic spiking data given reach direction or unseen reach trajectories. In summary, LDNS simultaneously enables inference of low-dimensional latents and realistic conditional generation of neural spiking datasets, opening up further possibilities for simulating experimentally testable hypotheses.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04072">Multi-Resolution Graph Analysis of Dynamic Brain Network for Classification of Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.04072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, making early detection vital for timely intervention. However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. Our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Machine learning was employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from brain network at different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09874">Image Statistics Predict the Sensitivity of Perceptual Quality Metrics</a></h4>

Abstract: Previously, Barlow and Attneave hypothesised a link between biological vision and information maximisation. Following Shannon, information was defined using the probability of natural images. Several physiological and psychophysical phenomena have been derived from principles like info-max, efficient coding, or optimal denoising. However, it remains unclear how this link is expressed in mathematical terms from image probability. Classical derivations were subjected to strong assumptions on the probability models and on the behaviour of the sensors. Moreover, the direct evaluation of the hypothesis was limited by the inability of classical image models to deliver accurate estimates of the probability. Here, we directly evaluate image probabilities using a generative model for natural images, and analyse how probability-related factors can be combined to predict the sensitivity of state-of-the-art subjective image quality metrics, a proxy for human perception. We use information theory and regression analysis to find a simple model that when combining just two probability-related factors achieves 0.77 correlation with subjective metrics. This probability-based model is validated in two ways: through direct comparison with the opinion of real observers in a subjective quality experiment, and by reproducing basic trends of classical psychophysical facts such as the Contrast Sensitivity Function, the Weber-law, and contrast masking.

                arXiv:2407.17220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To determine the precise link between anatomical structure and function, brain studies primarily concentrate on the anatomical wiring of the brain and its topological properties. In this work, we investigate the weighted degree and connection length distributions of the KKI-113 and KKI-18 human connectomes, the fruit fly, and of the mouse retina. We found that the node strength (weighted degree) distribution behavior differs depending on the considered scale. On the global scale, the distributions are found to follow a power-law behavior, with a roughly universal exponent close to 3. However, this behavior breaks at the local scale as the node strength distributions of the KKI-18 follow a stretched exponential, and the fly and mouse retina follow the lognormal distribution, respectively which are indicative of underlying random multiplicative processes and underpins non-locality of learning in a brain close to the critical state. However, for the case of the KKI-113 and the H01 human (1mm$^3$) datasets, the local weighted degree distributions follow an exponentially truncated power-law, which may hint at the fact that the critical learning mechanism may have manifested at the node level too.

                arXiv:2411.03541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Does learning of task-relevant representations stop when behavior stops changing? Motivated by recent theoretical advances in machine learning and the intuitive observation that human experts continue to learn from practice even after mastery, we hypothesize that task-specific representation learning can continue, even when behavior plateaus. In a novel reanalysis of recently published neural data, we find evidence for such learning in posterior piriform cortex of mice following continued training on a task, long after behavior saturates at near-ceiling performance ("overtraining"). This learning is marked by an increase in decoding accuracy from piriform neural populations and improved performance on held-out generalization tests. We demonstrate that class representations in cortex continue to separate during overtraining, so that examples that were incorrectly classified at the beginning of overtraining can abruptly be correctly classified later on, despite no changes in behavior during that time. We hypothesize this hidden yet rich learning takes the form of approximate margin maximization; we validate this and other predictions in the neural data, as well as build and interpret a simple synthetic model that recapitulates these phenomena. We conclude by showing how this model of late-time feature learning implies an explanation for the empirical puzzle of overtraining reversal in animal learning, where task-specific representations are more robust to particular task changes because the learned features can be reused.

                arXiv:2412.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative rates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.

Abstract: Statistical physics provides tools for analyzing high-dimensional problems in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience. These calculations, particularly those using the replica method, often involve lengthy derivations that can obscure physical interpretation. We give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. Specifically, we introduce a cavity approach to analyzing high-dimensional learning problems and apply it to three cases: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure -- a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables -- enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a na\"ive method. These results match those obtained through the replica method.

                arXiv:2405.11848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces alternators, a novel family of non-Markovian dynamical models for sequences. An alternator features two neural networks: the observation trajectory network (OTN) and the feature trajectory network (FTN). The OTN and the FTN work in conjunction, alternating between outputting samples in the observation space and some feature space, respectively, over a cycle. The parameters of the OTN and the FTN are not time-dependent and are learned via a minimum cross-entropy criterion over the trajectories. Alternators are versatile. They can be used as dynamical latent-variable generative models or as sequence-to-sequence predictors. Alternators can uncover the latent dynamics underlying complex sequential data, accurately forecast and impute missing data, and sample new trajectories. We showcase the capabilities of alternators in three applications. We first used alternators to model the Lorenz equations, often used to describe chaotic behavior. We then applied alternators to Neuroscience, to map brain activity to physical activity. Finally, we applied alternators to Climate Science, focusing on sea-surface temperature forecasting. In all our experiments, we found alternators are stable to train, fast to sample from, yield high-quality generated samples and latent variables, and often outperform strong baselines such as Mambas, neural ODEs, and diffusion models in the domains we studied.

Abstract: Economists model knowledge use and acquisition as a cause-and-effect calculus associating observations made by a decision-maker about their world with possible underlying causes. Knowledge models are well-established for static contexts, but not for contexts of innovative and unbounded change. We develop a representation of knowledge use and acquisition in open-ended evolutionary systems and demonstrate its primary results, including that observers embedded in open-ended evolutionary systems can agree to disagree and that their ability to theorize about their systems is fundamentally local and constrained to their frame of reference what we call frame relativity. The results of our framework formalize local knowledge use, the many-selves interpretation of reasoning through time, and motivate the emergence of nonlogical modes of reasoning like institutional and aesthetic codes.

Abstract: This paper explores the representational structure of linear Simple Cycle Reservoirs (SCR) operating at the edge of stability. We view SCR as providing in their state space feature representations of the input-driving time series. By endowing the state space with the canonical dot-product, we ``reverse engineer" the corresponding kernel (inner product) operating in the original time series space. The action of this time-series kernel is fully characterized by the eigenspace of the corresponding metric tensor. We demonstrate that when linear SCRs are constructed at the edge of stability, the eigenvectors of the time-series kernel align with the Fourier basis. This theoretical insight is supported by numerical experiments.

Abstract: High-dimensional vectors have been proposed as a neural method for representing information in the brain using Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). While previous work has explored decoding and cleaning up these vectors under the noise that arises during computation, existing methods are limited. Cleanup methods are essential for robust computation within a VSA. However, cleanup methods for continuous-value encodings are not as effective. In this paper, we present an iterative optimization method to decode and clean up Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) vectors that are encoding continuous values. We combine composite likelihood estimation (CLE) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to ensure convergence to the global optimum. We also demonstrate that this method can effectively decode FHRR vectors under different noise conditions, and show that it outperforms existing methods.

                arXiv:2412.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), high-dimensional black-box optimization problems are challenging tasks. Such problems often involve a property called low effective dimensionality (LED), in which the objective function is formulated with redundant dimensions relative to the intrinsic objective function and a rotation transformation of the search space. The CMA-ES suffers from LED for two reasons: the default hyperparameter setting is determined by the total number of dimensions, and the norm calculations in step-size adaptations are performed including elements on the redundant dimensions. In this paper, we incorporate countermeasures for LED into the CMA-ES and propose CMA-ES-LED. We tackle with the rotation transformation using the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. We estimate the effectiveness of each dimension in the rotated search space using the element-wise signal-to-noise ratios of the mean vector update and the rank-$\mu$ update, both of which updates can be explained as the natural gradient ascent. Then, we adapt the hyperparameter using the estimated number of effective dimensions. In addition, we refine the cumulative step-size adaptation and the two-point step-size adaptation to measure the norms only on the effective dimensions. The experimental results show the CMA-ES-LED outperforms the CMA-ES on benchmark functions with LED.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable mathematical capabilities but at the same time struggle with abstract reasoning and planning. In this study, we explore whether Transformers can learn to abstract and generalize the rules governing Elementary Cellular Automata. By training Transformers on state sequences generated with random initial conditions and local rules, we show that they can generalize across different Boolean functions of fixed arity, effectively abstracting the underlying rules. While the models achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines sharply in multi-step planning tasks without intermediate context. Our analysis reveals that including future states or rule prediction in the training loss enhances the models' ability to form internal representations of the rules, leading to improved performance in longer planning horizons and autoregressive generation. Furthermore, we confirm that increasing the model's depth plays a crucial role in extended sequential computations required for complex reasoning tasks. This highlights the potential to improve LLM with inclusion of longer horizons in loss function, as well as incorporating recurrence and adaptive computation time for dynamic control of model depth.

                arXiv:2412.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks employ fixed weights during inference, limiting their ability to adapt to changing input conditions, unlike biological neurons that adjust signal strength dynamically based on stimuli. This discrepancy between artificial and biological neurons constrains neural network flexibility and adaptability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for adaptive neural networks, where neuron weights are modeled as functions of the input signal, allowing the network to adjust dynamically in real-time. Importantly, we achieve this within the same traditional architecture of an Artificial Neural Network, maintaining structural familiarity while introducing dynamic adaptability. In our research, we apply Chebyshev polynomials as one of the many possible decomposition methods to achieve this adaptive weighting mechanism, with polynomial coefficients learned during training. Out of the 145 datasets tested, our adaptive Chebyshev neural network demonstrated a marked improvement over an equivalent MLP in approximately 8\% of cases, performing strictly better on 121 datasets. In the remaining 24 datasets, the performance of our algorithm matched that of the MLP, highlighting its ability to generalize standard neural network behavior while offering enhanced adaptability. As a generalized form of the MLP, this model seamlessly retains MLP performance where needed while extending its capabilities to achieve superior accuracy across a wide range of complex tasks. These results underscore the potential of adaptive neurons to enhance generalization, flexibility, and robustness in neural networks, particularly in applications with dynamic or non-linear data dependencies.

                arXiv:2412.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuning effective step sizes is crucial for the stability and efficiency of optimization algorithms. While adaptive coordinate-wise step sizes tuning methods have been explored in first-order methods, second-order methods still lack efficient techniques. Current approaches, including hypergradient descent and cutting plane methods, offer limited improvements or encounter difficulties in second-order contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Learning-to-Optimize (L2O) model within the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) framework, which leverages neural networks to predict optimal coordinate-wise step sizes. Our model integrates a theoretical foundation that establishes conditions for the stability and convergence of these step sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements over traditional backtracking line search and hypergradient descent-based methods, offering up to 7$\times$ faster and stable performance across diverse optimization tasks.

                arXiv:2412.00278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a standard tool to quantify the reliability of modern deep learning models, and crucial for many real-world applications. However, efficient uncertainty estimation methods for spiking neural networks, particularly for regression models, have been lacking. Here, we introduce two methods that adapt the Average-Over-Time Spiking Neural Network (AOT-SNN) framework to regression tasks, enhancing uncertainty estimation in event-driven models. The first method uses the heteroscedastic Gaussian approach, where SNNs predict both the mean and variance at each time step, thereby generating a conditional probability distribution of the target variable. The second method leverages the Regression-as-Classification (RAC) approach, reformulating regression as a classification problem to facilitate uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our approaches on both a toy dataset and several benchmark datasets, demonstrating that the proposed AOT-SNN models achieve performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art deep neural network methods, particularly in uncertainty estimation. Our findings highlight the potential of SNNs for uncertainty estimation in regression tasks, providing an efficient and biologically inspired alternative for applications requiring both accuracy and energy efficiency.

                arXiv:2412.00300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real world planning problems are often too complex to be effectively tackled by a single unaided human. To alleviate this, some recent work has focused on developing a collaborative planning system to assist humans in complex domains, with bridging the gap between the system's problem representation and the real world being a key consideration. Transferring the speed and correctness formal planners provide to real-world planning problems is greatly complicated by the dynamic and online nature of such tasks. Formal specifications of task and environment dynamics frequently lack constraints on some behaviors or goal conditions relevant to the way a human operator prefers a plan to be carried out. While adding constraints to the representation with the objective of increasing its realism risks slowing down the planner, we posit that the same benefits can be realized without sacrificing speed by modeling this problem as an online preference learning task. As part of a broader cooperative planning system, we present a feedback-driven plan critic. This method makes use of reinforcement learning with human feedback in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to directly optimize a plan with respect to natural-language user preferences despite the non-differentiability of traditional planners. Directly optimizing the plan bridges the gap between research into more efficient planners and research into planning with language models by utilizing the convenience of natural language to guide the output of formal planners. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our plan critic at adhering to user preferences on a disaster recovery task, and observe improved performance compared to an llm-only neurosymbolic approach.

                arXiv:2412.00408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning gets deployed more and more widely, and model sizes continue to grow, improving computational efficiency during model inference has become a key challenge. In many commonly used model architectures, including Transformers, a significant portion of the inference computation is comprised of exponential non-linearities such as Softmax. In this work, we develop QuAKE, a collection of novel operators that leverage certain properties of IEEE-754 floating point representations to quickly approximate the exponential function without requiring specialized hardware, extra memory, or precomputation. We propose optimizations that enhance the efficiency of QuAKE in commonly used exponential non-linearities such as Softmax, GELU, and the Logistic function. Our benchmarks demonstrate substantial inference speed improvements between 10% and 35% on server CPUs, and 5% and 45% on embedded and mobile-scale CPUs for a variety of model architectures and sizes. Evaluations of model performance on standard datasets and tasks from various domains show that QuAKE operators are able to provide sizable speed benefits with little to no loss of performance on downstream tasks.

                arXiv:2412.00472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skin cancer (SC) stands out as one of the most life-threatening forms of cancer, with its danger amplified if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Early intervention is critical, as it allows for more effective treatment approaches. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool in the early detection and skin cancer diagnosis (SCD). Although the DL seems promising for the diagnosis of skin cancer, still ample scope exists for improving model efficiency and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach to skin cancer detection, utilizing optimization techniques in conjunction with pre-trained networks and wavelet transformations. First, normalized images will undergo pre-trained networks such as Densenet-121, Inception, Xception, and MobileNet to extract hierarchical features from input images. After feature extraction, the feature maps are passed through a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) layer to capture low and high-frequency components. Then the self-attention module is integrated to learn global dependencies between features and focus on the most relevant parts of the feature maps. The number of neurons and optimization of the weight vectors are performed using three new swarm-based optimization techniques, such as Modified Gorilla Troops Optimizer (MGTO), Improved Gray Wolf Optimization (IGWO), and Fox optimization algorithm. Evaluation results demonstrate that optimizing weight vectors using optimization algorithms can enhance diagnostic accuracy and make it a highly effective approach for SCD. The proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in accuracy, achieving top rates of 98.11% with the MobileNet + Wavelet + FOX and DenseNet + Wavelet + Fox combination on the ISIC-2016 dataset and 97.95% with the Inception + Wavelet + MGTO combination on the ISIC-2017 dataset, which improves accuracy by at least 1% compared to other methods.

                arXiv:2412.00541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight learning from demonstration (LfD) model based on reservoir computing that can learn and generate multiple movement trajectories with prediction intervals, which we call as Context-based Echo State Network with prediction confidence (CESN+). CESN+ can generate movement trajectories that may go beyond the initial LfD training based on a desired set of conditions while providing confidence on its generated output. To assess the abilities of CESN+, we first evaluate its performance against Conditional Neural Movement Primitives (CNMP), a comparable framework that uses a conditional neural process to generate movement primitives. Our findings indicate that CESN+ not only outperforms CNMP but is also faster to train and demonstrates impressive performance in generating trajectories for extrapolation cases. In human-robot shared control applications, the confidence of the machine generated trajectory is a key indicator of how to arbitrate control sharing. To show the usability of the CESN+ for human-robot adaptive shared control, we have designed a proof-of-concept human-robot shared control task and tested its efficacy in adapting the sharing weight between the human and the robot by comparing it to a fixed-weight control scheme. The simulation experiments show that with CESN+ based adaptive sharing the total human load in shared control can be significantly reduced. Overall, the developed CESN+ model is a strong lightweight LfD system with desirable properties such fast training and ability to extrapolate to the new task parameters while producing robust prediction intervals for its output.

Abstract: Traditional genetic programming (GP) often struggles in stock alpha factor discovery due to its vast search space, overwhelming computational burden, and sporadic effective alphas. We find that GP performs better when focusing on promising regions rather than random searching. This paper proposes a new GP framework with carefully chosen initialization and structural constraints to enhance search performance and improve the interpretability of the alpha factors. This approach is motivated by and mimics the alpha searching practice and aims to boost the efficiency of such a process. Analysis of 2020-2024 Chinese stock market data shows that our method yields superior out-of-sample prediction results and higher portfolio returns than the benchmark.

Abstract: Coordinated multi-robot motion planning at intersections is key for safe mobility in roads, factories and warehouses. The rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithms are popular in multi-robot motion planning. However, generating the graph configuration space and searching in the composite tensor configuration space is computationally expensive for large number of sample points. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary-based algorithm using a parametric lattice-based configuration and the discrete-based RRT for collision-free multi-robot planning at intersections. Our computational experiments using complex planning intersection scenarios have shown the feasibility and the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to seven other related approaches. Our results offer new sampling and representation mechanisms to render optimization-based approaches for multi-robot navigation.

Our computational experiments using arbitrary obstacle configuration with convex and non-convex geometries show the feasibility and the attractive performance when computing multiple obstacle-avoiding Steiner trees in the plane.

Abstract: Many natural phenomena are characterized by self-similarity, for example the symmetry of human faces, or a repetitive motif of a song. Studying of such symmetries will allow us to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems. Recognizing the importance of understanding these patterns, we propose a geometrically inspired framework to study such phenomena in artificial neural networks. To this end, we introduce \emph{CantorNet}, inspired by the triadic construction of the Cantor set, which was introduced by Georg Cantor in the $19^\text{th}$ century. In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line that is self-similar and has a counter intuitive property of being an uncountably infinite null set. Similarly, we introduce CantorNet as a sandbox for studying self-similarity by means of novel topological and geometrical complexity measures. CantorNet constitutes a family of ReLU neural networks that spans the whole spectrum of possible Kolmogorov complexities, including the two opposite descriptions (linear and exponential as measured by the description length). CantorNet's decision boundaries can be arbitrarily ragged, yet are analytically known. Besides serving as a testing ground for complexity measures, our work may serve to illustrate potential pitfalls in geometry-ignorant data augmentation techniques and adversarial attacks.

                arXiv:2402.08573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for ``biologically plausible'' learning algorithms has converged on the idea of representing gradients as activity differences. However, most approaches require a high degree of synchronization (distinct phases during learning) and introduce substantial computational overhead, which raises doubts regarding their biological plausibility as well as their potential utility for neuromorphic computing. Furthermore, they commonly rely on applying infinitesimal perturbations (nudges) to output units, which is impractical in noisy environments. Recently it has been shown that by modelling artificial neurons as dyads with two oppositely nudged compartments, it is possible for a fully local learning algorithm named ``dual propagation'' to bridge the performance gap to backpropagation, without requiring separate learning phases or infinitesimal nudging. However, the algorithm has the drawback that its numerical stability relies on symmetric nudging, which may be restrictive in biological and analog implementations. In this work we first provide a solid foundation for the objective underlying the dual propagation method, which also reveals a surprising connection with adversarial robustness. Second, we demonstrate how dual propagation is related to a particular adjoint state method, which is stable regardless of asymmetric nudging.

	<p>Age-associated alterations in the brain lead to cognitive deterioration and neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). This review with a particular focus on Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), emphasizes the burgeoning significance of the gut microbiota (GMB) in neuroinflammation and its impact on the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis (GBA), a communication conduit between the gut and the central nervous system (CNS). Changes in the gut microbiome, including diminished microbial diversity and the prevalence of pro-inflammatory bacteria, are associated with AD pathogenesis. Promising therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, and prebiotics, may restore gut health and enhance cognitive performance. Clinical data remain insufficient, necessitating further research to elucidate causes, enhance therapy, and consider individual variances. This integrative approach may yield innovative therapies aimed at the GMB to improve cognitive function and brain health in older people.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas remain a significant concern in spinal neurosurgery, particularly following dural closure. The incidence of dural tears during spinal surgery is estimated between 1.6% and 10%. While direct suturing remains the gold standard, it has a failure rate of 5&amp;amp;ndash;10%. Various materials and techniques have been used to enhance dural closure. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of non-penetrating titanium clips (AnastoClip&amp;amp;reg;) for dural closure in intradural spinal lesion surgeries. Methods: A prospective analysis was conducted on 272 patients who were operated on for intradural spinal lesions from August 2017 to December 2023. Dural closure was performed using non-penetrating titanium clips with sealant, and, in select cases, autologous grafts. Postoperative care included early mobilization and routine MRI to assess outcomes. A comparative analysis was performed with a cohort of 81 patients treated with traditional sutures. Results: Among the 272 patients, postoperative CSF leaks occurred in 32 cases (11.76%), requiring various management approaches. Thirteen cases required surgical revision, while others resolved with external lumbar drainage or fluid aspiration. Compared to the suture group, which had a fistula rate of 23.46%, the titanium clip group had a significantly lower fistula rate. Logistic regression analysis did not find statistically significant associations between fistula risk and clinical factors. Conclusions: Non-penetrating titanium clips provide an effective alternative to sutures for dural closure, reducing CSF leak rates. They preserve dural integrity, reduce operative time, and avoid imaging artifacts, making them a viable advancement in spinal surgery with outcomes comparable to, or better than, traditional techniques.</p>

                Background Several scholars defined the concepts of fuzzy soft set theory and their application on decision-making problem. Based on this concept, researchers defined the generalised fuzzy soft set and its applications. However, to the best of the author’s knowledge, the generalised fuzzy soft set has not been dealing with in the generalised fuzzy soft code set. In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalised fuzzy soft code set and its application. Methods The theory of fuzzy soft sets and its application, generalised fuzzy soft sets and fuzzy codes in different years were studied with various researchers. To derive a generalised fuzzy soft code set, we apply the concepts of generalised fuzzy soft set and a new view of fuzzy codes and its application. A new aspect of this paper is to introduce the definition of generalised fuzzy soft code sets and its application on medical diagnosis and decision-makings. Results Generalised fuzzy soft code is the most powerful and effective extension of fuzzy soft sets that deal with the choice’s parameterized values. It is an extended model of fuzzy soft sets and a new mathematical tool with significant advantages for handling uncertain information and is proposed by combining the concept of fuzzy soft sets and fuzzy code sets. This paper introduces the concept of generalised fuzzy soft code and its properties. Conclusions In this study, we combine generalised fuzzy soft set and a different approach to coding theory to introduce generalisation of fuzzy soft codes. The paper also considers the relation between generalised fuzzy soft code and its application. We discussed the matrix representation of generalised fuzzy soft code. Furthermore, a demonstration example illustrates how the strategy could be effectively applied to various problems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1460/v1?src=rss">Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities of Employing Persons with Disabilities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background To supplement the extant literature on the economics of employing persons of disability, the present study explores the challenges and opportunities companies face with the employment of people with disabilities. Despite legal frameworks and growing awareness, individuals with disabilities often face significant barriers to securing meaningful employment. Misconceptions about their capabilities and concerns over potential costs persist, overshadowing evidence of economic and social benefits. This study explores these dynamics, emphasizing the potential advantages of inclusive hiring practices for organizations. Methods Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with HR managers from five South Tyrolean companies across diverse industries. Participants were selected based on criteria such as company size (minimum 35 employees) and HR management experience (at least 3 years). Interviews focused on exploring workplace adjustments, employment motivations, challenges, and barriers, generating qualitative insights into inclusion practices. Results The study identified several advantages of employing individuals with disabilities, including low turnover rates, increased employee motivation, and a positive workplace atmosphere. Most companies incurred minimal costs for workplace adjustments. Challenges included insufficient understanding among staff, difficulty matching job roles with capabilities, and bureaucratic obstacles. The experts also noted a lack of job applications from individuals with disabilities, potentially due to low confidence or family overprotection. Conclusions Employing people with disabilities can be economically profitable and is not limited to social aspects alone. Existing barriers can often be dismantled without significant financial or time investment, with obstacles being readily overcome. This article contributes to a better understanding of challenges and opportunities of employing staff with disabilities and demonstrates the conditions under which economic benefits emerge for companies. The findings are discussed from an economical and social/cultural perspective with practical implications for human resource practice and operation management.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservati</a></h4>

              
                Backround/Objectives We investigated a technique that facilitates the coiling of a regular straight catheter (with integral stylet) behind the sciatic nerve in an ultrasound (US) regional anaesthesia simulator, and then applied our findings to a series of orthopedic-trauma patients. Methods We conducted a randomized study of two methods of perineural catheter advancement in a sciatic nerve block Blue Phantom simulator. Two groups of twenty catheters each (method A and method B) were evaluated under real-time ultrasound imaging. The needle in-plane/nerve in-short-axis technique was applied. In method A the catheter was advanced beyond the needle tip with the integral stylet extending along its entire length; in method B the catheter was advanced after its integral stylet was retracted by 6 cm, thus providing flexibility to the catheter’s distal end. Additionally, to assess the procedural effectiveness of method B coiling technique, a pilot study was conducted examining 25 perineural catheters coiled underneath the sciatic nerve in trauma-orthopaedic patients to document any catheter tip displacement from their initial position (for 36 hours postoperatively). Results In the simulation study, method B led to a significantly higher percentage (18/20:90%) of coiled catheters than method A (3/20:15%). Two coiled catheters of method B were found kinked/obstructed. In our patients, after catheter insertion, the distal end of 2/25 (8%) coiled catheters was obstructed. One perineural catheter was dislodged. For the remaining 22 (88%) catheters, ultrasound imaging demonstrated that local anaesthetic infusion made contact with the sciatic nerve, indicating no displacement of the catheter’s distal end postoperatively. Conclusion Regular straight perineural catheters can be coiled if their integral stylet is partially retracted. This coiling method offers extra catheter length adjacent to the nerve structure which potentially mitigates catheter tip displacement.

                Background Livelihood diversification involves households earning through various economic activities, such as non-farm businesses, entrepreneurship, and off-farm jobs, improving sustainability, resilience, risk sharing, employment opportunities, and reducing poverty and food insecurity. However, little research has been done on the status, factors and relation of livelihood diversification and food security. This study explores the relationship between food security and livelihood diversification in the Chencha district of southern Ethiopia, focusing on determinants and their connection with household food security. Methods Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 303 randomly selected households using surveys, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and observations. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, Ordered probit regression and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results The result revealed that subsistence farming (52.1%) and weaving (38.6%) activities were reported as the primary and secondary main income sources of households. A majority of households (90.7%) diversified their livelihood. Based on income share, non-farm, on-farm, and off-farm income sources contributed, 72.96%, 25.3%, and 1.74% of total household income, respectively. Formal employment, weaving, barber/hairdresser, cattle production and sale, cereal production, and vegetable production (Potato) were highly paying livelihood activities in order. Households who combined on-farm, off-farm, and non-farm have gained far larger mean income followed by on-farm and non-farm strategies. Ordered Probit model results showed that landholding size, livestock holding size, and access to farmer training center (FTC) have positively affected the extent of livelihood diversification. Positive association was found between livelihood diversification and the food security status of households. Conclusion thus, the majority of weaving-based livelihood groups diversify their livelihood activities to on-farm, off-farm, and non-farm activities. Hence, supporting the weaving activity and motivating females’ participation, increasing other livelihood options, and modernizing the system with appropriate training, education, and market linkage seems inevitable.

                Background Prosthodontics significantly impacts oral health-related quality of life, especially oral comfort, functions, aesthetics, and overall well-being. This discipline is grounded in a solid academic and evidence-based understanding of fundamental principles for managing dental diseases and aims to restore the health of teeth and supporting tissues and compensate missing ones. Dental education is evolving quickly with the rise of digital dentistry, especially in prosthodontics. Integrating augmented reality simulations and haptic feedback has significantly advanced this transformation. This systematic review protocol intends to determine the effectiveness of haptic simulators in prosthodontics training during preclinical dental education. Methods An exhaustive search strategy will be employed, exploring PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science and Cochrane Central to select relevant studies, thereby enhancing the robustness of the review findings. Boolean operators (AND,OR) were utilized to assemble MeSH terms and relevant keywords. Titles and abstracts screening to identify studies that satisfy the eligibility criteria was followed by the quality and risk of bias assessment for the selected studies, via the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Data will be collected via standard form. Reviewers disagreement will be solved throughout debate, or by referring to a third opinion. This protocol will adhere the recommendations appointed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Discussion The outcomes of this systematic review are highly significant for dental education exploring the importance of enhancing haptic simulation during preclinic prosthetic training. Recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of virtual reality (VR) in relation to traditional preclinical training methods is crucial for developing effective educational strategies. This understanding can lead to enhanced training outcomes and increased student satisfaction, which in turn contributes to improved quality of clinical prosthetic services.

During morphogenesis, cells precisely generate forces that drive cell shape changes and cellular motion. These forces predominantly arise from contractility of the actomyosin cortex, allowing for cortical tension, protrusion formation, and cell division. Image-based force inference can derive such forces from microscopy images, without complicated and time-consuming experimental set-ups. However, current methods do not account for common effects, such as physical confinement and local force generation. Here we propose a force-inference method based on a biophysical model of cell shape, and assess relative cellular surface tension, adhesive tension between cells, as well as cytokinesis and protrusion formation. We applied our method on fluorescent microscopy images of the early <i>C. elegans</i> embryo. Predictions for cell surface tension at the 7-cell stage were validated by measurements using cortical laser ablation. Our non-invasive method facilitates the accurate tracking of force generation, and offers many new perspectives for studying morphogenesis.

                <p>by Adrián F. Amil, Albert Albesa-González, Paul F. M. J. Verschure</p>

Theta-band oscillations (3–8 Hz) in the mammalian hippocampus organize the temporal structure of cortical inputs, resulting in a phase code that enables rhythmic input sampling for episodic memory formation and spatial navigation. However, it remains unclear what evolutionary pressures might have driven the selection of theta over higher-frequency bands that could potentially provide increased input sampling resolution. Here, we address this question by introducing a theoretical framework that combines the efficient coding and neural oscillatory sampling hypotheses, focusing on the information rate (bits/s) of phase coding neurons. We demonstrate that physiologically realistic noise levels create a trade-off between the speed of input sampling, determined by oscillation frequency, and encoding precision in rodent hippocampal neurons. This speed-precision trade-off results in a maximum information rate of ∼1–2 bits/s within the theta frequency band, thus confining the optimal oscillation frequency to the low end of the spectrum. We also show that this framework accounts for key hippocampal features, such as the preservation of the theta band along the dorsoventral axis despite physiological gradients, and the modulation of theta frequency and amplitude by running speed. Extending the analysis beyond the hippocampus, we propose that theta oscillations could also support efficient stimulus encoding in the visual cortex and olfactory bulb. More broadly, our framework lays the foundation for studying how system features, such as noise, constrain the optimal sampling frequencies in both biological and artificial brains.

Biological signalling systems are complex, and efforts to build mechanistic models must confront a huge parameter space, indirect and sparse data, and frequently encounter multiscale and multiphysics phenomena. We present HOSS, a framework for Hierarchical Optimization of Systems Simulations, to address such problems. HOSS operates by breaking down extensive systems models into individual pathway blocks organized in a nested hierarchy. At the first level, dependencies are solely on signalling inputs, and subsequent levels rely only on the preceding ones. We demonstrate that each independent pathway in every level can be efficiently optimized. Once optimized, its parameters are held constant while the pathway serves as input for succeeding levels. We develop an algorithmic approach to identify the necessary nested hierarchies for the application of HOSS in any given biochemical network. Furthermore, we devise two parallelizable variants that generate numerous model instances using stochastic scrambling of parameters during initial and intermediate stages of optimization. Our results indicate that these variants produce superior models and offer an estimate of solution degeneracy. Additionally, we showcase the effectiveness of the optimization methods for both abstracted, event-based simulations and ODE-based models.

Human facial shape, while strongly heritable, involves both genetic and structural complexity, necessitating precise phenotyping for accurate assessment. Common phenotyping strategies include simplifying 3D facial features into univariate traits such as anthropometric measurements (e.g., inter-landmark distances), unsupervised dimensionality reductions (e.g., principal component analysis (PCA) and auto-encoder (AE) approaches), and assessing resemblance to particular facial gestalts (e.g., syndromic facial archetypes). This study provides a comparative assessment of these strategies in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of 3D facial shape. Specifically, we investigated inter-landmark distances, PCA and AE-derived latent dimensions, and facial resemblance to random, extreme, and syndromic gestalts within a GWAS of 8,426 individuals of recent European ancestry. Inter-landmark distances exhibit the highest SNP-based heritability as estimated via LD score regression, followed by AE dimensions. Conversely, resemblance scores to extreme and syndromic facial gestalts display the lowest heritability, in line with expectations. Notably, the aggregation of multiple GWASs on facial resemblance to random gestalts reveals the highest number of independent genetic loci. This novel, easy-to-implement phenotyping approach holds significant promise for capturing genetically relevant morphological traits derived from complex biomedical imaging datasets, and its applications extend beyond faces. Nevertheless, these different phenotyping strategies capture different genetic influences on craniofacial shape. Thus, it remains valuable to explore these strategies individually and in combination to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors underlying craniofacial shape and related traits.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) is an important genomic biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment, and sequencing-based approaches are often applied to identify MSI because of its fastness and efficiency. These approaches, however, may fail to identify MSI on one or more sub-clones for certain cancers with a high degree of heterogeneity, leading to erroneous diagnoses and unsuitable treatments. Besides, the computational cost of identifying sub-clonal MSI can be exponentially increased when multiple sub-clones with different length distributions share MSI status. Herein, this paper proposes “scMSI”, an accurate and efficient estimation of sub-clonal MSI to identify the microsatellite status. scMSI is an integrative Bayesian method to deconvolute the mixed-length distribution of sub-clones by a novel alternating iterative optimization procedure based on a subtle generative model. During the process of deconvolution, the optimized division of each sub-clone is attained by a heuristic algorithm, aligning with clone proportions that adhere optimally to the sample’s clonal structure. To evaluate the performance, 16 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer, exhibiting positive responses to the treatment despite having negative MSI status based on sequencing-based approaches, were considered. Excitingly, scMSI reported MSI on sub-clones successfully, and the findings matched the conclusions on immunohistochemistry. In addition, testing results on a series of experiments with simulation datasets concerning a variety of impact factors demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of scMSI in detecting MSI on sub-clones over existing approaches. scMSI provides a new way of detecting MSI for cancers with a high degree of heterogeneity.

When making risky choices in social contexts, humans typically combine social information with individual preferences about the options at stake. It remains unknown how such decisions are made when these preferences are inaccessible or disrupted, as might be the case for individuals confronting novel options or experiencing cognitive impairment. Thus, we examined participants with lesions in insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, key regions implicated in risky decision-making, as they played a gambling task where choices were made both alone and after observing others’ choices. Participants in both lesion groups showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options. For socially situated decisions, these participants showed increased conformity with the choices of others, independent from social utility-based computations. These findings suggest that in social contexts, following others’ choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted.

                <p>by Lalit Pandey, Donsuk Lee, Samantha M. W. Wood, Justin N. Wood</p>

How do newborns learn to see? We propose that visual systems are space-time fitters, meaning visual development can be understood as a blind fitting process (akin to evolution) in which visual systems gradually adapt to the spatiotemporal data distributions in the newborn’s environment. To test whether space-time fitting is a viable theory for learning how to see, we performed parallel controlled-rearing experiments on newborn chicks and deep neural networks (DNNs), including CNNs and transformers. First, we raised newborn chicks in impoverished environments containing a single object, then simulated those environments in a video game engine. Second, we recorded first-person images from agents moving through the virtual animal chambers and used those images to train DNNs. Third, we compared the viewpoint-invariant object recognition performance of the chicks and DNNs. When DNNs received the same visual diet (training data) as chicks, the models developed common object recognition skills as chicks. DNNs that used time as a teaching signal—space-time fitters—also showed common patterns of successes and failures across the test viewpoints as chicks. Thus, DNNs can learn object recognition in the same impoverished environments as newborn animals. We argue that space-time fitters can serve as formal scientific models of newborn visual systems, providing image-computable models for studying how newborns learn to see from raw visual experiences.

Simulations of large-scale brain dynamics are often impacted by overexcitation resulting from heavy-tailed structural network distributions, leading to biologically implausible simulation results. We implement a homeodynamic plasticity mechanism, known from other modeling work, in the widely used Jansen-Rit neural mass model for The Virtual Brain (TVB) simulation framework. We aim at heterogeneously adjusting the inhibitory coupling weights to reach desired dynamic regimes in each brain region. We show that, by using this dynamic approach, we can control the target activity level to obtain biologically plausible brain simulations, including post-synaptic potentials and blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity. We demonstrate that the derived dynamic Feedback Inhibitory Control (dFIC) can be used to enable increased variability of model dynamics. We derive the conditions under which the simulated brain activity converges to a predefined target level analytically and via simulations. We highlight the benefits of dFIC in the context of fitting the TVB model to static and dynamic measures of fMRI empirical data, accounting for global synchronization across the whole brain. The proposed novel method helps computational neuroscientists, especially TVB users, to easily “tune” brain models to desired dynamical regimes depending on the specific requirements of each study. The presented method is a steppingstone towards increased biological realism in brain network models and a valuable tool to better understand their underlying behavior.

                <p>by Maciej Majka, Nils B. Becker, Pieter Rein ten Wolde, Marcin Zagorski, Thomas R. Sokolowski</p>

Gene expression patterns in developing organisms are established by groups of cross-regulating target genes that are driven by morphogen gradients. As development progresses, morphogen activity is reduced, leaving the emergent pattern without stabilizing positional cues and at risk of rapid deterioration due to the inherently noisy biochemical processes at the cellular level. But remarkably, gene expression patterns remain spatially stable and reproducible over long developmental time spans in many biological systems. Here we combine spatial-stochastic simulations with an enhanced sampling method (Non-Stationary Forward Flux Sampling) and a recently developed stability theory to address how spatiotemporal integrity of a gene expression pattern is maintained in developing tissue lacking morphogen gradients. Using a minimal embryo model consisting of spatially coupled biochemical reactor volumes, we study a prototypical stripe pattern in which weak cross-repression between nearest neighbor expression domains alternates with strong repression between next-nearest neighbor domains, inspired by the gap gene system in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. We find that tuning of the weak repressive interactions to an optimal level can prolong stability of the expression patterns by orders of magnitude, enabling stable patterns over developmentally relevant times in the absence of morphogen gradients. The optimal parameter regime found in simulations of the embryo model closely agrees with the predictions of our coarse-grained stability theory. To elucidate the origin of stability, we analyze a reduced phase space defined by two measures of pattern asymmetry. We find that in the optimal regime, intact patterns are protected via restoring forces that counteract random perturbations and give rise to a metastable basin. Together, our results demonstrate that metastable attractors can emerge as a property of stochastic gene expression patterns even without system-wide positional cues, provided that the gene regulatory interactions shaping the pattern are optimally tuned.

                <p>by Anna N. Osiecka, Przemysław Bryndza, Elodie F. Briefer, Katarzyna Wojczulanis-Jakubas</p>

How well does the information contained in vocal signals travel through the environment? To assess the efficiency of information transfer in little auk (<i>Alle alle</i>, an Arctic seabird) calls over distance, we selected two of the social call types with the highest potential for individuality coding. Using available recordings of known individuals, we calculated the apparent source levels, with apparent maximum peak sound pressure level (ASPL) of 63 dB re 20 μPa at 1 m for both call types. Further, we created a sound attenuation model using meteorological data collected in the vicinity of the little auk colony in Hornsund, Spitsbergen. Using this model, we modelled the calls to reflect higher frequency filtering and sound level loss occurring during spherical spreading in perfect local conditions, down to the putative hearing threshold of the species, calculated to equal ASPL of signals “propagated” to roughly one kilometre. Those modelled calls were then used in a permuted discriminant function analysis, support vector machine models, and linear models of Beecher’s information statistic, to investigate whether transmission loss will affect the retention of individual information of the signal. Calls could be correctly classified to individuals above chance level independently of the distance, down to and over the putative physiological hearing threshold. Interestingly, the information capacity of the signal did not decrease with its filtering and attenuation. While this study touches on signal properties purely and cannot provide evidence of the actual use by the animals, it shows that little auk signals can theoretically travel long distances with negligible information loss, and supports the hypothesis that vocalisations could facilitate long-distance communication in the species.

The intestinal epithelium is a polarized monolayer of cells, with an apical side facing the lumen and a basal side facing the blood stream. In mice, both proteins and mRNAs have been shown to exhibit global basal-apical polarization; however, polarization in the human intestine has not been systematically explored. Here, we employed laser-capture microdissection to isolate apical and basal epithelial segments from intestinal tissues of 8 individuals and performed RNA sequencing and mass-spectrometry proteomics. We find a substantial polarization of mRNA molecules that largely overlaps polarization patterns observed in mice. This mRNA polarization remains consistent across different zones of the intestinal villi and is generally correlated with the polarization of proteins. Our protein analysis exposes streamlined intracellular nutrient transport and processing and reveals that mitochondria and ribosomes are less polarized in humans compared to mice. Our study provides a resource for understanding human intestinal epithelial biology.

                <p>by Xiaoyu Tian, Hanyu Wang, Song Liu, Wei Liu, Kaiyue Zhang, Xiaohan Gao, Qingchao Li, Huijie Zhao, Liangran Zhang, Peiwei Liu, Min Liu, Youjun Wang, Xueliang Zhu, Rutao Cui, Jun Zhou</p>

Production of melanin pigments is a protective mechanism of the skin against ultraviolet (UV)-induced damage and carcinogenesis. However, the molecular basis for melanogenesis is still poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate a critical interplay between the primary cilium and the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) signaling. Our data show that UV and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) trigger cilium formation in human melanocytes and melanoma cells. Deficiency of MC1R or the presence of its red hair color (RHC) variations significantly attenuates the UV/α-MSH-induced ciliogenesis. Further investigation reveals that MC1R enters the cilium upon UV/α-MSH stimulation, which is facilitated by the interaction of MC1R with the BBSome and the palmitoylation of MC1R. MC1R interacts with the BBSome through the second and third intercellular loops, which contain the common RHC variant alleles (R151C and R160W). These RHC variants of MC1R exhibit attenuated ciliary localization, and enforced ciliary localization of these variants elevates melanogenesis. Ciliary MC1R triggers a sustained cAMP signaling and selectively stimulates Sox9, which appears to up-regulate melanogenesis-related genes as the transcriptional cofactor for MITF. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized nexus between MC1R and cilia and suggest an important mechanism for RHC variant-related pigmentary defects.

                <p>by Xitong Chen, Stephanie C. Leach, Juniper Hollis, Dillan Cellier, Kai Hwang</p>

Cognitive flexibility relies on hierarchically structured task representations that organize task contexts, relevant environmental features, and subordinate decisions. Despite ongoing interest in the human thalamus, its role in cognitive control has been understudied. This study explored thalamic representation and thalamocortical interactions that contribute to hierarchical cognitive control in humans. We found that several thalamic nuclei, including the anterior, mediodorsal, ventrolateral, and pulvinar nuclei, exhibited stronger evoked responses when subjects switch between task contexts. Decoding analysis revealed that thalamic activity encodes task contexts within the hierarchical task representations. To determine how thalamocortical interactions contribute to task representations, we developed a thalamocortical functional interaction model to predict task-related cortical representation. This data-driven model outperformed comparison models, particularly in predicting activity patterns in cortical regions that encode context representations. Collectively, our findings highlight the significant contribution of thalamic activity and thalamocortical interactions for contextually guided hierarchical cognitive control.

Active conductances tune the kinetics of axonal action potentials (APs) to support specialized functions of neuron types. However, the temporal characteristics of voltage signals strongly depend on the size of neuronal structures, as capacitive and resistive effects slow down voltage discharges in the membranes of small elements. Axonal action potentials are particularly sensitive to these inherent biophysical effects because of the large diameter variabilities within individual axons, potentially implying bouton size-dependent synaptic effects. However, using direct patch-clamp recordings and voltage imaging in small hippocampal axons in acute slices from rat brains, we demonstrate that AP shapes remain uniform within the same axons, even across an order of magnitude difference in caliber. Our results show that smaller axonal structures have more Kv1 potassium channels that locally re-accelerate AP repolarization and contribute to size-independent APs, while they do not preclude the plasticity of AP shapes. Thus, size-independent axonal APs ensure consistent digital signals for each synapse within axons of same types.

                <p>by Rosanna C. T. Wright, A. Jamie Wood, Michael J. Bottery, Katie J. Muddiman, Steve Paterson, Ellie Harrison, Michael A. Brockhurst, James P. J. Hall</p>

Plasmids are important vectors of horizontal gene transfer in microbial communities but can impose a burden on the bacteria that carry them. Such plasmid fitness costs are thought to arise principally from conflicts between chromosomal- and plasmid-encoded molecular machineries, and thus can be ameliorated by compensatory mutations (CMs) that reduce or resolve the underlying causes. CMs can arise on plasmids (i.e., plaCM) or on chromosomes (i.e., chrCM), with contrasting predicted effects upon plasmid success and subsequent gene transfer because plaCM can also reduce fitness costs in plasmid recipients, whereas chrCM can potentially ameliorate multiple distinct plasmids. Here, we develop theory and a novel experimental system to directly compare the ecological effects of plaCM and chrCM that arose during evolution experiments between Pseudomonas <i>fluorescens</i> SBW25 and its sympatric mercury resistance megaplasmid pQBR57. We show that while plaCM was predicted to succeed under a broader range of parameters in mathematical models, chrCM dominated in our experiments, including conditions with numerous recipients, due to a more efficacious mechanism of compensation, and advantages arising from transmission of costly plasmids to competitors (plasmid “weaponisation”). We show analytically the presence of a mixed Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) regime for CMs, driven by trade-offs with horizontal transmission, that offers one possible explanation for the observed failure of plaCM to dominate even in competition against an uncompensated plasmid. Our results reveal broader implications of plasmid-bacterial evolution for plasmid ecology, demonstrating the importance of specific compensatory mutations for resistance gene spread. One consequence of the superiority of chrCM over plaCM is the likely emergence in microbial communities of compensated bacteria that can act as “hubs” for plasmid accumulation and dissemination.

                <p>by Sarah Wettstadt, Francisco J. Marcos-Torres, Joaquín R. Otero-Asman, Alicia García-Puente, Álvaro Ortega, María A. Llamas</p>

Competitive bacteria like the human pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> can acquire iron from different iron carriers, which are usually internalized via outer membrane TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs). Production of TBDRs is promoted by the presence of the substrate. This regulation often entails a signal transfer pathway known as cell-surface signaling (CSS) that involves the TBDR itself that also functions as transducer (and is thus referred to as TBDT), a cytoplasmic membrane-bound anti-σ factor, and an extracytoplasmic function σ (σ<sup>ECF</sup>) factor. TBDTs contain an extra N-terminal domain known as signaling domain (SD) required for the signal transfer activity of these receptors. In the current CSS model, presence of the signal allows the interaction between the TBDT and the anti-σ factor in the periplasm, promoting the proteolysis of the anti-σ factor and in turn the σ<sup>ECF</sup>-dependent transcription of response genes, including the TBDT gene. However, recent evidence shows that σ<sup>ECF</sup> activity does not depend on this interaction, suggesting that the contact between these 2 proteins fulfills a different role. Using the <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> Fox CSS system as model, we show here that the SD of the FoxA TBDT already interacts with the C-terminal domain of the FoxR anti-σ factor in absence of the signal. This interaction protects FoxR from proteolysis in turn preventing transcription of σ<sup>FoxI</sup>-dependent genes. By structural modeling of the FoxR/FoxA<sup>SD</sup> interaction, we have identified the interaction sites between these 2 proteins and provide the molecular details of this interaction. We furthermore show that to exert this protective role, FoxA undergoes proteolytic cleavage, denoting a change in the paradigm of the current CSS model.

                <p>by Xin Yuan, Hailiang Li, Fang Guo</p>

Organisms detect temperature signals through peripheral neurons, which relay them to central circadian networks to drive adaptive behaviors. Despite recent advances in <i>Drosophila</i> research, how circadian circuits integrate temperature cues with circadian signals to regulate sleep/wake patterns remains unclear. In this study, we used the FlyWire brain electron microscopy connectome to map neuronal connections, identifying lateral posterior neurons LPNs as key nodes for integrating temperature information into the circadian network. LPNs receive input from both circadian and temperature-sensing neurons, promoting sleep behavior. Through connectome analysis, genetic manipulation, and behavioral assays, we demonstrated that LPNs, downstream of thermo-sensitive anterior cells (ACs), suppress activity-promoting lateral dorsal neurons LNds via the AstC pathway, inducing sleep Disrupting LPN-LNd communication through either <i>AstCR1</i> RNAi in LNds or in an <i>AstCR1</i> mutant significantly impairs the heat-induced reduction in the evening activity peak. Conversely, optogenetic calcium imaging and behavioral assays revealed that cold-activated LNds subsequently stimulate LPNs through NPF-NPFR signaling, establishing a negative feedback loop. This feedback mechanism limits LNd activation to appropriate levels, thereby fine-tuning the evening peak increase at lower temperatures. In conclusion, our study constructed a comprehensive connectome centered on LPNs and identified a novel peptidergic circadian feedback circuit that coordinates temperature and circadian signals, offering new insights into the regulation of sleep patterns in <i>Drosophila</i>.

                <p>by Jonathan M. Werner, Jesse Gillis</p>

Human neural organoids offer an exciting opportunity for studying inaccessible human-specific brain development; however, it remains unclear how precisely organoids recapitulate fetal/primary tissue biology. We characterize field-wide replicability and biological fidelity through a meta-analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for first and second trimester human primary brain (2.95 million cells, 51 data sets) and neural organoids (1.59 million cells, 173 data sets). We quantify the degree primary tissue cell type marker expression and co-expression are recapitulated in organoids across 10 different protocol types. By quantifying gene-level preservation of primary tissue co-expression, we show neural organoids lie on a spectrum ranging from virtually no signal to co-expression indistinguishable from primary tissue, demonstrating a high degree of variability in biological fidelity among organoid systems. Our preserved co-expression framework provides cell type-specific measures of fidelity applicable to diverse neural organoids, offering a powerful tool for uncovering unifying axes of variation across heterogeneous neural organoid experiments.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has generated significant impacts on the forestry sector. Employment layoffs have led to an increase in return migration, resulting in additional labor supply and heightened family economic burdens. This research employs the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) framework to examine and predict sustainable forest management practices among families managing customary forests and village forests in Bali. Methods Purposive sampling was used to collect data from 71 managers of customary forests and village forests in Tenganan and Wanagiri. Partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the acquired data. Results The findings demonstrated that TPB can explain the sustainable forest management. The incorporation of an additional construct, Tri Hita Karana (THK), enhanced the model’s predictive power for both managerial intentions and behaviors in sustainable forest management. Specifically, THK influences management intentions through the mediation of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Conclusions This study established that THK, a fundamental value system in Balinese society, serves an antecedent predictor of behavioral intentions toward sustainable forest management. The relationship between THK and sustainable forest management intentions is mediated by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. This research makes significant theoretical and managerial contributions. First, it validates the established TPB framework within the context of COVID-19’s impact in Bali. Additionally, it provides scholars with insights for identifying other potential constructs that may influence forest land managers’ behavior.

                Background The purpose of the study was to assess the obstacles faced by diabetes patients in their self-care and determine the factors associated with these obstacles. The management of diabetes mellitus (DM) extends beyond the clinician’s efforts, with the responsibility of the care also being shared by the patient to achieve better treatment outcomes and prevent complications. Self-care management is the most important part of DM treatment, which includes diet, regular exercise, blood glucose monitoring, medication and foot care. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 107 type 2 DM patients aged >18 years using the Diabetes Obstacles Questionnaire-30. Patients scoring a mean response score >3 were considered to have an obstacle. We included age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), duration of DM and blood glucose levels as factors for regression analysis and a P value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results A large majority (64.5%, n = 69) of our participants were aged above 55 years and belonged to lower socio-economic status (65.4%, n = 70). Family history of DM was present in 41% (n=44) of the participants. The median duration of DM among the participant was 10 (4 – 7) years. In our study, the participants faced obstacles for two items in the domains: Support from Friends & Family (mean score: 3.73) and Knowledge of the Disease (mean score: 3.58). A multinominal regression analysis revealed SES was predictive of participants who could not understand information from literature with a P. value of 0.002 (OR: 3.65, CI: 1.60-8.338). Conclusion The two major obstacles to self-management practices that were identified were in the domains of Support from Friends and Family, and Knowledge of the Disease. Socioeconomic status was identified to be a predictive factor associated with the participants who are not able to understand information from the literature.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98449">Human airway macrophages are metabolically reprogrammed by IFN-γ resulting in glycolysis-dependent functional plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Airway macrophages (AM) are the predominant immune cell in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection, making them a target for host directed therapy. Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism. A knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, especially in lung resident AM. We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM; as a model of blood derived macrophages) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM do not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94706">Ligand response of guanidine-IV riboswitch at single-molecule level</a></h4>

              
                Riboswitches represent a class of non-coding RNA that possess the unique ability to specifically bind ligands and, in response, regulate gene expression. A recent report unveiled a type of riboswitch, known as the guanidine-IV riboswitch, which responds to guanidine levels to regulate downstream genetic transcription. However, the precise molecular mechanism through which the riboswitch senses its target ligand and undergoes conformational changes remain elusive. This gap in understanding has impeded the potential applications of this riboswitch. To bridge this knowledge gap, our study investigated the conformational dynamics of the guanidine-IV riboswitch RNA upon ligand binding. We employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to dissect the behaviors of the aptamer, terminator, and full-length riboswitch. Our findings indicated that the aptamer portion exhibited higher sensitivity to guanidine compared to the terminator and full-length constructs. Additionally, we utilized Position-specific Labelling of RNA (PLOR) combined with smFRET to observe, at the single-nucleotide and single-molecule level, the structural transitions experienced by the guanidine-IV riboswitch during transcription. Notably, we discovered that the influence of guanidine on the riboswitch RNA’s conformations was significantly reduced after the transcription of 88 nucleotides. Furthermore, we proposed a folding model for the guanidine-IV riboswitch in the absence and presence of guanidine, thereby providing insights into its ligand-response mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97793">The neural dynamics of positive and negative expectations of pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain is heavily modulated by expectations. Whereas the integration of expectations with sensory information has been examined in some detail, little is known about how positive and negative expectations are generated and their neural dynamics from generation over anticipation to the integration with sensory information. The present preregistered study employed a novel paradigm to induce positive and negative expectations on a trial-by-trial basis and examined the neural mechanisms using combined EEG-fMRI measurements (n=50). We observed substantially different neural representations between the anticipatory and the actual pain period. In the anticipation phase i.e., before the nociceptive input, the insular cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed increased activity for directed expectations regardless of their valence. Interestingly, a differentiation between positive and negative expectations within the majority of areas only occurred after the arrival of nociceptive information. FMRI-informed EEG analyses could reliably track the temporal sequence of processing showing an early effect in the DLPFC, followed by the anterior insula and late effects in the ACC. The observed effects indicate the involvement of different expectation-related subprocesses, including the transformation of visual information into a value signal that is maintained and differentiated according to its valence only during stimulus processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94703">Taste triggers a homeostatic temperature control in hungry flies</a></h4>

              
                Hungry animals consistently show a desire to obtain food. Even a brief sensory detection of food can trigger bursts of physiological and behavioral changes. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the sensation of food triggers the acute behavioral response remain elusive. We have previously shown in <i>Drosophila</i> that hunger drives a preference for low temperature. Because <i>Drosophila</i> is a small ectotherm, a preference for low temperature implies a low body temperature and a low metabolic rate. Here, we show that taste-sensing triggers a switch from a low to a high temperature preference in hungry flies. We show that taste stimulation by artificial sweeteners or optogenetics triggers an acute warm preference, but is not sufficient to reach the fed state. Instead, nutrient intake is required to reach the fed state. The data suggest that starvation recovery is controlled by two components: taste-evoked and nutrient-induced warm preferences, and that taste and nutrient quality play distinct roles in starvation recovery. Animals are motivated to eat based on time of day or hunger. We found that clock genes and hunger signals profoundly control the taste-evoked warm preferences. Thus, our data suggest that the taste-evoked response is one of the critical layers of regulatory mechanisms representing internal energy homeostasis and metabolism.

">Environmental exposures and familial background alter the induction of neuropathology and inflammation after SARS-CoV-2 infection.</a></h4>

              
                Basal ganglia disease has been reported as a post-infection sequela of several viruses, with documentation of this phenomenon from the H1N1 Spanish flu to the recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein-based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA-based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.

">A signal of temporal integration in the human auditory brain: psychological insights, EEG evidence, and clinical application</a></h4>

              
                Temporal integration, the process by which the auditory system combines sound information over a curtain period to form a coherent auditory object, is essential for coherent auditory perception, yet its neural mechanisms remain underexplored. We use a "transitional click train" paradigm, which concatenates two click trains with slightly differing inter-click intervals (ICIs), to investigate temporal integration in the human cortex. Using a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG), we recorded responses from 42 healthy participants exposed to regular and irregular transitional click trains and conducted change detection tasks. Regular transitional click trains elicited significant change responses in the human cortex, indicative of temporal integration, whereas irregular trains did not. These neural responses were modulated by ICI length, ICI contrast, and regularity. Behavioral data mirrored EEG findings, showing enhanced detection for regular conditions compared to irregular conditions and pure tones. Furthermore, variations in change responses were associated with decision-making processes. Temporal continuity was critical, as introducing gaps between click trains diminished both behavioral and neural responses. In clinical assessments, 22 coma patients exhibited diminished or absent change responses, effectively distinguishing them from healthy individuals. Our findings identify distinct neural markers of temporal integration and highlight the potential of transitional click trains for clinical diagnostics.

">RIG-I mediated neuron-specific IFN type 1 signaling in FUS-ALS induces neurodegeneration and offers new biomarker-driven individualized treatment options for (FUS-)ALS</a></h4>

              
                Recent research has demonstrated significant aberrant activation of the innate immune system in ALS model systems due to mutations in SOD1, TARDBP and C9orf72 through stimulation of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway. This pathway can be activated, for example, by cGAS-STING-dependent sensing of cytosolic DNA that accumulates as a result of chronic DNA damage and defective mitochondria, both of which have been identified as early pathology in FUS-ALS spinal motor neurons (sMNs). Therefore, we analysed innate immune pathways in isogenic and non-isogenic FUSmut iPSC-derived sMNs, which revealed upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and activation of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway in FUSmut sMNs. Notably, we found evidence for accumulation of cytosolic dsRNA and its sensor RIG-I in FUS-ALS. RIG-I, but not MDA5, was found to be significantly upregulated in FUSmut sMNs, and siRNA-mediated knockdown abolished the increased IFN1 activation in FUSmut sMNs. In post-mortem analysis, RIG-I was highly expressed in the remaining alpha-MNs. IFN treatment of FUSwt sMNs phenocopied the axonal degeneration of FUSmut sMNs. Mechanistically, DNA damage induction did not increase ISG expression, but dsRNA was increased in the mitochondria of FUSmut sMNs. Mitochondrial transcription, a known source of dsRNA, was found to be upregulated in compartmental axonal RNAseq analysis and its inhibition reduced ISGs in FUS-ALS sMNs. Furthermore, the JAK-STAT inhibitor ruxolitinib alleviated the upregulated ISG expression and reversed the axonal degeneration of sMNs. Finally, we analysed ISG expression in peripheral blood samples from 18 FUS-ALS patients, eight of whom had a significantly elevated interferon signature. Blood ISGs correlated with disease progression rate and negatively with disease duration. RIG-I-mediated innate immune activation in sMNs may be an interesting novel individualised biomarker-driven therapeutic target in (FUS-) ALS.

">Early-life adversity alters adult nucleus incertus neurons: implications for neuronal mechanisms of increased stress and compulsive behavior vulnerability</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Early-life stress (ELS) arising from physical and emotional abuse disrupts normal brain development and impairs hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, increasing the risk of psychopathological disorders and compulsive behaviors in adulthood. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The brainstem nucleus incertus (NI) is a highly stress-sensitive locus, involved in behavioral activation and stress-induced reward (food/alcohol) seeking, but its sensitivity to ELS remains unexplored. METHODS: We used neonatal maternal separation stress in rats as a model for ELS and examined its impact on stress-related mRNA and neuropeptide expression in the NI, using fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Using whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings we determined the influence of ELS on the synaptic activity, excitability, and electrophysiological properties of NI neurons. Using c-Fos protein expression we also assessed the impact of ELS on the sensitivity of NI neurons to acute restraint stress in adulthood. RESULTS: ELS weakened the acute stress responsiveness of NI neurons, and caused dendritic shrinkage, impaired synaptic transmission and altered electrophysiological properties of NI neurons in a cell-type-specific manner. Additionally, ELS increased the expression of mRNA encoding corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 and the nerve-growth factor receptor, TrkA in adult NI. CONCLUSIONS: The multiple, cell-type specific changes in the expression of neuropeptides and molecules associated with stress and substance abuse in the NI, as well as impairments in NI neuron morphology and electrophysiology caused by early-life stress and observed in the adult brain, may contribute to the increased susceptibility to stress and compulsive behaviors observed in individuals with a history of ELS.

">How much is 'enough'? Considerations for functional connectivity reliability in pediatric naturalistic fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) measurements are important for robust and reproducible findings, yet pediatric functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) faces unique challenges due to head motion and bias toward shorter scans. Passive viewing conditions during fMRI offer advantages for scanning pediatric populations, but FC reliability under these conditions remains underexplored. Here, we used precision fMRI data collected across three passive viewing conditions to directly compare FC reliability profiles between 25 pre-adolescent children and 25 adults, with each participant providing over 2.8 hours of data over four sessions. We found that FC test-retest correlations increased asymptotically with scan length, with children requiring nearly twice the post-censored scan time (24.6 minutes) compared to adults (14.4 minutes) to achieve comparable reliability, and that this effect was only partly attributable to head motion. Reliability differences between lower-motion adults and higher-motion children were spatially non-uniform and largest in ventral anterior temporal and frontal regions. While averaging features within functional networks improved intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) reliability, values for higher-motion children remained in the poor-to-fair ICC range even with 48 minutes of total scan time. Viewing conditions with greater engagement reduced head motion in children but had lower FC reliability compared to less engaging 'low-demand' videos, suggesting complex state- or condition-related trade-offs. These findings have important implications for developmental neuroimaging study design, particularly for higher motion pediatric populations.

                Making decisions based on noisy sensory information is a crucial function of the brain. Various decisions take each sensory signal's uncertainty into account. Here, we investigated whether perceptual inferences rely on accurate estimates of sensory uncertainty. Participants completed a set of auditory, visual, and audiovisual spatial as well as temporal tasks. We fitted Bayesian observer models of each task to every participant's complete dataset. Crucially, in some model variants the uncertainty estimates employed for perceptual inferences were independent of the actual uncertainty associated with the sensory signals. Model comparisons and analysis of the best-fitting parameters revealed that, in unimodal and bimodal contexts, participants' perceptual decisions relied on overconfident estimates of auditory spatial and audiovisual temporal uncertainty. These findings challenge the ubiquitous assumption that human behavior optimally accounts for sensory uncertainty regardless of sensory domain.

                We demonstrate here that astrocytes in the striatum interact with striatal dopamine in bidirectional signaling with dopamine release actively driving surges in astrocytic Ca++, which in turn modulate and reduce subsequent dopamine release. These Ca++ surges accurately predict behavioral state changes from task-engaged to task-disengaged states, but fail to predict detailed action parameters. We propose that interactions between striatal astrocytes and dopamine are strong candidates to modulate nigro-striato-nigral loop function underlying on-going behavioral state dynamics.

">Reproducible Brain Entropy (BEN) Alterations During Rumination</a></h4>

              
                Rumination, characterized by recurrent and repetitive thinking, is closely associated with mental disorders such as depression. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this mental state remain poorly understood. In this study, we use a relatively novel neuroimaging analysis method-Brain Entropy (BEN) to quantitatively assess the irregularity, disorder, and complexity of brain activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of rumination. We utilized a publicly available MRI dataset from three different scanners. The dataset included 41 healthy adult participants who completed identical fMRI tasks on IPCASGE, PKUGE, and PKUSIEMENS scanners. The time interval between the two visits was 22.0 +/- 14.6 days. The fMRI session included four runs: resting state, sad memory, rumination, and distraction. Whole brain voxel-wise BEN differences of task state and resting state, rumination and sad memory, distraction and sad memory, and rumination and distraction were tested and overlap regions after thresholded (p<0.05) across the three scanners were identified as exhibiting significant differences. The results demonstrate distinct alterations in BEN across mental states. Compared to the sad memory condition, decreased BEN was found in the visual cortex (VC) during rumination and decreased BEN in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu) during distraction. However, when compared to distraction, rumination showed increased BEN in the PCC/PCu. These findings suggest that rumination involves heightened internal focus and reduced processing of external environmental information. This study highlights BEN as a valuable metric for elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying rumination and its role in depression.

Using unbiased proteomics, we identified the epilepsy and intellectual disability-associated VGCC auxiliary subunit 2{delta}1 as a candidate extracellular AMPAR slot. Presynaptic 2{delta}1 deletion in CA3 affects synaptic AMPAR incorporation during long-term potentiation, but not basal synaptic transmission, at CA1 synapses. Consistently, mice lacking 2{delta}1 in CA3 display a specific impairment in CA1-dependent spatial memory, but not in memory tests involving other cortical regions. Decreased seizure susceptibility in mice lacking 2{delta}1 in CA3 suggests a regulation of circuit excitability by 2{delta}1/AMPAR interactions. Our study sheds light on the regulation of activity-dependent AMPAR trafficking, and highlights the synaptic organizing roles of 2{delta}1

">ARBEL: A Machine Learning Tool with Light-Based Image Analysis for Automatic Classification of 3D Pain Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                A detailed analysis of pain-related behaviors in rodents is essential for exploring both the mechanisms of pain and evaluating analgesic efficacy. With the advancement of pose-estimation tools, automatic single-camera video animal behavior pipelines are growing and integrating rapidly into quantitative behavioral research. However, current existing algorithms do not consider an animals body-part contact intensity with- and distance from- the surface, a critical nuance for measuring certain pain-related responses like paw withdrawals (flinching) with high accuracy and interpretability. Quantifying these bouts demands a high degree of attention to body part movement and currently relies on laborious and subjective human visual assessment. Here, we introduce a supervised machine learning algorithm, ARBEL: Automated Recognition of Behavior Enhanced with Light, that utilizes a combination of pose estimation together with a novel light-based analysis of body part pressure and distance from the surface, to automatically score pain-related behaviors in freely moving mice in three dimensions. We show the utility and accuracy of this algorithm for capturing a range of pain-related behavioral bouts using a bottom-up animal behavior platform, and its application for robust drug-screening. It allows for rapid objective pain behavior scoring over extended periods with high precision. This open-source algorithm is adaptable for detecting diverse behaviors across species and experimental platforms.

">Voluntary locomotion induces an early and remote hemodynamic decrease in the large cerebral veins</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Behavior regulates dural and cerebral vessels, with spontaneous locomotion inducing dural vessel constriction and increasing stimulus-evoked cerebral hemodynamic responses. It is vital to investigate the function of different vascular network components, surrounding and within the brain, to better understand the role of the neurovascular unit in health and neurodegeneration. Aim: We characterized locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses across vascular compartments of the whisker barrel cortex: artery, vein, parenchyma, draining and meningeal vein. Approach: Using 2D-OIS, hemodynamic responses during locomotion were recorded in 9-12-month-old awake mice: wild-type, Alzheimer's disease (AD), atherosclerosis or mixed (atherosclerosis/AD) models. Within somatosensory cortex, responses were taken from pial vessels inside the whisker barrel region ([WBR]: "whisker artery" and "whisker vein"), a large vein from the sagittal sinus adjacent to the WBR (draining vein), and meningeal vessels from the dura mater (which do not penetrate cortical tissue). Results: We demonstrate that locomotion evokes an initial decrease in total hemoglobin (HbT) within the draining vein before the increase in HbT within WBR vessels. The locomotion event size influences the magnitude of the HbT increase in the pial vessels of the WBR, but not of the early HbT decrease within the draining veins. Following locomotion onset, an early HbT decrease was also observed in the overlying meningeal vessels, which unlike within the cortex did not go on to exceed baseline HbT levels during the remainder of the locomotion response. We show that locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses are altered in disease in the draining vein and whisker artery, suggesting this could be an important neurodegeneration biomarker. Conclusion: This initial reduction in HbT within the draining and meningeal veins potentially serves as a 'space saving' mechanism, allowing for large increases in cortical HbT associated with locomotion. Given this mechanism is impacted by disease it may provide an important target for vascular-based therapeutic interventions.

">Similarity in Early Life Stress Exposure is Associated with Similarity in Neural Representations in Early Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Early life stress (ELS) has profound implications for developmental trajectories, yet the neural mechanisms underlying its long-term effects remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we examined whether interindividual similarity in ELS exposure aligns with similarity in neural representations and behavioral task performance in early adulthood. Leveraging a 20-year longitudinal dataset of Finnish families, we evaluated 87 young adults who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotional go/no-go task. Intersubject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA) was used to assess the associations between pairwise similarities in prospectively or retrospectively measured ELS, neural representations in 360 cortical regions, and task performance. We incorporated multidimensional scaling and Procrustes alignment to visualize interindividual differences in representational spaces. Prospective ELS, but not Retrospective ELS, was significantly associated with neural representational similarity across 40 cortical regions, including the anterior insula, frontal operculum, and anterior cingulate cortex. Higher Prospective ELS was also linked to reduced detection sensitivity, mediated by neural responses to angry facial expressions. These findings highlight the systematic and chronic effects of more moderate ELS on brain development and emphasize the value of prospective measurements and advanced similarity analyses in capturing the nuanced influences of ELS. By integrating spatial and shape analytical techniques, the present study provides new insights into the long-term neurobiological correlates of ELS and introduces novel methodological tools for neurodevelopmental research.

">The effects of varying intensities of unilateral handgrip fatigue on bilateral movement</a></h4>

              
                The human ability to maintain adequate movement quality despite muscle fatigue is of critical importance to master physically demanding activities of daily life and for retaining independence following motor impairments. Many real-life situations call for asymmetrical activation of extremity muscles leading to unilateral manifestations of muscle fatigue. Repeated unilateral handgrip contractions at submaximal force have been shown to be associated with neural dynamics in both contralateral and ipsilateral cortical motor areas and improved response times of the contralateral, unfatigued homologue in a button-press task. However, it remains unclear whether the observed improvement in contralateral response latency translates into higher-level benefits in movement quality. To investigate this, 30 healthy participants underwent unilateral handgrip fatiguing tasks at 5%, 50%, and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force. Subsequently, bimanual movement quality was assessed in an object-hit task using a Kinarm robot. The protocol at 50% and 75% of MVC elicited clear signs of muscle fatigue compared to the control condition (5%) measured by a decline in force, post-exercise deterioration in MVC, characteristic changes in surface electromyography magnitudes, and increases in ratings of perceived exertion. No change was observed on kinematic measures in the object-hit task for both arms indicating that unilateral handgrip fatigue did not elicit measurable effects on higher-level movement quality on the ipsilateral or contralateral homologue. Previously reported improvements on contralateral response latency were not found to translate into advanced movement quality benefits.

">Decoding task representations that support generalization in hierarchical task</a></h4>

              
                Task knowledge is encoded hierarchically such that complex tasks are composed of simpler tasks. This compositional organization also supports generalization to facilitate learning of related but novel complex tasks. To study how the brain implements composition and generalization in hierarchical task learning, we trained human participants on two complex tasks that shared a simple task and tested them on a novel complex task whose composition could be inferred via the shared simple task. Behaviorally, we observed faster learning of the novel complex task than control tasks (i.e., behavioral generalization effect). Using electroencephalogram (EEG) data, we could decode the constituent simple tasks when a complex task was performed (i.e., EEG composition effect). Crucially, the shared simple task, although not part of the novel complex task, could be reliably decoded from the novel complex task. The decoding strength was also correlated with EEG composition effect and behavioral generalization effect. The findings demonstrate how generalization in task learning is implemented via task reinstatement.

">The efficacy of resting-state fMRI denoising pipelines for motion correction and behavioural prediction.</a></h4>

              
                Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is a pivotal tool for mapping the functional organization of the brain and its relation to individual differences in behaviour. One challenge for the field is that rsfMRI signals are contaminated by multiple sources of noise that can contaminate these rsfMRI signals, affecting the reliability and validity of any derivative phenotypes and attenuating their correlations with behaviour. Here, we investigate the efficacy of different noise mitigation pipelines, including white matter and cerebrospinal fluid regression, independent component analysis (ICA) based artefact removal, volume censoring, global signal regression (GSR), and diffuse cluster estimation and regression (DiCER), in simultaneously achieving two objectives: mitigating motion related artifacts and augmenting brain behaviour associations. Our analysis, which employed three distinct quality control metrics to evaluate motion influence and a kernel ridge regression for behavioural predictions of 81 different behavioural variables across two independent datasets, revealed that no single pipeline universally excels at achieving both objectives consistently across different cohorts. Pipelines combining ICA FIX and GSR demonstrate a reasonable trade off between motion reduction and behavioural prediction performance, but inter pipeline variations in predictive performance are modest.

">Overactivation of prefrontal astrocytes impairs cognition through the metabolic pathway of central kynurenines</a></h4>

              
                Astrocyte dysfunctions have long been implicated in psychiatric and cognitive disorders, yet the precise mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. Here, we show that chemogenetic activation of prefrontal astrocytes in mice impairs short-term memory and sensorimotor gating and attenuates the activation of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the prefrontal cortex. These alterations are accompanied by increases in prefrontal levels of kynurenic acid (KYNA), a key metabolite of the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, known to be produced by astrocytes, which serves as an endogenous antagonist of NMDA receptors. Pharmacological inhibition of kynurenine aminotransferase II, the key enzyme mediating the transamination of KYN to KYNA, reinstates the astrocyte-mediated impairments in short-term memory and sensorimotor gating, and normalizes the deficits in prefrontal PV interneuron activation. Our study identifies a mechanistic link between overactivation of prefrontal astrocytes, increased production of KYNA, and cognitive as well as cellular dysfunctions involved in major psychiatric disorders and beyond.

">Dynamic Regulation Of The Chromatin Environment By ASH1L Modulates Human Neuronal Structure And Function</a></h4>

              
                Precise regulation of the chromatin environment through post-translational histone modification modulates transcription and controls brain development. Not surprisingly, mutations in a large number of histone-modifying enzymes underlie complex brain disorders. In particular, the histone methyltransferase ASH1L modifies histone marks linked to transcriptional activation and has been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of ASH1L-asociated disease remain underexplored. We generated human isogenic stem cells with a mutation in the catalytic domain of ASH1L. We find that ASH1L dysfunction results in reduced neurite outgrowth, which correlates with alterations in the chromatin profile of activating and repressive histone marks, as well as the dysregulation of gene programs important for neuronal structure and function implicated in neuropsychiatric disease. We also identified a novel regulatory node implicating both the SP and Kruppel-like families of transcription factors and ASH1L relevant to human neuronal development. Finally, we rescue cellular defects linked to ASH1L dysfunction by leveraging two independent epigenetic mechanisms that promote transcriptional activation. In summary, we identified an ASH1L-driven epigenetic and transcriptional axis essential for human brain development and complex brain disorders that provide insights into future therapeutic strategies for ASH1L-related disorders.

">Hyperactive neuronal networks facilitate tau spread in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Pathological tau spreads throughout the brain along neuronal connections in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms that underlie this process are poorly understood. Given the high incidence and deleterious consequences of epileptiform activity in AD, we hypothesized neuronal hyperactivity and seizures are key factors in tau spread. To examine these interactions, we created a novel mouse model involving the cross of targeted recombination in active populations (TRAP) mice and the 5 times familial AD (5XFAD; 5X-TRAP) model allowing for the permanent fluorescent labelling of neuronal activity. To establish a causal role of seizures in tau spread, we seeded mice with human AD brain-derived tau lysate and induced seizures with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling. Comprehensive brain mapping of tau pathology and neuronal activity revealed that basal hyperactivity in 5X-TRAP mice was associated with increased tau spread, which was exacerbated by seizure induction through activated networks and correlated with memory deficits. Computational modeling revealed that anterograde tau spread was elevated in 5X-TRAP mice and that regional neuronal activity was predictive of tau spread to that brain region. On a cellular level, we found that in both saline and PTZ-treated 5X-TRAP mice, hyperactive neurons disproportionately contributed to the spread of tau. Further, we found that Synaptogyrin-3, a synaptic vesicle protein that interacts with tau, was increased following PTZ kindling in 5X-TRAP mice, possibly indicative of a synaptic mechanism underlying seizure-exacerbated tau spread. Importantly, postmortem AD brain tissue from patients with a history of seizures showed increased tau pathology in patterns indicative of increased spread and increased Synaptogyrin-3 levels compared to those without seizures. Overall, our study identifies neuronal hyperactivity and seizures as key factors underlying the pathobiological and cognitive progression of AD. Therapies targeting these factors should be tested clinically to slow tau spread and AD progression.

                We present a neurophenomenological case study investigating distinct neural connectivity regimes during an advanced concentrative absorption meditation called jhana (ACAM-J),characterized by highly-stable attention and mental absorption. Using EEG recordings and phenomenological ratings (29 sessions) from a meditator with +20,000 hours of practice, we evaluated connectivity metrics tracking distinct large-scale neural interactions: nonlinear (WSMI and Directed Information), capturing non-oscillatory dynamics; and linear (WPLI) connectivity metrics, capturing oscillatory synchrony. Results demonstrate ACAM-J are better distinguished by non-oscillatory compared to oscillatory dynamics across multiple frequency ranges. Furthermore, combining attention-related phenomenological ratings with WSMI improves Bayesian decoding of ACAM-J compared to neural metrics alone. Crucially, deeper ACAM-J indicate an equalization of feedback and feedforward processes, suggesting a balance of internally- and externally-driven information processing. Our results reveal distinct neural dynamics during ACAM-J, offering insights into refined conscious states and highlighting the value of nonlinear neurophenomenological approaches to studying attentional states.

">Hydrogel encapsulation of a designed fluorescent protein biosensor for continuous measurements of sub-100 nanomolar nicotine</a></h4>

              
                The reinforcing and addictive properties of nicotine result from concentration- and time-dependent activation, desensitization, and upregulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, time-resolved [nicotine] measurement in people who consume nicotine is challenging, as current approaches are expensive, invasive, tedious, and discontinuous. To address the challenge of continuous nicotine monitoring in human biofluids, we report the encapsulation of a purified, previously developed fluorescent biosensor protein, iNicSnFR12, into acrylamide hydrogels and PEGDA hydrogels. We optimized the hydrogels for optical clarity and straightforward slicing. With fluorescence photometry of the hydrogels in microscopes and a miniscope, [nicotine] is detected at the smoking- and vaping- relevant level of 10 - 100 nM (1.62 - 16.2 ng/ml). Concentration-response relations are consistent with previous measurements on isolated iNicSnFR12. Leaching of iNicSnFR12 from the hydrogel and inactivation of iNicSnFR are minimal for several days, and nicotine can be detected for at least 10 months after casting. This work provides the molecular, photophysical, and instrumental bases for personal, wearable continuous [nicotine] monitoring, with straightforward extensions to existing, homologous 'iDrugSnFR' proteins for other abused and prescribed drugs.

">MEG signals reveal arm posture coding and intrinsic movement plans in parietofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Movement planning processes must account for body posture to accurately convert sensory signals into movement plans. While movement plans can be computed relative to the world (extrinsic), intrinsic muscle commands tuned for current limb posture are ultimately needed to execute spatially accurate movements. The whole-brain topology and dynamics of this process are largely unknown. Here, we use high spatiotemporal resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans combined with a Pro-/Anti-wrist pointing task with 2 opposing forearm postures to investigate this question. First, we computed cortical source activity in 16 previously identified bilateral cortical areas (Alikhanian, et al., Frontiers in Neuroscience 2013). We then contrasted oscillatory activity related to opposing wrist postures to find posture coding and test when and where extrinsic and intrinsic motor codes occurred. We found a distinct pair of overlapping networks coding for posture (predominantly in {gamma} band) vs. posture-specific movement plans ( and {beta}). Some areas (e.g., pIPS) only showed extrinsic motor coding, and others (e.g., AG) only showed intrinsic coding, but the majority showed both types of codes. In the latter case, intrinsic codes appeared slightly before extrinsic codes and persisted in parallel across different cortical areas. These findings are consistent with two cortical networks for 1) direct feed-forward sensorimotor transformations to intrinsic muscle coordinates (for rapid control) and 2) computations of extrinsic spatial coordinates, possibly for use in higher-level aspects of visually-guided action, such as spatial updating and internal performance monitoring.

">Asynchronous subunit transitions precede acetylcholine receptor activation</a></h4>

              
                Rapid communication at synapses is facilitated by postsynaptic receptors, which convert a chemical signal into an electrical response. In the case of ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transition through a series of intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation. These transitions are usually framed in terms of a mechanism where agonist binding and channel activation are separate events. Here, we collect cryo-EM images over a range of agonist concentrations to define structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. We show that agonist binding to a single agonist site stabilizes an intermediate state where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit has transitioned to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Binding of agonist to the second agonist site fully activates the remaining subunits leading to hydration of the ion pore. Uniting this cryo-EM derived intermediate structure with single-channel recordings leads to a model where individual acetylcholine receptor subunits asynchronously undergo conformational transitions, and thus a sequential activation mechanism that has implications for the entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.

">Synaptic acetylcholine induces sharp wave ripples in the basolateral amygdala through nicotinic receptors</a></h4>

              
                While the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is critical in the consolidation of emotional memories, mechanisms underlying memory consolidation in this region are not well understood. In the hippocampus, memory consolidation depends upon network signatures termed sharp wave ripples (SWR). These SWRs largely occur during states of awake rest or slow wave sleep and are inversely correlated with cholinergic tone. While high frequency cholinergic stimulation can inhibit SWRs through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, it is unclear how nicotinic acetylcholine receptors or different cholinergic firing patterns may influence SWR generation. SWRs are also present in BLA in vivo. Interestingly, the BLA receives extremely dense cholinergic inputs, yet the relationship between acetylcholine (ACh) and BLA SWRs is unexplored. Here, using brain slice electrophysiology in male and female mice, we show that brief stimulation of ACh inputs to BLA reliably induces SWRs that resemble those that occur in the BLA in vivo. Repeated ACh-SWRs are induced with single pulse stimulation at low, but not higher frequencies. ACh-SWRs are driven by nicotinic receptors which recruit different classes of local interneurons and trigger glutamate release from external inputs. In total, our findings establish a previously undefined mechanism for SWR induction in the brain. They also challenge the previous notion of neuromodulators as purely modulatory agents gating these events but instead reveal these systems can directly instruct SWR induction with temporal precision. Further, these results intriguingly suggest a new role for the nicotinic system in emotional memory consolidation.

">Microglial engulfing of glutamatergic inputs and diminished excitability of D1 medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens by peripheral inflammatory insult</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimmune responses to systemic inflammation can generate anxiodepressive behaviors and psychomotor slowing. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a neural hub encoding mood and motivation that contributes to the locomotor and mood dampening effects of neuroinflammation. Dopamine receptor 1 mediums spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) of the NAc regulate locomotor activity, motivated behavior and emotional states and are modulated by microglial reactivity. Here, we evaluated sickness- and anxiety-like behaviors along with D1-MSN activity and microglial responses in the NAc to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. LPS stimulated anxiety-like behavior, blunted locomotion and reduced cFos expression in D1-MSNs of the NAc core and shell of male mice. These effects associated with reduced excitatory inputs (EPSCs) onto D1-MSNs as measured by whole cell patch-clamp. To determine if microglia contribute to changes in MSN activity, Ca2+ imaging of primary cultures containing NAc neurons with or without primary NAc microglia was performed. The presence of microglia decreased the activity of LPS-treated MSNs in response to dopamine and glutamate application and LPS stimulated microglial phagocytosis of MSN processes in co-cultures. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that in vivo LPS treatment enhanced morphological indices of microglia reactivity and engulfment of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) inputs in the NAc. Our results suggest that LPS reduces locomotion and stimulates anxiety via increasing microglia engulfment of excitatory inputs onto D1-MSNs, and highlight changes in NAc microglia phagocytic activity in the behavioral consequences of neuroinflammation.

">Characterizing vascular function in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and mixed Alzheimer's and atherosclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Alzheimer's disease does not occur in isolation and there are many comorbidities associated with the disease - especially diseases of the vasculature. Atherosclerosis is a known risk factor for the subsequent development of Alzheimer's disease, therefore understanding how both diseases interact will provide a greater understanding of co-morbid disease progression and aid the development of potential new treatments. Aim: The current study characterizes hemodynamic responses and cognitive performance in APP/PS1 Alzheimer's mice, atherosclerosis mice, and a mixed disease group (APP/PS1 & atherosclerosis) between the ages of 9 and 12 months. Approach: Whisker-evoked hemodynamic responses and recognition memory were assessed in awake mice, immunohistochemistry to assess amyloid pathology, and histology to characterize atherosclerotic plaque load. Results: We observed hemodynamic deficits in atherosclerosis mice (vs Alzheimer's, mixed disease or wild-type mice), with reduced short-duration stimulus-evoked hemodynamic responses occurring when there was no concurrent locomotion during the stimulation period. Mixed Alzheimer's and atherosclerosis models did not show differences in amyloid beta coverage in the cortex or hippocampus or atherosclerotic plaque burden in the aortic arch vs relevant Alzheimer's or atherosclerosis controls. Consistent with the subtle vascular deficits and no pathology differences, we also observed no difference in performance on the novel object recognition task across groups. Conclusions: These results emphasize the importance of experimental design for characterizing vascular function across disease groups, as locomotion and stimulus duration impacted the ability to detect differences between groups. Whilst atherosclerosis did reduce hemodynamic responses, these were recovered in the presence of co-occurring Alzheimer's disease which may provide targets for future studies to explore the potentially contrasting vasodilatory mechanisms these diseases impact.

">Connectivity in the human and the monkey brain probes causal involvement of the fornix in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by memory loss and severe deficits in cognitive function associated with neural degeneration in a network of brain regions. However, little is known about those regions' connectivity patterns and how that differs from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or healthy aging. To address that, we used diffusion-weighted MRI to determine connectivity across 11 key memory-related regions and their unique set of connections (connectivity fingerprints) to 14 white matter (WM) tracts. One WM tract particularly important for memory, and attractive target for therapeutic interventions in AD, is the fornix. However, determining fornix-specific contributions to memory deficits or therapeutic benefits is difficult, partly because the fornix carries numerous subcortical and cortical projections. To explore that, we additionally examined MRI-derived connectivity across homologous structures in non-human primates before and after fornix transections. We report several important findings. First, that connectivity between the hippocampus and the anterior thalamus (ATh) is strongly compromised in cognitive decline, as is fornix integrity. We also found strong reductions in the hippocampus-fornix and ATh-fornix connectivity in AD, demonstrating that fingerprint divergence across groups in hippocampal CA1 and ATh can identify differences between people with AD and MCI. In AD, we observed also elevated connectivity between WM tracts and the hippocampus or the ATh, suggesting a compensatory mechanism, which, importantly, depends on a viable fornix. We finally demonstrate that certain thalamic nuclei and hippocampal subfields link through the retrosplenial cortex in both species, highlighting its potential role as an alternative target for interventions in memory disorders.

                Background: Evidence suggests a non-specific mapping between psychiatric disorders and underlying neurobiological substrates. A dimensional psychopathology framework may prove useful for organizing observed neurobiological alterations along broad psychopathological dimensions. Methods: We applied latent class analysis to identify clinical cohorts of symptomatic homogeneity to represent the clinical end of specific psychopathological dimensions (i.e., internalizing/externalizing, p-factor), using baseline data (N = 11860) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. These cohorts were compared against neurotypical individuals in terms of deviations from the normality of cortical development, quantified using autoencoder-based normative models, to reveal cortical abnormalities. Results: We identified cortical thickness as an important MRI-derived index of psychopathology and revealed distinct structural abnormalities to broad psychopathological dimensions. Conclusion: This study highlights the value of person-centered analytic techniques, combined with normative modeling, to complement traditional associational methodologies in revealing neurobiological correlates of dimensional psychopathologies.

">Impact of a transient neonatal visual deprivation on the development of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex in humans</a></h4>

              
                How does experience shape the development of visual brain regions? We demonstrate that a transient period of visual deprivation early in life in humans leads to permanent alteration in the function of the early visual cortex (EVC), while leaving the categorical coding of downstream ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) mostly unaffected. We used fMRI to characterize the brain response to five categories (faces, bodies, objects, buildings and words) in a rare group of cataract-reversal individuals who experienced a transient period of blindness early in life, and in matched participants with typical visual development. We show that the encoding of low-level visual properties is impaired in EVC in cataract-reversal participants, while the categorical response in the VOTC is preserved. When altering the visual properties of our stimuli to mimic in controls the deficit of EVC response of the cataract, we observe a cascading alteration of the categorical coding from EVC to VOTC that is not observed in the cataract-reversal group. Our results show that a typical visual categorical organization develops in VOTC despite a period of visual deprivation early in life and in the presence of impaired processing in EVC. A deep neural network exposed to a visual diet that emulates the experience of our participants reproduced our brain observations within an artificial system. These findings emphasize how specific visual regions are differently affected by a period of visual deprivation early in life, with information encoded in EVC being permanently affected, while the categorical coding in VOTC shows resilience to deprivation.

">Emotion processing in mothers with bonding disorder during the first year postpartum: Results of an adapted fMRI emotional GoNoGo Task</a></h4>

              
                Maternal bonding refers to the unique emotional connection between a mother and her baby that gradually develops during the pre- and postpartum period. However, 3-24% of women report bonding disorders (BD), often accompanied by constraints for the mother-infant relationship with consequences for child development. The underlying neural patterns are not clarified yet. Our present study investigates the neural and behavioral patterns that underlie the processing of emotional infant stimuli over the 1st year postpartum. Mothers with and without BD (N = 45) completed an adapted (newly developed) Emotional Infant GoNoGo Task while fMRI scanning at 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum. Our results show that response inhibition towards emotional infant faces elicits stronger results than towards adult faces in all mothers. While behavioral performance in BD is impaired, the neural responses to emotional infant faces as compared to neutral faces are increased at 3 months postpartum in limbic structures such as the anterior cingulate and insula, as well as nucleus caudatus. At 6 and 12 months behavioral reactions assimilate in BD to those of healthy controls, while differences in neural reactions between BD and healthy controls increase at 6 months and decrease again at 12 months. These effects are independent of depressive symptoms. Our findings point to an experience-based adaptive process of emotion processing and responses to infants' affect during the first year postpartum as a specific characteristic of clinical bonding disorder and thus might point to potential or future therapeutic interventions targeting emotion processing and regulation in mothers with BD.

">Purinergic Receptor P2Y13 Controls Activation and Mode of Division in Subependymal Adult Neural Stem Cells</a></h4>

              
                The subependymal zone (SEZ) of the mammalian brain is the most active germinal area that continues to generate newborn neurons throughout life. This area harbors a population of neural stem cells (NSCs) that can be found in different states of activation, each differing in proliferative capacity and molecular signature: quiescent NSCs (qNSCs), primed NSCs and activated NSCs (aNSCs). There is currently a void in terms of the specific markers available to effectively discern between these transient states. Likewise, the molecular signaling mechanisms controlling the transition from quiescence to activation and the subsequent mode of division remain largely unexplored. Here, we present evidence that the metabotropic P2Y13 purinergic receptor plays a critical role in regulating adult neurogenesis. We found that P2Y13 is specifically expressed in NSCs within the adult SEZ and that its levels can be used to distinguish qNSCs from aNSCs. Moreover, we identified the metabotropic P2Y13 purinergic receptor as a pivotal modulator of NSC dynamics, influencing both the balance between NSC quiescence and activation and the mode of NSC division at the subependymal zone.

They show that, while both in situ Flt3L expression and PD-1 inhibition promote the transition with acquisition of effector functions via IL-12, the former induces TCR repertoire diversification.

	<p>Background. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a prevalent psychopathological condition, affecting 0.7&amp;amp;ndash;2.7% of the general population. Given the known link between identity formation and the temporal, metacognitive, and narrative processes that contribute to its coherence, the aim of the present systematic review is to synthesize the current literature about the relationship between identity diffusion and lived time in adult patients with BPD. This would enhance knowledge and treatments, leading to a better understanding of the implications of time processes on identity diffusion in BPD. Methods. According to PRISMA guidelines, the main databases were consulted, and specific eligibility criteria were applied. The selection leads to the inclusion of 15 articles, investigating through integrated techniques the lived time, memory, self-reported narratives, and metacognition in BPD subjects. Results. A general agreement among researchers was found, confirming greater difficulty for BPD subjects in producing autobiographical stories, logically and temporally integrated, characterized by positive content. Functional and structural alterations were detected to explain narrative incoherence, as well as symptoms such as emotional dysregulation and cognitive biases. Conclusions. The difficulty for BPD subjects in producing a coherent personal narrative has been interpreted as a correlation of anomalies in autobiographical memories and consequently identities, which were equally compromised by the experience of discontinuity in the temporal structure. This would confirm the hypothesis of the temporal fragmentation of the self in BPD. Although some limitations have been encountered, we suggest that the understanding of identity diffusion and lived time in BPD subjects could represent a useful guide for further research.</p>

	<p>The advent of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells has recently changed the prognosis of relapsing/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, showing response rates as high as 60 to 80%. Common toxicities reported in the pivotal clinical trials include the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), a stereotyped encephalopathy related to myeloid cell activation and blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier dysfunction, presenting with a distinctive cascade of dysgraphia, aphasia, disorientation, attention deficits, vigilance impairment, motor symptoms, seizures, and diffuse brain oedema. The tremendous oncological efficacy of CAR-T cells observed in systemic B-cell malignancies is leading to their growing use in patients with primary or secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas and in patients with solid tumours, including several CNS cancers. Early studies conducted in adult and paediatric patients with solid CNS tumours reported a distinct profile of neurotoxicity referred to as Tumour inflammation-associated neurotoxicity (TIAN), corresponding to local inflammation at the tumour site manifesting with focal neurological deficits or mechanical complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus). The present review summarises available data on the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cells for solid and haematological CNS malignancies, emphasising known and emerging phenotypes, ongoing challenges, and future perspectives.</p>

	<p>Background: The involvement of the circadian system in the etiology and treatment of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is becoming an increasingly important topic. The prodromal symptoms of PD include insomnia, fatigue, depression and sleep disturbance which herald the onset of the primary symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity while robbing patients of their quality of life. Light treatment (LT) has been implemented for modifying circadian function in PD but few studies have examined its use in a protracted term that characterizes PD itself. Methods: The present exploratory study monitors the effect of LT over a 10 year course of PD in the context of ongoing circadian function. Results: Improvement in circadian based symptoms were seen soon after LT commenced and continued for the duration of the study. Improvement in motor function was more subtle and was not distinguishable until 1.2 years after commencing treatment. Improvement in most motor and prodromal symptoms remained in steady state for the duration of the study as long as patients were compliant with daily use. Conclusions: The sequence of improvement in prodromal symptoms and motor function seen here parallels the slow, incremental repair process mimicking the protracted degenerative sequelae of PD that extends over decades. This process also emulates the slow incremental improvement characterizing the reparative course seen with circadian symptoms in other disorders that improve with LT. Recent findings from epidemiological work suggest that early disruption of circadian rhythmicity is associated with increased risk of PD and the present findings are consistent with that hypothesis. It is concluded that intervening in circadian function with LT presents a minimally invasive method that is compatible with internal timing that slows the degenerative process of PD.</p>

	<p>Objective: Visual processing deficits arising in dementia are associated with particular functional disability. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the built environment on mobility and navigation in people with dementia-related visual loss. Methods: Participants with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA; &amp;amp;ldquo;visual-variant Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s&amp;amp;rdquo;; n = 11), typical Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (tAD; N = 10), and controls (n = 13) repeatedly walked down routes within a simplified real-world setting. Participant groups were of comparable age and gender. Routes were of different complexity (straight, U-shaped, and S-shaped), overhead lighting levels (low and high) and with or without a dynamic LED (light-emitting diode) cue (trial n = 24). Ratios of walking times for each experimental condition (each complex route vs the straight route, high lighting vs low, and LED cue vs no cue) were compared between participant groups. Kinematic measures were produced from a total of 10,813 steps using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs). Results: The walking time ratios relating to route complexity were higher in the PCA group than in controls: 30.3% (95% CI [13.5%, 49.5%] higher for U-shaped vs straight and 31.9% [21.1%, 55.3%] for S-shaped vs straight, averaged over other conditions). The analogous results relating to route complexity for the tAD group were intermediate between those for the PCA and control groups. There was no evidence that walking time ratios differed according to lighting level or the presence of the LED cue. Conclusions: Findings contribute to evidence-based design for dementia-friendly environments, emphasizing consequences of environmental complexity for functional independence and mobility in people with dementia-related visual loss. Findings inform recommendations for environmental design to support the independence of individuals with dementia.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Emotional prosody, the intonation and rhythm of speech that conveys emotions, is vital for speech communication as it provides essential context and nuance to the words being spoken. This study explored how listeners automatically process emotional prosody in speech, focusing on different neural responses for the prosodic categories and potential sex differences. Methods: The pilot data here involved 11 male and 11 female adult participants (age range: 18&amp;amp;ndash;28). A multi-feature oddball paradigm was used, in which participants were exposed to sequences of non-repeating English words with emotional (angry, happy, sad) or neutral prosody while watching a silent movie. Results: Both mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a components were observed, indicating automatic perceptual grouping and neural sensitivity to emotional variations in speech. Women showed stronger MMN to angry than sad prosody, while men showed stronger MMN to angry than happy prosody. Happy prosody elicited the strongest P3a, but only in men. Conclusions: The findings challenge the notion that all facets of emotion processing are biased toward female superiority. However, these results from 22 young adult native English speakers should be interpreted with caution, as data from a more adequate sample size are needed to test the generalizability of the findings. Combined with results from studies on children and elderly adults, these preliminary data underscore the need to explore the complexities of emotional speech processing mechanisms to account for category and sex differences across the lifespan in a longitudinal perspective.</p>

	<p>Background: Among all professions, teaching is significantly affected by psycho-social risks with approximately 33.33% of educators reporting work-related fatigue. Suggestopedia, an effective pedagogical approach developed in Bulgaria, claims to induce positive psychological and cognitive benefits in both teachers and students. In order to gather scientific evidence, given the above statement, we designed a methodology to detect fatigue in Suggestopedia teachers based on neurocognitive analysis and psychological assessment. Methods: An increase in the EEG theta and alpha band powers is considered among the most reliable markers of fatigue. The proposed methodology introduces a robust framework for fatigue analysis. Initially, the changes in EEG band powers using the resting state EEG activity before and after teaching are measured. Subsequently, validated psychological questionnaires are used to gain subjective feedback on fatigue. The study participants include a control group (traditional teachers) and the test group (suggestopedia teachers) to assess whether suggestopedia practice mitigates fatigue among teachers. Observations: In a pilot study, the EEG data was analyzed by evaluating the interrelations between EEG bands and the alpha&amp;amp;ndash;beta ratio. The results of the proposed study are expected to provide comprehensive analysis for the fatigue levels of teachers. In future research, our goal is to position the described methodology as a robust approach for evaluating cognitive and emotional states.</p>

                In Peru, insect consumption, as a nutritional complement or as the main source in the diet, is limited to the regions of our the central jungle where Atta sexdens ants are consumed. An energy bar based on Andean grains with Atta sexdens ant flour was formulated. The ants were obtained from the department of San Martin, district of Rioja, province of Rioja. Four different formulations were prepared with different Atta sexdens ant flour concentrations: 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%. Moisture, total fat, ash, proteins, fiber, carbohydrates, instrumental texture, and organoleptic analysis (taste, texture, and color) were performed. The developed cereal energy bar presented a 10 g protein content in 100 g of the final product. Acceptability was evaluated in adolescents and young adult populations. The developed cereal bars presented a high protein content, adequate organoleptic properties and high acceptability. However, this must be considered in the context of the rising cost of protein-rich foods.

                Background Pathological response of liver metastases (LM) from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) to neoadjuvant therapy is a known prognostic factor associated with recurrence and survival. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of two prognostic scores in patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM), specifically in stage IV disease. Methods We conducted a study on patients with stage IV colorectal cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy (CT) followed by liver metastasis (LM) resection between 2015 and 2021. Among these patients, 57% had synchronous metastases (diagnosed at the same time as the primary tumor), while the remaining cases were metachronous (diagnosed after the primary tumor). Pathological response was evaluated using both the Rubbia-Brandt tumor regression grade (TRG) and the Blazer scoring system. We then assessed the performance of these two prognostic scores based on homogeneity (using the likelihood ratio, LR+), monotonicity, and discriminative ability (using the area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve, AUC). Results 70 cases were included in the study. Mean age was 56 years. The sex ratio (males/females) was 2.2. Forty patients were stage IV (57%) with synchronous all CRCLMs. The overall survival, all stages combined, was 85.5% at 12 months, 41.7% at 24 months and 19.3% at 36 months. The median survival was better in case of major response (TRG1/TRG2) evaluated at 40.1 and 41.1 months after diagnosis. In cases of partial response (TRG3), the median survival was 32.1 months. In cases with no response (TRG4/TRG5), survival was estimated at 29.9 and 18.5 months. The Rubbia-Brandt TRG had the highest LR+ (10.95). The LR+ of the Rubbia-Brandt score was greater than 10, so it was a test with very strong contribution. The LR+ of the Blazer score was between 5 and 10, it was a test with strong contribution. The Rubbia-Brandt TRG had the highest linearity value (10.73). With a higher AUC of the ROC curve (0.8), the Rubbia-Brandt TRG was better at predicting survival than the Blazer score. Conclusion Surgical resection is the gold standard for CRCLM, with improved prognosis from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pathological response to CT is a key prognostic factor, and the Rubbia Brandt TRG system enhances survival predictivity when combined with ypTN stage.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1447/v1?src=rss">Strategic priorities and challenges in research software funding: Results from an international survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Research software is increasingly recognized as critical infrastructure in contemporary science. It spans a broad spectrum, including source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows, and executables, all created for or during research. While research funders have developed programs, initiatives, and policies to bolster research software’s role, there has been no empirical study of how these funders prioritize support for research software. Understanding their priorities is essential to clarify where current support is concentrated and to identify strategic gaps. Methods We conducted an online mixed methods survey of international research funders (n=36) to explore their priorities in supporting research software. The survey gathered data on the specific outcomes funders emphasize in their programs and initiatives for research software. Results The survey revealed that funders place strong emphasis on developing skills, promoting software sustainability, embedding open science practices, building community and collaboration, advancing research software funding mechanisms, increasing software visibility and use, fostering innovation, and ensuring security. Conclusions The findings highlight opportunities to enhance research software’s role through increased funder attention on professional recognition for software contributions and the non-technical, social aspects of research software sustainability. Addressing these areas could lead to more effective support and development of research software, ultimately benefitting the entire research ecosystem.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-188/v2?src=rss">Impacts of illegal trade on socio-emotional and behavioural skills in macaques [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Decades of research have illuminated the consequences of early adverse rearing experiences in laboratory macaque populations. However, knowledge of the impact of traumatic episodes in non-laboratory settings remains limited. This study investigates the socio-emotional and behavioural impacts of illegal trade on five macaque species, all victims of poaching. We studied 53 focal subjects residing at the Lao Conservation Trust for Wildlife (LCTW), a former zoo converted into a rescue and rehabilitation centre. We categorised their past experiences into seven aspects, encompassing maternal care and interactions with conspecifics. We assessed social engagement and cooperation by analysing social behaviours and employing the Social Responsiveness Scale. Emotional resilience was evaluated by measuring anxiety levels and the occurrence of abnormal behaviours, supported by a welfare questionnaire. Additionally, the introduction of Cattell’s 16PF questionnaire in macaques for the first time aimed to reveal the influence of traumatic experiences on their personality traits. Our findings underscore the significance of early social exposure to conspecifics. Macaques deprived of juvenile social contact show reduced social behaviours and a tendency towards social avoidance in adulthood. Human-reared macaques display increased abnormal behaviours in social contexts, which compromises welfare. Social deprivation with conspecifics during infancy negatively affects psychological stimulation and overall welfare, with prolonged time in illegal trade correlating with increased anxiety levels. Personality traits, such as ‘Calmness’ and ‘Unfriendliness’, are shaped by rearing conditions, with macaques deprived of social interaction showing higher levels of introversion. In summary, the more time macaques spend in human care with minimal exposure to conspecifics, the more pronounced the impacts on anxiety, abnormal social behaviours, and personality traits, highlighting the significant long-term effects of early rearing conditions on their socio-emotional development.

                Background Stroke survivors, especially working-age adults, face an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one to five years after the initial occurrence, primarily due to suboptimal risk factor management. This study aims to investigate the contributing factors associated with the risk of recurrent stroke in this demographic. Methods This case-control study matched participants with recurrent stroke to those without recurrent stroke by age and gender. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to identify significant factors associated with recurrent stroke. The study included 100 patients with recurrent stroke and 200 control participants recruited from the hospital database. Results Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke were gender (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.10 to 3.29), high fasting blood sugar (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.10 to 3.29), drinking status (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 3.01 to 6.54), sedentary lifestyle (OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.50 to 5.13), and lack of workplace support for health (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.13 to 3.63). The association of female gender, marital status, smoking status, sedentary lifestyle, interpersonal relationships at the workplace, and workplace support for health with recurrent stroke differed by age group. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of addressing lifestyle-related and occupational factors to reduce recurrent stroke risk among working-age adults. Tailoring age-specific stroke prevention strategies, promoting healthier lifestyles, and implementing evidence-based interventions can lead to improved stroke outcomes and enhance the quality of life for this vulnerable population.

                Abstract Backgrounds The retention of the maxillary complete denture may be influenced by adequate recording in the patient’s mouth, marking, and carving of the post-dam on the maxillary cast. Failure to do so may lead to loss of retention. Successful denture construction with patient’s comfort could be achieved by effective methods of recording, marking, and carving of the post-dam. The aim of the study was to assess Iraqi dentists in their knowledge and application of the post-dam in maxillary complete dentures. Methods Questionnaires were distributed randomly through online Google Forms and 118 Iraqi dentists with different academic degree participated in the study. A multinomial logistic regression model was also used to assess the nominal outcome variables. Results A High percentage of 90.7% of Iraqi dentists with different academic degree stated that they had the knowledge about the vibrating lines and their location and 84.7% stated that they mark the post-dam on the master cast, while 15.3% stated that the dental technician marks it. More the half (52.5%) of the participants carved the post-dam, while 47.5% of the participants stated that the dental technician did it. For participants not marking the post-dam, 30.5% of the participants stated they depend on the dental technician in marking and/or carve the post-dam, while the fear of denture failure and loss of retention was observed in 25.4% of the participants, followed by 24.6% of participants forgetting to carve, 10.2% of participants had no information about carving, and 9.3% participants found it was difficult to carve. Conclusions Within the limitations of the study, most Iraqi dentists with different academic degree stated that they had the knowledge on the location of vibrating lines. However, recording and carving the post-dam was influenced by the dentist’s personal preference and their dependency on the dental technician.

     alt="Decreased Water Diffusivity Along the Perivascular Space in Older Adults With Poor Sleep Quality"/>
<p>This study provides insights into changes in the glymphatic system using the diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) method and choroid plexus volume (CPV) in Japanese older adults with poor sleep quality. Our findings revealed a decrease in the DTI-ALPS index and a significant association between the DTI-ALPS index and CPV among older adults with PSQ.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study included 52 Japanese older adults with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores &gt; 5 and 52 healthy controls (HCs) with PSQI score ≤ 5. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and 3D T1-weighted imaging were acquired using 3T magnetic resonance imaging. The diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index was calculated using preprocessed DWI. The choroid plexus volume (CPV) was calculated using FreeSurfer 6.0. The mean ALPS index and CPV were compared between the older adults with poor sleep quality (PSQ) and HCs using a general linear model, adjusted for covariates including age, sex, years of education, total intracranial volume, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and white matter lesion volume. We also conducted a partial correlation analysis between the mean ALPS index and CPV, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and PSQI scores, adjusting for all the mentioned covariates. The PSQ group had a significantly lower mean ALPS index than HCs. The mean ALPS index in the PSQ group was negatively correlated with CPV and positively correlated with the MoCA score. Therefore, older adults with PSQ may experience dysfunction in the excretory pathway of the perivascular space around the medullary veins. This impairment may be associated with an increase in CPV and cognitive dysfunction.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The interaction between major depressive disorder (MDD) and overweight/obesity has received considerable attention owing to its widespread occurrence and the intricate biopsychological implications involved. Despite extensive research, the neural mechanisms underlying these comorbid conditions, particularly in terms of functional network connectivity (FNC), are still not well understood. This study aimed to clarify these mechanisms by utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to examine both static and dynamic FNC. We analyzed data from 57 patients with both MDD and overweight/obesity (MDD-OW), 57 MDD patients of normal weight (MDD-NW), and 44 healthy controls, using techniques such as independent component analysis, sliding window analysis, K-means clustering, and graph theory. In contrast to static FNC, which showed no significant differences, dynamic FNC analysis identified four consistent states across all participants. Both MDD groups demonstrated reduced flexibility in functional coordination among these states and decreased nodal characteristics within the salience network. Notably, the MDD-OW group displayed enhanced dynamic FNC between the default mode network (DMN) and the executive control network (ECN) during certain states, which was inversely associated with the severity of depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of altered dynamic connectivity patterns in individuals with MDD and concurrent overweight/obesity, especially between the DMN and ECN, suggesting their potential utility as biomarkers for depressive states. This research contributes to our understanding of how comorbid overweight/obesity affects brain network dynamics in depressive disorders and provides a basis for targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10738584241293366?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R">Oxytocin in Human Social Network Cooperation</a></h4>

              
                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Human society is organized in structured social networks upon which large-scale cooperation among genetically unrelated individuals is favored and persists. Such large-scale cooperation is crucial for the success of the human species but also one of the most puzzling challenges. Recent work in social and behavioral neuroscience has linked human cooperation to oxytocin, an evolutionarily ancient and structurally preserved hypothalamic neuropeptide. This review aims to elucidate how oxytocin promotes nonkin cooperation in social networks by reviewing its effects at three distinct levels: individual cooperation, the formation of interpersonal relationships, and the establishment of heterogeneous network structures. We propose oxytocin as a proximate mechanism for fostering large-scale cooperation in human societies. Specifically, oxytocin plays an important role in facilitating network-wide cooperation in human societies by 1) increasing individual cooperation, mitigating noncooperation motives, and facilitating the enforcement of cooperative norms; 2) fostering interpersonal bonding and synchronization; and 3) facilitating the formation of heterogeneous network structures.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Over 90% of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In this system, the ubiquitin protein can bind to a substrate on its own or it can form a chain with multiple ubiquitin molecules in a process called polyubiquitination. There are 8 different sites on ubiquitin at which polyubiquitin chains can be formed, the second most abundant of which, lysine-63 (K63), is independent of the degradation process, though this mark has rarely been studied in the brain or during learning-dependent synaptic plasticity. Recently, we found that knockdown of K63 polyubiquitination in the amygdala selectively impaired contextual fear memory formation in female, but not male, rats. It is unknown, however, whether the sex-specific requirement of K63 polyubiquitination occurs in other brain regions that are required for contextual fear memory formation, including the hippocampus. Here, we found that CRISPR-dCas13-mediated knockdown of K63 polyubiquitination in the hippocampus significantly enhanced contextual fear memory in both male and female rats, a result that is in striking contrast to what we observed in the amygdala for both sex-specificity and directionality. Using unbiased proteomics, we found that following fear conditioning K63 polyubiquitination was primarily decreased at target proteins in the hippocampus of both males and females. Importantly, the target proteins and downstream functional pathways influenced by K63 polyubiquitination changes diverged significantly by sex. Together, these data suggest that unlike what we previously reported in the amygdala, decreases in K63 polyubiquitination in the hippocampus are a critical regulator of memory formation in the hippocampus of both males and females.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101483">The membrane domains of mammalian adenylyl cyclases are lipid receptors</a></h4>

              
                The biosynthesis of cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases (mACs) is predominantly regulated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Up to now the two hexahelical transmembrane domains of mACs were considered to fix the enzyme to membranes. Here, we show that the transmembrane domains serve in addition as signal receptors and transmitters of lipid signals that control Gsα-stimulated mAC activities. We identify aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide as receptor ligands of mAC isoforms 1–7 and 9. The ligands enhance (mAC isoforms 2, 3, 7, and 9) or attenuate (isoforms 1, 4, 5, and 6) Gsα-stimulated mAC activities in vitro and in vivo. Substitution of the stimulatory membrane receptor of mAC3 by the inhibitory receptor of mAC5 results in a ligand inhibited mAC5–mAC3 chimera. Thus, we discovered a new class of membrane receptors in which two signaling modalities are at a crossing, direct tonic lipid and indirect phasic GPCR–Gsα signaling regulating the biosynthesis of cAMP.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83288">Determining the effects of paternal obesity on sperm chromatin at histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation in relation to the placental transcriptome and cellular composition</a></h4>

              
                Paternal obesity has been implicated in adult-onset metabolic disease in offspring. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these paternal effects and the developmental processes involved remain poorly understood. One underexplored possibility is the role of paternally-induced effects on placenta development and function. To address this, we investigated paternal high-fat diet-induced obesity in relation to sperm histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation signatures, the placenta transcriptome and cellular composition. C57BL6/J male mice were fed either a control or high-fat diet for 10 weeks beginning at 6 weeks of age. Males were timed-mated with control-fed C57BL6/J females to generate pregnancies, followed by collection of sperm, and placentas at embryonic day (E)14.5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation targeting histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed on sperm to define obesity-associated changes in enrichment. Paternal obesity corresponded with altered sperm H3K4me3 at promoters of genes involved in metabolism and development. Notably, sperm altered H3K4me3 was also localized at placental enhancers. Bulk RNA-sequencing on placentas revealed paternal obesity-associated sex-specific changes in expression of genes involved in hypoxic processes such as angiogenesis, nutrient transport, and imprinted genes, with a subset of deregulated genes showing changes in H3K4me3 in sperm at corresponding promoters. Paternal obesity was also linked to impaired placenta development; specifically, a deconvolution analysis revealed altered trophoblast cell lineage specification. These findings implicate paternal obesity-effects on placenta development and function as one potential developmental route to offspring metabolic disease.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) may lead to disabling incontrollable movements known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been applied as non-invasive therapy to ameliorate motor symptoms and dyskinesias in PD treatment. Recent studies have shown that TMS-induced motor effects might be related to dopaminergic system modulation. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects of TMS are not fully understood. Objectives: To assess the expression of FosB and c-Fos in dopamine-D1 receptor-containing cells of dyskinetic rats and to analyze the effect of TMS on dyskinetic behavior and its histological marker (FosB). Methods: We investigated the outcome of TMS on cellular activation, using c-Fos immunoreactivity, on D1 receptor-positive (D1R+) cells into the motor cortex and striatum of dyskinetic (n = 14) and intact rats (n = 14). Additionally, we evaluated the effect of TMS on the dyskinesia global score and its molecular marker, FosB, in the striatum (n = 67). Results: TMS reduces c-Fos expression in D1R+cells into the motor cortex and striatum. Moreover, TMS treatment attenuated dyskinesias, along with a low stratal FosB expression. Conclusions: The current study shows that TMS depressed FosB and c-Fos expression in D1R+ cells of the dorsal striatum and motor cortex, in accordance with previous evidence of its capacity to modulate the dopaminergic system, thus suggesting a mechanism by which TMS may mitigate dyskinesias. Additionally, our observations highlight the potential therapeutic effect of TMS on dyskinesias in a PD model.</p>

	<p>Tinnitus is correlated with anomalies of neural plasticity and has been found to be affected by inflammatory status. The current theories on tinnitus, although still somewhat incomplete, are based on maladaptive plasticity mechanisms. Astrocytes play a major role in both neural responses to inflammation and plasticity regulation; moreover, they have recently been discovered to encode &amp;amp;ldquo;context&amp;amp;rdquo; for neuronal circuits, which is similar to the &amp;amp;ldquo;expectation&amp;amp;rdquo; of Bayesian brain models. Therefore, this narrative review explores the possible and likely roles of astrocytes in the neural mechanisms leading to acute and chronic tinnitus.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased mental health issues, particularly among long-COVID patients, who experience persistent symptoms post-recovery, potentially leading to chronic conditions. The psychological impact of long-COVID is still largely unknown, but it may contribute to mental disorders like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Given the global rise in anxiety and depression, exploring therapies like Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) for long-COVID traumatic disorders is crucial. This study explores the effectiveness of remote EMDR therapy for PTSD-like symptoms in long-COVID conditions (LCC), assessing their emergence, the impact of LCC on mental health, and identifying key commonalities. It also examines the potential advantages of an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform for EMDR treatments for both therapists and patients, evaluating the response differences between remote and in-person treatment. Methods: We enrolled a total of 160 participants divided into two groups of 80, with the experimental group receiving EMDR treatment for PTSD-like symptoms via a remote AI-powered platform, and the control group receiving traditional in-person therapy. We compared the ANOVA for Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUDs) scores, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) scores, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores between our two groups for three cases: pre-treatment, post-treatment, and decrement. Results: Statistical significance analysis showed a consistent absence of significant differences between online AI-powered platforms and traditional in-presence sessions. This effectively confirms our hypothesis and highlights that no significant differences were observed between the two groups. Conclusions: The AI-supported remote platform demonstrates comparable efficacy in delivering EMDR therapy, confirming its potential as an effective alternative to traditional in-person methods while providing added advantages in accessibility and adaptability (e.g., remote areas, hikikomori, natural disasters).</p>

	<p>Background: Emotions significantly influence decision-making, social interactions, and medical outcomes. Leveraging emotion recognition through Electroencephalography (EEG) signals offers potential advancements in personalized medicine, adaptive technologies, and mental health diagnostics. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of three neural network architectures&amp;amp;mdash;ShallowFBCSPNet, Deep4Net, and EEGNetv4&amp;amp;mdash;for emotion classification using the SEED-V dataset. Methods: The SEED-V dataset comprises EEG recordings from 16 individuals exposed to 15 emotion-eliciting video clips per session, targeting happiness, sadness, disgust, neutrality, and fear. EEG data were preprocessed with a bandpass filter, segmented by emotional episodes, and split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Three neural networks were trained and evaluated to classify emotions from the EEG signals. Results: ShallowFBCSPNet achieved the highest accuracy at 39.13%, followed by Deep4Net (38.26%) and EEGNetv4 (25.22%). However, significant misclassification issues were observed, such as EEGNetv4 predicting all instances as &amp;amp;ldquo;Disgust&amp;amp;rdquo; or &amp;amp;ldquo;Neutral&amp;amp;rdquo; depending on the configuration. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, such as ResNet18 combined with differential entropy, which achieved 95.61% accuracy on the same dataset, the tested models demonstrated substantial limitations. Conclusions: Our results highlight the challenges of generalizing across emotional states using raw EEG signals, emphasizing the need for advanced preprocessing and feature-extraction techniques. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights into the potential and constraints of neural networks for EEG-based emotion recognition, paving the way for future advancements in the field.</p>

	<p>Background: Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is often difficult for skull base surgeons to address. FD arises due to the abnormal proliferation of fibroblasts, ultimately resulting in immature osseous tissue replacing normal cancellous bone. When the skull base is involved, it can result in cranial nerve compression. FD affecting the optic canal and optic nerve is the most concerning as new onset of vision loss is considered a surgical emergency. The prevalence of FD is approximately 3.6 per 1,000,000. The most severe implications of this disease are neurological deficits due to cranial nerve compression, cosmetic appearance, and high recurrence rates even in the setting of surgical and medical therapy interventions. Methods: A PubMed search of &amp;amp;ldquo;pediatric fibrous dysplasia management&amp;amp;rdquo; using MESH Terms was conducted. Articles were excluded for non-English languages, inaccessibility, and events/erratum/letters to the editor. Included articles were in English, as well as encompassed pediatric FD case reports or comprehensive reviews of FD that discussed pediatric presentations. Results: A total of 109 articles were reviewed, and 44 were included in the final review. Most articles were case reports. There is a clear need for guidelines regarding surgical intervention, especially in the pediatric population, where hormonal fluctuation can influence rates of recurrence and bony deformity. Overall, most surgeons recommend close observation with biomarkers and radiographic imaging for asymptomatic patients until at least the age of 16 years old. Conservative methods, such as RANK-L inhibitors, can be utilized to decrease growth with some success, especially in older adolescents. Conclusion: This review is an update on this disease and its presentations, imaging findings, and treatment options. The current literature lacks clear guidance on management, especially in regard to surgical intervention or recurrence monitoring algorithms.</p>

	<p>This perspective paper explores the untapped potential of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning-based dimension reduction techniques in multimodal neuroimaging analysis of Long COVID fatigue. The complexity and high dimensionality of neuroimaging data from modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pose significant analytical challenges. Deep neural networks and other machine learning approaches offer powerful tools for managing this complexity and extracting meaningful patterns. The paper discusses current challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, reviews state-of-the-art AI approaches for dimension reduction and multimodal integration, and examines their potential applications in Long COVID research. Key areas of focus include the development of AI-based biomarkers, AI-informed treatment strategies, and personalized medicine approaches. The authors argue that AI-driven multimodal neuroimaging analysis represents a paradigm shift in studying complex brain disorders like Long COVID. While acknowledging technical and ethical challenges, the paper emphasizes the potential of these advanced techniques to uncover new insights into the condition, which might lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for those affected by Long COVID fatigue. The broader implications for understanding and treating other complex neurological and psychiatric conditions are also discussed.</p>

	<p>Acoustic noise is known to perturb reading for good readers, including children and adults. This external acoustic noise interfering at the multimodal areas in the brain causes difficulties reducing reading and writing performances. Moreover, it is known that people with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and dyslexia have reading deficits even in the absence of acoustic noise. The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of additional acoustic noise on an adult with DCD and dyslexia. Indeed, as vision is the main source of information for the brain during reading, a noisy internal visual crowding has been observed in many cases of readers with dyslexia, as additional mirror or duplicated images of words are perceived by these observers, simultaneously with the primary images. Here, we show that when the noisy internal visual crowding and an increasing external acoustic noise are superimposed, a reading disruptive threshold at about 50 to 60 dBa of noise is reached, depending on the type of acoustic noise for a young adult with DCD and dyslexia but not for a control. More interestingly, we report that this disruptive noise threshold can be controlled by Hebbian mechanisms linked to a pulse-modulated lighting that erases the confusing internal crowding images. An improvement of 12 dBa in the disruptive threshold is then observed with two types of acoustic noises, showing the potential utility of Hebbian optocontrol in managing reading difficulties in adults with DCD and dyslexia.</p>

                Objectives Good oral hygiene measures are important for successful orthodontic treatment. They involve various types of mouthwashes which have been reported to cause alteration of mechanical properties of archwires. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a new kind of chlorine-dioxide-containing mouthwash on the mechanical properties and surface morphology of stainless steel orthodontic archwires against the already prevalent chlorhexidine mouthwash in the market. Method Group A – Chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2% (study), Group B – Chlorine Dioxide mouthwash (study), and Group C – Artificial Saliva (control). 42 specimens of 5 cm long 19x25 inch SS archwires were immersed in each group equally. Post immersion, the frictional force was analyzed in the universal testing machine for each group using custom-made acrylic jigs for 10 specimens. The remaining 4 specimens from each group were sent for surface morphology evaluation using an atomic force microscope. Results Friction resistance evaluation for the archwires revealed a mean friction of 0.011 ± 0.0056 in Group A, 0.015 ± 0.0052 in Group B, and 0.010 ± 0.0067 in Group C. Results suggested that the static friction of Group C (control group) was found to be the least when compared with the experimental groups, although not producing statistically significant values. Surface roughness of archwires compared at a 10μm range revealed a mean roughness of 19.38 ± 0.82 in Group A, 25.39 ± 7.01 in Group B, and 16.65 ± 3.07 in Group C which shows there wasn’t any statistically significant difference in the mean roughness midst the three sets. Conclusion Chlorine dioxide and Chlorhexidine mouthwashes caused an increase in the frictional resistance of the archwires when compared to the control group. This increase was statistically insignificant. When measured at a range of 10μm the mean surface roughness did not statistically differ across the control and the experimental groups.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The 2017 McDonald criteria continued the separation of diagnostic criteria for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) for historical, rather than biological, reasons. We aimed to explore the feasibility of a single, unified set of diagnostic criteria when applied to patients with suspected PPMS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively identified patients evaluated for suspected PPMS at 5 European centers. The 2017 McDonald PPMS criteria was the gold standard against which the 2017 McDonald RRMS dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time criteria were evaluated. We also investigated modified RRMS DIS criteria, including: (i) optic nerve lesions; (ii) ≥2 spinal cord lesions; and (iii) higher fulfilment of DIS criteria alone (lesions in ≥3 regions) without dissemination in time/positive cerebrospinal fluid, for a diagnosis of PPMS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 282 patients were diagnosed with PPMS using the 2017 McDonald criteria, and 40 with alternate disorders. The 2017 McDonald RRMS DIS criteria and the modified DIS criteria including the optic nerve or ≥2 spinal cord lesions performed well in PPMS diagnosis when combined with dissemination in time/positive cerebrospinal fluid (sensitivity 92.9–95.4%, specificity 95%, accuracy 93.2–95.3%). A diagnosis of PPMS based on high fulfillment of modified RRMS DIS criteria had high specificity, but low sensitivity. A diagnostic algorithm applicable to patients evaluated for suspected MS is proposed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The 2017 McDonald RRMS criteria and modifications to DIS criteria, currently under consideration, performed well in PPMS diagnosis. Forthcoming revisions to the McDonald criteria should consider a single, unified set of diagnostic criteria for MS. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intravascular lymphoma is a rare subtype of B-cell lymphoma characterized by a clonal proliferation restricted to the lumen of small vessels. Over 50% of patients exhibit central nervous system (CNS) involvement, but diagnosis is often delayed due to the lack of distinctive features. We aimed to identify key phenotypic features for early diagnosis of intravascular lymphoma with CNS involvement through an in-depth cohort study.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We built up a multicenter retrospective cohort of 17 patients recruited in collaboration with the French Expert Network for Oculo-Cerebral Lymphomas (LOC network), and retrospectively analyzed data from medical records.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this cohort, 15 of 17 (88%) patients developed focal neurological episodes, often fluctuating and/or recurrent, with a sudden onset in 68% of episodes, suggesting a vascular origin. Rapid cognitive deterioration occurred in 15 of 17 (88%) patients, psychiatric manifestations in 8 of 17 (47%), and “B signs” in 14 of 17 (82%). Brain MRI showed polymorphic FLAIR hyperintensities in 14 of 16 (87%) patients, and DWI-positive lesions in 13 of 16 (81%) of patients, which accumulated over time and had unusual characteristics for ischemic lesions (progressive growth, persistent DWI-hyperintensity over 1 month, surrounded by a wider FLAIR hyperintensity). Early-onset inflammatory syndrome, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were observed in over 90% of cases. Mild and inconsistent meningitis contrasted with a nearly-constant hyperproteinorachia. An increased interleukin 10/6 ratio over 0,7 was found in 4 of 7 (57%) patients, and skin biopsy led to a pathological diagnosis in 3 of 6 (50%) patients.</p>

<p>We provide evidence that myelinated tanycytes likely remove cellular waste from the human hippocampus in an aquaporin-4-dependent manner for disposal from the brain. We propose that amyloid beta may play an important role in the differentiation and proliferation of these receptacles.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>One of the most important goals in biomedical sciences is understanding the causal mechanisms of neurodegeneration. A prevalent hypothesis relates to impaired waste clearance mechanisms from the brain due to reported waste aggregation in the brains of Alzheimer patients, including amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. Currently, our understanding of the mechanisms by which waste is removed from the brain is only fragmentary. Here we provide compelling evidence that waste clearance from brain tissue is highly conserved in arachnids and humans. Utilizing RNAscope in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and histological approaches, we demonstrate that cellular debris in spider neurons is engulfed by myelin-forming ependymal glial cells that transect into neuronal somata and form myelin-derived waste-internalizing receptacles. These canal systems channel this debris into the lymphatic system likely in an aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel-dependent manner. We provide robust evidence that a similar process may be true in human hippocampus where vast numbers of myelinated AQP4-immunoreactive ependymal glial cells send cellular projections into the somata of neurons and glial cells where they differentiate into waste internalizing receptacles. In the brains of Alzheimer decedents, hypertrophic impairment of these myelinated glial cells leads to the catastrophic obstruction and depletion of neuronal cytoplasm into the ependymal glial cells. At the cellular level, the structural impairment of macroglia leads to swelling myelin protrusions that appear as electron-lucent circular profiles, explaining spongiform abnormalities associated with the neurodegenerative diseases described here. We propose to term this novel type of macroglia-mediated cell death “gliaptosis.”</p>

                Hamamoto et al. report that disrupting the VPS37A ubiquitin E2 variant-like domain impairs autophagosome closure, resulting in milder autophagy-defective phenotypes in mice compared to those lacking upstream autophagy-related genes. They found that LC3-conjugated phagophores facilitate TBK1-dependent p62 phosphorylation, potentially alleviating proteotoxicity by sequestering protein aggregates.

                Alcobia et al. explore the thymic potential of non-canonical pharyngeal pouches (PPs) using quail-chick chimeras. They show that 2PP shares thymic potential with canonical 3/4PP and local pharyngeal arch (PA) mesenchyme regulates this potential. Transcriptomic analysis reveals distinct pathways mediating PP-PA interactions, potentially regulating thymus development.

                Glanzberg et al. examine neurobehavioral representations of food and cocaine seeking. Prelimbic cortex neurons stably encode specific components of both behaviors. However, significant variation in the degree of overlap between ensembles encoding for food vs. cocaine lever pressing suggests individual differences in how prelimbic cortex ensembles encode multiple reward-seeking behaviors.
