                <p>NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are widely recognized as master regulators of synaptic plasticity, most notably for driving long-term changes in synapse size and strength that support learning. NMDARs are unique among neurotransmitter receptors in that they require binding of both neurotransmitter (glutamate) and co-agonist (e.g., <scp>d</scp>-serine) to open the receptor channel, which leads to the influx of calcium ions that drive synaptic plasticity. Over the past decade, evidence has accumulated that NMDARs also support synaptic plasticity via ion flux-independent (non-ionotropic) signaling upon the binding of glutamate in the absence of co-agonist, although conflicting results have led to significant controversy. Here, we hypothesized that a major source of contradictory results might be attributed to variable occupancy of the co-agonist binding site under different experimental conditions. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated co-agonist availability in acute hippocampal slices from mice of both sexes. We found that enzymatic scavenging of endogenous co-agonists enhanced the magnitude of long-term depression (LTD) induced by non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling in the presence of the NMDAR pore blocker MK801. Conversely, a saturating concentration of <scp>d</scp>-serine completely inhibited LTD and spine shrinkage induced by glutamate binding in the presence of MK801 or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Using a Fo&#x0308;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay in cultured neurons, we further found that <scp>d</scp>-serine completely blocked NMDA-induced conformational movements of the GluN1 cytoplasmic domains in the presence of MK801. Our results support a model in which <scp>d</scp>-serine availability serves to modulate NMDAR signaling and synaptic plasticity even when the NMDAR is blocked by magnesium.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/32/e0170242024?rss=1">Astrocyte D1/D5 Dopamine Receptors Govern Non-Hebbian Long-Term Potentiation at Sensory Synapses onto Lamina I Spinoparabrachial Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent work demonstrated that activation of spinal D1 and D5 dopamine receptors (D1/D5Rs) facilitates non-Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) at primary afferent synapses onto spinal projection neurons. However, the cellular localization of the D1/D5Rs driving non-Hebbian LTP in spinal nociceptive circuits remains unknown, and it is also unclear whether D1/D5R signaling must occur concurrently with sensory input in order to promote non-Hebbian LTP at these synapses. Here we investigate these issues using cell-type&ndash;selective knockdown of D1Rs or D5Rs from lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, or astrocytes in adult mice of either sex using Cre recombinase-based genetic strategies. The LTP evoked by low-frequency stimulation of primary afferents in the presence of the selective D1/D5R agonist SKF82958 persisted following the knockdown of D1R or D5R in spinoparabrachial neurons, suggesting that postsynaptic D1/D5R signaling was dispensable for non-Hebbian plasticity at sensory synapses onto these key output neurons of the superficial dorsal horn (SDH). Similarly, the knockdown of D1Rs or D5Rs in DRG neurons failed to influence SKF82958-enabled LTP in lamina I projection neurons. In contrast, SKF82958-induced LTP was suppressed by the knockdown of D1R or D5R in spinal astrocytes. Furthermore, the data indicate that the activation of D1R/D5Rs in spinal astrocytes can either retroactively or proactively drive non-Hebbian LTP in spinoparabrachial neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that dopaminergic signaling in astrocytes can strongly promote activity-dependent LTP in the SDH, which is predicted to significantly enhance the amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission from the spinal cord to the brain.</p>

                <p>MicroRNAs are emerging as crucial regulators within the complex, dynamic environment of the synapse, and they offer a promising new avenue for the treatment of neurological disease. These small noncoding RNAs modify gene expression in several ways, including posttranscriptional modulation via binding to complementary and semicomplementary sites on target mRNAs. This rapid, finely tuned regulation of gene expression is essential to meet the dynamic demands of the synapse. Here, we provide a detailed review of the multifaceted world of synaptic microRNA regulation. We discuss the many mechanisms by which microRNAs regulate gene expression at the synapse, particularly in the context of neuronal plasticity. We also describe the various factors, such as age, sex, and neurological disease, that can influence microRNA expression and activity in neurons. In summary, microRNAs play a crucial role in the intricate and quickly changing functional requirements of the synapse, and context is essential in the study of microRNAs and their potential therapeutic applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/32/e0463242024?rss=1">Decreased Beta Power and OFC-STN Phase Synchronization during Reactive Stopping in Freely Behaving Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>During natural behavior, an action often needs to be suddenly stopped in response to an unexpected sensory input&mdash;referred to as reactive stopping. Reactive stopping has been mostly investigated in humans, which led to hypotheses about the involvement of different brain structures, in particular the hyperdirect pathway. Here, we directly investigate the contribution and interaction of two key regions of the hyperdirect pathway, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), using dual-area, multielectrode recordings in male rats performing a stop-signal task. In this task, rats have to initiate movement to a go-signal, and occasionally stop their movement to the go-signal side after a stop-signal, presented at various stop-signal delays. Both the OFC and STN show near-simultaneous field potential reductions in the beta frequency range (12&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) compared with the period preceding the go-signal and the movement period. These transient reductions (~200&nbsp;ms) only happen during reactive stopping, which is when the stop-signal was received after action initiation, and are well timed after stop-signal onset and before the estimated time of stopping. Phase synchronization analysis also showed a transient attenuation of synchronization between the OFC and STN in the beta range during reactive stopping. The present results provide the first direct quantification of local neural oscillatory activity in the OFC and STN and interareal synchronization specifically timed during reactive stopping.</p>

                <p>The mechanisms utilized by neurons to regulate the efficacy of phasic and tonic inhibition and their impacts on synaptic plasticity and behavior are incompletely understood. Cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1 (Clptm1) is a membrane-spanning protein that interacts with multiple -aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) subunits, trapping them in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi network. Overexpression and knock-down studies suggest that Clptm1 modulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-mediated phasic inhibition and tonic inhibition as well as activity-induced inhibitory synaptic homeostasis in cultured hippocampal neurons. To investigate the role of Clptm1 in the modulation of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in vivo, we generated Clptm1 knock-out (KO) mice. Here, we show that genetic KO of Clptm1 elevated phasic and tonic inhibitory transmission in both male and female heterozygous mice. Although basal excitatory synaptic transmission was not affected, Clptm1 haploinsufficiency significantly blocked high-frequency stimulation-induced long&ndash;term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA3-&gt;CA1 synapses. In the hippocampus-dependent contextual fear-conditioning behavior task, both male and female Clptm1 heterozygous KO mice exhibited impairment in contextual fear memory. In addition, LTP and contextual fear memory were rescued by application of L-655,708, a negative allosteric modulator of the extrasynaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R &alpha;5 subunit. These results suggest that haploinsufficiency of Clptm1 contributes to cognitive deficits through altered synaptic transmission and plasticity by elevation of inhibitory neurotransmission, with tonic inhibition playing a major role.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/32/e0528242024?rss=1">Generation and Characterization of a Novel Prkcd-Cre Rat Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Activity of central amygdala (CeA) PKC expressing neurons has been linked to appetite regulation, anxiety-like behaviors, pain sensitivity, and addiction-related behaviors. Studies of the role that CeA PKC+ neurons play in these behaviors have largely been carried out in mice, and genetic tools that would allow selective manipulation of PKC+ cells in rats have been lacking. Here, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to generate a transgenic <I>Prkcd</I>-cre knock-in rat and characterized this model using anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches in both sexes. In the CeA, Cre was selectively expressed in PKC+ cells. Anterograde projections of PKC+ neurons to cortical regions, subcortical regions, several hypothalamic nuclei, the amygdala complex, and midbrain dopaminergic regions were largely consistent with published mouse data. In a behavioral screen, we found no differences between Cre<sup>+</sup> rats and Cre<sup>&ndash;</sup> wild-type littermates. Optogenetic stimulation of CeA PKC+ neurons in a palatable food intake assay resulted in an increased latency to first feeding and decreased total food intake, once again replicating published mouse findings. Lastly, using a real-time place preference task, we found that stimulation of PKC+ neurons promoted aversion, without affecting locomotor activity. Collectively, these findings establish the novel <I>Prkcd</I>-Cre rat line as a valuable tool that complements available mouse lines for investigating the functional role of PKC+ neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/32/e0629242024?rss=1">The Consolidation of Newly Learned Movements Depends upon the Somatosensory Cortex in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Studies using magnetic brain stimulation indicate the involvement of somatosensory regions in the acquisition and retention of newly learned movements. Recent work found an impairment in motor memory when retention was tested shortly after the application of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to the primary somatosensory cortex, compared with stimulation of the primary motor cortex or a control zone. This finding that the somatosensory cortex is involved in motor memory retention whereas the motor cortex is not, if confirmed, could alter our understanding of human motor learning. It would indicate that plasticity in sensory systems underlies newly learned movements, which is different than the commonly held view that adaptation learning involves updates to a motor controller. Here we test this idea. Participants were trained in a visuomotor adaptation task, with visual feedback gradually shifted. Following adaptation, cTBS was applied either to M1, S1, or an occipital cortex control area. Participants were tested for retention 24&nbsp;h later. It was observed that S1 stimulation led to reduced retention of prior learning, compared with stimulation of M1 or the control area (with no significant difference between M1 and control). In a further control, cTBS was applied to S1 following training with unrotated feedback, in which no learning occurred. This had no effect on movement in the retention test indicating the effects of S1 stimulation on movement are learning specific. The findings are consistent with the S1 participation in the encoding of learning-related changes to movements and in the retention of human motor memory.</p>

                <p>Sleep slow waves are the hallmark of deeper non-rapid eye movement sleep. It is generally assumed that gray matter properties predict slow-wave density, morphology, and spectral power in healthy adults. Here, we tested the association between gray matter volume (GMV) and slow-wave characteristics in 27 patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI, 32.0 &plusmn; 12.2&nbsp;years old, eight women) and compared that with 32 healthy controls (29.2 &plusmn; 11.5&nbsp;years old, nine women). Participants underwent overnight polysomnography and cerebral MRI with a 3&nbsp;Tesla scanner. A whole-brain voxel&ndash;wise analysis was performed to compare GMV between groups. Slow-wave density, morphology, and spectral power (0.4&ndash;6&nbsp;Hz) were computed, and GMV was extracted from the thalamus, cingulate, insula, precuneus, and orbitofrontal cortex to test the relationship between slow waves and gray matter in regions implicated in the generation and/or propagation of slow waves. Compared with controls, TBI patients had significantly lower frontal and temporal GMV and exhibited a subtle decrease in slow-wave frequency. Moreover, higher GMV in the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, cingulate cortex, and precuneus was associated with higher slow-wave frequency and slope, but only in healthy controls. Higher orbitofrontal GMV was also associated with higher slow-wave density in healthy participants. While we observed the expected associations between GMV and slow-wave characteristics in healthy controls, no such associations were observed in the TBI group despite lower GMV. This finding challenges the presumed role of GMV in slow-wave generation and morphology.</p>

                <p>Neuroticism/negative emotionality (N/NE)&mdash;the tendency to experience anxiety, fear, and other negative emotions&mdash;is a fundamental dimension of temperament with profound consequences for health, wealth, and well-being. Elevated N/NE is associated with a panoply of adverse outcomes, from reduced socioeconomic attainment to psychiatric illness. Animal research suggests that N/NE reflects heightened reactivity to uncertain threat in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce), but the relevance of these discoveries to humans has remained unclear. Here we used a novel combination of psychometric, psychophysiological, and neuroimaging approaches to test this hypothesis in an ethnoracially diverse, sex-balanced sample of 220 emerging adults selectively recruited to encompass a broad spectrum of N/NE. Cross-validated robust-regression analyses demonstrated that N/NE is preferentially associated with heightened BST activation during the uncertain anticipation of a genuinely distressing threat (aversive multimodal stimulation), whereas N/NE was unrelated to BST activation during certain-threat anticipation, Ce activation during either type of threat anticipation, or BST/Ce reactivity to threat-related faces. It is often assumed that different threat paradigms are interchangeable assays of individual differences in brain function, yet this has rarely been tested. Our results revealed negligible associations between BST/Ce reactivity to the anticipation of threat and the presentation of threat-related faces, indicating that the two tasks are nonfungible. These observations provide a framework for conceptualizing emotional traits and disorders; for guiding the design and interpretation of biobank and other neuroimaging studies of psychiatric risk, disease, and treatment; and for refining mechanistic research.</p>

                <p>Overexpression of the agouti-signaling protein (<I>asip1</I>), an endogenous melanocortin antagonist, under the control of a constitutive promoter in zebrafish [Tg(Xla.Eef1a1:Cau.Asip1]iim4] (<I>asip1</I>-Tg) increases food intake by reducing sensitivity of the central satiety systems and abolish circadian activity rhythms. The phenotype also shows increased linear growth and body weight, yet no enhanced aggressiveness in dyadic fights is observed. In fact, <I>asip1</I>-Tg animals choose to flee to safer areas rather than face a potential threat, thus suggesting a potential anxiety-like behavior (ALB). Standard behavioral tests, i.e., the open field test (OFT), the novel object test (NOT), and the novel tank dive test (NTDT), were used to investigate thigmotaxis and ALB in male and female zebrafish. Results showed that the <I>asip1</I>-Tg strain exhibited severe ALB in every test, mainly characterized by pronounced freezing behavior and increased linear and angular swimming velocities. <I>asip1</I>-Tg animals exhibited low central serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) levels and high turnover rates, thus suggesting that central monoaminergic pathways might mediate melanocortin antagonist-induced ALB. Accordingly, the treatment of <I>asip1</I>-Tg animals with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), reversed the ALB phenotype in NTDT as well as 5-HT turnover. Genomic and anatomical data further supported neuronal interaction between melanocortinergic and serotonergic systems. These results suggest that inhibition of the melanocortin system by ubiquitous overexpression of endogenous antagonist has an anxiogenic effect mediated by serotonergic transmission.</p>

                <p>Little is known about the electrophysiologic activity of the intact human spinal cord during volitional movement. We analyzed epidural spinal recordings from a total of five human subjects of both sexes during a variety of upper extremity movements and found that these spinal epidural electrograms contain spectral information distinguishing periods of movement, rest, and sensation. Cervical epidural electrograms also contained spectral changes time-locked with movement. We found that these changes were primarily associated with increased power in the theta (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) band and feature increased theta phase to gamma amplitude coupling, and this increase in theta power can be used to topographically map distinct upper extremity movements onto the cervical spinal cord in accordance with established myotome maps of the upper extremity. Our findings have implications for the development of neurostimulation protocols and devices focused on motor rehabilitation for the upper extremity, and the approach presented here may facilitate spatiotemporal mapping of naturalistic movements.</p>

                <p>Serial dependence has shown seemingly contradictory effects on visual perception and working memory. While serial dependence promotes perpetual and mnemonic stability, it biases behavioral reports toward prior information. The neural mechanisms that drive both biasing and adaptive stabilizing effects are not well understood. We proposed and tested a reactivation and integration mechanism that can account for these contradictory effects. We used multivariate pattern analyses of EEG data (26 human participants, 17 females, 9 males) to examine the reactivation of prior reported orientation during the delay period of a visual working memory task. The reactivation strength of prior reports, but not prior sensory items, was predictive of the magnitude of serial dependency biases. These reactivated representations integrated with the representation of the current memory item and improved the ability to decode the current contents of memory. Overall, our data provide convergent evidence suggesting that prior reports in a visual working memory task are reactivated on the subsequent trial and become integrated with current memory representations. This similarity-dependent reactivation mechanism drives both report biasing and stabilization effects attributed to serial dependence in working memory.</p>

                <p>It has long been assumed that activity patterns persist in neuronal circuits after they are first experienced, as part of the process of information processing and storage by the brain. However, these "reverberations" of current activity have not been directly observed on a single-neuron level in a mammalian system. Here we demonstrate that specific induced activity patterns are retained in mature cultured hippocampal neuronal networks. Neurons within the network are induced to fire at a single frequency or in a more complex pattern containing two distinct frequencies. After the stimulation was stopped, the subsequent neuronal activity of hundreds of neurons in the network was monitored. In the case of single-frequency stimulation, it was observed that many of the neurons continue to fire at the same frequency that they were stimulated to fire at. Using a recurrent neural network trained to detect specific, more complex patterns, we found that the multiple-frequency stimulation patterns were also retained within the neuronal network. Moreover, it appears that the component frequencies of the more complex patterns are stored in different populations of neurons and neuron subtypes.</p>

                Background Polypharmacy is common among hospitalized patients with infectious infections owing to comorbidities or concomitant illnesses. This raises the likelihood of drug-drug interactions and creates uncertainty for healthcare providers. This study aimed to assess the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) among hospitalized patients with infectious diseases in a secondary care hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in the internal medicine ward for six months after the ethics committee’s approval. Data were collected from patient case records, and prescriptions were screened for pDDIs from a portable electronic physician information database (PEPID) resource analyzed using SPSS, version 27.0. Results In total, 148 patient case records were analyzed, and 549 pDDIs were identified, with 66.8% having at least one or more DDIs. The mean number of drug interactions was 3.70 ± 4.58 per prescription. The most frequently encountered drug interactions were drug combinations such as bisoprolol with atorvastatin and aspirin with tazobactam/piperacillin. Bivariate analysis showed that age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and the number of drugs prescribed were risk factors associated with DDIs (p<0.05). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, DDIs were significantly associated with comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study observed the prevalence of DDIs in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases of ‘moderate’ severity. Prescription screening using a drug information database assists in early identification and prevention of DDIs, enhancing drug safety and quality of patient-centered care.

Vinculin binds to specific sites of mechanically unfolded talin rod domains to reinforce the coupling of the cell’s exterior to its force generation machinery. Force-dependent vinculin–talin complexation and dissociation was previously observed as contraction or extension of the unfolded talin domains respectively using magnetic tweezers. However, the structural mechanism underlying vinculin recognition of unfolded vinculin binding sites (VBSs) in talin remains unknown. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that a VBS dynamically refolds under force, and that vinculin can recognize and bind to partially unfolded VBS states. Vinculin binding enables refolding of the mechanically strained VBS and stabilizes its folded α-helical conformation, providing resistance against mechanical stress. Together, these results provide an understanding of a recognition mechanism of proteins unfolded by force and insight into the initial moments of how vinculin binds unfolded talin rod domains during the assembly of this mechanosensing meshwork.

                <p>by Lies Zandberg, Veronica Morfi, Julia M. George, David F. Clayton, Dan Stowell, Robert F. Lachlan</p>

Our understanding of bird song, a model system for animal communication and the neurobiology of learning, depends critically on making reliable, validated comparisons between the complex multidimensional syllables that are used in songs. However, most assessments of song similarity are based on human inspection of spectrograms, or computational methods developed from human intuitions. Using a novel automated operant conditioning system, we collected a large corpus of zebra finches’ (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) decisions about song syllable similarity. We use this dataset to compare and externally validate similarity algorithms in widely-used publicly available software (Raven, Sound Analysis Pro, Luscinia). Although these methods all perform better than chance, they do not closely emulate the avian assessments. We then introduce a novel deep learning method that can produce perceptual similarity judgements trained on such avian decisions. We find that this new method outperforms the established methods in accuracy and more closely approaches the avian assessments. Inconsistent (hence ambiguous) decisions are a common occurrence in animal behavioural data; we show that a modification of the deep learning training that accommodates these leads to the strongest performance. We argue this approach is the best way to validate methods to compare song similarity, that our dataset can be used to validate novel methods, and that the general approach can easily be extended to other species.

                <p>by Hiroto Murata, Kazuma Toko, George Chikenji</p>

A protein superfold is a type of protein fold that is observed in at least three distinct, non-homologous protein families. Structural classification studies have revealed a limited number of prevalent superfolds alongside several infrequent occurring folds, and in <i>α</i>/<i>β</i> type superfolds, the C-terminal <i>β</i>-strand tends to favor the edge of the <i>β</i>-sheet, while the N-terminal <i>β</i>-strand is often found in the middle. The reasons behind these observations, whether they are due to evolutionary sampling bias or physical interactions, remain unclear. This article offers a physics-based explanation for these observations, specifically for pure parallel <i>β</i>-sheet topologies. Our investigation is grounded in several established structural rules that are based on physical interactions. We have identified “frustration-free topologies” which are topologies that can satisfy all the rules simultaneously. In contrast, topologies that cannot are termed “frustrated topologies.” Our findings reveal that frustration-free topologies represent only a fraction of all theoretically possible patterns, these topologies strongly favor positioning the C-terminal <i>β</i>-strand at the edge of the <i>β</i>-sheet and the N-terminal <i>β</i>-strand in the middle, and there is significant overlap between frustration-free topologies and superfolds. We also used a lattice protein model to thoroughly investigate sequence-structure relationships. Our results show that frustration-free structures are highly designable, while frustrated structures are poorly designable. These findings suggest that superfolds are highly designable due to their lack of frustration, and the preference for positioning C-terminal <i>β</i>-strands at the edge of the <i>β</i>-sheet is a direct result of frustration-free topologies. These insights not only enhance our understanding of sequence-structure relationships but also have significant implications for de novo protein design.

Understanding the dynamic evolution of <i>Salmonella</i> is vital for effective bacterial infection management. This study explores the role of the flexible genome, organised in regions of genomic plasticity (RGP), in shaping the pathogenicity of <i>Salmonella</i> lineages. Through comprehensive genomic analysis of 12,244 <i>Salmonella</i> spp. genomes covering 2 species, 6 subspecies, and 46 serovars, we uncover distinct integration patterns of pathogenicity-related gene clusters into RGP, challenging traditional views of gene distribution. These RGP exhibit distinct preferences for specific genomic spots, and the presence or absence of such spots across <i>Salmonella</i> lineages profoundly shapes strain pathogenicity. RGP preferences are guided by conserved flanking genes surrounding integration spots, implicating their involvement in regulatory networks and functional synergies with integrated gene clusters. Additionally, we emphasise the multifaceted contributions of plasmids and prophages to the pathogenicity of diverse <i>Salmonella</i> lineages. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive blueprint of the pathogenicity potential of <i>Salmonella</i>. This unique insight identifies genomic spots in nonpathogenic lineages that hold the potential for harbouring pathogenicity genes, providing a foundation for predicting future adaptations and developing targeted strategies against emerging human pathogenic strains.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-904/v1?src=rss">Stage 2 Registered Report Personal factors and group creative outcomes: A correlational meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has indicated that individual differences play a role in group creativity. Group creativity activities have different outcomes, leading to numerous ways to assess the effectiveness of these creative activities. To date, no meta-analysis has been performed on the relationship between the outcomes of the creative activity and personal factors of the group members. In this Registered Report, we conducted a meta-analysis (n = 11, k = 72) on the relationship between personal factors and group creativity outcomes. We found weak support for a positive correlation between self-efficacy and group creativity outcomes, between r = .04 and r = .67. We found weak support for a moderation effect of time constraint, with stronger relationships for conditions limited to 20 minutes as opposed to 10 minutes. Finally, we found that only a few studies could be included in the meta-analysis, because many studies (1) did not directly measure creativity, or (2) measured other, less common personal factors. We call for a more systematic and direct approach to measuring creativity and an improvement of open science practices in the field. Data and analysis can be found at https://osf.io/xwph9.

                Turecek and Ginty record from mechanosensory neurons in awake, freely moving animals. They find that Pacinian neurons tuned to mechanical vibration can detect body movement and subtle environmental vibrations from great distances. Pacinian neurons also span a range of sensitivities, allowing them to encode a wide range of environmental stimuli.

The activation of a myogenin-myostatin axis drives muscle atrophy in this model, and muscle atrophy can be rescued by inhibiting myogenin or myostatin.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86042">Actin networks modulate heterogenous NF-κB dynamics in response to TNFα</a></h4>

              
                The canonical NF-κB transcription factor RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in PDAC tumours. In this study, we characterised previously unexplored endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines through live single cell imaging. Our observations revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA. Through Bayesian analysis of single cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA, we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα. Additionally, we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα. Taken together, we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94070">Chromosome structure in Drosophila is determined by boundary pairing not loop extrusion</a></h4>

              
                Two different models have been proposed to explain how the endpoints of chromatin looped domains (‘TADs’) in eukaryotic chromosomes are determined. In the first, a cohesin complex extrudes a loop until it encounters a boundary element roadblock, generating a stem-loop. In this model, boundaries are functionally autonomous: they have an intrinsic ability to halt the movement of incoming cohesin complexes that is independent of the properties of neighboring boundaries. In the second, loops are generated by boundary:boundary pairing. In this model, boundaries are functionally non-autonomous, and their ability to form a loop depends upon how well they match with their neighbors. Moreover, unlike the loop-extrusion model, pairing interactions can generate both stem-loops and circle-loops. We have used a combination of MicroC to analyze how TADs are organized, and experimental manipulations of the <i>even skipped</i> TAD boundary, <i>homie</i>, to test the predictions of the ‘loop-extrusion’ and the ‘boundary-pairing’ models. Our findings are incompatible with the loop-extrusion model, and instead suggest that the endpoints of TADs in flies are determined by a mechanism in which boundary elements physically pair with their partners, either head-to-head or head-to-tail, with varying degrees of specificity. Although our experiments do not address how partners find each other, the mechanism is unlikely to require loop extrusion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94948">Insights into early animal evolution form the genome of the xenacoelomorph worm Xenoturbella bocki</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary origins of Bilateria remain enigmatic. One of the more enduring proposals highlights similarities between a cnidarian-like planula larva and simple acoel-like flatworms. This idea is based in part on the view of the Xenacoelomorpha as an outgroup to all other bilaterians which are themselves designated the Nephrozoa (protostomes and deuterostomes). Genome data can provide important comparative data and help to understand the evolution and biology of enigmatic species better. Here we assemble and analyse the genome of the simple, marine xenacoelomorph <i>Xenoturbella bocki</i>, a key species for our understanding of early bilaterian evolution. Our highly contiguous genome assembly of <i>X. bocki</i> has a size of ~111 Mbp in 18 chromosome like scaffolds, with repeat content and intron, exon and intergenic space comparable to other bilaterian invertebrates. We find <i>X. bocki</i> to have a similar number of genes to other bilaterians and to have retained ancestral metazoan synteny. Key bilaterian signalling pathways are also largely complete and most bilaterian miRNAs are present. Overall, we conclude that <i>X. bocki</i> has a complex genome typical of bilaterians, which does not reflect the apparent simplicity of its body plan that has been so important to proposals that the Xenacoelomorpha are the simple sister group of the rest of the Bilateria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91359">Enkephalin-mediated modulation of basal somatic sensitivity by regulatory T cells in mice</a></h4>

              
                CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg) have been implicated in pain modulation in various inflammatory conditions. However, whether Treg cells hamper pain at steady state and by which mechanism is still unclear. From a meta-analysis of the transcriptomes of murine Treg and conventional T cells (Tconv), we observe that the proenkephalin gene (<i>Penk</i>), encoding the precursor of analgesic opioid peptides, ranks among the top 25 genes most enriched in Treg cells. We then present various evidence suggesting that <i>Penk</i> is regulated in part by members of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) family and the transcription factor Basic leucine zipper transcription faatf-like (BATF). Using mice in which the promoter activity of <i>Penk</i> can be tracked with a fluorescent reporter, we also show that <i>Penk</i> expression is mostly detected in Treg and activated Tconv in non-inflammatory conditions in the colon and skin. Functionally, Treg cells proficient or deficient for <i>Penk</i> suppress equally well the proliferation of effector T cells in vitro and autoimmune colitis in vivo. In contrast, inducible ablation of <i>Penk</i> in Treg leads to heat hyperalgesia in both male and female mice. Overall, our results indicate that Treg might play a key role at modulating basal somatic sensitivity in mice through the production of analgesic opioid peptides.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83320">Syntaxin-6 delays prion protein fibril formation and prolongs presence of toxic aggregation intermediates</a></h4>

              
                Prions replicate via the autocatalytic conversion of cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into fibrillar assemblies of misfolded PrP. While this process has been extensively studied in vivo and in vitro, non-physiological reaction conditions of fibril formation in vitro have precluded the identification and mechanistic analysis of cellular proteins, which may alter PrP self-assembly and prion replication. Here, we have developed a fibril formation assay for recombinant murine and human PrP (23-231) under near-native conditions (NAA) to study the effect of cellular proteins, which may be risk factors or potential therapeutic targets in prion disease. Genetic screening suggests that variants that increase syntaxin-6 expression in the brain (gene: STX6) are risk factors for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Analysis of the protein in NAA revealed, counterintuitively, that syntaxin-6 is a potent inhibitor of PrP fibril formation. It significantly delayed the lag phase of fibril formation at highly sub-stoichiometric molar ratios. However, when assessing toxicity of different aggregation time points to primary neurons, syntaxin-6 prolonged the presence of neurotoxic PrP species. Electron microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy revealed that, instead of highly ordered fibrils, in the presence of syntaxin-6 PrP formed less-ordered aggregates containing syntaxin-6. These data strongly suggest that the protein can directly alter the initial phase of PrP self-assembly and, uniquely, can act as an 'anti-chaperone', which promotes toxic aggregation intermediates by inhibiting fibril formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94114">Stem-loop and circle-loop TADs generated by directional pairing of boundary elements have distinct physical and regulatory properties</a></h4>

              
                The chromosomes in multicellular eukaryotes are organized into a series of topologically independent loops called TADs. In flies, TADs are formed by physical interactions between neighboring boundaries. Fly boundaries exhibit distinct partner preferences, and pairing interactions between boundaries are typically orientation-dependent. Pairing can be head-to-tail or head-to-head. The former generates a stem-loop TAD, while the latter gives a circle-loop TAD. The TAD that encompasses the <i>Drosophila even skipped</i> (<i>eve</i>) gene is formed by the head-to-tail pairing of the <i>nhomie</i> and <i>homie</i> boundaries. To explore the relationship between loop topology and the physical and regulatory landscape, we flanked the <i>nhomie</i> boundary region with two attP sites. The attP sites were then used to generate four boundary replacements: <i>λ DNA</i>, <i>nhomie forward</i> (WT orientation), <i>nhomie reverse</i> (opposite of WT orientation), and <i>homie forward</i> (same orientation as WT <i>homie</i>). The <i>nhomie forward</i> replacement restores the WT physical and regulatory landscape: in MicroC experiments, the <i>eve</i> TAD is a ‘volcano’ triangle topped by a plume, and the <i>eve</i> gene and its regulatory elements are sequestered from interactions with neighbors. The <i>λ DNA</i> replacement lacks boundary function: the endpoint of the ‘new’ <i>eve</i> TAD on the <i>nhomie</i> side is ill-defined, and <i>eve</i> stripe enhancers activate a nearby gene, <i>eIF3j</i>. While <i>nhomie reverse</i> and <i>homie forward</i> restore the <i>eve</i> TAD, the topology is a circle-loop, and this changes the local physical and regulatory landscape. In MicroC experiments, the <i>eve</i> TAD interacts with its neighbors, and the plume at the top of the <i>eve</i> triangle peak is converted to a pair of ‘clouds’ of contacts with the next-door TADs. Consistent with the loss of isolation afforded by the stem-loop topology, the <i>eve</i> enhancers weakly activate genes in the neighboring TADs. Conversely, <i>eve</i> function is partially disrupted.

">Repetition effects reveal the sub-sequence representation of actions</a></h4>

              
                When a movement sequence is repeated, the second execution is faster than the first. This demonstrates that the brain retains some trace of the just executed sequence, the earliest form of sequence memory. Currently it is unclear whether this memory trace is represented at the level (a) transitions between movements, (b) chunks of multiple movements, or (c) the entire sequence. To answer this question, we instructed human participants to generate sequences of 11 finger presses in a delayed response paradigm. From one trial to the next, segments of variable length (1, 2, 4, 6, 11) could be repeated from the previous trial. We observed that repetition benefits appeared when a segment of 4 consecutive finger presses or longer was repeated from the previous trial. This suggests that the benefit of repetition is not merely the sum of improvements in individual transitions, nor does it require the entire sequence to be repeated. The repetition benefit was small for the first transition of a repeated segment and increased with additional repetitions. This suggests that the memory supporting the repetition effect is mainly activated when a series of past movements matches the memory trace. Planned future movements had less of an effect on the repetition effect. Our results provide insight into the structure of the earliest memory traces for motor sequences.

">Selective deletion of Tsc1 from mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons drives sex-specific behavioral impairments linked to autism</a></h4>

              
                There is a striking sex bias in the prevalence and severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 80% of diagnoses occurring in males. Because the molecular etiology of ASD is likely combinatorial, including interactions across multiple genetic and environmental factors, it is difficult to investigate the physiological mechanisms driving sex-specific differences. Loss of function mutations in TSC1 result in dysregulated mTORC1 signaling and underlie a multi-system disorder known as tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Interestingly, more than 50% of individuals diagnosed with TSC are also diagnosed with ASD, making TSC mutations one of the most prevalent monogenic causes of ASD. Mice harboring targeted deletion of Tsc1 selectively in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, referred to here as Tsc1mut/mut, have multiple ASD-linked behavioral impairments, including deficits in social interactions, motor coordination, and vocalizations. However, these ASD-linked behavioral deficits have only been investigated using male Tsc1mut/mut animals. Here, we used cohorts of male and female Tsc1mut/mut animals to determine if behavioral impairments, previously identified in this model, are similar across sex. Specifically, we measured balance and motor coordination and social interaction behaviors in two age groups across sex. We determined balance and motor coordination deficits are similar in male and female Tsc1mut/mut mice, and that deficits in the firing of Tsc1mut/mut Purkinje neurons located in the cerebellar vermis are also similar across sex. However, impairments in social approach behavior were found to be significantly more severe in Tsc1mut/mut males compared to females. These results indicate the selective deletion of Tsc1 in Purkinje neurons differentially impairs cerebellar circuits based on sex.

                The increase in the number of authors per article is a well-documented phenomenon across various academic disciplines. While prior studies have examined this trend in specific fields and countries, they in most cases did not compare the increase in the number of authors between countries. While it has previously shown that the number of authors in neuroscience publications has risen in the G10 countries, no study has yet addressed whether it reflects a global trend in the field. To address this gap, we quantified the global trend in the number of authors in neuroscience publications from 2001 to 2022. Our findings reveal a consistent increase in authorship across nearly all the countries examined. Italy ranks highest in terms of average authorship per article, while Ukraine ranks the lowest. On the other hand, China shows the largest increase in authorship over the years, followed by Norway and Egypt. South Korea is the only country showing a slight decreasing trend rather than growth. These results contribute to a better understanding of authorship patterns in neuroscience, and can stimulate further investigations on the reasons behind such an increase in terms of socio-economic factors, the need for collaborative efforts in some fields, or, on the negative side, the effect of utilitarian reasons to meet career evaluation criteria.

">Intrinsic dynamics shape responses to external stimulation in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                When ongoing sensory stimulation reaches the brain, the resulting neural activity reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. How this intrinsic dynamic affects sensory responses is not well understood. To separate the immediate effect of the stimulus from the recurrent brain dynamic we used a new vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX). Applying this analysis to intracranial recordings in humans, we find that the recurrent connectivity observed during rest is unaltered when humans are watching movies. The recurrent dynamic enhances and prolongs the responses of the brain to scene cuts, fixation onsets, and sound envelope. If one fails to account for these external inputs, then spurious connections appear in the ''functional connectivity''. The model reproduces the prominent observation that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. The model also reveals that sensory areas have mostly outward connections, whereas higher-order brain areas have mostly incoming connections. By combining the concepts of ''functional connectivity'' and ''encoding models'' we introduce an analytical approach capable of revealing interactions between external stimulation and internal dynamics that are not apparent when analyzing these concepts in isolation.

">Resting-State Electroencephalography and Magnetoencephalography in Migraine - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (M/EEG) can provide insights into migraine pathophysiology and help develop clinically valuable biomarkers. To integrate and summarize the existing evidence on changes in brain function in migraine, we performed a systematic review and metaanalysis (PROSPERO CRD42021272622) of resting state M/EEG findings in migraine. We included 27 studies after searching MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, and EMBASE. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Semi-quantitative analysis was conducted by vote counting, and meta-analyses of M/EEG differences between people with migraine and healthy participants were performed using random-effects models. In people with migraine during the interictal phase, metaanalysis revealed higher power of brain activity at theta frequencies (3 to 8 Hz) than in healthy participants. Furthermore, we found evidence for lower alpha and beta connectivity in people with migraine in the interictal phase. No associations between M/EEG features and disease severity were observed. Moreover, some evidence for higher delta and beta power in the premonitory compared to the interictal phase was found. Strongest risk of bias of included studies arose from a lack of controlling for comorbidities and non-automatized or non-blinded M/EEG assessments. These findings can guide future M/EEG studies on migraine pathophysiology and brain based biomarkers, which should consider comorbidities and aim for standardized, collaborative approaches.

">The neurophysiology of healthy and pathological aging: A comprehensive systematic review</a></h4>

              
                As the population of older adults grows, so does the prevalence of neurocognitive disorders such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. While biochemical, genetic, and neuroimaging biomarkers have accelerated early detection and diagnosis, neurophysiological measures are absent from daily medical use. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are two non-invasive techniques that measure neurophysiological signals in the brain and convey information about signal strength at different frequency bands, event-related activity, signal complexity, and temporal correlation between spatially remote brain regions. Here we conducted a pre-registered, comprehensive systematic review of 942 studies using EEG, MEG, and combined MEG and EEG to characterise the neurophysiology of healthy aging, MCI, and dementia under resting-state and task conditions. To complement our search, we also reviewed 51 past reviews in the field. Relevant features of these papers were extracted to present a detailed overview of the current state of evidence. Overall, neurophysiological measures show great promise as diagnostic tools and could prove invaluable in predicting healthy and pathological aging trajectories. However, to reach this potential in clinical practice, it is crucial to adopt longitudinal designs, standardise methodologies, and identify biomarkers at the individual rather than group level.

">Mitochondrial leakage and mtDNA damage trigger early immune response in Inclusion Body Myositis.</a></h4>

              
                Polymyositis with mitochondrial pathology (PM-Mito) was first identified in 1997 as a subtype of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Recent findings demonstrated significant molecular similarities between PM-Mito and Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), suggesting a trajectory from early to late IBM and prompting the inclusion of PM-Mito as an IBM precursor (early IBM) within the IBM spectrum. Both PM-Mito and IBM show mitochondrial abnormalities, suggesting mitochondrial disturbance is a critical element of IBM pathogenesis. The primary objective of this cross-sectional study was to characterize the mitochondrial phenotype in PM-Mito at histological, ultrastructural, and molecular levels and to study the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Skeletal muscle biopsies of 27 patients with PM-Mito and 27 with typical IBM were included for morphological and ultrastructural analysis. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and deletions were assessed by qPCR and long-range PCR, respectively. In addition, full-length single-molecule sequencing of the mtDNA enabled precise mapping of deletions. Protein and RNA levels were studied using unbiased proteomic profiling, immunoblotting, and bulk RNA sequencing. Cell-free mtDNA (cfmtDNA) was measured in the serum of IBM patients. We found widespread mitochondrial abnormalities in both PM-Mito and IBM, illustrated by elevated numbers of COX-negative and SDH-positive fibers and prominent ultrastructural abnormalities with disorganized and concentric cristae within enlarged and dysmorphic mitochondria. MtDNA copy numbers were significantly reduced, and multiple large-scale mtDNA deletions were already evident in PM-Mito, compared to healthy age-matched controls, similar to the IBM group. The activation of the canonical cGAS/STING inflammatory pathway, possibly triggered by the intracellular leakage of mitochondrial DNA, was evident in PM-Mito and IBM. Elevated levels of circulating cfmtDNA also indicated leakage of mtDNA as a likely inflammatory trigger. In PM-Mito and IBM, these findings were accompanied by dysregulation of proteins and transcripts linked to the mitochondrial membranes. In summary, we identified that mitochondrial dysfunction with multiple mtDNA deletions and depletion, disturbed mitochondrial ultrastructure, and defects of the inner mitochondrial membrane are features of PM-Mito and IBM, underlining the concept of an IBM-spectrum disease (IBM-SD). The activation of inflammatory pathways related to mtDNA release indicates a significant role of mitochondria-associated inflammation in the pathogenesis of IBM-SD. Thus, mitochondrial abnormalities precede tissue remodeling and infiltration by specific T-cell subpopulations (e.g., KLRG1+) characteristic of late IBM. This study highlights the critical role of early mitochondrial abnormalities in the pathomechanism of IBM, which may lead to new approaches to therapy.

">Cortical Representation of the Glottal Events during Speech Production</a></h4>

              
                To produce complex motor behaviors such as speech, the nervous system must accommodate the fact that sensory feedback is delayed relative to actual movements; by most accounts, this is accomplished using an internal model that predicts the current state of the body's periphery from recent motor system output. Here we show that onsets of events in the human glottal waveform, measured via electroglottography, are encoded in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) during speech production, maximally reflected at zero time lag. Conversely, we show that glottal event times can be decoded from the EEG. Furthermore, after prolonged exposure to delayed auditory feedback, subjects show a robust recalibration of their behaviorally observed threshold for detecting auditory-motor mismatches, and decoding models that perform best in normal speaking conditions also showed a shift in the predicted times of glottal events relative to actual events. This suggests that decoding performance is driven by plastic internal representations of peripheral event timing (while ruling out movement artifact concerns). Our results provide a missing component for a mechanism to associate specific feedback events with the neurons that gave rise to those movements, mirroring the observation of synchronous bursting of songbird HVC neurons with events in the trajectories of the biophysical parameters that control bird voicing.

">Desegregation of neuronal predictive processing</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits construct internal 'world-models' to guide behavior. The predictive processing framework posits that neural activity signaling sensory predictions and concurrently computing prediction-errors is a signature of those internal models. Here, to understand how the brain generates predictions for complex sensorimotor signals, we investigate the emergence of high-dimensional, multi-modal predictive representations in recurrent networks. We find that robust predictive processing arises in a network with loose excitatory/inhibitory balance. Contrary to previous proposals of functionally specialized cell-types, the network exhibits desegregation of stimulus and prediction-error representations. We confirmed these model predictions by experimentally probing predictive-coding circuits using a rich stimulus-set to violate learned expectations. When constrained by data, our model further reveals and makes concrete testable experimental predictions for the distinct functional roles of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and of neurons in different layers along a laminar hierarchy, in computing multi-modal predictions. These results together imply that in natural conditions, neural representations of internal models are highly distributed, yet structured to allow flexible readout of behaviorally-relevant information. The generality of our model advances the understanding of computation of internal models across species, by incorporating different types of predictive computations into a unified framework.

">Spatial sampling of deep neural network features improves encoding models of foveal and peripheral visual processing in humans</a></h4>

              
                Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used to build encoding models to predict neural data recorded during visual stimulation. Their ability to process natural images makes them a prime candidate for studying the neural profile underlying real-world visual perception. However, there are still prominent discrepancies in how DNNs and humans process visual information. One discrepancy lies in the spatial sampling of visual input: while DNNs uniformly sample from their input at every spatial location, the human visual system samples differentially from central and peripheral regions. Here, we implement multiple spatial sampling strategies on feature maps of DNNs into encoding models that predict human EEG responses to a novel stimulus set consisting of large, high-quality natural scene images. By applying differential spatial sampling of DNN feature maps, we reveal distinct temporal profiles for encoding of peripheral vs. central information in EEG signals. Moreover, we show that a differential spatial sampling derived from the density of retinal ganglion cells yields the best performing encoding model when using DNN feature maps. We experimentally confirm this pattern by separately stimulating peripheral and central visual field regions, and demonstrate that the distinct temporal profiles for central and peripheral information are only revealed when using large-field stimuli. Together, these results show that aligning the spatial sampling of humans and DNN encoding models can improve predictions of neural data. The distinct temporal profiles for encoding of peripheral vs. central information support a global-to-local processing hierarchy of real-world vision.

                Neural decoding via the latent space of deep neural network models can infer perceived and imagined images from neural activities, even when the image is novel for the subject and decoder. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using the latent space enable a subject to retrieve intended image from a large dataset on the basis of their neural activities but have not yet been realized. Here, we used neural decoding in a closed-loop condition to retrieve images of the instructed categories from 2.3 million images on the basis of the latent vector inferred from electrocorticographic signals of visual cortices. Using a latent space of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model, two subjects retrieved images with significant accuracy exceeding 80% for two instructions. In contrast, the image retrieval failed using the latent space of another model, AlexNet. In another task to imagine an image while viewing a different image, the imagery made the inferred latent vector significantly closer to the vector of the imagined category in the CLIP latent space but significantly further away in the AlexNet latent space, although the same electrocorticographic signals from nine subjects were decoded. Humans can retrieve the intended information via a closed-loop BCI with an appropriate latent space.

">Arsenic impairs Drosophila neural stem cell mitotic progression and sleep behavior in a tauopathy model</a></h4>

              
                Despite established exposure limits, arsenic remains the most significant environmental risk factor detrimental to human health and is associated with carcinogenesis and neurotoxicity. Arsenic compromises neurodevelopment, and it is associated with peripheral neuropathy in adults. Exposure to heavy metals, such as arsenic, may also increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying arsenic-induced neurotoxicity remain poorly understood. Elucidating how arsenic contributes to neurotoxicity may mitigate some of the risks associated with chronic sublethal exposure and inform future interventions. In this study, we examine the effects of arsenic exposure on Drosophila larval neurodevelopment and adult neurologic function. Consistent with prior work, we identify significant developmental delays and heightened mortality in response to arsenic. Within the developing larval brain, we identify a dose-dependent increase in brain volume. This aberrant brain growth is coupled with impaired mitotic progression of the neural stem cells (NSCs), progenitors of the neurons and glia of the central nervous system. Live imaging of cycling NSCs reveals significant delays in cell cycle progression upon arsenic treatment, leading to genomic instability. In adults, chronic arsenic exposure reduces neurologic function, such as locomotion. Finally, we show arsenic selectively impairs circadian rhythms in a humanized tauopathy model. These findings inform mechanisms of arsenic neurotoxicity and reveal sex-specific and genetic vulnerabilities to sublethal exposure.

">Brief encounters with real objects modulate medial parietal but not occipitotemporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Humans are skilled at recognizing everyday objects from pictures, even if we have never encountered the depicted object in real life. But if we have encountered an object, how does that real-world experience affect the representation of its photographic image in the human brain? We developed a paradigm that involved brief real-world exploration of everyday objects prior to the measurement of brain activity with fMRI while viewing pictures of the objects. We discovered that while object- responsive regions in lateral occipital and ventral temporal cortex were visually driven and contained highly invariant representations of specific objects, those representations were not modulated by real- world exploration. However, real-world experience with an object produced foci of increased activation in medial parietal and posterior cingulate cortex, identifying an important associative region for the experience gained from manual object exploration. The richness of object representations beyond their photographic image has important implications for understanding object recognition in both the human brain and in computational models.

">Slow-wave sleep and REM sleep differentially contribute to memory representational transformation</a></h4>

              
                Memory transforms over time, gradually becoming less idiosyncratic and more gist-like. While sleep contributes to memory transformation, how different sleep stages and EEG activity influence memory transformation is far from clear. Applying representational similarity analysis to electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, we examined memory representational transformation at both the idiosyncratic 'item-level' and the generic 'category-level'. Our findings revealed that after an overnight sleep, item-level neural representations for post-sleep remembered items were abolished. In contrast, category-level representations remained prominent, but they became distinctive from pre-sleep. Across participants, more rapid eye movement (REM) sleep relative to slow-wave sleep (SWS) was associated with reduced item-level neural representational strength, increased category-level representational strength, as well as the decreased item-level representational similarity between pre-sleep learning and post-sleep retrieval sessions. Moreover, the theta and beta EEG power during REM sleep, and delta power during SWS differentially supported these representational transformations. These findings suggest that post-learning REM sleep and SWS play differential roles in supporting overnight memory transformation.

">From Maps to Models: A Survey on the Reliability of Small Studies of Task-Based fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful tool for studying brain function, but neuroimaging research produces ongoing concerns regarding small-sample studies and how to interpret them. Although it is well understood that larger samples are preferable, many situations require researchers to make judgments from small studies, including reviewing the existing literature, analyzing pilot data, or assessing subsamples. Quantitative guidance on how to make these judgments remains scarce. To address this, we leverage the Human Connectome Project's Young Adult dataset to survey various analyses--from regional activation maps to predictive models. We find that, for some classic analyses such as detecting regional activation or cluster peak location, studies with as few as 40 subjects are adequate, although this depends crucially on effect sizes. For predictive modeling, similar sizes can be adequate for detecting whether features are predictable, but at least an order of magnitude more (at least hundreds) may be required for developing consistent predictions. These results offer valuable insights for designing and interpreting fMRI studies, emphasizing the importance of considering effect size, sample size, and analysis approach when assessing the reliability of findings. We hope that this survey serves as a reference for identifying which kinds of research questions can be reliably answered with small-scale studies.

">Transcranial focused ultrasound modulates visual thalamus in a nonhuman primate model</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.

">Formation of an Enduring Ensemble of Accumbens Neurons Leads to Prepotent Seeking for Cocaine Over Natural Reward Cues</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) is necessary for reward-seeking behaviors. We hypothesized that the differential encoding of natural and drug rewards in the NAcore contributes to substance use disorder. We leveraged single-cell calcium imaging of dopamine D1- and D2-receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAcore of mice to examine differences between sucrose and cocaine rewarded (self-administration) and unrewarded (abstinent and cue-induced) seeking. Activity was time-locked to nose-poking for reward, clustered, and compared between sucrose and cocaine. Only in cocaine-trained mice were excited D1-MSNs securely stable, capable of decoding nose-poking in all rewarded and unrewarded sessions and correlated with the intensity of nose-poking for unrewarded seeking. Furthermore, D1-MSNs formed a stable ensemble predictive of seeking behavior after extended cocaine, but not sucrose abstinence. The excited D1-MSN ensemble uniquely drives cue-induced cocaine seeking and may contribute to why drug seeking is prepotent over natural reward seeking in cocaine use disorder.

">Parcellation of the primate prefrontal cortex by cognitive control operations</a></h4>

              
                Modular organization, the division of the cerebral cortex into functionally distinct subregions, is well established in the primate sensorimotor cortex, but debated in the cognitive association cortex, including the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). So far, single-unit recordings have not confirmed the prefrontal rostro-caudal gradients observed in neuroimaging and neuroanatomical experiments. To bridge these microscale and macroscale perspectives, we obtained microelectrode recordings with twice the spatial coverage of conventional studies from the PFC of monkeys engaged in a working memory task. Neighboring electrodes shared task-related neural dynamics that were stable across recording sessions and formed spatially continuous, mesoscale clusters with distinct local and long-range fronto-parietal connectivity. Spiking activity was cluster-specific and related to either the encoding, maintenance or decoding of working memory content. Our findings support parcellation of the PFC by cognitive control operations rather than by processed information, indicating that modularity is a fundamental architectural principle across the primate cortex.

">Spike-to-excite: photosensitive seizures in biologically-realistic spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Photosensitive Epilepsy (PE) is a neurological disorder characterized by seizures triggered by harmful visual stimuli, such as flashing lights and high-contrast patterns. The mechanisms underlying PE remain poorly understood, and to date, no computational model has captured the phenomena associated with this condition. Biologically detailed spiking networks trained for efficient prediction of natural scenes have been shown to capture V1-like characteristics. Here, we show that these models display seizure-like activity in response to harmful stimuli while retaining healthy responses to non-provocative stimuli when post-synaptic inhibitory connections are weakened. Notably, our adapted model resembles the motion tuning and contrast gain responses of excitatory V1 neurons in mice with optogenetically reduced inhibitory activity. We offer testable predictions underlying the pathophysiology of PE by exploring how reduced inhibition leads to seizure-like activity. Finally, we show that artificially injecting pulsating input current into the model units prevents seizure-like activity and restores baseline function. In summary, we present a model of PE that offers new insights to understand and treat this condition.

">A hidden mark of a troubled past: neuroimaging and transcriptomic analyses reveal interactive effects of maternal immune activation and adolescent THC exposure in the absence of overt behavioural disruptions</a></h4>

              
                Maternal exposure to infections during gestation has been shown to predispose individuals to the development of schizophrenia. Additionally, clinical data suggest that cannabis use could trigger the onset of schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals. However, the direction of causality remains unclear. To elucidate this issue, we utilised a rat model of maternal immune activation, combined with exposure to increasing doses of THC during adolescence, in both male and female rats. We investigated several behaviours in adulthood that resemble specific symptoms of schizophrenia, including impairments in working memory, deficits in sensorimotor gating, alterations in social behaviour, anhedonia, and potential changes in implicit learning (conditioned taste aversion). Furthermore, we conducted a longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) study to identify affected brain regions and subsequently collected brain samples from one of these regions (the orbitofrontal cortex) for RNA sequencing analyses. These analyses were also performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells to identify peripheral biomarkers. Notably, while no overt behavioural disruptions were observed, our PET scans revealed several brain alterations dependent on the combination of both exposures. Additionally, the transcriptomic studies demonstrated that maternal immune activation affected glutamatergic and serotoninergic genes, with the combination of both exposures shifting the expression from down-regulation to up-regulation. In peripheral cells, interactive effects were observed on inflammatory pathways, and some genes were proposed as biomarkers of the disease. These results suggest that the combination of these two vulnerability factors leaves a lasting mark on the body, potentially predisposing individuals to the disease even before behavioural alterations manifest.

                There is a critical need to understand how aging visual systems contribute to age-related increases in vehicle accidents. We investigated the potential contribution of age-related detriments in steering based on optic flow, a source of information known to play a role in navigation control. Seventeen younger adults (mean age: 21.1 years) and thirteen older adults (mean age: 57.3 years) performed a virtual reality steering task. The virtual environment depicted movement at 19 m/s along a winding road. Participants were tasked with maintaining a central lane position while experiencing 8 repetitions of each combination of optic flow density (low, medium, high), turn radius (35, 55, 75 meters), and turn direction (left, right), presented in random order. All participants cut corners, but did so less on turns with rotational flow from distant landmarks and without proximal optic flow. The magnitude of this flow-related effect was independent of age, although older adults cut corners more on all turns. An exploratory gaze analysis revealed no age-related differences in gaze behavior. The lack of age-related differences in steering or gaze behavior as a function of optic flow implies that processing of naturalistic optic flow stimuli when steering may be preserved with age.

">Neural Processing of Taste-related Signals in the Mediodorsal Thalamus of Mice.</a></h4>

              
                Our consummatory decisions depend on the taste of food and the reward experienced while eating, which are processed through neural computations in interconnected brain areas. Although many gustatory regions of rodents have been explored, the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) remains understudied. The MD, a multimodal brain area connected with gustatory centers, is often studied for its role in processing associative and cognitive information and has been shown to represent intraorally-delivered chemosensory stimuli after strong retronasal odor-taste associations. Key questions remain about whether MD neurons can process taste quality independently of odor-taste associations and how they represent extraoral signals predicting rewarding and aversive gustatory outcomes. Here, we present electrophysiological evidence demonstrating how mouse MD neurons represent and encode 1) the identity and concentrations of basic taste qualities during active licking, and 2) auditory signals anticipating rewarding and aversive taste outcomes. Our data reveal that MD neurons can reliably and dynamically encode taste identity in a broadly tuned manner and taste concentrations with spiking activity positively and negatively correlated with stimulus intensity. Our data also show that MD can represent information related to predictive cues and their associated outcomes, regardless of whether the cue predicts a rewarding or aversive outcome. In summary, our findings suggest that the mediodorsal thalamus is integral to the taste pathway, as it can encode sensory-discriminative dimensions of tastants and participate in processing associative information essential for ingestive behaviors.

">Formation of brain-wide neural geometry during visual item recognition in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Neural dynamics reflect canonical computations that relay and transform information in the brain. Previous studies have identified the neural population dynamics in many individual brain regions as a trajectory geometry in a low-dimensional neural space. However, whether these populations share particular geometric patterns across brain-wide neural populations remains unclear. Here, by mapping neural dynamics widely across temporal/frontal/limbic regions in the cortical and subcortical structures of monkeys, we show that 10 neural populations, including 2,500 neurons, propagate visual item information in a stochastic manner. We found that the visual inputs predominantly evoked rotational dynamics in the higher-order visual area, the TE and its downstream striatum tail, while curvy/straight dynamics appeared more frequently downstream in the orbitofrontal/hippocampal network. These geometric changes were not deterministic but rather stochastic according to their respective emergence rates. These results indicated that visual information propagates as a heterogeneous mixture of stochastic neural population signals in the brain.

In this study, we designed and characterized a 21-amino-acid trans-activator of transcription (TAT)-fused peptide that mimics the binding region of the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs) C-tail to the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1) N-lobe. Acute intrahippocampal infusion of this peptide enhanced perforant path-evoked synaptic transmission in the rat dentate gyrus (DG) in vivo, likely by strengthening the interaction between TARP and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), a mechanism crucial for the synaptic anchoring of AMPARs. Additionally, the peptide also slowed AMPAR lateral diffusion and blocked KCl-induced AMPAR endocytosis, likely by enhancing the diffusional trapping of AMPARs at the synapse. Remarkably, a 7-day peptide infusion prevented social-isolation-induced forgetting of fear memory. Our findings suggest that targeting AMPAR diffusional trapping, particularly through disrupting the TARP-Arc N-lobe interaction, could hold promise as a therapeutic approach for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with impaired AMPAR synaptic retention.

">Sound preferences in mice are sex-dependent</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the impact of early exposure to sound and to silence on sound preferences later in life in mice. We exposed young mice during the critical periods to excerpts of music (first movement of Beethovens symphony no. 9), non-music sounds, or to silence. We tested the sound preference behavior a few weeks later. Music exposure affected mouse behavior in a sex-dependent manner: male mice largely preferred the environment to which they were exposed, while female mice showed a weak reduction in their seemingly inborn aversion to sound. The neural activity in auditory cortex was suppressed in exposed compared to naive mice, regardless of exposure type. Remarkably, a robust negative correlation was found between neural response and behavior in female, but not in male, mice.

">The scope and limits of fine-grained category information in the ventral visual pathway</a></h4>

              
                Humans can easily abstract incoming visual information into discrete semantic categories. Previous research employing functional MRI (fMRI) in humans has identified cortical organizing principles that allow not only for coarse-scale distinctions such as animate versus inanimate objects but also more fine-grained distinctions at the level of individual objects. This suggests that fMRI carries rather fine-grained information about individual objects. However, most previous work investigating fine-grained category representations either additionally included coarse-scale category comparisons of objects, which confounds fine-grained and coarse-scale distinctions, or only used a single exemplar of each object, which confounds visual and semantic information. To address these challenges, here we used multisession fMRI paired with a broad yet homogenous stimulus class of 48 terrestrial mammals, with 2 exemplars per mammal. Multivariate decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed high image-specific reliability in low- and high-level visual regions, indicating stable representational patterns at the image level. In contrast, analyses across exemplars of the same animal yielded only small effects in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), indicating rather subtle category effects in this region. Variance partitioning with a deep neural network and shape model showed that across exemplar effects in EVC were largely explained by low-level visual appearance, while representations in LOC appeared to also contain higher category-specific information. These results suggest that representations typically measured with fMRI are dominated by image-specific visual or coarse-grained category information but demonstrate that commonly employed fMRI protocols can reveal subtle yet reliable distinctions between individual objects.

">GBA1 MUTATIONS ALTER THE PHENOTYPE AND BEHAVIOUR OF DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS IN PARKINSON DISEASE, INFLUENCING VGLUT2 AND CRYAB EXPRESSION</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) gene, encoding a lysosomal enzyme, are major risk factors for Parkinson disease (PD). The impact of GBA1 mutations on neuronal maturation, function and degeneration was investigated in dopaminergic (DA) neurons obtained from our repository of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells or iPSCs), cells derived from PD patients carrying the heterozygous N370S or L444P mutation in GBA1, or from healthy subjects (controls). DA neurons co-expressing TH and VGLUT2 were detected in the cultures, and their number and/or expression of SLC17A6/VGLUT2 mRNA was markedly reduced in both N370S and L444P cultures. Electrophysiological recordings revealed a significant increase in the firing rate of N370S but not L444P neurons, whereas evoked dopamine release was stronger from neurons carrying either mutation than from the controls. Remarkably, neurons carrying either GBA1 mutation accumulated abundant degenerative bodies, multilamellar bodies, autophagosomes and Golgi apparatus vacuolated dictyosomes, with some differences in neurons carrying the N370S or L444P mutation. Furthermore, there was a significant accumulation of -synuclein aggregates in the cell body and dendrites of N370S neurons. Notably, a significant upregulation of the small chaperone CRYAB (HSPB5/alpha-crystallin-B) was found early in DA neuron differentiation and in the Substantia Nigra of PD patients. Our findings indicate that N370S and L444P GBA1 mutations produce some similar and other distinct molecular, electrical and ultrastructural alterations in DA neurons. They suggest that these mutations impair the VGLUT2 subpopulation of midbrain DA neurons, and provoke stress responses early in the neuronal differentiation programme.

">Delineating In-Vivo T1-Weighted Intensity Profiles Within the Human Insula Cortex Using 7-Tesla MRI</a></h4>

              
                The integral role of the insula cortex in sensory and cognitive function has been well documented in humans, and fine anatomical details characterising the insula have been extensively investigated ex-vivo in both human and non-human primates. However, in-vivo studies of insula anatomy in humans (in general), and within-insula parcellation (in particular) have been limited. The current study leverages 7 tesla magnetic resonance imaging to delineate T1-weighted intensity profiles within the human cortex, serving as an indirect proxy of myelination. Our analysis revealed two separate clusters of relatively high and low T1-weighted signal intensity across the insula cortex located in three distinct cortical locations within the posterior, anterior, and middle insula. The posterior and anterior cortical locations are characterised by elevated T1-weighted signal intensities, contrasting with lower intensity observed in the middle insular cortical location, compatible with ex-vivo studies. Importantly, the detection of the high T1-weighted anterior cluster is determined by the choice of brain atlas employed to define the insular ROI. We obtain reliable in-vivo within-insula parcellation at the individual and group levels, across two separate cohorts acquired in two separate sites (n1 = 21, Glasgow, UK; n2 = 101, Amsterdam, NL). These results reflect new insights into the insula anatomical structure, in-vivo, while highlighting the use of 7 tesla in neuroimaging. Specifically, the current study also paves the way to study within-insula parcellation at 7 tesla and above, and discusses further implications for individualised medicine approaches.

">Computational model for synthesizing auditory brainstem responses to assess neuronal alterations in aging and autistic animal models</a></h4>

              
                The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a widely used objective electrophysiology measure for non-invasively assessing auditory function and neural activities in the auditory brainstem, but its ability to reflect detailed neuronal processes is limited due to the averaging nature of the electroencephalogram recordings. This study addresses this limitation by developing a computational model of the auditory brainstem which is capable of synthesizing ABR traces based on a large, population scale neural extrapolation of a spiking neuronal network of auditory brainstem neural circuitry. The model was able to recapitulate alterations in ABR waveform morphology that have been shown to be present in two medical conditions: animal models of autism and aging. Moreover, in both of these conditions, these ABR alterations are caused by known distinct changes in auditory brainstem physiology, and the model could recapitulate these changes. In the autism model, the simulation revealed myelin deficits and hyperexcitability, which caused a decreased wave III amplitude and a prolonged wave III-V interval, consistent with experimentally recorded ABRs in Fmr1-KO mice. In the aging model, the model recapitulated ABRs recorded in aged gerbils and indicated a reduction in activity in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), a finding validated by confocal imaging data. These results demonstrate not only the model's accuracy but also its capability of linking features of ABR morphologies to underlying neuronal properties and suggesting follow-up physiological experiments.

">Circular RNAs exhibit exceptional stability in the aging brain and serve as reliable age and experience indicators</a></h4>

              
                Circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprise a large class of stable RNAs produced through backsplicing. While circRNAs have been shown to be very stable in cell culture, it is unknown how stable they are in vivo. Interestingly, studies across various animal systems demonstrated that circRNAs levels increase with age in neural tissue. However, the underlying reasons for this age-related accumulation are still unclear. To address these questions, we profiled circRNAs from fly heads at six timepoints across their lifespan. We found that circRNA levels increase linearly with age, independent of changes in mRNA levels, overall transcription, intron retention, or host genes splicing. This indicates that the age-related accumulation is attributed to their extraordinary stability in neural tissue rather than changes in biosynthesis. Furthermore, exposure to environmental stimuli like different temperatures, resulted in the increase but not decrease of circRNAs subsets, further confirming their stability in vivo. This exceptional stability implies that circRNAs can serve as markers of environmental experience. Indeed, flies subjected to a ten-day regimen at 29C exhibit higher levels of specific brain circRNAs even six weeks after returning to standard conditions, indicating that circRNAs can reveal past environmental stimuli. Additionally, circRNA half-life measurements revealed values exceeding 20 days, with some showing no degradation over the animal lifetime. These findings demonstrate the extreme stability of circRNAs in vivo and their use as markers for aging, stress and life experiences.

	<p>Paper-based or IT tools can be used in telerehabilitation mode to improve the skills of children with developmental dyslexia (DD), seeking to increase reading speed and reduce errors. Telerehabilitation is the provision of remote treatments in which the patient works autonomously in a familiar environment under the remote monitoring, through telecommunication means, of an expert operator. Through telerehabilitation, children with DD can receive treatments outside the specialist clinic, at home or school, via internet connections, and through advanced technological platforms. These procedures allow adequate communication with the family, intensity of treatment, self-adaptivity of exercises, and child engagement; these factors are crucial for a high intervention efficacy. Recent studies have supported the effectiveness of the telerehabilitation of reading in children with DD, with some studies reporting no differences in efficacy between remote and in-person methods. Nevertheless, many points remain to be clarified about the procedures and methods required by telerehabilitation, the variables linked to its effectiveness (e.g., the impact of the intensity of the training and the neuropsychological profile of the child), and the comparative validity of different tele-treatment paths. These aspects are discussed in the present paper.</p>

	<p>Ongoing neural oscillations reflect cycles of excitation and inhibition in local neural populations, with individual neurons being more or less likely to fire depending upon the oscillatory phase. As a result, the oscillations could determine whether or not a sound is perceived and/or whether its neural representation enters into later processing stages. While empirical support for this idea has come from sound detection studies, large gaps in knowledge still exist regarding memory for sound events. In the current study, it was investigated how sensory entrainment impacts the fidelity of working memory representations for pitch. In two separate experiments, an 8 Hz amplitude modulated (AM) entraining stimulus was presented prior to a multitone complex having an f0 between 270 and 715 Hz. This &amp;amp;ldquo;target&amp;amp;rdquo; sound could be presented at phases from 0 to 2&amp;amp;pi; radians in relation to the previous AM. After a retention interval of 4 s (Experiment 1; n = 26) or 2 s (Experiment 2; n = 28), listeners were tasked to reproduce the target sound&amp;amp;rsquo;s pitch by moving their finger along the horizontal axis of a response pad. It was hypothesized that if entrainment modulates auditory working memory fidelity, reproductions of a target&amp;amp;rsquo;s pitch would be more accurate and precise when targets were presented in phase with the entrainment. Cosine fits of the average data for both experiments showed a significant entrainment &amp;amp;ldquo;echo&amp;amp;rdquo; in the accuracy of pitch matches. There was no apparent echo in the matching precision. Fitting of the individual data accuracy showed that the optimal phase was consistent across individuals, aligning near the next AM peak had the AM continued. The results show that sensory entrainment modulates auditory working memory in addition to stimulus detection, consistent with the proposal that ongoing neural oscillatory activity modulates higher-order auditory processes.</p>

                Lutein, a plant-derived xanthophyl-carotenoid, is an exceptional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory constituent found in food. High dietary intake of lutein is beneficial against eye disease, improves cardiometabolic health, protects from neurodegenerative diseases, and is beneficial for liver, kidney, and respiratory health. Lutein protects against oxidative and nitrosative stress, both of which play a major role in post-COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Lutein is an important natural agent for therapeutic use against oxidative and nitrosative stress in chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. It can also potentially inhibit spike protein-induced inflammation. Rich dietary supplementation of lutein, naturally derived in non-biodegradable Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), can most optimally be used against oxidative and nitrosative stress during post-COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Due to its high oleic acid (OA) content, EVOO supports optimal absorption of dietary lutein. The main molecular pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces pathology, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activated B cells (NF-κB) and activated protein (AP)-1, can be suppressed by lutein. Synergy with other natural compounds for spike protein detoxification is likely.

                Intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring abnormalities had been reported to correlate with decreased umbilical artery base excess associated with neonatal seizures. However, we present an infant born at 35 weeks of gestation diagnosed with cerebral palsy associated with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) without fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring abnormalities, According to the summary reports of PVL cases published on the home page of the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy (JOCSC)), the percentage of placenta previa without FHR monitoring abnormalities in the cases of PVL was 5.7% (12/209), which seemed to be higher than the total percentage of placenta previa reported in Japan (0.3–0.5%).

                Background when family planning methods not use, there is a higher chance of high fertility, which raises health risks for both mother and infant and lowers quality of life by limiting access to jobs employment, education, and nutrition. Unsatisfactory needs and poor family planning use can be explained by fear of negative impacts, rejection from couples, limits in knowledge, and social condemnation. Objectives To understanding the Middle East women’s barriers about make decisions and use of family planning methods Methodology A descriptive and analytic (cross sectional) study, conducted at six Arabic countries includes a non-probability (purposive sample) consist of (198) women. Which were selected according to inclusion criteria that are women in reproductive age, primiparous and multiparous mothers, and mothers who attended primary healthcare centers. Results Women are with average age of 32.23±7.9 years in which the highest percentage is seen with age group of 30-39 (40.4%). women have high affective barrier to avoid family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.60); have high behavioral barriers to avoid family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.56); and have high cognitive barriers to avoid family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.56). So, the mean scores indicate high among most of affective, behavioral, and cognitive barriers. Conclusions There are many potential barriers which can negatively impact the Middle East women’s decision about their reproductive life (affective, behavioral and cognitive) barriers. Despite the fact that family planning faces several challenges in the Middle East, governments and civil society organizations are working to find solutions to improve access to family planning services, promote education, hold candid conversations about reproductive health with local communities. Empowering the role of nurse in family planning to educate the couples about contraceptive methods and how to help them to choice the appropriate method.

                Background Medical imaging has seen significant advancements through machine learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These technologies have transformed the analysis of pathological images, enhancing the accuracy of diagnosing and classifying cellular anomalies. Digital pathology methodologies, including image analysis, have improved cervical cancer diagnostics. However, existing commercial platforms are often costly and restrictive, limiting customization and scalability. Methods CINNAMON-GUI is an open-source digital pathology tool based on CNNs for classifying Pap smear images. Transitioning to a Shiny app in Python, it offers enhanced user interface and interactivity. The application supports dynamic web interactions, advanced features for image analysis, and state-of-the-art CNN models tailored for digital pathology. Key features include intuitive UI components, real-time image and plot generation, memory-efficient data handling, and robust training capabilities with customizable CNN architectures. The tool also integrates with Labelme for defining regions of interest and allows testing on external biospecimens. Results Model A (seed 42, 100 epochs) and Model B (same architecture with adjusted augmentation parameters) were compared. Model A stabilized with training accuracy around 0.88 and validation accuracy around 0.913. Model B showed improved performance with training accuracy around 0.91 and validation accuracy around 0.95. Feature mapping highlighted critical morphological aspects, improving classification accuracy. Model B reduced misclassification errors significantly compared to Model A. Conclusions CINNAMON-GUI demonstrates the potential of an open-source platform in digital pathology, providing transparency and collaborative opportunities. The tool enhances diagnostic accuracy through feature map analysis and optimized CNN training. Future development aims to extend its application to other cancer types, leveraging its dynamic and user-friendly interface for broader use in diagnostics.

                <p>by Jiaping Liu, Zhenglun Cai, Paul Gustafson, Daniel J. McDonald</p>

To understand the transmissibility and spread of infectious diseases, epidemiologists turn to estimates of the instantaneous reproduction number. While many estimation approaches exist, their utility may be limited. Challenges of surveillance data collection, model assumptions that are unverifiable with data alone, and computationally inefficient frameworks are critical limitations for many existing approaches. We propose a discrete spline-based approach that solves a convex optimization problem—Poisson trend filtering—using the proximal Newton method. It produces a locally adaptive estimator for instantaneous reproduction number estimation with heterogeneous smoothness. Our methodology remains accurate even under some process misspecifications and is computationally efficient, even for large-scale data. The implementation is easily accessible in a lightweight R package rtestim.

                Background The acquisition and development of prosodic aspects of vocal intonation are of special interest within the larger context of language acquisition. Method The present study explored the developmental trajectories of infant prosodic abilities from 4 to 16 months of life with an intensive time points assessment. Several aspects were considered: an acoustic analysis of infant vocal productions with specific software, the analyses of all the prosodic variables associated with the fundamental frequency (F0 mean, F0 range, and F0 final contours), the individual variability and the complexity of the vocal productions of the infants. Results The multi-level analysis evidenced specific prosodic developmental trajectories that differ for the different kind of vocal productions since the first months of life. Conclusions The findings suggest that in the second half of the first year of life infants show an intonational repertoire that may help manage interactions with their caregiver and that individual variability has to be taken in consideration when assessing infants’ prosody.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Using anti-neurofilament H non-phosphorylated antibodies (SMI-32) as markers for the neuronal maturation level and Y channel responsible for motion processing, we investigated early postnatal development of the primary visual areas 17 and 18 in cats aged 0, 10, 14, and 34 days and in adults. Two analyzed parameters of SMI-32-immunolabeling were used: the total proportion of SMI-32-labeling and the density of labeled neurons. (i) The developmental time course of the total proportion of SMI-32-labeling shows the general increase in the accumulation of heavy-chain neurofilaments. This parameter showed a different time course for cortical layer development; the maximal increment in the total labeling in layer V occurred between the second and fifth postnatal weeks and in layers II–III and VI after the fifth postnatal week. In addition, the delay in accumulation of SMI-32-labeling was shown in layer V of the area 17 periphery representation during the first two postnatal weeks. (ii) The density of SMI-32-labeled neurons decreased in all layers of area 18, but was increased, decreased, or had a transient peak in layers II–III, V, and VI of area 17, respectively. The transient peak is in good correspondence with some transient neurochemical features previously revealed for different classes of cortical and thalamic neurons and reflects the time course of the early development of the thalamocortical circuitry. Some similarities between the time courses for the development of SMI-32-labeling in areas 17/18 and in A- and C-laminae of the LGNd allow us to propose heterochronous postnatal development of two Y sub-channels.</p>

                Background The growing importance of emotional intelligence in academic and professional contexts has generated a need to explore its linkage with psychological well-being. Furthermore, understanding how various demographic and academic factors can influence students' emotional perception and management is crucial for optimizing educational and intervention strategies. In this context, the primary purpose of this study was to analyze the existing relationship between emotional education and psychological well-being in graduate students. Methods The objective was to conduct a comparative analysis of perceived emotional intelligence (PEI) in different study programs offered at a specific university. The methodology, framed within a positivist paradigm, was based on a quantitative approach and examines the responses of 1,522 university students using the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24). Results This tool, which is divided into three dimensions (emotional attention, emotional clarity, and emotional repair), was analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and ANOVA tests to determine demographic and academic influences on the scores. The findings indicate deficiencies in the areas of Emotional Attention and Emotional Repair, contrasting with a marked prevalence in Emotional Clarity. Variables such as sex, age, and field of study demonstrated an influence on the dimensions of PEI. Notably, significant differences in emotional perception were found between sex and academic fields. Conclusions Specifically, training directed towards empathy proved to be a prominent factor in the perception of emotional competencies. This study highlights the influence of demographic and academic variables on emotional competencies, underscoring the need to adapt strategies in education and therapy.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is considered essential for several forms of declarative memory, including spatial and social memory. Despite the extensive research of the classic subfields of the hippocampus, the fasciola cinerea (FC)—a medially located structure within the hippocampal formation—has remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we performed a morpho-functional characterization of principal neurons in the mouse FC. Using in vivo juxtacellular recording of single neurons, we found that FC neurons are distinct from neighboring CA1 pyramidal cells, both morphologically and electrophysiologically. Specifically, FC neurons displayed non-pyramidal morphology and granule cell-like apical dendrites. Compared to neighboring CA1 pyramidal neurons, FC neurons exhibited more regular in vivo firing patterns and a lower tendency to fire spikes at short interspike intervals. Furthermore, tracing experiments revealed that the FC receives inputs from the lateral but not the medial entorhinal cortex and CA3, and it provides a major intra-hippocampal projection to the septal CA2 and sparser inputs to the distal CA1. Overall, our results indicate that the FC is a morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct subfield of the hippocampal formation; given the established role of CA2 in social memory and seizure initiation, the unique efferent intra-hippocampal connectivity of the FC points to possible roles in social cognition and temporal lobe epilepsy.</p>

                Background The response of heart rate to changes in exercise intensity is comprised of several dynamic modes with differing magnitudes and temporal characteristics. Investigations of empirical identification of dynamic models of heart rate showed that second-order models gave substantially and significantly better model fidelity compared to the first order case. In the present work, we aimed to reanalyse data from previous studies to more closely consider the effect of including a zero and a pure delay in the model. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 22 treadmill (TM) and 54 cycle ergometer (CE) data sets from a total of 38 healthy participants. A linear, time-invariant plant model structure with up to two poles, a zero and a dead time is considered. Empirical estimation of the free parameters was performed using least-squares optimisation. The primary outcome measure is model fit, which is a normalised root-mean-square model error. Results A model comprising parallel connection of two first-order transfer functions, one with a dead time and one without, was found to give the highest fit (56.7 % for TM, 54.3 % for CE), whereby the non-delayed component appeared to merely capture initial transients in the data and the part with dead time likely represented the true dynamic response of heart rate to the excitation. In comparison, a simple first-order model without dead time gave substantially lower fit than the parallel model (50.2 % for TM, 47.9 % for CE). Conclusions This preliminary analysis points to a linear first-order system with dead time as being an appropriate model for heart rate response to exercise using treadmill and cycle ergometer modalities. In order to avoid biased estimates, it is vitally important that, prior to parameter estimation and validation, careful attention is paid to data preprocessing in order to eliminate transients and trends.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23630?af=R">Hippocampal neurogenesis modulated by Quinic acid: A therapeutic strategy for the neurodegenerative disorders</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) reside in the brain and participate in the mechanism of neurogenesis that permits the brain to generate the building blocks for enhancement of cognitive abilities and acquisition of new skills. The existence of NPCs in brain has opened a novel dimension of research to explore their potential for treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. The present study provides novel insights into the intracellular mechanisms in neuronal cells proliferation, maturation and differentiation regulated by Quinic acid (QA). Furthermore, this study might help in discovery and development of lead molecule that can overcome the challenges in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The growth supporting effect of QA was studied using MTT assay. For that purpose, hippocampal cell cultures of neonatal rats were treated with different concentrations of QA and incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h. Gene and protein expressions of the selected molecular markers nestin, neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1), neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN), neuronal differentiation 1 (NeuroD1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuroligin (NLGN) and vimentin were analyzed. QA-induced cell proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal progenitor cells was also accompanied by significantly increased expression of progenitor and immature neuronal marker, mature neuronal marker and differentiating factor, that is, nestin, Tuj-1, NeuN and NeuroD1, respectively. On the other hand, vimentin downregulation and constant GFAP expression were observed following QA treatment. Additionally, the effects of QA on the recovery of stressed cells was studied using in vitro model of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). It was observed that hippocampal cells were able to recover from OGD following the treatment with QA. These findings suggest that QA treatment promotes hippocampal neurogenesis by proliferating and differentiating of NPCs and recovers neurons from stress caused by OGD. Thus, the neurogenic potential of QA can be explored for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1382/v3?src=rss">The impact of energy releasing B-vitamin intake on indices of obesity and cardiac function: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background B vitamins play a crucial role in the balance and metabolism of energy. Energy metabolism mainly benefits from the B-complex vitamins. Specifically, decarboxylation, transamination, acylation, oxidation, and reduction of substrates that are ultimately employed in energy intake require thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin B6. Vitamin deficiency could lead to chronic disease occurrence. Objectives To assess the impact of energy-releasing B-vitamins intake (B1, B2, B3, and B6) on selected indices of obesity and cardiac function. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed on 491 apparently healthy adults (18-64 years old) between January and May 2019 at Hashemite University, Jordan. Anthropometric measurements were taken, lipid profiles were analyzed, and indices of obesity and cardiac function were calculated. The typical dietary intake of B1, B2, B3, and B6 vitamins was calculated. Results Conicity index (CI) and abdominal volume index (AVI) scores significantly decreased with the increased adjusted vitamin B1 and B6 intake. Also, body roundness index (BRI), weight-adjusted-waist index (WWI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) scores were decreased with the increase of adjusted B6 intake (p<0.05). The total sample showed a significant inverse weak correlation between energy-adjusted intake of B1 and AVI (r= -0.156, p=0.001) and BRI (r= 0.111, p=0.014). Similar correlations were detected among male participants between energy-adjusted B1 intake and BAI, AVI, and BRI. Female participants had a significant weak inverse correlation between BAI and energy-adjusted B2 (r= -0.180, p=0.029) and B6 intake (r= -0.212, p=0.010). Only B1, the vitamin, significantly explained 2.43 and 1.24% of changes observed in the AVI and BRI scores, respectively (p<0.05). Conclusions Increasing the consumption of B1, B2, and B6 may significantly lower values of indices of obesity and cardiac function regardless of sex differences. Thus reducing the occurrence of obesity and related coronary heart diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-893/v1?src=rss">Dataset of a national survey on online gambling activities among young people in Portugal. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Recent advancements in online gambling have significantly increased the popularity and participation in gambling activities among the general population, specifically the young generations. These changes are reshaping gambling behaviors, attracting a growing number of enthusiasts. This paper describes a dataset that maps online gambling activities among young individuals in Portugal, providing insights into their gambling prevalence, habits, behaviors, preferences, and potential antecedents and consequences of these activities. Methods A survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,993 young people in Portugal, aged between 18 and 34, to gather data on their activities. This methodology involved a quantitative telephone survey conducted in March and April 2023, utilizing quota sampling to ensure representation across various regions. The data collection process employed Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and involved rigorous quality control measures to ensure accuracy and reliability. Conclusion The dataset generated from this survey provides valuable insights into the patterns of online gambling activities among young Portuguese individuals. It allows researchers to explore potential risk factors, including gambling-related harm, and to understand the sociodemographic factors influencing gambling behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-892/v1?src=rss">A Revolutionary Device for Endovascular Aortic Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Pilot Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has been the gold standard since it was established in 1991. Various graft configurations have been developed to overcome the limitations of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), including contralateral gate cannulation (CGC). We propose a new device and technique intended to simplify endovascular AAA repair, along with reports of its application in six patients. Intervention The Taofan and Kang (T&K) bidirectional endovascular aortic repair (B-EVAR (B-EVAR) device uses a main-body stent graft, two-limb extensions, and bare metal stent. The procedure involved accessing the right and left femoral arteries, followed by standard aortography evaluation using a pigtail catheter through the contralateral femoral access. The main body stent graft is deployed through ipsilateral femoral access using a balloon catheter, while the contralateral gate is cannulated with a hydrophilic coated wire. Both balloons were inflated simultaneously to ensure that the wires were in different lumens. Contralateral and ipsilateral extensions were deployed using a limb extension stent graft. Standard aortography evaluation was repeated. Result T&K B-EVAR pilot procedures proved successful in various cases, from simple to complex anatomy, and even with varied graft stent deployment strategies. None of the patients had complications or prolonged length of stay (LOS). Follow-up CT did not reveal any high-pressure endoleaks. Conclusion T&K B-EVAR has been proven to simplify endovascular AAA repair in six patients with excellent results. It is also reproducible, potentially universally applicable, and can offer operators ease of use, faster procedure times, reduced fluoroscopy times, and reduced contrast usage.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-891/v1?src=rss">Case Report: The Sausage Technique using Anorganic Bovine Bone Mineral for Horizontal Bone Augmentation at the Crestal Part of a Posterior Mandibular Ridge: A Case Report. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Following tooth extraction, the alveolar bone goes through a natural remodeling process resulting in a significant bone resorption which may complicate dental implant placement without prior bone augmentation treatment. The sausage technique is a modified guided bone regeneration (GBR) method that has been successfully used for horizontal bone augmentation. This technique was developed to increase the bone growth at the alveolar crest. Although the sausage technique uses a combination of autograft chips and xenograft particles with a native collagen membrane, several studies have questioned whether adding autograft chips is essential for bone formation with guided bone regeneration. Moreover, harvesting the bone graft may increase the donor site morbidity and patient discomfort. This case report aimed to investigate the bone gain radiologically when the sausage technique was applied to treat a healthy, thirty-year-old patient with a horizontal defect in the posterior mandibular region using anorganic bovine bone mineral (ABBM) particles with Jason membrane, assess the implant primary stability in the augmented ridge, and present the surgical procedure steps in details. After nine months of healing, the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) revealed approximately 4.32 mm of bone gain at the alveolar crest in the buccal-lingual direction. The graft particles were well integrated into the newly formed bone. Two implants were inserted with an insertion torque of 35 N/cm. The ISQ values were 76 for the most anterior implant and 78 for the posterior implant. Within the limitations of this case report, the sausage technique using ABBM particles without autograft chips was an effective approach in achieving the prerequisite bone width at the crest in cases with horizontal bone defects.

                Background Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is considered the most suitable approach for relative performance efficiency calculation for banks as it is believed to be superior to traditional ratio-based analysis and other conventional performance evaluations. This study provides statistical evidence on the sampling error that can creep into performance evaluation studies using the DEA methodology. Inferences are drawn based on samples, and various preventive measures must be taken to eliminate or avoid sampling errors and misleading results. This study demonstrates the possibility of sampling error in DEA with the secondary data available in financial statements and reports from a sample set of banks. Methods The samples included 15 public sectors and five leading private sector banks in India based on their market share, and the data for calculating efficiencies were retrieved from the published audited reports. The sample data was collected from 2014 to 2017 because the banking sector in India witnessed a series of mergers of public sector banks post-2017, and the data after that would be skewed and not comparable due to the demonetization policy implementation and merger process-related consolidation implemented by the Government of India. The efficiency measures thus computed are further analyzed using non-parametric statistical tests. Results We found statistically significant discrepancies in the efficiency score calculations using DEA approach when specific outlier values. Evidence is provided on statistically significant differences in the efficiencies due to the inclusion and exclusion of particular samples in the DEA. Conclusion The study offers a novel contribution along with statistical evidence on the possible sampling error that can creep into the performance evaluation of organizations while applying the DEA methodology.

                Vermaercke et al. investigate the mechanisms underlying deficiency in the ID/ASD gene SYNGAP1 in human cortical neurons transplanted in the mouse cortex. They find that SYNGAP1-deficient neurons develop mature synapses and circuit integration months in advance, leading to precocious sensory responsiveness. These data link disrupted neoteny of human neurons to an ID/ASD gene mutation.

                Lee et al. show that the transformation of the vibrotactile temporal code found in the periphery into a rate code along the ascending somatosensory pathway involves thalamic processing, particularly through parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the reticular nucleus. Brainstem microstimulation mimics vibration responses in the somatosensory cortex, offering insights for neural prostheses.

VAP-Pma1 interaction via an FFAT-like motif is crucial for pH homeostasis. They propose that VAPs sustain cytosolic pH by gearing their interactions between Pma1 and pH-sensory phospholipids at ER-PM contacts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92595">Signatures of Bayesian inference emerge from energy-efficient synapses</a></h4>

              
                Biological synaptic transmission is unreliable, and this unreliability likely degrades neural circuit performance. While there are biophysical mechanisms that can increase reliability, for instance by increasing vesicle release probability, these mechanisms cost energy. We examined four such mechanisms along with the associated scaling of the energetic costs. We then embedded these energetic costs for reliability in artificial neural networks (ANNs) with trainable stochastic synapses, and trained these networks on standard image classification tasks. The resulting networks revealed a tradeoff between circuit performance and the energetic cost of synaptic reliability. Additionally, the optimised networks exhibited two testable predictions consistent with pre-existing experimental data. Specifically, synapses with lower variability tended to have (1) higher input firing rates and (2) lower learning rates. Surprisingly, these predictions also arise when synapse statistics are inferred through Bayesian inference. Indeed, we were able to find a formal, theoretical link between the performance-reliability cost tradeoff and Bayesian inference. This connection suggests two incompatible possibilities: evolution may have chanced upon a scheme for implementing Bayesian inference by optimising energy efficiency, or alternatively, energy-efficient synapses may display signatures of Bayesian inference without actually using Bayes to reason about uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91345">The ORP9-ORP11 dimer promotes sphingomyelin synthesis</a></h4>

              
                Numerous lipids are heterogeneously distributed among organelles. Most lipid trafficking between organelles is achieved by a group of lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) that carry lipids using their hydrophobic cavities. The human genome encodes many intracellular LTPs responsible for lipid trafficking and the function of many LTPs in defining cellular lipid levels and distributions is unclear. Here, we created a gene knockout library targeting 90 intracellular LTPs and performed whole-cell lipidomics analysis. This analysis confirmed known lipid disturbances and identified new ones caused by the loss of LTPs. Among these, we found major sphingolipid imbalances in ORP9 and ORP11 knockout cells, two proteins of previously unknown function in sphingolipid metabolism. ORP9 and ORP11 form a heterodimer to localize at the ER-<i>trans</i>-Golgi membrane contact sites, where the dimer exchanges phosphatidylserine (PS) for phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) between the two organelles. Consequently, loss of either protein causes phospholipid imbalances in the Golgi apparatus that result in lowered sphingomyelin synthesis at this organelle. Overall, our LTP knockout library toolbox identifies various proteins in control of cellular lipid levels, including the ORP9-ORP11 heterodimer, which exchanges PS and PI(4)P at the ER-Golgi membrane contact site as a critical step in sphingomyelin synthesis in the Golgi apparatus.

	<p>Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) represents one of the core features of the disorder and has a significant impact on functional and rehabilitation outcomes of people living with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). The aim of this critical review is to highlight the most recent evidence on effective treatments available for CIAS, to discuss the current challenges in this field, and to present future perspectives that may help to overcome them. Concerning psychopharmacological approaches, among the most indicated strategies for the management and prevention of CIAS is to favor second-generation antipsychotic medications and avoid long-term and high-dose treatments with anticholinergic medications and benzodiazepines. Moreover, non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive remediation and physical exercise-based programs represent evidence-based interventions in the treatment of CIAS that have shown reliable evidence of effectiveness on both cognitive and functional outcomes. These treatments, however, are still delivered to people accessing mental health services with a diagnosis of CIAS in an uneven manner, even in high-income countries. Academic and clinical partnership and collaboration, as well as advocacy from service users, families, carers, and stakeholders&amp;amp;rsquo; organizations could help to reduce the bench to bedside gap in the treatment of CIAS. Future perspectives include the development of novel pharmacological agents that could be effective in the treatment of CIAS, the implementation of novel technologies such as telemedicine and virtual reality in the delivery of evidence-based interventions to improve accessibility and engagement, and further research in the field of non-invasive brain stimulation.</p>

                Background COVID-19 pandemics increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk during hospitalization, despite prophylactic anticoagulation. Limited radiological diagnosis in pandemic requires a guided protocol for anticoagulant adjustment. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center as part of a quality improvement program evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation protocols. The study focused on implementing a guideline for anticoagulant dosing protocol based on dynamic changes in D-dimer levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The dosing guideline allowed for dose escalation from standard prophylactic levels to escalated prophylactic or therapeutic levels, depending on the patient's risk profile for VTE. The primary endpoints included in-hospital survival comparing between fix and dynamic adjustment treatment groups. Secondary endpoints encompassed major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events, incidence of breakthrough thrombosis, length of hospitalization and ICU stay, days of mechanical ventilator use, and survival duration. Findings Among the 260 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020. The patients received fixed anticoagulant dosage in 188, 72.3%) patients, while 72 (27.7%) were up-titrated according to the protocol. In-hospital survival at 30 days demonstrated superiority among patients whose anticoagulation was up-titrated to either escalated prophylactic or therapeutic (80.2%) compared to receiving fixed anticoagulant dosage (51.3%) (p=0.01). Bleeding events were significantly higher in up-titrate group (12.5%) compared to fixed anticoagulant dosage group (2.13%). Most of them are CRNMB. Conclusion A dynamic, D-dimer-based dose escalation of anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 holds promise in improving in-hospital mortality rates without a significant increase in fatal bleeding events.

                Background The danger of earthquakes poses a serious threat to people worldwide. One of the most significant challenges is preparing communities to cope effectively with this disaster. Therefore, understanding earthquake hazards is critically important for preparedness, mitigation, and an effective response to this threat. This report aims to observe and conduct a preliminary assessment of the degree to which community preparedness for earthquake disasters has been implemented. Methods Empirical data were obtained from survey respondents and interviews. The respondents were members of a community affected by the Cianjur earthquake, which occurred on November 21, 2022. The data were analysed using the mean range approach, based on Likert scales. Additionally, the Spearman correlation method was employed to indicate the relationship between community awareness and infrastructure readiness. Result Based on empirical evidence and preliminary analysis, it is evident that the preparedness of the community to respond effectively to earthquake catastrophes is inadequate. An apparent lack of readiness is observed in the inadequate construction of housing that fails to meet disaster standards, and the absence of disaster response facilities is notable. Conclusions Based on our initial assumption, it appears that knowledge related to disaster resilience in this area has not been adequately disseminated or socialized. However, this premise requires further investigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-886/v1?src=rss">All-cause mortality according to COVID-19 vaccination status: An analysis of the UK office for National statistics public data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 has been commonly considered the best response to the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis. However, to assess its real-world overall effects, the best way can be the analysis of all-cause mortality by vaccination status. The UK is perhaps the only country which has made publicly available all-cause mortality data by vaccination status. Methods Data from April 2021 to May 2023 published by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) were retrospectively analyzed by age groups and vaccination status; the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause and non-COVID-19 mortality was calculated against the corresponding unvaccinated groups. Results We found that across all age groups, all-cause mortality SMRs increased from a certain date, dependent on the age group. Across all age groups, all-cause mortality SMRs were initially much lower than 1. However, due to their increase, by a certain date for the 18-39, 80-89 and 90+ age groups they exceeded the reference value. For the other age groups, the date at which the SMR would reach 1 can be predicted, provided the trend is maintained. Non-COVID-19 SMRs’ trends were very similar. Their initial values much lower than 1 are suggestive of significant biases in the ONS dataset, leading to underestimate the risks for the vaccinated people, as it is implausible that COVID-19 vaccines protect against non-COVID-19 deaths. Conclusions The increase over time in all-cause death SMRs in vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated, and their excess from the reference values for certain age groups, should be carefully considered to understand the underlying factors. It would be desirable for other major countries to systematically collect all-cause mortality by vaccination status and, in the meantime, a moratorium on promoting mass vaccination campaigns should be implemented.

                <p>The frontal cortex-striatum circuit plays a pivotal role in adaptive goal-directed behaviors. However, it remains unclear how decision-related signals are mediated through cross-regional transmission between the medial frontal cortex and the striatum by neuronal ensembles in making decision based on outcomes of past action. Here, we analyzed neuronal ensemble activity obtained through simultaneous multiunit recordings in the secondary motor cortex (M2) and dorsal striatum (DS) in rats performing an outcome-based left-or-right choice task. By adopting tensor component analysis (TCA), a single-trial&ndash;based unsupervised dimensionality reduction approach, for concatenated ensembles of M2 and DS neurons, we identified distinct three spatiotemporal neural dynamics (TCA components) at the single-trial level specific to task-relevant variables. Choice-position&ndash;selective neural dynamics reflected the positions chosen and was correlated with the trial-to-trial fluctuation of behavioral variables. Intriguingly, choice-pattern&ndash;selective neural dynamics distinguished whether the incoming choice was a repetition or a switch from the previous choice before a response choice. Other neural dynamics was selective to outcome and increased within-trial activity following response. Our results demonstrate how the concatenated ensembles of M2 and DS process distinct features of decision-related signals at various points in time. Thereby, the M2 and DS collaboratively monitor action outcomes and determine the subsequent choice, whether to repeat or switch, for action selection.</p>

                Background: Phlebotomy is a medical procedure that is performed frequently in the blood collection activities of medical institutions. The procedure involves close interaction with different types of patients—some of whom are cooperative and others, who, for many reasons, are not (for example, patients who have a fear of needles). Blood extraction is an essential skill in several medical specialties, such as in laboratory sciences. Lesson planning in phlebotomy education is mainly focused on procedural skills, and very little attention is given towards teaching communication skills despite the close patient interaction in phlebotomy. In this paper, I propose a lesson plan for teaching communication skills to medical laboratory sciences and nursing students based on Gagne’s instructional design. Methods: The training session included two main parts: training session using Gange’s instructional design and at the end of the session, the participants were surveyed for the effectiveness of the training session. Results: 17 participants were included in the study. Overall, the majority of the participants were highly satisfied with the effectiveness of the training session in teaching communication skills with all seven survey questions receiving a mean score of 4.58 on a Likert scale of 1-5. Conclusion: We demonstrated the effectiveness of Gange’s instructional beyond theoretical lesson planning to teach communication skills through role-play in phlebotomy education.

                Background Preterm birth, which is child delivery before 37 weeks of pregnancy, is the primary cause of perinatal mortality worldwide. Preterm birth remains a major public health challenge in Rwanda, affecting approximately 13.8% of birth. The World Health Organization estimates that 15 million babies are born prematurely each year. While the association between periodontitis and preterm deliveries is increasingly recognized, little is known about this link in Rwanda. This policy brief aims to bridge this knowledge gap by presenting the findings of a recent study investigating the prevalence of periodontitis among pregnant women in Rwanda and its association with preterm deliveries. This policy brief also aims to inform and guide decision making towards incorporating periodontal screening into the antenatal care package in Rwanda. This has the potential to improve pregnancy outcomes and contribute to improved oral health in the future. Policy outcome and Implications Contemporary evidence has shown a six-fold increased risk of preterm delivery for women with periodontitis in Rwanda, with a concerningly high prevalence (60%) among pregnant women. Additionally, nurses working in antenatal clinics displayed insufficient knowledge about gum disease. Actionable recommendations The adoption of basic periodontal screening within existing antenatal care packages is recommended. This, coupled with nurse training and public awareness campaigns, can empower women and healthcare professionals to prioritize oral health for better pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions Integrating periodontal screening into antenatal care has the potential to significantly reduce preterm deliveries and contribute to a healthier future generation in Rwanda.

                Background Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America, has emerged as a global health concern due to the migration of infected individuals. With its epidemiological complexity, by difficulty to obtain appropriate diagnoses and poor treatment, the search for novel therapeutic options remains. Methods In this context, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies employing animal models to verify the progress in CD treatment. We searched the PubMed database for CD treatment studies published between 1990 and 2023, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Results Twelve papers met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicate that the fifteen treatment alternatives examined, mainly between 2010 and 2014, demonstrated efficacy in experimental CD models, evidenced by significant parasitemia reduction. Bis-triazole DO870 and VNI were effective in the acute and chronic phases, respectively. However, of these emerging therapies, only posaconazole and fexinidazole have progressed to clinical trials, yielding unsatisfactory outcomes as CD monotherapies Conclusions This meta-analysis highlights the existence of promising new drug candidates for CD treatment, but most remain in the preclinical stages. Those that reached clinical trials did not demonstrate optimal results, underscoring the ongoing challenges in CD therapy. Collaborative efforts among the academic community, pharmaceutical industries, funding agencies, and government agencies are urgently needed to accelerate the development of more effective medications against CD.

                Background: Mammary cancer, called breast cancer in humans, results from the abnormal growth of cells in the mammary glands that attack the surrounding tissue. The process of carcinogenesis at the molecular level can be monitored through the production of proteins as biomarkers for carcinogenesis. 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) is a known carcinogenic compound. This study aimed to analyze the proteomic profile as critical data regarding DMBA-induced carcinogenesis in Sprague‒Dawley rats. Methods: Experimental animals were divided into two groups: a treatment group given DMBA at a dose of 10 mg/kg (intramammary) at intervals of 48 hours for a total of 10 doses, and a negative control group that was not given any treatment. Measurement of the total protein concentration was carried out using a spectrophotometer, and the data were analyzed using a t-test, while the characterization of protein profiles was carried out based on molecular weight data using SDS‒PAGE. Mammary gland histopathology was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Results: The results showed a significant (p<0.05) increase of 27% in the total protein concentration in the rat mammary cancer model. The results of proteomic characterization showed a protein profile containing proteins of 187, 169, 68, 64, 53, 41, 24, 18, and 14 kDa, which were suspected to be HER-2, Nischarin, COX-2, Albumine, Vimentin, ACTB, TNF, p16, and fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), respectively. Histopathology of the mammary glands showed an irregular and indistinct arrangement of the alveoli and extensive epithelial cell proliferation from the surface to the lumen of the mammary ducts, and the mammary stroma showed the formation of new epithelial cells, which were cancer cells that spread to surrounding tissue. Conclusions: The proteomic profile was strongly associated with morphological alterations in mammary carcinogenesis in a rat model of DMBA-induced mammary cancer.

                Background. The return to normality post-pandemic brought some inconveniences to the population, especially students. To evaluate the frequency of awake bruxism behaviors through the use of an app on smartphones in dental students returning to presential classes. Awake bruxism was evaluated with the creation of an app that according to the authors evaluates: relaxed jaw muscles, dental contact, jaw effort, clenching teeth and teeth grinding, 5 frequent oral conditions in the population. The frequency of awake/daytime bruxism (AB) in healthy individuals when comparing other populations with possible risk factors for additive bruxism (psychological factors, depression, suicide delusions, etc.), evaluating consequent clinical signs (fatigue, muscle pain, attritions and dental openings). Methods: The sample of three hundred (n=300) young adults legally enrolled in two Ecuadorian universities, the sample was selected among fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth semester students legally enrolled and who are attending Faculty of Dentistry classes in 2 different cities (Quito and Guayaquil). The app was configured to provide 20 alerts during the day x seven days a week, in real time. Results. The study obtained 95% reliability and 5% error in research, was used. The relaxation condition was present in all users, but 40% of the alerts were associated with jaw and tooth discomfort, 39% corresponded to the discomfort of mandibular clenching, and 24% corresponded to tooth contact. A direct significant association was found between the state of relaxation and nonrelaxation, with a high probability of reports related to nonrelaxation (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: Awake bruxism with the app was evaluated, identifying 5 behaviors such as: relaxed mandibular muscles, dental contact, mandibular effort, clenching and grinding teeth, frequent conditions in the population; reporting a state of mandibular relaxation, there is a high probability that a condition of nonrelaxation would be reported (p≤0.05).

                Background Women’s educational attainment and their generation of value through education has increased the prospects for achieving economic equality between men and women. However, women continue to earn lower wages than men, reflecting growing inequality in several countries. Therefore, the objective of the study is to estimate the impact of education on the gender wage gap in Peru over the period 2017-2021. Methods Quantitative, explanatory study aimed at identifying the impact of education on the gender wage gap in Peru during the period 2017-2021. The research design is non-experimental and uses a time series that analyses the influence of the latent variable of education on the gender wage gap. This is a continuous variable to estimate the Tobit model. Results The results show that the gender gap in Peru exhibited a decreasing trend between men and women during the period 2017-2020, with an average reduction of 10% until 2020 due to the health crisis. The highest average salary was achieved by men in 2019, reaching S/2289.97 soles, while women reached an average salary of S/1368.85 soles. In the post-pandemic scenario for 2021, the gender gap increased by 3%, with men earning an average salary of S/1999.63 soles and women earning an average salary of S/1281.16 soles. The analysis from 2017-2021 shows that years of education had a positive impact on the gender wage gap in Peru based on the Tobit model estimation. Conclusions During the analysis period of 2017-2021, years of education had a positive impact on the gender wage gap in Peru, with the greatest impact occurring during the health crisis. The probability of women’s incomes improving with an increase in years of education was 2.35%, while for men, the highest impact was in 2018, with a probability of income improvement of 2.16% in terms of marginal effect.

                Background Research waste has become an increasing issue for research institutions and researchers due to poor research reproducibility and replicability. Interventions to improve research quality at research institutions are important to reduce research waste. This review aims to identify and classify possible interventions to improve research quality, reduce waste, and improve reproducibility and replicability within research-performing institutions. Methods Steps to develop the taxonomy were 1) Use an exemplar paper looking at journal-level interventions to improve research quality, 2) Adapt intervention titles to align with Michie’s behaviour change wheel, 3) Conduct a 2-stage search in PubMed using seed articles and reviews, and a forward and backward citation search to identify articles that evaluated or described the implementation of interventions to improve research quality, 4) Pilot draft taxonomy with researchers at an openscience conference workshop, and 5) Iterative drafting and revisions by the research team. Results Overall, 93 individual interventions were identified through the peer-review literature and researcher reporting. Eleven peer-reviewed articles were identified. Interventions identified covered research stages from before, during, and after study conduct, and whole of institution. Types of intervention included: Tools, Education & Training, Incentives, Modelling and Mentoring, Review & Feedback, Expert involvement, and Policies & Procedures. The taxonomy identified areas for research institutions to focus on to improve research quality, reproducibility, and replicability. Conclusions Areas of focus and future research include improving incentives to implement quality research practices, evaluating current interventions, encouraging no- or low-cost and high-benefit interventions, examining institution culture and individual research ethos, and encouraging researcher mentor-mentee relationships.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                <p>by Seth Commichaux, Tu Luan, Harihara Subrahmaniam Muralidharan, Mihai Pop</p>

For decades, the 16S rRNA gene has been used to taxonomically classify prokaryotic species and to taxonomically profile microbial communities. However, the 16S rRNA gene has been criticized for being too conserved to differentiate between distinct species. We argue that the inability to differentiate between species is not a unique feature of the 16S rRNA gene. Rather, we observe the gradual loss of species-level resolution for other nearly-universal prokaryotic marker genes as the number of gene sequences increases in reference databases. This trend was strongly correlated with how represented a taxonomic group was in the database and indicates that, at the gene-level, the boundaries between many species might be fuzzy. Through our study, we argue that any approach that relies on a single marker to distinguish bacterial taxa is fraught even if some markers appear to be discriminative in current databases.

                <p>by Michael B. Sohn, Cynthia Monaco, Steven R. Gill</p>

In many omics data, including microbiome sequencing data, we are only able to measure relative information. Various computational or statistical methods have been proposed to extract absolute (or biologically relevant) information from this relative information; however, these methods are under rather strong assumptions that may not be suitable for multigroup (more than two groups) and/or longitudinal outcome data. In this article, we first introduce the minimal assumption required to extract absolute from relative information. This assumption is less stringent than those imposed in existing methods, thus being applicable to multigroup and/or longitudinal outcome data. We then propose the first normalization method that works under this minimal assumption. The optimality and validity of the proposed method and its beneficial effects on downstream analysis are demonstrated in extensive simulation studies, where existing methods fail to produce consistent performance under the minimal assumption. We also demonstrate its application to real microbiome datasets to determine biologically relevant microbes to a specific disease/condition.

                <p>by Anton Suvorov, Daniel R. Schrider</p>

A phylogenetic tree represents hypothesized evolutionary history for a set of taxa. Besides the branching patterns (i.e., tree topology), phylogenies contain information about the evolutionary distances (i.e. branch lengths) between all taxa in the tree, which include extant taxa (external nodes) and their last common ancestors (internal nodes). During phylogenetic tree inference, the branch lengths are typically co-estimated along with other phylogenetic parameters during tree topology space exploration. There are well-known regions of the branch length parameter space where accurate estimation of phylogenetic trees is especially difficult. Several novel studies have recently demonstrated that machine learning approaches have the potential to help solve phylogenetic problems with greater accuracy and computational efficiency. In this study, as a proof of concept, we sought to explore the possibility of machine learning models to predict branch lengths. To that end, we designed several deep learning frameworks to estimate branch lengths on fixed tree topologies from multiple sequence alignments or its representations. Our results show that deep learning methods can exhibit superior performance in some difficult regions of branch length parameter space. For example, in contrast to maximum likelihood inference, which is typically used for estimating branch lengths, deep learning methods are more efficient and accurate. In general, we find that our neural networks achieve similar accuracy to a Bayesian approach and are the best-performing methods when inferring long branches that are associated with distantly related taxa. Together, our findings represent a next step toward accurate, fast, and reliable phylogenetic inference with machine learning approaches.

<i>Plasmodium</i> parasites cause Malaria disease, which remains a significant threat to global health, affecting 200 million people and causing 400,000 deaths yearly. <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> remain the two main malaria species affecting humans. Identifying the malaria disease in blood smears requires years of expertise, even for highly trained specialists. Literature studies have been coping with the automatic identification and classification of malaria. However, several points must be addressed and investigated so these automatic methods can be used clinically in a Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) scenario. In this work, we assess the transfer learning approach by using well-known pre-trained deep learning architectures. We considered a database with 6222 Region of Interest (ROI), of which 6002 are from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC), and 220 were acquired locally by us at Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ) in Porto Velho Velho, Rondônia—Brazil, which is part of the legal Amazon. We exhaustively cross-validated the dataset using 100 distinct partitions with 80% train and 20% test for each considering circular ROIs (rough segmentation). Our experimental results show that DenseNet201 has a potential to identify <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites in ROIs (infected or uninfected) of microscopic images, achieving 99.41% AUC with a fast processing time. We further validated our results, showing that DenseNet201 was significantly better (99% confidence interval) than the other networks considered in the experiment. Our results support claiming that transfer learning with texture features potentially differentiates subjects with malaria, spotting those with <i>Plasmodium</i> even in Leukocytes images, which is a challenge. In Future work, we intend scale our approach by adding more data and developing a friendly user interface for CAD use. We aim at aiding the worldwide population and our local natives living nearby the legal Amazon’s rivers.

Originally developed as a theory of consciousness, integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to quantify the causal irreducibility of systems and subsets of units in the system. Specifically, <i>mechanism integrated information</i> quantifies how much of the causal powers of a subset of units in a state, also referred to as a mechanism, cannot be accounted for by its parts. If the causal powers of the mechanism can be fully explained by its parts, it is reducible and its integrated information is zero. Here, we study the upper bound of this measure and how it is achieved. We study mechanisms in isolation, groups of mechanisms, and groups of causal relations among mechanisms. We put forward new theoretical results that show mechanisms that share parts with each other cannot all achieve their maximum. We also introduce techniques to design systems that can maximize the integrated information of a subset of their mechanisms or relations. Our results can potentially be used to exploit the symmetries and constraints to reduce the computations significantly and to compare different connectivity profiles in terms of their maximal achievable integrated information.

                <p>by Andrew A. Schmidt, Alexander Y. Grosberg, Anna Grosberg</p>

Understanding muscle contraction mechanisms is a standing challenge, and one of the approaches has been to create models of the sarcomere–the basic contractile unit of striated muscle. While these models have been successful in elucidating many aspects of muscle contraction, they fall short in explaining the energetics of functional phenomena, such as rigor, and in particular, their dependence on the concentrations of the biomolecules involved in the cross-bridge cycle. Our hypothesis posits that the stochastic time delay between ATP adsorption and ADP/Pi release in the cross-bridge cycle necessitates a modeling approach where the rates of these two reaction steps are controlled by two independent parts of the total free energy change of the hydrolysis reaction. To test this hypothesis, we built a two-filament, stochastic-mechanical half-sarcomere model that separates the energetic roles of ATP and ADP/Pi in the cross-bridge cycle’s free energy landscape. Our results clearly demonstrate that there is a nontrivial dependence of the cross-bridge cycle’s kinetics on the independent concentrations of ATP, ADP, and Pi. The simplicity of the proposed model allows for analytical solutions of the more basic systems, which provide novel insight into the dominant mechanisms driving some of the experimentally observed contractile phenomena.

                <p>by Honghan Li, Shiyou Liu, Shinji Deguchi, Daiki Matsunaga</p>

Cells exhibit various morphological characteristics due to their physiological activities, and changes in cell morphology are inherently accompanied by the assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton. Stress fibers are a prominent component of the actin-based intracellular structure and are highly involved in numerous physiological processes, e.g., mechanotransduction and maintenance of cell morphology. Although it is widely accepted that variations in cell morphology interact with the distribution and localization of stress fibers, it remains unclear if there are underlying geometric principles between the cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton. Here, we present a machine learning system that uses the diffusion model to convert the cell shape to the distribution and alignment of stress fibers. By training with corresponding cell shape and stress fibers datasets, our system learns the conversion to generate the stress fiber images from its corresponding cell shape. The predicted stress fiber distribution agrees well with the experimental data. With this conversion relation, our system allows for performing virtual experiments that provide a visual map showing the probability of stress fiber distribution from the virtual cell shape. Our system potentially provides a powerful approach to seek further hidden geometric principles regarding how the configuration of subcellular structures is determined by the boundary of the cell structure; for example, we found that the stress fibers of cells with small aspect ratios tend to localize at the cell edge while cells with large aspect ratios have homogenous distributions.

                <p>by Rune Höper, Daria Komkova, Tomáš Zavřel, Ralf Steuer</p>

The metabolism of phototrophic cyanobacteria is an integral part of global biogeochemical cycles, and the capability of cyanobacteria to assimilate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> into organic carbon has manifold potential applications for a sustainable biotechnology. To elucidate the properties of cyanobacterial metabolism and growth, computational reconstructions of genome-scale metabolic networks play an increasingly important role. Here, we present an updated reconstruction of the metabolic network of the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and its quantitative evaluation using flux balance analysis (FBA). To overcome limitations of conventional FBA, and to allow for the integration of experimental analyses, we develop a novel approach to describe light absorption and light utilization within the framework of FBA. Our approach incorporates photoinhibition and a variable quantum yield into the constraint-based description of light-limited phototrophic growth. We show that the resulting model is capable of predicting quantitative properties of cyanobacterial growth, including photosynthetic oxygen evolution and the ATP/NADPH ratio required for growth and cellular maintenance. Our approach retains the computational and conceptual simplicity of FBA and is readily applicable to other phototrophic microorganisms.

                <p>by Teemu J. Rintala, Vittorio Fortino</p>

Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance. Furthermore, current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering, highlighting a significant gap in the methodology. We present the COPS R-package, tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. Some of these methods are not accessible through R, and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS. Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics, they vary considerably across methods and datasets. Therefore, it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies.

                <p>by The CRyPTIC consortium </p>

There remains a clinical need for better approaches to rapid drug susceptibility testing in view of the increasing burden of multidrug resistant tuberculosis. Binary susceptibility phenotypes only capture changes in minimum inhibitory concentration when these cross the critical concentration, even though other changes may be clinically relevant. We developed a machine learning system to predict minimum inhibitory concentration from unassembled whole-genome sequencing data for 13 anti-tuberculosis drugs. We trained, validated and tested the system on 10,859 isolates from the CRyPTIC dataset. Essential agreement rates (predicted MIC within one doubling dilution of observed MIC) were above 92% for first-line drugs, 91% for fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, and 90% for new and repurposed drugs, albeit with a significant drop in performance for the very few phenotypically resistant isolates in the latter group. To further validate the model in the absence of external MIC datasets, we predicted MIC and converted values to binary for an external set of 15,239 isolates with binary phenotypes, and compare their performance against a previously validated mutation catalogue, the expected performance of existing molecular assays, and World Health Organization Target Product Profiles. The sensitivity of the model on the external dataset was greater than 90% for all drugs except ethionamide, clofazimine and linezolid. Specificity was greater than 95% for all drugs except ethambutol, ethionamide, bedaquiline, delamanid and clofazimine. The proposed system can provide quantitative susceptibility phenotyping to help guide antimicrobial therapy, although further data collection and validation are required before machine learning can be used clinically for all drugs.

                <p>by Chadi M. Saad-Roy, Sinead E. Morris, Mike Boots, Rachel E. Baker, Bryan L. Lewis, Jeremy Farrar, Madhav V. Marathe, Andrea L. Graham, Simon A. Levin, Caroline E. Wagner, C. Jessica E. Metcalf, Bryan T. Grenfell</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has generated a considerable number of infections and associated morbidity and mortality across the world. Recovery from these infections, combined with the onset of large-scale vaccination, have led to rapidly-changing population-level immunological landscapes. In turn, these complexities have highlighted a number of important unknowns related to the breadth and strength of immunity following recovery or vaccination. Using simple mathematical models, we investigate the medium-term impacts of waning immunity against severe disease on immuno-epidemiological dynamics. We find that uncertainties in the duration of severity-blocking immunity (imparted by either infection or vaccination) can lead to a large range of medium-term population-level outcomes (<i>i.e</i>. infection characteristics and immune landscapes). Furthermore, we show that epidemiological dynamics are sensitive to the strength and duration of underlying host immune responses; this implies that determining infection levels from hospitalizations requires accurate estimates of these immune parameters. More durable vaccines both reduce these uncertainties and alleviate the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in pessimistic outcomes. However, heterogeneity in vaccine uptake drastically changes immune landscapes toward larger fractions of individuals with waned severity-blocking immunity. In particular, if hesitancy is substantial, more robust vaccines have almost no effects on population-level immuno-epidemiology, even if vaccination rates are compensatorily high among vaccine-adopters. This pessimistic scenario for vaccination heterogeneity arises because those few individuals that are vaccine-adopters are so readily re-vaccinated that the duration of vaccinal immunity has no appreciable consequences on their immune status. Furthermore, we find that this effect is heightened if vaccine-hesitants have increased transmissibility (<i>e.g</i>. due to riskier behavior). Overall, our results illustrate the necessity to characterize both transmission-blocking and severity-blocking immune time scales. Our findings also underline the importance of developing robust next-generation vaccines with equitable mass vaccine deployment.

                <p>by Alex T. Keeley, Jeffrey M. Lotthammer, Jacqueline F. Pelham</p>

Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous across the kingdoms of life and serve important roles in regulating physiology and behavior at many levels. These rhythms occur in ~24-hour cycles and are driven by a core molecular oscillator. Circadian timekeeping enables organisms to anticipate daily changes by timing their growth and internal processes. <i>Neurospora crassa</i> is a model organism with a long history in circadian biology, having conserved eukaryotic clock properties and observable circadian phenotypes. A core approach for measuring circadian function in Neurospora is to follow daily oscillations in the direction of growth and spore formation along a thin glass tube (race tube). While leveraging robust phenotypic readouts is useful, interpreting the outputs of large-scale race tube experiments by hand can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To provide the field with an efficient tool for analyzing race tubes, we present Rhythmidia, a graphical user interface (GUI) tool written in Python for calculating circadian periods and growth rates of Neurospora. Rhythmidia is open source, has been benchmarked against the current state-of-the-art, and is easily accessible on GitHub.

                <p>by Robby Concha-Eloko, Michiel Stock, Bernard De Baets, Yves Briers, Rafael Sanjuan, Pilar Domingo-Calap, Dimitri Boeckaerts</p>

Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria. Many of them produce specific enzymes called depolymerases to break down external polysaccharide structures. Accurate annotation and domain identification of these depolymerases are challenging due to their inherent sequence diversity. Hence, we present DepoScope, a machine learning tool that combines a fine-tuned ESM-2 model with a convolutional neural network to identify depolymerase sequences and their enzymatic domains precisely. To accomplish this, we curated a dataset from the INPHARED phage genome database, created a polysaccharide-degrading domain database, and applied sequential filters to construct a high-quality dataset, which is subsequently used to train DepoScope. Our work is the first approach that combines sequence-level predictions with amino-acid-level predictions for accurate depolymerase detection and functional domain identification. In that way, we believe that DepoScope can greatly enhance our understanding of phage-host interactions at the level of depolymerases.

                <p>by Priscilla E. Greenwood, Lawrence M. Ward</p>

Synchronous neural oscillations are strongly associated with a variety of perceptual, cognitive, and behavioural processes. It has been proposed that the role of the synchronous oscillations in these processes is to facilitate information transmission between brain areas, the ‘communication through coherence,’ or CTC hypothesis. The details of how this mechanism would work, however, and its causal status, are still unclear. Here we investigate computationally a proposed mechanism for selective attention that directly implicates the CTC as causal. The mechanism involves alpha band (about 10 Hz) oscillations, originating in the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, being sent to communicating cortical areas, organizing gamma (about 40 Hz) oscillations there, and thus facilitating phase coherence and communication between them. This is proposed to happen contingent on control signals sent from higher-level cortical areas to the thalamic reticular nucleus, which controls the alpha oscillations sent to cortex by the pulvinar. We studied the scope of this mechanism in parameter space, and limitations implied by this scope, using a computational implementation of our conceptual model. Our results indicate that, although the CTC-based mechanism can account for some effects of top-down and bottom-up attentional selection, its limitations indicate that an alternative mechanism, in which oscillatory coherence is caused by communication between brain areas rather than being a causal factor for it, might operate in addition to, or even instead of, the CTC mechanism.

Bacterial pathogens utilize the factors of their hosts to infect them, but which factors they exploit remain poorly defined. Here, we show that a pathogenic <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>Tm) exploits host polyamines for the functional expression of virulence factors. An <i>S</i>Tm mutant strain lacking principal genes required for polyamine synthesis and transport exhibited impaired infectivity in mice. A polyamine uptake-impaired strain of <i>S</i>Tm was unable to inject effectors of the type 3 secretion system into host cells due to a failure of needle assembly. <i>S</i>Tm infection stimulated host polyamine production by increasing arginase expression. The decline in polyamine levels caused by difluoromethylornithine, which inhibits host polyamine production, attenuated <i>S</i>Tm colonization, whereas polyamine supplementation augmented <i>S</i>Tm pathogenesis. Our work reveals that host polyamines are a key factor promoting <i>S</i>Tm infection, and therefore a promising therapeutic target for bacterial infection.

     alt="Age-, region-, and day/night-related variation of the chloride reversal potential in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus"/>
<p>In this study, we examined the chloride reversal potential (E<sub>Cl</sub>) in four postnatal ages, in both the ventral and dorsal regions of the SCN, and during the day and nighttime. Our findings reveal significant variations in the E<sub>Cl</sub> across all three parameters analyzed.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The master control of mammalian circadian rhythms is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is formed by the ventral and dorsal regions. In SCN neurons, GABA has an important function and even excitatory actions in adulthood. However, the physiological role of this neurotransmitter in the developing SCN is unknown. Here, we recorded GABAergic postsynaptic currents (in the perforated-patch configuration using gramicidin) to determine the chloride reversal potential (E<sub>Cl</sub>) and also assessed the immunological expression of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) at early ages of the rat (postnatal days (P) 3 to 25), during the day and night, in the two SCN regions. We detected that E<sub>Cl</sub> greatly varied with age and depending on the SCN region and time of day. Broadly speaking, E<sub>Cl</sub> was more hyperpolarized with age, except for the oldest age studied (P20–25) in both day and night in the ventral SCN, where it was less negative. Likewise, E<sub>Cl</sub> was more hyperpolarized in the dorsal SCN both during the day and at night; while E<sub>Cl</sub> was more negative at night both in the ventral and the dorsal SCN. Moreover, the total NKCC1 fluorescent expression was higher during the day than at night. These results imply that NKCC1 regulates the circadian and developmental fluctuations in the [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to fine-tune E<sub>Cl</sub>, which is crucial for either excitatory or inhibitory GABAergic actions to occur in the SCN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27035?af=R">Prediction of Cognitive Heterogeneity in Parkinson's Disease: A 4‐Year Longitudinal Study Using Clinical, Neuroimaging, Biological and Electrophysiological Biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) can show a very heterogeneous trajectory among patients. Here, we explored the mechanisms involved in the expression and prediction of different cognitive phenotypes over 4 years.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 2 independent cohorts (total n = 475), we performed a cluster analysis to identify trajectories of cognitive progression. Baseline and longitudinal level II neuropsychological assessments were conducted, and baseline structural magnetic resonance imaging, resting electroencephalogram and neurofilament light chain plasma quantification were carried out. Linear mixed-effects models were used to study longitudinal changes. Risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia were estimated using multivariable hazard regression. Spectral power density from the electroencephalogram at baseline and source localization were computed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two cognitive trajectories were identified. Cluster 1 presented stability (PD-Stable) over time, whereas cluster 2 showed progressive cognitive decline (PD-Progressors). The PD-Progressors group showed an increased risk for evolving to PD mild cognitive impairment (HR 2.09; 95% CI 1.11–3.95) and a marked risk for dementia (HR 4.87; 95% CI 1.34–17.76), associated with progressive worsening in posterior-cortical-dependent cognitive processes. Both clusters showed equivalent clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and neurofilament light chain levels at baseline. Conversely, the PD-Progressors group showed a fronto-temporo-occipital and parietal slow-wave power density increase, that was in turn related to worsening at 2 and 4 years of follow-up in different cognitive measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the absence of differences in baseline cognitive function and typical markers of neurodegeneration, the further development of an aggressive cognitive decline in PD is associated with increased slow-wave power density and with a different profile of worsening in several posterior-cortical-dependent tasks.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Training clinician–scientists is a primary objective of many academic neurology departments, as these individuals are uniquely positioned to perform insightful clinical or laboratory-based research informed both by clinical knowledge and their own experiences caring for patients. Despite its importance, training clinician–scientists has perhaps never been so challenging. The National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) R25 program was designed in an attempt to support these individuals, decrease the time needed to obtain National Institutes of Health K awards, and to help educate a cohort of trainees preparing for a career in academic neurology. We endeavored to describe the structure and features of the program while examining its outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>R25 outcome data from 2009 to 2024 were reviewed. Statistical comparisons were made using 2-sided Mann–Whitney <i>U</i> testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 67% of adult neurologists who received an R25 had a successful application for a National Institutes of Health K award compared with 45% of adult neurologists who had not received R25 support (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Among child neurologists, 73% who applied went on to receive K funding after R25 support, compared with 45% who had not been part of the R25 program (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The average time between completion of residency and obtaining a K award for R25 participants was decreased by 26 months among those with an MD/PhD degree, and 32 months for those with an MD degree compared with non-R25 individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The R25 program has been successful in achieving its training goals, but stands as only one component of support for aspiring clinician–scientists. Investments and commitments made by academic neurology departments are key to supporting this success. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88294">Deciphering deep-sea chemosynthetic symbiosis by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Bathymodioline mussels dominate deep-sea methane seep and hydrothermal vent habitats and obtain nutrients and energy primarily through chemosynthetic endosymbiotic bacteria in the bacteriocytes of their gill. However, the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate mussel host–symbiont interactions remain unclear. Here, we constructed a comprehensive cell atlas of the gill in the mussel <i>Gigantidas platifrons</i> from the South China Sea methane seeps (1100 m depth) using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and whole-mount in situ hybridisation. We identified 13 types of cells, including three previously unknown ones, and uncovered unknown tissue heterogeneity. Every cell type has a designated function in supporting the gill’s structure and function, creating an optimal environment for chemosynthesis, and effectively acquiring nutrients from the endosymbiotic bacteria. Analysis of snRNA-seq of in situ transplanted mussels clearly showed the shifts in cell state in response to environmental oscillations. Our findings provide insight into the principles of host–symbiont interaction and the bivalves' environmental adaption mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95680">Disparity in temporal and spatial relationships between resting-state electrophysiological and fMRI signals</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state brain networks (RSNs) have been widely applied in health and disease, but the interpretation of RSNs in terms of the underlying neural activity is unclear. To address this fundamental question, we conducted simultaneous recordings of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and electrophysiology signals in two separate brain regions of rats. Our data reveal that for both recording sites, spatial maps derived from band-specific local field potential (LFP) power can account for up to 90% of the spatial variability in RSNs derived from rsfMRI signals. Surprisingly, the time series of LFP band power can only explain to a maximum of 35% of the temporal variance of the local rsfMRI time course from the same site. In addition, regressing out time series of LFP power from rsfMRI signals has minimal impact on the spatial patterns of rsfMRI-based RSNs. This disparity in the spatial and temporal relationships between resting-state electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals suggests that electrophysiological activity alone does not fully explain the effects observed in the rsfMRI signal, implying the existence of an rsfMRI component contributed by ‘electrophysiology-invisible’ signals. These findings offer a novel perspective on our understanding of RSN interpretation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90565">Combining array tomography with electron tomography provides insights into leakiness of the blood-brain barrier in mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                Like other volume electron microscopy approaches, automated tape-collecting ultramicrotomy (ATUM) enables imaging of serial sections deposited on thick plastic tapes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ATUM is unique in enabling hierarchical imaging and thus efficient screening for target structures, as needed for correlative light and electron microscopy. However, SEM of sections on tape can only access the section surface, thereby limiting the axial resolution to the typical size of cellular vesicles with an order of magnitude lower than the acquired xy resolution. In contrast, serial-section electron tomography (ET), a transmission electron microscopy-based approach, yields isotropic voxels at full EM resolution, but requires deposition of sections on electron-stable thin and fragile films, thus making screening of large section libraries difficult and prone to section loss. To combine the strength of both approaches, we developed ‘ATUM-Tomo, a hybrid method, where sections are first reversibly attached to plastic tape via a dissolvable coating, and after screening detached and transferred to the ET-compatible thin films. As a proof-of-principle, we applied correlative ATUM-Tomo to study ultrastructural features of blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness around microthrombi in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. Microthrombi and associated sites of BBB leakiness were identified by confocal imaging of injected fluorescent and electron-dense nanoparticles, then relocalized by ATUM-SEM, and finally interrogated by correlative ATUM-Tomo. Overall, our new ATUM-Tomo approach will substantially advance ultrastructural analysis of biological phenomena that require cell- and tissue-level contextualization of the finest subcellular textures.

                Understanding the mechanisms of viral disease tolerance in bats has significant scientific implications for human health. Dai et al. investigate bat immune tolerance through the perspective of the antiviral RNA interference response. This RNA-based antiviral immunity, an energy-conserving pathway, may be particularly beneficial for bats.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsal region of the hippocampus (dHC) mediates many of the mnemonic functions traditionally associated with the hippocampus proper, such as spatial and episodic memory, whereas ventral hippocampus (vHC) has been extensively implicated in emotional memory and motivational processes. By contrast, the functions of the intermediate hippocampus (iHC) are far less understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mnemonic functions of iHC by reversibly inactivating iHC prior to testing memory in behavioral tasks dependent on the integrity of dHC, iHC, or vHC, namely, rapid place water maze, inhibitory avoidance, spontaneous alternation, and temporal ordering of odors. Given our previous findings showing that dHC and vHC are involved in mnemonic control of ingestive behavior, we also assessed the effects of iHC inactivation on sucrose intake. The results showed that pharmacological inhibition of iHC impairs rapid place water maze memory, which has been previously shown to be dependent on iHC but not dHC or vHC. iHC inactivation does not impact memory dependent on dHC (spontaneous alternation), vHC (temporal odor memory), or either dHC or vHC (inhibitory avoidance), and only modestly affects sucrose intake. These findings provide support for the involvement of iHC in mnemonic functions that are distinct from dHC and vHC and highlight the need to further advance our understanding of the functions of this hippocampal region that has been relatively understudied.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the hippocampus has been implicated in both the temporal organization of memories and association of scene elements, some theoretical accounts posit that the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory is largely atemporal. In this study, we set out to explore this discrepancy by identifying hippocampal activity patterns related to scene construction while participants performed a temporal order memory task. Participants in the fMRI scanner were shown a sequence of photographs, each consisting of a central object and a contextual background scene. On each retrieval trial, participants were shown a pair of the original photographs (FULL), objects from the scenes without the background (OBJ), or background contexts without the main foreground object (BACK). In the temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, participants judged the temporal order of the pair of scenes; in the Viewing trials, two identical scenes were shown without any task. First, we found that the anterior hippocampus—particularly the CA1 and subiculum—showed similar patterns of activation between the BACK and OBJ conditions, suggesting that scene construction occurred spontaneously during both TOJ and Viewing. Furthermore, neural markers of scene construction in the anterior hippocampus did not apply to incorrect trials, showing that successful temporal memory retrieval was functionally linked to scene construction. In the cortex, time-processing areas, such as the supplementary motor area and the precuneus, and scene-processing areas, such as the parahippocampal cortex, were activated and functionally connected with the hippocampus. Together, these results support the view that the hippocampus is concurrently involved in scene construction and temporal organization of memory and propose a model of hippocampal episodic memory that takes both processes into account.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. Objective surrogate markers sensitive to detect changes in disease severity are needed to reduce sample sizes in interventional trials and identification of predictors of faster disease progression would facilitate patient selection, enrichment, or stratification in such trials.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prospective 1-year longitudinal, multimodal study in 34 ataxic SCA1 individuals and 21 healthy controls. We collected clinical, patient-reported outcomes, biochemical and magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers at baseline and after 1 year. We determined 1-year progression and evaluated the potential predictive value of several baseline markers on 1-year disease progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, multiple structural and spectroscopic MR markers in pons and cerebellum differentiated SCA1 from healthy controls and correlated with disease severity. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) chain and CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were elevated in SCA1. In longitudinal analysis, total brainstem and pontine volume change, inventory of non-ataxia signs (INAS) count, and SCA functional index (SCAFI) showed larger responsiveness compared to the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA).</p>
<p>Longer disease duration, longer non-expanded CAG repeat length, and higher disease burden were associated with faster SARA increase after 1-year in the SCA1 group. Similarly, lower baseline brainstem, pontine, and cerebellar volumes, as well as lower levels of N-acetylaspartate and glutamate in the cerebellar white matter, were also associated with faster SARA increase.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results guide the selection of the most sensitive measures of disease progression in SCA1 and have identified features associated with accelerated progression that could inform the design of clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To develop a multiparametric machine-learning (ML) framework using high-resolution 3 dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) fingerprinting (MRF) data for quantitative characterization of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>We included 119 subjects, 33 patients with focal epilepsy and histopathologically confirmed FCD, 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs), and 26 disease controls (DCs). Subjects underwent whole-brain 3 Tesla MRF acquisition, the reconstruction of which generated T1 and T2 relaxometry maps. A 3D region of interest was manually created for each lesion, and z-score normalization using HC data was performed. We conducted 2D classification with ensemble models using MRF T1 and T2 mean and standard deviation from gray matter and white matter for FCD versus controls. Subtype classification additionally incorporated entropy and uniformity of MRF metrics, as well as morphometric features from the morphometric analysis program (MAP). We translated 2D results to individual probabilities using the percentage of slices above an adaptive threshold. These probabilities and clinical variables were input into a support vector machine for individual-level classification. Fivefold cross-validation was performed and performance metrics were reported using receiver-operating-characteristic-curve analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>FCD versus HC classification yielded mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.945, 0.980, and 0.962, respectively; FCD versus DC classification achieved 0.918, 0.965, and 0.939. In comparison, visual review of the clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected 48% (16/33) of the lesions by official radiology report. In the subgroup where both clinical MRI and MAP were negative, the MRF-ML models correctly distinguished FCD patients from HCs and DCs in 98.3% of cross-validation trials for the magnetic resonance imaging negative group and MAP negative group. Type II versus non-type-II classification exhibited mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.835, 0.823, and 0.83, respectively; type IIa versus IIb classification showed 0.85, 0.9, and 0.87. In comparison, the transmantle sign was present in 58% (7/12) of the IIb cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The MRF-ML framework presented in this study demonstrated strong efficacy in noninvasively classifying FCD from normal cortex and distinguishing FCD subtypes. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27047?af=R">Evaluation of Glymphatic System Development in Neonatal Brain via Diffusion Analysis along the Perivascular Space Index</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system is a recently discovered macroscopic waste clearance system associated with numerous neurological diseases. However, little is known about glymphatic system development in neonates. We sought to evaluate diffusion along the perivascular space (ALPS) index, a proxy for glymphatic system function, in neonates and investigate its potential associations with maturation, sex, and preterm birth.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 418 neonates, including 92 preterm neonates (57 males) and 326 term neonates (175 males), from the Developing Human Connectome Project were used for evaluating ALPS index. Linear regression modeling was performed to assess group differences in the ALPS index according to preterm birth and sex. Pearson's and partial correlation analysis were performed to assess the association between the ALPS index and gestational age (GA) as well as postmenstrual age (PMA) at MRI. Moderation analysis was performed to assess the moderation effect of preterm birth on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to term neonates, preterm neonates exhibited lower ALPS indices (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The ALPS index positively correlated with PMA (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and GA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Preterm birth (<i>p</i> = 0.013) had a significant moderation effect on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA. Sex had no significant direct effect (<i>p</i> = 0.639) or moderation effect (<i>p</i> = 0.333) on ALPS index.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system development is a dynamic process in neonates, which can be moderated by preterm birth, the ALPS index could serve as a sensitive biomarker for monitoring this process. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

Brain-specific gene co-expression analysis was performed for D/EE-SWAS genes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified the etiology in 42/91 (46%) patients in our Core cohort, including 29/44 (66%) with DEE-SWAS and 13/47 (28%) with EE-SWAS. A genetic etiology was identified in 31/91 (34%). D/EE-SWAS genes were highly co-expressed in brain, highlighting the importance of channelopathies and transcriptional regulators. Structural etiologies were found in 12/91 (13%) individuals. We identified 10 novel D/EE-SWAS genes with a range of functions: <i>ATP1A2</i>, <i>CACNA1A</i>, <i>FOXP1</i>, <i>GRIN1</i>, <i>KCNMA1</i>, <i>KCNQ3</i>, <i>PPFIA3</i>, <i>PUF60</i>, <i>SETD1B, and ZBTB18</i>, and 2 novel copy number variants, 17p11.2 duplication and 5q22 deletion. Although developmental regression patterns were similar in both syndromes, DEE-SWAS was associated with a longer duration of epilepsy and poorer intellectual outcome than EE-SWAS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS have highly heterogeneous genetic and structural etiologies. Phenotypic analysis highlights valuable clinical differences between DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS which inform clinical care and prognostic counseling. Our etiological findings pave the way for the development of precision therapies. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>Non-invasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has been shown to increase the outcome of speech and language therapy (SLT) in chronic aphasia. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of add-on tDCS on SLT in the early stage of aphasia; this may be due to methodological reasons, in particular the influence of spontaneous remission and the difficulty of establishing stimulation protocols in clinical routines. Thirty-seven participants with subacute aphasia (PwA) after stroke (23 men, 14 women; mean age 62 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12 years; mean duration 49 &amp;amp;plusmn; 28 days) were included in two consecutive periods of treatment lasting two weeks each. During the first period (P1) the participants received 10 sessions of SLT, during the second period (P2) the aphasia therapy was supplemented by anodal left hemispheric 2 mA tDCS over the left hemisphere. Severity-specific language tests (Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT), n = 27 and Bielefeld Aphasia Screening-Reha (BIAS-R), n = 10) were administered before P1, between P1 and P2, and after P2. Where information was available, the results were corrected for spontaneous remission (AAT sample), and the therapy outcomes of P1 and P2 were compared. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; overall language abilities improved significantly during P1 and P2. However, improvement&amp;amp;mdash;as measured by the AAT profile level or the BIAS-R mean percentage value&amp;amp;mdash;during P2 (with tDCS) was significantly higher than during P1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; AAT sample and p = 0.005; BIAS-R sample). Thus, tDCS protocols can be implemented in early aphasia rehabilitation. Despite the limitations of the research design, which are also discussed from an implementation science perspective, this is preliminary evidence that an individually tailored anodal tDCS can have a significant add-on effect on the outcome of behavioral aphasia therapy in subacute aphasia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/8/ENEURO.0523-23.2024?rss=1">Adaptive Changes in Group 2 Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors Underlie the Deficit in Recognition Memory Induced by Methamphetamine in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive dysfunction is associated with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Here, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to examine the involvement of either Group 2 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2) or mGlu3 receptors in memory deficit induced by methamphetamine in mice. Methamphetamine treatment (1&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p., once a day for 5&nbsp;d followed by 7&nbsp;d of withdrawal) caused an impaired performance in the novel object recognition test in wild-type mice, but not in mGlu2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> or mGlu3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Memory deficit in wild-type mice challenged with methamphetamine was corrected by systemic treatment with selectively negative allosteric modulators of mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptors (compounds VU6001966 and VU0650786, respectively). Methamphetamine treatment in wild-type mice caused large increases in levels of mGlu2/3 receptors, the Type 3 activator of G-protein signaling (AGS3), Rab3A, and the vesicular glutamate transporter, vGlut1, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Methamphetamine did not alter mGlu2/3-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation but abolished the ability of postsynaptic mGlu3 receptors to boost mGlu5 receptor-mediated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in PFC slices. Remarkably, activation of presynaptic mGlu2/3 receptors did not inhibit but rather amplified depolarization-induced [<sup>3</sup>H]-D-aspartate release in synaptosomes prepared from the PFC of methamphetamine-treated mice. These findings demonstrate that exposure to methamphetamine causes changes in the expression and function of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, which might alter excitatory synaptic transmission in the PFC and raise the attractive possibility that selective inhibitors of mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptors (or both) may be used to improve cognitive dysfunction in individuals affected by MUD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-998/v2?src=rss">An Assessment of Contemporary Methods and Data-Enabled Approaches for Early Cataract Detection [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cataracts are common causes of visual impairment. Preventing blindness requires an early and accurate diagnosis. This review examines current cataract diagnosis strategies, explores data-driven machine learning algorithms for early detection, investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, assesses improvements in cataract detection accuracy, identifies research gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies. Methods: We gathered labelled cataract and non-cataract fundus data from the Kaggle. Scholarly publications were sourced from reliable databases such as ProQuest, IEEE, ELSEVIER, Google Scholar, and PubMed. A detailed literature search with specific terms expanded the scope of this review. We included studies that used cataract and non-cataract fundus eye images from cross-sectional, retrospective, and prospective studies. The quality assessment used the AMSTAR tool, considering factors such as literature search comprehensiveness, study selection criteria, data extraction methodologies, and study validity (Table 1). Results: This study encompassed 130 research publications, focusing on machine learning models and clinical-based diagnostic approaches for early-stage cataract identification. The performance of machine-learning models is influenced by factors such as dataset noise and limited reliable data. Barriers to the successful implementation of AI for cataract diagnosis were identified. Conclusions: This review emphasises the obstacles hindering the broad application of AI in cataract diagnosis. Addressing these findings is vital for developing strategies to overcome these challenges and enhance cataract detection systems. To achieve improved accuracy and efficiency in cataract diagnosis, future research should prioritise efforts to enhance dataset availability and quality, reduce data noise, and refine machine-learning algorithms. Unlocking the full potential of AI and/or machine learning can lead to significant breakthroughs in cataract diagnosis, ultimately resulting in better patient outcomes and reduced visual impairments.
