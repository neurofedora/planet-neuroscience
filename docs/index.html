              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of motion in the neural representation of social interactions in the posterior temporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Humans are an inherently social species, with multiple focal brain regions sensitive to various visual social cues such as faces, bodies, and biological motion. More recently, research has begun to investigate how the brain responds to more complex, naturalistic social scenes, identifying a region in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (SI-pSTS; i.e., social interaction pSTS), among others, as an important region for processing social interaction. This research, however, has presented images or videos, and thus the contribution of motion to social interaction perception in these brain regions is not yet understood. In the current study, 22 participants viewed videos, image sequences, scrambled image sequences and static images of either social interactions or non-social independent actions. Combining univariate and multivariate analyses, we confirm that bilateral SI-pSTS plays a central role in dynamic social interaction perception but is much less involved when interactiveness is conveyed solely with static cues. Regions in the social brain, including SI-pSTS and extrastriate body area (EBA), showed sensitivity to both motion and interactive content. While SI-pSTS is somewhat more tuned to video interactions than is EBA, both bilateral SI-pSTS and EBA showed a greater response to social interactions compared to non-interactions and both regions responded more strongly to videos than static images. Indeed, both regions showed higher responses to interactions than independent actions in videos and intact sequences, but not in other conditions. Exploratory multivariate regression analyses suggest that selectivity for simple visual motion does not in itself drive interactive sensitivity in either SI-pSTS or EBA. Rather, selectivity for interactions expressed in point-light animations, and selectivity for static images of bodies, make positive and independent contributions to this effect across the LOTC region. Our results strongly suggest that EBA and SI-pSTS work together during dynamic interaction perception, at least when interactive information is conveyed primarily via body information. As such, our results are also in line with proposals of a third visual stream supporting dynamic social scene perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Idiosyncratic relation between human brain activity and behavior</a></h4>

              
                Human behavior is known to be idiosyncratic, yet research in neuroscience typically assumes a universal brain-behavior relationship. Here we test this assumption by estimating the level of idiosyncrasy in individual brain-behavior maps obtained using human neuroimaging. We first show that task-based activation maps are both stable within an individual and similar across people. Critically, although behavior-based activation maps are also stable within an individual, they strongly diverge across people. A computational model that jointly generates brain activity and behavior explains these results and reveals that within-person factors have much larger effect than group factors in determining behavior-based activations. These findings demonstrate that unlike task-based activity that is mostly similar among people, the relation between brain activity and behavioral outcomes is largely idiosyncratic. Thus, contrary to popular assumptions, group-level behavior-based maps reveal relatively little about each individual.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Processing of Different Social Scales in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                For an individual to lead a healthy and fulfilling social life, it is essential to have relationships with multiple people who are at different levels of emotional closeness. Based on ethological, sociological and psychological evidence, social networks have been divided into five scales of emotional closeness, gradually increasing in size and decreasing in emotional proximity. Is this division also reflected in different brain processes? During functional MRI, participants compared their emotional closeness to different members of their social network. We examined the brain area that was differentially activated for levels of emotional closeness, and found that its vast majority (78%) showed preference for people who are closest to participants, including the temporoparietal junction, middle temporal gyrus, precuneus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A different system, which includes the medial temporal lobe, retrosplenial cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed preference for all other social scales. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between brain responses to emotionally close people and smaller spaces (room, building) as well as between emotionally distant people and larger spaces (neighborhood, city). Finally, brain activity at the default mode network (DMN) was associated with social scale preference, such that its subnetwork DMN A, related to social processing, showed preference to closer social scales, while DMN C, related to spatiotemporal processing, showed preference to farther social scales. Our results show that the cognitive processing of a few intimately close people differs from the rest of the social network, emphasizing their crucial role in social life.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Enhanced Stability of Complex Sound Representations Relative to Simple Sounds in the Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Typical everyday sounds, such as those of speech or running water, are spectrotemporally complex. The ability to recognize complex sounds (CxSs) and their associated meaning is presumed to rely on their stable neural representations across time. The auditory cortex is critical for the processing of CxSs, yet little is known of the degree of stability of auditory cortical representations of CxSs across days. Previous studies have shown that the auditory cortex represents CxS identity with a substantial degree of invariance to basic sound attributes such as frequency. We therefore hypothesized that auditory cortical representations of CxSs are more stable across days than those of sounds that lack spectrotemporal structure such as pure tones (PTs). To test this hypothesis, we recorded responses of identified layer 2/3 auditory cortical excitatory neurons to both PTs and CxSs across days using two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice. Auditory cortical neurons showed significant daily changes of responses to both types of sounds, yet responses to CxSs exhibited significantly lower rates of daily change than those of PTs. Furthermore, daily changes in response profiles to PTs tended to be more stimulus-specific, reflecting changes in sound selectivity, compared with changes of CxS responses. Last, the enhanced stability of responses to CxSs was evident across longer time intervals as well. Together, these results suggest that spectrotemporally CxSs are more stably represented in the auditory cortex across time than PTs. These findings support a role of the auditory cortex in representing CxS identity across time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Traces of Semantization, from Episodic to Semantic Memory in a Spiking Cortical Network Model</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Episodic memory is a recollection of past personal experiences associated with particular times and places. This kind of memory is commonly subject to loss of contextual information or "semantization," which gradually decouples the encoded memory items from their associated contexts while transforming them into semantic or gist-like representations. Novel extensions to the classical Remember/Know (R/K) behavioral paradigm attribute the loss of episodicity to multiple exposures of an item in different contexts. Despite recent advancements explaining semantization at a behavioral level, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we suggest and evaluate a novel hypothesis proposing that Bayesian&ndash;Hebbian synaptic plasticity mechanisms might cause semantization of episodic memory. We implement a cortical spiking neural network model with a Bayesian&ndash;Hebbian learning rule called Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), which captures the semantization phenomenon and offers a mechanistic explanation for it. Encoding items across multiple contexts leads to item-context decoupling akin to semantization. We compare BCPNN plasticity with the more commonly used spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule in the same episodic memory task. Unlike BCPNN, STDP does not explain the decontextualization process. We further examine how selective plasticity modulation of isolated salient events may enhance preferential retention and resistance to semantization. Our model reproduces important features of episodicity on behavioral timescales under various biological constraints while also offering a novel neural and synaptic explanation for semantization, thereby casting new light on the interplay between episodic and semantic memory processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Paroxetine Increases {delta} Opioid Responsiveness in Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>There are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved -opioid receptor (DOR)-selective agonists, despite having fewer side effects in rodents and nonhuman primates compared with traditional &mu;-opioid receptor (MOR) therapeutics (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B55">Vanderah, 2010</cross-ref>). Targeting peripheral receptors is an attractive strategy to reduce abuse potential. However, peripheral opioid receptors do not readily respond to agonists unless primed by inflammation, which would limit their efficacy in noninflammatory pain patients (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B51">Stein et al., 1989</cross-ref>). It was recently identified that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) maintains DOR incompetence in noninflamed nociceptors (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B6">Brackley et al., 2016</cross-ref>, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B7">2017</cross-ref>). Here, we report that paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and potent GRK2 inhibitor (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B54">Thal et al., 2012</cross-ref>), reduces chronic GRK2 association with membrane DOR, thereby enhancing peripheral DOR-mediated analgesic competence in the absence of inflammation. Interestingly, paroxetine&rsquo;s effects on GRK2 <I>in vivo</I> are limited to peripheral tissues in the male rat. The effects of paroxetine on DOR competence are notably antagonized by GRK2 overexpression. This is the first study to suggest that paroxetine induces peripheral DOR analgesic competence through a GRK2-dependent mechanism, improving analgesic efficacy in noninflamed tissue. Because paroxetine targets the protein that governs peripheral opioid receptor responsiveness, and does so in the absence of inflammation, we propose that paroxetine may be suitable as a co-therapy with peripherally-restrictive doses of opioids to improve analgesic efficacy in noninflammatory pain conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Confirmation of Decreased Rates of Cerebral Protein Synthesis In Vivo in a Mouse Model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder that results in intellectual disability and, in ~50% of patients, autism spectrum disorder. The protein products that are altered in TSC (TSC1 and TSC2) form a complex to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR; mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)] pathway. This pathway has been shown to affect the process of mRNA translation through its action on ribosomal protein S6 and 4-elongation binding protein 1. It is thought that mutations in the TSC proteins lead to upregulation of the mTORC1 pathway and consequently an increase in protein synthesis. Unexpectedly, our previous study of a mouse model of TSC (<I>Tsc2<sup>Djk</sup></I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup>) demonstrated decreased <I>in vivo</I> rates of protein synthesis throughout the brain. In the present study, we confirm those results in another <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mouse model, one with a different mutation locus and on a mixed background (<I>Tsc2<sup>Mjg</sup></I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup>). We also examine mTORC1 signaling and possible effects of prior isoflurane anesthesia. Because measurements of protein synthesis rates <I>in vivo</I> require surgical preparation of the animal and anesthesia, we examine mTORC1 signaling pathways both under baseline conditions and following recovery from anesthesia. Our results demonstrate regionally selective effects of prior anesthesia. Overall, our results in both <I>in vivo</I> models suggest divergences from the central hypothesis regarding TSC and show the importance of studying protein synthesis <I>in vivo</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Recommendations for connecting molecular sequence and biodiversity research infrastructures through ELIXIR [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Threats to global biodiversity are increasingly recognised by scientists and the public as a critical challenge. Molecular sequencing technologies offer means to catalogue, explore, and monitor the richness and biogeography of life on Earth. However, exploiting their full potential requires tools that connect biodiversity infrastructures and resources. As a research infrastructure developing services and technical solutions that help integrate and coordinate life science resources across Europe, ELIXIR is a key player. To identify opportunities, highlight priorities, and aid strategic thinking, here we survey approaches by which molecular technologies help inform understanding of biodiversity. We detail example use cases to highlight how DNA sequencing is: resolving taxonomic issues; Increasing knowledge of marine biodiversity; helping understand how agriculture and biodiversity are critically linked; and playing an essential role in ecological studies. Together with examples of national biodiversity programmes, the use cases show where progress is being made but also highlight common challenges and opportunities for future enhancement of underlying technologies and services that connect molecular and wider biodiversity domains. Based on emerging themes, we propose key recommendations to guide future funding for biodiversity research: biodiversity and bioinformatic infrastructures need to collaborate closely and strategically; taxonomic efforts need to be aligned and harmonised across domains; metadata needs to be standardised and common data management approaches widely adopted; current approaches need to be scaled up dramatically to address the anticipated explosion of molecular data; bioinformatics support for biodiversity research needs to be enabled and sustained; training for end users of biodiversity research infrastructures needs to be prioritised; and community initiatives need to be proactive and focused on enabling solutions. For sequencing data to deliver their full potential they must be connected to knowledge: together, molecular sequence data collection initiatives and biodiversity research infrastructures can advance global efforts to prevent further decline of Earth‚Äôs biodiversity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effects of beliefs, knowledge, and attitude on herbal medicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herbal medicines are gaining a greater degree of popularity as complementary and alternative medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, there is a lack of data concerning the rationale for and factors influencing their use. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based online study involving 1,621 participants was conducted to explore the effects of magical health beliefs, holistic health beliefs, knowledge, and pro- complementary alternative medicine (CAM) attitudes on herbal medicine use in the Indonesian population. Results: Logistic regression findings showed that knowledge about herbal medicines was independently and positively associated with herbal medicine use to a greater extent than herbal medicine non-use (adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval; CI = 1.16 to 1.24). The participants who used herbal medicines had a greater magical health belief score than herbal medicine non-users, with AOR = 1.03 and 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.06. Moreover, holistic health beliefs and pro-CAM attitudes were also found to be independently associated with herbal medicine use. Conclusion: These findings alert nurses to assess the roles of magical health beliefs, holistic health belief, knowledge, and attitudes toward herbal medicine use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Culling and mortality of dairy cows: why it happens and how it can be mitigated [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The United Nations estimates that the global population will total 9.7 billion in 2050. Rapid population growth pose a significant obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly eradicating hunger and poverty. In view of the expanding population growth, food production ideally should triple to prevent massive food shortages. Sustainable food and nutrition security is the focal point of the dairy industry. Dairy production plays a pivotal role in addressing and advancing global food and nutrition security. It serves as a major source of protein, calcium, and phosphorus in many families in developing countries with a fast-growing population. Consequently, the dairy industry is expected to grow by approximately 26% in the next 10 years and produce an estimated 1077 million tonnes of milk by 2050. However, the growth and distribution of the dairy industry is limited by many factors such as culling and mortality of dairy cows. Several studies highlight reproduction failures, old age, poor milk yield, diseases (mastitis, lameness, and dystocia), and heat stress as some reasons for culling of dairy cows. Hence, this review highlights the factors influencing culling and mortality in dairy production farms, and discusses mitigating measures to limit culling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A framework for macroscopic phase-resetting curves for generalised spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gr√©gory Dumont, Alberto P√©rez-Cervera, Boris Gutkin</p>

Brain rhythms emerge from synchronization among interconnected spiking neurons. Key properties of such rhythms can be gleaned from the phase-resetting curve (PRC). Inferring the PRC and developing a systematic phase reduction theory for large-scale brain rhythms remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present a theoretical framework and methodology to compute the PRC of generic spiking networks with emergent collective oscillations. We adopt a renewal approach where neurons are described by the time since their last action potential, a description that can reproduce the dynamical feature of many cell types. For a sufficiently large number of neurons, the network dynamics are well captured by a continuity equation known as the refractory density equation. We develop an adjoint method for this equation giving a semi-analytical expression of the infinitesimal PRC. We confirm the validity of our framework for specific examples of neural networks. Our theoretical framework can link key biological properties at the individual neuron scale and the macroscopic oscillatory network properties. Beyond spiking networks, the approach is applicable to a broad class of systems that can be described by renewal processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Amyloid pathology disrupts gliotransmitter release in astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anup Gopalakrishna Pillai, Suhita Nadkarni</p>

Accumulation of amyloid-beta (AŒ≤) is associated with synaptic dysfunction and destabilization of astrocytic calcium homeostasis. A growing body of evidence support astrocytes as active modulators of synaptic transmission via calcium-mediated gliotransmission. However, the details of mechanisms linking AŒ≤ signaling, astrocytic calcium dynamics, and gliotransmission are not known. We developed a biophysical model that describes calcium signaling and the ensuing gliotransmitter release from a single astrocytic process when stimulated by glutamate release from hippocampal neurons. The model accurately captures the temporal dynamics of microdomain calcium signaling and glutamate release via both kiss-and-run and full-fusion exocytosis. We investigate the roles of two crucial calcium regulating machineries affected by AŒ≤: plasma-membrane calcium pumps (PMCA) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). When we implemented these AŒ≤-affected molecular changes in our astrocyte model, it led to an increase in the rate and synchrony of calcium events. Our model also reproduces several previous findings of AŒ≤ associated aberrant calcium activity, such as increased intracellular calcium level and increased spontaneous calcium activity, and synchronous calcium events. The study establishes a causal link between previous observations of hyperactive astrocytes in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) and AŒ≤-induced modifications in mGluR and PMCA functions. Analogous to neurotransmitter release, gliotransmitter exocytosis closely tracks calcium changes in astrocyte processes, thereby guaranteeing tight control of synaptic signaling by astrocytes. However, the downstream effects of AD-related calcium changes in astrocytes on gliotransmitter release are not known. Our results show that enhanced rate of exocytosis resulting from modified calcium signaling in astrocytes leads to a rapid depletion of docked vesicles that disrupts the crucial temporal correspondence between a calcium event and vesicular release. We propose that the loss of temporal correspondence between calcium events and gliotransmission in astrocytes pathologically alters astrocytic modulation of synaptic transmission in the presence of AŒ≤ accumulation.

                <p>by Nora Heitzman-Breen, Stanca M. Ciupe</p>

The relationship between transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the amount of virus present in the proximity of a susceptible host is not understood. Here, we developed a within-host and aerosol mathematical model and used it to determine the relationship between viral kinetics in the upper respiratory track, viral kinetics in the aerosols, and new transmissions in golden hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. We determined that infectious virus shedding early in infection correlates with transmission events, shedding of infectious virus diminishes late in the infection, and high viral RNA levels late in the infection are a poor indicator of transmission. We further showed that viral infectiousness increases in a density dependent manner with viral RNA and that their relative ratio is time-dependent. Such information is useful for designing interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Phage endolysins are adapted to specific hosts and are evolutionarily dynamic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frank Oechslin, Xiaojun Zhu, Moira B. Dion, Rong Shi, Sylvain Moineau</p>

Endolysins are produced by (bacterio)phages to rapidly degrade the bacterial cell wall and release new viral particles. Despite sharing a common function, endolysins present in phages that infect a specific bacterial species can be highly diverse and vary in types, number, and organization of their catalytic and cell wall binding domains. While much is now known about the biochemistry of phage endolysins, far less is known about the implication of their diversity on phage‚Äìhost adaptation and evolution. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we could genetically exchange a subset of different endolysin genes into distinct lactococcal phage genomes. Regardless of the type and biochemical properties of these endolysins, fitness costs associated to their genetic exchange were marginal if both recipient and donor phages were infecting the same bacterial strain, but gradually increased when taking place between phage that infect different strains or bacterial species. From an evolutionary perspective, we observed that endolysins could be naturally exchanged by homologous recombination between phages coinfecting a same bacterial strain. Furthermore, phage endolysins could adapt to their new phage/host environment by acquiring adaptative mutations. These observations highlight the remarkable ability of phage lytic systems to recombine and adapt and, therefore, explain their large diversity and mosaicism. It also indicates that evolution should be considered to act on functional modules rather than on bacteriophages themselves. Furthermore, the extensive degree of evolvability observed for phage endolysins offers new perspectives for their engineering as antimicrobial agents.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Human electromagnetic and haemodynamic networks systematically converge in unimodal cortex and diverge in transmodal cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Golia Shafiei, Sylvain Baillet, Bratislav Misic</p>

Whole-brain neural communication is typically estimated from statistical associations among electromagnetic or haemodynamic time-series. The relationship between functional network architectures recovered from these 2 types of neural activity remains unknown. Here, we map electromagnetic networks (measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG)) to haemodynamic networks (measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)). We find that the relationship between the 2 modalities is regionally heterogeneous and systematically follows the cortical hierarchy, with close correspondence in unimodal cortex and poor correspondence in transmodal cortex. Comparison with the BigBrain histological atlas reveals that electromagnetic‚Äìhaemodynamic coupling is driven by laminar differentiation and neuron density, suggesting that the mapping between the 2 modalities can be explained by cytoarchitectural variation. Importantly, haemodynamic connectivity cannot be explained by electromagnetic activity in a single frequency band, but rather arises from the mixing of multiple neurophysiological rhythms. Correspondence between the two is largely driven by MEG functional connectivity at the beta (15 to 29 Hz) frequency band. Collectively, these findings demonstrate highly organized but only partly overlapping patterns of connectivity in MEG and fMRI functional networks, opening fundamentally new avenues for studying the relationship between cortical microarchitecture and multimodal connectivity patterns.

Children typically experience more mild symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) when compared to adults. There is a strong body of evidence that children are also less susceptible to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with the ancestral viral isolate. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) has been associated with an increased number of pediatric infections. Whether this is the result of widespread adult vaccination or fundamental changes in the biology of SARS-CoV-2 remain to be determined. Here, we use primary nasal epithelial cells (NECs) from children and adults, differentiated at an air‚Äìliquid interface to show that the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 replicates to significantly lower titers in the NECs of children compared to those of adults. This was associated with a heightened antiviral response to SARS-CoV-2 in the NECs of children. Importantly, the Delta variant also replicated to significantly lower titers in the NECs of children. This trend was markedly less pronounced in the case of Omicron. It is also striking to note that, at least in terms of viral RNA, Omicron replicated better in pediatric NECs compared to both Delta and the ancestral virus. Taken together, these data show that the nasal epithelium of children supports lower infection and replication of ancestral SARS-CoV-2, although this may be changing as the virus evolves.

Galanin is a neuropeptide expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it regulates various processes including neuroendocrine release, cognition, and nerve regeneration. Three G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) for galanin have been discovered, which is the focus of efforts to treat diseases including Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, anxiety, and addiction. To understand the basis of the ligand preferences of the receptors and to assist structure-based drug design, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to solve the molecular structure of GALR2 bound to galanin and a cognate heterotrimeric G-protein, providing a molecular view of the neuropeptide binding site. Mutant proteins were assayed to help reveal the basis of ligand specificity, and structural comparison between the activated GALR2 and inactive hŒ≤<sub>2</sub>AR was used to relate galanin binding to the movements of transmembrane (TM) helices and the G-protein interface.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The fibro‚Äê and cyto‚Äêarchitecture demarcating the border between the dentate gyrus and CA3 in sheep (Ovis aries) and domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampal formation is essential for spatial navigation and episodic memory. The anatomical structure is largely similar across mammalian species, apart from the deep polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus and the adjacent part of cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) which feature substantial variations. In rodents, the polymorphic layer has a triangular cross-section abutting on the end of the CA3 pyramidal layer, while in primates it is long and band-shaped capping the expanded CA3 end, which here lacks a distinct pyramidal layer. This structural variation has resulted in a confusing nomenclature and unclear anatomical criteria for the definition of the dentate-ammonic border. Seeking to clarify the border, we present here a light microscopic investigation based on Golgi-impregnated and Timm‚Äìthionin-stained sections of the Artiodactyla sheep and domestic pig, in which the dentate gyrus and CA3 end have some topographical features in common with primates. In short, the band-shaped polymorphic layer coincides with the Timm-positive mossy fiber collateral plexus and the Timm-negative subgranular zone. While the soma and excrescence-covered proximal dendrites of the mossy cells are localized within the plexus, the peripheral mossy cell dendrites extend outside the plexus, both into the granular and molecular layers, and the CA3. The main mossy fibers leave the collateral plexus in a scattered formation to converge gradually through the CA3 end in between the dispersed pyramidal cells, which are of three subtypes, as in monkey, with the classical apical subtype dominating near the hidden blade, the nonapical subtype near the exposed blade, and the dentate subtype being the only pyramidal cells that extend dendrites into the dentate gyrus. In agreement with our previous study in mink, the findings show that the border between the dentate gyrus and the CA3 end can be more accurately localized by the mossy fiber system than by cyto-architecture alone.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Rhesus macaque versus rat divergence in the corticospinal projectome</a></h4>

              
                Sinopoulou et¬†al. map the entire projection network of the corticospinal motor system in rats and monkeys, including all collaterals. They find extensive corticospinal collateralization in rats yet far more direct corticospinal convergence on the spinal cord in monkeys. These findings have important implications for translational research.

Here the authors provide an integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis of mouse and marmoset neocortical neuronal classes. Pan-neuronal programs active during early development are more evolutionary conserved but not neuron-specific, whereas pan-neuronal programs active during later stages of maturation are more neuron- and species-specific.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hypoxia-induced proteasomal degradation of DBC1 by SIAH2 in breast cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                DBC1 has been characterized as a key regulator of physiological and pathophysiological activities, such as DNA damage, senescence and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism by which the functional stability of DBC1 is regulated has yet to be elucidated. Here, we report that the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of DBC1 is regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH2 and deubiquitinase OTUD5 under hypoxic stress. Mechanistically, hypoxia promoted DBC1 to interact with SIAH2 but not OTUD5, resulting in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of DBC1 through the ubiquitin‚Äìproteasome pathway. <i>SIAH2</i> knockout inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration, which could be rescued by double knockout of <i>SIAH2/CCAR2</i>. Human tissue microarray analysis further revealed that the SIAH2/DBC1 axis was responsible for tumor progression under hypoxic stress. These findings define a key role of the hypoxia-mediated SIAH2-DBC1 pathway in the progression of human breast cancer and provide novel insights into the metastatic mechanism of breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Prolonged Œ≤-adrenergic stimulation disperses ryanodine receptor clusters in cardiomyocytes</a></h4>

              
                Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs) exhibit dynamic arrangements in cardiomyocytes, and we previously showed that 'dispersion' of RyR clusters disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during heart failure (HF) (Kolstad <i>et al.</i>, eLife, 2018). Here, we investigated whether prolonged Œ≤-adrenergic stimulation, a hallmark of HF, promotes RyR cluster dispersion, and examined the underlying mechanisms. We observed that treatment of healthy rat cardiomyocytes with isoproterenol for 1 hour triggered progressive fragmentation of RyR clusters. Pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII reversed these effects, while cluster dispersion was reproduced by specific activation of CaMKII, and in mice with constitutively active Ser2814-RyR. A similar role of protein kinase A (PKA) in promoting RyR cluster fragmentation was established by employing PKA activation or inhibition. Progressive cluster dispersion was linked to declining Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark fidelity and magnitude, and slowed release kinetics from Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation between more numerous RyR clusters. In healthy cells, this served to dampen the stimulatory actions of Œ≤-adrenergic stimulation over the longer term, and protect against pro-arrhythmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. However, during HF, RyR dispersion was linked to impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Thus, RyR localization and function are intimately linked via channel phosphorylation by both CaMKII and PKA which, while finely tuned in healthy cardiomyocytes, underlies impaired cardiac function during pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The unmitigated profile of COVID-19 infectiousness</a></h4>

              
                Quantifying the temporal dynamics of infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for understanding the spread of COVID-19 and for evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Many studies have estimated the infectiousness profile using observed serial intervals. However, statistical and epidemiological biases could lead to underestimation of the duration of infectiousness. We correct for these biases by curating data from the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China (when mitigation was minimal), and find that the infectiousness profile of the original strain is longer than previously thought. Sensitivity analysis shows our results are robust to model structure, assumed growth rate and potential observational biases. Although unmitigated transmission data is lacking for variants of concern (VOC), previous analyses suggest that the alpha and delta variants have faster within-host kinetics, which we extrapolate to crude estimates of variant-specific unmitigated generation intervals. Knowing the unmitigated infectiousness profile of infected individuals can inform estimates of the effectiveness of isolation and quarantine measures. The framework presented here can help design better quarantine policies in early stages of future epidemics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanism of the cadherin-catenin F-actin catch bond interaction</a></h4>

              
                Mechanotransduction at cell-cell adhesions is crucial for the structural integrity, organization, and morphogenesis of epithelia. At cell-cell junctions, ternary E-cadherin/Œ≤-catenin/Œ±E-catenin complexes sense and transmit mechanical load by binding to F-actin. The interaction with F-actin, described as a two-state catch bond, is weak in solution but is strengthened by applied force due to force-dependent transitions between weak and strong actin-binding states. Here, we provide direct evidence from optical trapping experiments that the catch bond property principally resides in the Œ±E-catenin actin-binding domain (ABD). Consistent with our previously proposed model, deletion of the first helix of the five-helix ABD bundle enables stable interactions with F-actin under minimal load that are well-described by a single-state slip bond, even when Œ±E-catenin is complexed with Œ≤-catenin and E-cadherin. Our data argue for a conserved catch bond mechanism for adhesion proteins with structurally similar ABDs. We also demonstrate that a stably bound ABD strengthens load-dependent binding interactions between a neighboring complex and F-actin, but the presence of the other Œ±E-catenin domains weakens this effect. These results provide mechanistic insight to the cooperative binding of the cadherin-catenin complex to F-actin, which regulate dynamic cytoskeletal linkages in epithelial tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microscopic colitis: Etiopathology, diagnosis, and rational management</a></h4>

              
                Microscopic colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease divided into two subtypes: collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis. With an increasing incidence of microscopic colitis exceeding those of ulcerative and Crohn‚Äôs disease among elderly people in some countries, microscopic colitis is a debilitating life experience. Therefore, physicians should be familiar with its clinical features and management strategies because the disease deserves the same attention as the classical inflammatory bowel diseases. Here, state-of-the-art knowledge of microscopic colitis is provided from a global perspective with reference to etiopathology and how to establish the diagnosis with the overall aim to create awareness and improve rational management in clinical practice. The immune system and a dysregulated immune response seem to play a key role combined with risk factors (e.g. cigarette smoking) in genetically predisposed individuals. The symptoms are characterized by recurrent or chronic nonbloody, watery diarrhea, urgency, weight loss, and a female preponderance. As biomarkers are absent, the diagnosis relies on colonoscopy with a histological assessment of biopsy specimens from all parts of the colon. Although the disease is not associated with a risk of colorectal cancer, a recent nationwide, population-based cohort study found an increased risk of lymphoma and lung cancer. Budesonide is the first-line therapy for management, whereas immunomodulatory drugs (including biologics) and drugs with antidiarrheal properties may be indicated in those failing, dependent, or intolerant to budesonide. In microscopic colitis induced by checkpoint inhibitors, a drug class used increasingly for a wide range of malignancies, a more aggressive therapeutic approach with biologics introduced early seems reasonable. However, particular attention needs to be drawn to the existence of incomplete forms of microscopic colitis with the risk of being overlooked in routine clinical settings.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Enteroendocrine cell types that drive food reward and aversion</a></h4>

              
                Animals must learn through experience which foods are nutritious and should be consumed, and which are toxic and should be avoided. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are the principal chemosensors in the GI tract, but investigation of their role in behavior has been limited by the difficulty of selectively targeting these cells in vivo. Here we describe an intersectional genetic approach for manipulating EEC subtypes in behaving mice. We show that multiple EEC subtypes inhibit food intake but have different effects on learning. Conditioned flavor preference is driven by release of cholecystokinin whereas conditioned taste aversion is mediated by serotonin and substance P. These positive and negative valence signals are transmitted by vagal and spinal afferents, respectively. These findings establish a cellular basis for how chemosensing in the gut drives learning about food.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure-activity relationships of mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptide pharmacological compounds</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria play a central role in metabolic homeostasis, and dysfunction of this organelle underpins the etiology of many heritable and aging-related diseases. Tetrapeptides with alternating cationic and aromatic residues such as SS-31 (elamipretide) show promise as therapeutic compounds for mitochondrial disorders. In this study, we conducted a quantitative structure-activity analysis of three alternative tetrapeptide analogs, benchmarked against SS-31, that differ with respect to aromatic side chain composition and sequence register. We present the first structural models for this class of compounds, obtained with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics approaches, showing that all analogs except for SS-31 form compact reverse turn conformations in the membrane-bound state. All peptide analogs bound cardiolipin-containing membranes, yet they had significant differences in equilibrium binding behavior and membrane interactions. Notably, analogs had markedly different effects on membrane surface charge, supporting a mechanism in which modulation of membrane electrostatics is a key feature of their mechanism of action. The peptides had no strict requirement for side chain composition or sequence register to permeate cells and target mitochondria in mammalian cell culture assays. All four peptides were pharmacologically active in serum withdrawal cell stress models yet showed significant differences in their abilities to restore mitochondrial membrane potential, preserve ATP content, and promote cell survival. Within our peptide set, the analog containing tryptophan side chains, SPN10, had the strongest impact on most membrane properties and showed greatest efficacy in cell culture studies. Taken together, these results show that side chain composition and register influence the activity of these mitochondria-targeted peptides, helping provide a framework for the rational design of next-generation therapeutics with enhanced potency.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of multiple omics approaches to define pathophysiology of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS), though both common and deadly in critically ill children, lacks targeted therapies. The development of effective pharmacotherapies has been limited, in part, by lack of clarity about the pathobiology of pediatric ARDS. Epithelial lung injury, vascular endothelial activation, and systemic immune activation are putative drivers of this complex disease process. Prior studies have used either hypothesis-driven (e.g., candidate genes and proteins, in vitro investigations) or unbiased (e.g., genome-wide association, transcriptomic, metabolomic) approaches to predict clinical outcomes and to define subphenotypes. Advances in multiple omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have permitted more comprehensive investigation of PARDS pathobiology. However, omics studies have been limited in children compared to adults, and analyses across multiple tissue types are lacking. Here, we synthesized existing literature on the molecular mechanism of PARDS, summarized our interrogation of publicly available genomic databases to determine the association of candidate genes with PARDS phenotypes across multiple tissues and cell types, and integrated recent studies that used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We conclude that novel profiling methods such as scRNA-seq, which permits more comprehensive, unbiased evaluation of pathophysiological mechanisms across tissue and cell types, should be employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PRDS toward the goal of identifying targeted therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large vesicle extrusion from C. elegans neurons requires phagocytic interaction via the ARF-6 and CED-1/DRAPER pathways</a></h4>

              
                C. elegans neurons under stress can produce giant vesicles, several microns in diameter, called exophers. Current models suggest that exophers are neuroprotective, providing a mechanism for stressed neurons to eject toxic protein aggregates and organelles. However, little is known of the fate of the exopher once it leaves the neuron. We found that exophers produced by mechanosensory neurons in C. elegans are engulfed by surrounding hypodermal skin cells, and are then broken up into numerous smaller vesicles that acquire hypodermal phagosome maturation markers, with vesicular contents gradually degraded by hypodermal lysosomes. Consistent with the hypodermis acting as an exopher phagocyte, we found that the hypodermal plasma membrane adjacent to newly formed exophers surrounds the exopher and accumulates F-actin. Efficient fission of engulfed exopher-phagosomes to produce smaller vesicles and degrade their contents required phagosome maturation factors SAND-1/Mon1, GTPase RAB-35, the CNT-1 ARF-GAP, and microtubule motor associated GTPase ARL-8, suggesting a close coupling of phagosome fission and phagosome maturation. Lysosome activity was required to degrade exopher contents in the hypodermis but not for exopher-phagosome resolution into smaller vesicles. Importantly, we found that GTPase ARF-6 and effector SEC-10/Exocyst activity in the hypodermis, along with the CED-1 phagocytic receptor, is required for efficient production of exophers by the neuron. Our results indicate that the neuron requires specific interaction with the phagocyte for an efficient exopher response, a mechanistic feature potentially conserved with mammalian exophergenesis, and similar to neuronal pruning by phagocytic glia that influences neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging the columnar functional organization of human area MT+ to axis-of-motion stimuli using VASO at 7 Tesla</a></h4>

              
                Cortical columns of direction-selective neurons in the motion sensitive area (MT) have been successfully established as a microscopic feature of the neocortex in animals. The same property has been investigated at mesoscale (<1mm) in the homologous brain area (hMT+) in living humans by using ultra-high field fMRI. Despite the reproducibility of the selective response to axis-of-motion stimuli, clear quantitative evidence for the columnar organization of hMT+ is still lacking. Using cerebral blood volume (CBV)-sensitive fMRI at 7 Tesla with submillimeter resolution and high spatial specificity to microvasculature, we investigate the columnar functional organization of hMT+ (V5) in 5 participants perceiving axis-of-motion stimuli for both blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and vascular space occupancy (VASO) contrast mechanisms provided by the used Slab-Selective Slice Inversion (SS-SI)-VASO sequence. With the development of a new searchlight-like algorithm for column detection, we provide the first quantitative columnarity map that characterizes the entire 3D hMT+ volume. We demonstrate the advantage of using CBV-sensitive fMRI to detect mesoscopic cortical features by showing, through our new voxel-wise measures of sensitivity and specificity, the higher specificity of axis-of-motion cortical columns detected by VASO compared to BOLD contrast. These voxel-wise metrics also provide further insights on how to mitigate the highly debated draining veins effect. We conclude that using CBV-VASO fMRI together with voxel-wise measurements of sensitivity, specificity and columnarity offers a promising avenue to quantify the mesoscopic organization of hMT+ with respect to axis-of-motion stimuli. Furthermore, our approach and methodological developments are generalizable and applicable to other human brain areas where similar mesoscopic research questions are addressed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Complement-dependent loss of inhibitory synapses on pyramidal neurons following Toxoplasma gondii infection</a></h4>

              
                The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii has developed mechanisms to establish a central nervous system infection in virtually all warm-blooded animals. Acute T. gondii infection can cause neuroinflammation, encephalitis, and seizures. Meanwhile, studies in humans, non-human primates, and rodents have linked chronic T. gondii infection with altered behavior and increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. We previously demonstrated that T. gondii infection triggers the loss of perisomatic inhibitory synapses, an important source of inhibition on excitatory pyramidal cells, and a type of synapse that is disrupted in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Similar to other instances of inflammation and neurodegeneration, we showed that phagocytic cells (including microglia and infiltrating monocytes) contribute to the loss of these inhibitory synapses. However, in the case of T. gondii-induced synapse loss, phagocytic cells target and ensheath the cell bodies of telencephalic neurons. Here, we show that these phagocytic cells specifically ensheath excitatory pyramidal neurons, leading to the preferential loss of perisomatic synapses on these neurons. In contrast, inhibitory cortical interneuron subtypes are not extensively ensheathed by phagocytic cells following infection. Moreover, we show that infection induces expression of complement C3 protein by these excitatory neurons and that C3 is required for the loss of perisomatic inhibitory synapses, albeit not through activation of the classical complement pathway. Together, these findings provide evidence that T. gondii infection induces changes in excitatory pyramidal neurons that trigger selective removal of inhibitory perisomatic synapses in the infected neocortex and provide a novel role for complement in remodeling of inhibitory circuits in the infected brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Laminar VASO fMRI in focal hand dystonia patients</a></h4>

              
                Focal Hand Dystonia (FHD) is a disabling movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements, cramps and spasms. It is associated with pathological neural microcircuits in the cortical somatosensory system. While invasive preclinical modalities allow researchers to probe specific neural microcircuits of cortical layers and columns, conventional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) cannot resolve such small neural computational units. In this study, we take advantage of recent developments in ultra-high-field MRI hardware and MR-sequences to capture altered digit representations and laminar processing in FHD patients. We aim to characterize the capability and challenges of layer-specific imaging and analysis tools in resolving laminar and columnar structures in clinical research setups. We scanned N=4 affected and N=5 unaffected hemispheres at 7T and found consistent results of altered neural microcircuitry in FHD patients: a) In affected hemispheres of FHD patients, we found a breakdown of ordered finger representation in the primary somatosensory cortex, as suggested from previous low-resolution fMRI. b) In affected primary motor cortices of FHD patients, we furthermore found increased fMRI activity in superficial cortico-cortical neural input layers (II/III), compared to relatively weaker activity in the cortico-spinal output layers (Vb/VI). Overall, we show that layer-fMRI acquisition and analysis tools are applicable to address clinically-driven neuroscience research questions about altered computational mechanisms at the spatial scales that were previously only accessible in animal models. We believe that this study paves the way for easier translation of preclinical work into clinical research in focal hand dystonia and beyond.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unmet Expectations About Material Properties Delay Perceptual Decisions</a></h4>

              
                Based on our expectations about material properties we can implicitly predict an object's future states, e.g. a wine glass falling down will break when it hits the ground. How these expectations affect relatively low level perceptual decisions, however, has not been systematically studied previously. To seek an answer to this question we conducted a behavioral experiment using animations of various familiar objects (e.g. key, wine glass etc.) freely falling and hitting the ground. During a training session participants first built expectations about the dynamic properties of those objects. Half of the participants (N=28) built expectations consistent with our daily lives (e.g. a key bounces rigidly), whereas the other half learned an anomalous behavior (e.g. a key wobbles). This was followed by experimental sessions, in which expectations were unmet in 20% of the trials. In both training and experimental sessions, participants' task was to report whether the objects broke or not upon hitting the ground. Critically a specific object always remained intact or broke, only the manner with which it did so differed. For example, a key could wobble or remain rigid, but it never broke. We found that participants' reaction times were longer when expectations were unmet even when those expectations were anomalous and learned during the training session. Furthermore, we found an interplay between long-term and newly learned expectations, which could be predicted by a Bayesian updating approach. Overall, our results show that expectations about material properties can have an impact on relatively low-level perceptual decision making processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid Color Categorization in the Brain Revealed by Frequency-tagging-based EEG</a></h4>

              
                The origin of color categories has been debated extensively. Linguistic relativists claim that color categories are shaped by the language we speak and that color terms subsequently affect our perception of color, while universalists postulate that color categories are independent of language and formed based on perceptual mechanisms. Our study adopted a sensitive frequency-tagging-based EEG paradigm where the color stimuli were presented sequentially at a fast speed of 10 Hz (SOA: 100 ms) to probe fast, feedforward processing of color categories. We showed that EEG responses to cross-category oddball colors at the frequency where the oddball stimuli were presented was significantly larger than the responses to within-category oddball colors. This finding suggested that the categories of color stimuli were likely to be encoded automatically and in a feedforward manner, as the color stimuli were only briefly flashed and irrelevant to the task. The findings support the view that the categorical processing of color emerges at the early perceptual stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological signature of the interplay between habits and inhibition in response to smoking-related cues in individuals with a smoking habit: an ERP study</a></h4>

              
                The rigid, stimulus-bound nature of drug seeking that characterizes Substance-use disorder (SUD) has been related to a dysregulation of motivational and early attentional reflexive and inhibitory reflective systems. However, the mechanisms by which these systems are engaged by drug-paired conditioned stimuli CSs) when they promote the enactment of seeking habits in individuals with a SUD have not been elucidated. The present study aimed behaviorally and electrophysiologically to characterize the nature of the interaction between the reflexive and reflective systems recruited by CSs in individuals with a smoking habit. For this, we measured the behavioral performance and associated ERPs of 20 individuals with a smoking habit and 20 controls, who never smoked regularly, in a modified Go/NoGo task during which smoking-related CSs, appetitive, and neutral pictures, presented either in first-person or as a third-person visual perspective were displayed 250 ms before the Go/NoGo cue. We show that smoking-related cues selectively influence early incentive motivation-related attentional bias (N2 after picture onset), motor readiness and behavioral inhibition (Go-P3, NoGo-P3 and Pc) of individuals with a smoking habit only when presented from a first-person perspective. These data together identify the neural signature of the aberrant engagement of the reflexive and reflective systems during the recruitment of an incentive habit by CSs presented as if they had been response-produced, i.e., as conditioned reinforcers.

                Understanding the patterns of changes in brain function and structure under the influence of various disorders is of utmost importance. There have been numerous efforts towards successful biomarker discovery for complex brain disorders by utilizing neuroimaging datasets accompanied by analytical frameworks. However, due to the multi-faceted nature of the disorders involving a wide and overlapping range of symptoms as well as complex changes in structural and functional brain networks, it is increasingly important to devise computational frameworks that can take into account underlying patterns of heterogeneous changes with specific target assessments, at the same time producing a summarizing output from the high-dimensional neuroimaging data. While various machine learning approaches focus on diagnostic frameworks, many learning frameworks have been utilized to break down the neuroimaging features into lower dimensional components using unsupervised methods, as well as to analyze important features at the level of brain regions involved in prediction using supervised methods. However, most frameworks either do not take into account the target assessment information while extracting brain subspaces, or are able to extract only higher dimensional importance associations as an ordered list of involved features, making manual interpretation at the level of subspaces difficult. We present a novel multimodal active subspace learning framework to understand various subspaces within the brain that are associated with changes in particular biological and cognitive traits. Our framework decomposes the multimodal feature importances associated with a battery of biological and cognitive assessments to extract robust multimodal subspaces that define the highest change in a given assessment. Through a repeated sub-sampling procedure on an Alzheimer's dataset, we show that our framework is able to extract subspaces covering both functional and structural modalities, which are specific to a given group assessment and also retain predictive performance in standard machine learning algorithms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Basolateral amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, but not dorsal hippocampus, are necessary for the control of reward-seeking by occasion setters</a></h4>

              
                Reward-seeking in the world is driven by cues that can have ambiguous predictive and motivational value. To produce adaptive, flexible reward-seeking it is necessary to exploit occasion setters, other distinct features in the environment, to resolve the ambiguity of Pavlovian reward-paired cues. Despite this, very little research has investigated the neurobiological underpinnings of occasion setting and as a result little is known about which brain regions are critical for occasion setting. To address this, we exploited a recently developed task that was amenable to neurobiological inquiry where a conditioned stimulus is only predictive of reward delivery if preceded in time by the non-overlapping presentation of a separate cue - an occasion setter. This task required male rats to maintain and link cue-triggered expectations across time to produce adaptive reward-seeking. We interrogated the contributions of the basolateral amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex to occasion setting as these regions are thought to be critical for the computation and exploitation of state value, respectively. Reversible inactivation of either structure prior to the occasion-setting task resulted in a profound inability of rats to use the occasion setter to guide reward seeking. In contrast, inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus, a region fundamental for context-specific responding was without effect nor did inactivation of the basolateral amygdala or orbitofrontal cortex in a standard Pavlovian conditioning preparation affect conditioned responding. We conclude that neural activity within the orbitofrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala circuit is necessary to update and resolve ambiguity in the environment to promote cue-driven reward-seeking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical dynamics of speech feedback control in non-fluent Primary Progressive Aphasia</a></h4>

              
                Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which patients progressively lose speech and language abilities. The non-fluent variant of PPA (nfvPPA) is characterised by impaired motor speech and agrammatism. To date, no study in nfvPPA patients has either examined speech motor control behaviour or imaged the speech motor control network during vocal production. Here, we did this using a novel structure-function imaging approach integrating magnetoencephalographic imaging of neural oscillations with voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We examined task-induced non-phase-locked neural oscillatory activity during a vocal motor control task, where participants were prompted to phonate the vowel /[a]/ for ~2.4s while the pitch of their auditory feedback was shifted either up or down by 100 cents for a period of 400ms mid-utterance. Participants were 18 nfvPPA patients (14 female, mean age = 67.79 +/- 8.02 years) and 17 controls (13 female, mean age = 64.81 +/- 5.76 years). Patients showed a smaller compensation response to pitch perturbation than controls (p < 0.05). Task-induced neural oscillations across five frequency bands were reconstructed in source space for each subject during pitch feedback perturbation. Patients exhibited reduced task-induced alpha-band (8-12Hz) neural activity unrelated to their atrophy patterns, in the right temporal lobe and the right temporoparietal junction (p < 0.01) from 250ms to 750ms after pitch perturbation onset. Patients also showed increased task-induced beta-band (12-30Hz) activity also unrelated to cortical atrophy in the left dorsal sensorimotor cortex, left premotor cortex and the left supplementary motor area (p < 0.01) from 50ms to 150ms after pitch perturbation onset. Reduced average alpha-band power at the peak voxel in the temporoparietal cluster in the right hemisphere could predict speech motor impairment in patients ({beta} = 3.41, F = 8.31, p = 0.0128) whereas increased average beta-band power at the peak voxel in the left dorsal sensorimotor cluster could not ({beta} = -1.75, F = 1.72, p = 0.2123). Collectively, these results suggest significant disruption in sensorimotor integration during vocal production in nfvPPA patients which occurs unrelated to patterns of atrophy. These findings highlight how multimodal structure-function imaging in PPA enhances our understanding of its pathophysiological sequelae.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Graph lesion-deficit mapping of fluid intelligence</a></h4>

              
                Fluid intelligence is arguably the defining feature of human cognition. Yet the nature of its relationship with the brain remains a contentious topic. Influential proposals drawing primarily on functional imaging data have implicated "multiple demand" frontoparietal and more widely distributed cortical networks, but extant lesion-deficit studies with greater causal power are almost all small, methodologically constrained, and inconclusive. The task demands large samples of patients, comprehensive investigation of performance, fine-grained anatomical mapping, and robust lesion-deficit inference, yet to be brought to bear on it. We assessed 165 healthy controls and 227 frontal or non-frontal patients with unilateral brain lesions on the best-established test of fluid intelligence, Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, employing an array of lesion-deficit inferential models responsive to the potentially distributed nature of fluid intelligence. Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block models were used to reveal the community structure of lesion deficit networks, disentangling functional from confounding pathological distributed effects. Impaired performance was confined to patients with frontal lesions (F(2,387) = 18.491; p < .001; frontal worse than non-frontal and healthy participants p < .01; p <.001), more marked on the right than left (F(4,385) = 12.237; p < .001; right worse than left and healthy participants p<.01; p<.001). Patients with non-frontal lesions were indistinguishable from controls and showed no modulation by laterality. Neither the presence nor the extent of multiple demand network involvement affected performance. Both conventional network-based statistics and non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling heavily implicated the right frontal lobe. Crucially, this localisation was confirmed on explicitly disentangling functional from pathology-driven effects within a layered stochastic block model, prominently highlighting a right frontal network involving middle and inferior frontal gyrus, pre- and post-central gyri, with a weak contribution from right superior parietal lobule. Similar results were obtained with standard lesion-deficit analyses. Our study represents the first large-scale investigation of the distributed neural substrates of fluid intelligence in the focally injured brain. Combining novel graph-based lesion-deficit mapping with detailed investigation of cognitive performance in a large sample of patients provides crucial information about the neural basis of intelligence. Our findings indicate that a set of predominantly right frontal regions, rather than a more widely distributed network, is critical to the high-level functions involved in fluid intelligence. Further they suggest that Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices is a useful clinical index of fluid intelligence and a sensitive marker of right frontal lobe dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The 3D Structural Architecture of the Human Hand Area is Non-Topographic</a></h4>

              
                The functional topography of the human primary somatosensory cortex (S1) hand area is a widely studied model system to understand sensory organization and plasticity. It is so far unclear whether or not the underlying 3D structural architecture also shows a topographic organization. We used 7T MRI data to quantify layer-specific myelin, iron and mineralization in relation to population receptive field maps of individual finger representations. This 3D description allowed us to identify a characteristic profile of layer-specific myelin and iron deposition in the S1 hand area, but revealed an absence of structural differences between individual finger representations, and an absence of low-myelin borders between individual fingers. Both, however, were detected between the hand and the face areas. Using markers of responsivity, precision and sensorimotor integration, we additionally phenotyped these microstructural features with respect to their relation to BOLD signal change and behavior. We conclude that the 3D structural architecture of the human hand area is non-topographic, other than in some monkey species, which suggests a high degree of flexibility for functional finger organization and plasticity in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parametric modulation of the blink reflex provides an individual difference measure of trigeminal sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                The trigeminal blink response is a familiar and easily evoked brainstem reflex. Despite a long history of clinical and research investigation, there has been limited study of how parametric manipulation of the intensity of somatosensory stimulation modulates the evoked response. The goal of this study was to measure the psychometric trigeminal sensitivity function and to test the resulting model parameters for differences between the eyelids contralateral and ipsilateral to the side of stimulation, and to test for individual differences in sensitivity. We measured the ipsilateral and contralateral blink in 17 healthy, adult participants in response to airpuffs delivered to the cornea over a range of five, log-spaced intensities (3.5 - 60 PSI). The temporal lid position vector was decomposed into amplitude, velocity, and shape components. We found that variation in blink amplitude was well fit with a two-parameter Weibull cumulative density function of log stimulus intensity. There was a reliable decrease in threshold sensitivity of the contralateral as compared to ipsilateral eyelid. This decrease was consistent across participants despite substantial individual differences in the threshold and slope of the overall sensitivity function, suggesting that the laterality effect arises subsequent to individual differences in the neural circuit. We conclude that a parametric measure of trigeminal sensitivity is a promising tool for examining neural mechanisms that modulate this response, including in various disease states.

                We perform microelectrode array recordings of neonatal chick retina explants and report stimulus-dependent response properties of different retinal ganglion cell types to various luminance and contrast adaptation conditions. The isolated single units indicate wavelength-sensitive response properties of most of the putative retinal ganglion cells recorded. Responses to different luminance and contrast conditions were investigated as a function of wavelength indicating a combination of adaptation and sensitization features. We also demonstrate the presence of color opponency between blue (450 nm) and green (530 nm) light input. The analysis of their STA profiles to the full field random gaussian flicker stimulus reveals a green ON/blue OFF RGC type and a blue ON/green OFF RGC type.

                Pyramidal neurons, a mainstay of cortical regions, receive a plethora of inputs from various areas onto their morphologically distinct apical and basal trees. Both trees differentially contribute to the somatic response, defining distinct anatomical and possibly functional sub-units. To elucidate the contribution of each tree to the encoding of visual stimuli at the somatic level, we modeled the response pattern of a L2/3 V1 pyramidal neuron to orientation-tuned synaptic input. Towards this goal, we used a morphologically detailed computational model of a single cell, validated against electrophysiological and two-photon imaging data. Our simulations predict a synergistic effect of apical and basal trees on somatic action potential generation: basal tree activity, in the form of either depolarization or dendritic spiking, is necessary for producing somatic activity, despite the fact that most somatic spikes are heavily driven by apical dendritic spikes. This model provides evidence for synergistic computations taking place in the basal and apical trees of the L2/3 V1 neuron and emphasizes the potential role of predictive and attentional feedback input in these cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Effects of Depression on The Neural Correlates of Reward Sensitivity in Poverty</a></h4>

              
                Existing studies have identified that depression and depressive symptoms are associated with reduced sensitivity to feedback processing, which is a core ability that determine the success of human actions. However, a key individual difference which is the socioeconomic status (SES) has been largely ignored in this field because the recent trend of research has suggested how it relates to various cognitive domain specific neural systems. Because depression is a widespread mental health condition that is more prevalent among the poor, it can potentially play a role in the association between poverty and the feedback processing. With a sample of 80 adults recruited from low to high-income communities, the current study examined the role of depression on the relationship between poverty and feedback processing by using feedback negativity (FN) event-related potential (ERP), which is a well-known ERP component that is indexed by response feedback indicating losses versus gains. Consistent with previous studies, high depressive symptoms were associated with reduced FN amplitude across our sample. SES was negatively associated with FN and depressive symptoms which indicates reduced reward sensitivity to feedback among the low-SES individuals who are also mostly depressed. However, no association between SES and reward sensitivity was observed when it was controlled for depression. Findings in this study suggests the importance of partial out the variance accounted for by depression when studying responses to reward sensitivity in poverty.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pair housing does not alter incubation of craving, extinction, and reinstatement after heroin self-administration in female and male rats</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Evidence suggests that single housing in rats acts as a chronic stressor, raising the possibilities that it contributes to measures of heroin craving and that pair housing ameliorates such measures. Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether pair housing after heroin self-administration reduces the incubation of craving, extinction, and reinstatement of heroin seeking. Methods: Single-housed female and male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent daily 6-h heroin self-administration, wherein active lever presses produced a heroin infusion paired with light/tone cues. One d after self-administration, rats underwent a baseline cued-seeking test wherein active lever presses only produced light/tone cues. Immediately following this cued-seeking test, rats were either pair-housed with a weight- and sex-matched naive rat or remained single-housed for the rest of the study. For 14 d, rats remained in their homecages, after which they underwent a cued-seeking test to assess the incubation of craving compared to their baseline test. Rats then underwent extinction sessions followed by cue-induced and heroin-primed reinstatements. Results: The findings reveal that pair-housed rats did not differ from single-housed rats in terms of the incubation of craving, extinction, or reinstatement of heroin seeking. Additionally, the results did not reveal any evidence of sex-based differences in the study. Conclusions: The present work indicates that pair housing during the forced abstinence period does not alter measures of heroin craving/seeking. These findings suggest that the chronic stress of single housing specifically during forced abstinence does not contribute to the degree of such measures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The topology of time: transition networks in simulated and real neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Characterizing large-scale dynamic organization of the brain relies on both descriptive and mechanistic modeling. The former often uses the language of statistical dependency, and the latter uses that of dynamical systems. The conceptual translation between the two is not straightforward. The present work aims to provide a conceptual bridge between descriptive and mechanistic modeling via a computational framework. In particular, we focus on fMRI-based and -targeted modeling of large-scale brain dynamics in humans. We conceptualize brain dynamics as a complex landscape continuously modulated by internal and external changes (e.g., arousal level, task conditions). The modulation can induce transitions between one stable brain state (attractor) to another. We provide a method to retrieve the network of transitions between relevant attractors from time-series data alone. For theoretical validation of our approach, we first use a biophysical network model to induce transitions in a controlled manner, which provides simulated time series equipped with a ground-truth attractor transition network. Building on existing works in the field of Topological Data Analysis, we develop a computational tool, named the Temporal Mapper, that reconstructs the ground-truth transition network from simulated time-series data better than existing time-varying approaches. For empirical relevance, we later apply our Temporal Mapper approach to human fMRI data gathered during a continuous multitask experiment. We found that occupancy of the high-degree nodes and cycles of the transition network was significantly associated with subjects' behavioral performance. Taken together, we provide an important first step towards integrating descriptive and mechanistic modeling of brain dynamics.

	<p>Tinnitus is the phantom perception of a sound, often accompanied by increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. Degenerative or inflammatory processes, as well as changes in monoaminergic systems, have been suggested as potential underlying mechanisms. Herein, we conducted the first post-mortem histopathological assessment to reveal detailed structural changes in tinnitus patients&amp;amp;rsquo; auditory and non-auditory brain regions. Tissue blocks containing the medial geniculate body (MGB), thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), central part of the inferior colliculus (CIC), and dorsal and obscurus raphe nuclei (DRN and ROb) were obtained from tinnitus patients and matched controls. Cell density and size were assessed in Nissl-stained sections. Astrocytes and microglia were assessed using immunohistochemistry. The DRN was stained using antibodies raised against phenylalanine hydroxylase-8 (PH8) and tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) to visualize serotonergic and dopaminergic cells, respectively. Cell density in the MGB and CIC of tinnitus patients was reduced, accompanied by a reduction in the number of astrocytes in the CIC only. Quantification of cell surface size did not reveal any significant difference in any of the investigated brain regions between groups. The number of PH8-positive cells was reduced in the DRN and ROb of tinnitus patients compared to controls, while the number of TH-positive cells remained unchanged in the DRN. These findings suggest that both neurodegenerative and inflammatory processes in the MGB and CIC underlie the neuropathology of tinnitus. Moreover, the reduced number of serotonergic cell bodies in tinnitus cases points toward a potential role of the raphe serotonergic system in tinnitus.</p>

	<p> Multiple psychosocial interventions to treat ADHD symptoms have been developed and empirically tested. However, no clear recommendations exist regarding the utilization of these interventions for treating core ADHD symptoms across different populations. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis by the CADDRA Guidelines work Group was to generate such recommendations, using recent evidence. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses (MA) from 2010 to 13 February 020 were searched in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, EBM Reviews and CINAHL. Studies of populations with significant levels of comorbidities were excluded. Thirty-one studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (22 RCT, 9 MA) and 24 studies (19 RCT, 5 MA) were included in the quantitative synthesis. Using three-level meta-analyses to pool results of multiple observations from each RCT, as well as four-level meta-analyses to pool results from multiples outcomes and multiple studies of each MA, we generated recommendations using the GRADE approach for: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Physical Exercise and Mind&amp;amp;ndash;Body intervention; Caregiver intervention; School-based and Executive intervention; and other interventions for core ADHD symptoms across Preschooler, Child, Adolescent and Adult populations. The evidence supports a recommendation for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for adults and Caregiver intervention for Children, but not for preschoolers. There were not enough data to provide recommendations for the other types of psychosocial interventions. Our results are in line with previous meta-analytic assessments; however, they provide a more in-depth assessment of the effect of psychosocial intervention on core ADHD symptoms.</p>

	<p>Blood-based proteomic analysis is a routine practice for detecting the biomarkers of human disease. The results obtained from blood alone cannot fully reflect the alterations of nerve cells, including neurons and glia cells, in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) brains. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate novel potential AD biomarker candidates, through an integrated multi-omics approach in AD. We propose a comprehensive strategy to identify high-confidence candidate biomarkers by integrating multi-omics data from AD, including single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets of the prefrontal and entorhinal cortices, as wells as serum proteomic datasets. We first quantified a total of 124,658 nuclei, 8 cell types, and 3701 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from snRNA-seq dataset of 30 human cortices, as well as 1291 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from serum proteomic dataset of 11 individuals. Then, ten DEGs/DEPs (NEBL, CHSY3, STMN2, MARCKS, VIM, FGD4, EPB41L2, PLEKHG1, PTPRZ1, and PPP1R14A) were identified by integration analysis of snRNA-seq and proteomics data. Finally, four novel candidate biomarkers (NEBL, EPB41L2, FGD4, and MARCKS) for AD further stood out, according to bioinformatics analysis, and they were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) verification. These candidate biomarkers are related to the regulation process of the actin cytoskeleton, which is involved in the regulation of synaptic loss in the AD brain tissue. Collectively, this study identified novel cell type-related biomarkers for AD by integrating multi-omics datasets from brains and serum. Our findings provided new targets for the clinical treatment and prognosis of AD.</p>

                The worlds languages differ substantially in their sounds, grammatical rules, and expression of semantic relations. While starting from a shared neural substrate, the developing brain must therefore have the plasticity to accommodate to the specific processing needs of each language. However, there is little research on how language-specific differences impacts brain function and structure. Here, we show that speaking typologically different languages leaves unique traces in the brains white matter connections of monolingual speakers of English (fixed word order language), German (with grammatical marking), and Chinese (tonal language). Using machine learning, we classified with high accuracy the mother tongue based on the participants patterns of structural connectivity obtained with probabilistic tractography. More importantly, connectivity differences between groups could be traced back to relevant processing characteristics of each native tongue. Our results show that the life-long use of a certain language leaves distinct traces in a speakers neural network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expansion Sequencing of RNA Barcoded Neurons in the Mammalian Brain: Progress and Implications for Molecularly Annotated Connectomics</a></h4>

              
                Mapping and molecularly annotating mammalian neural circuits is challenging due to the inability to uniquely label cells while also resolving subcellular features such as synaptic proteins or fine cellular processes. We argue that an ideal technology for connectomics would have the following characteristics: the capacity for robust distance-independent labeling, synaptic resolution, molecular interrogation, and scalable computational methods. The recent development of high-diversity cellular barcoding with RNA has provided a way to overcome the labeling limitations associated with spectral dyes, however performing all-optical circuit mapping has not been demonstrated because no method exists to image barcodes throughout cells at synaptic-resolution. Here we show ExBarSeq, an integrated method combining in situ sequencing of RNA barcodes, immunostaining, and Expansion Microscopy coupled with an end-to-end software pipeline that automatically extracts barcode identities from large imaging datasets without data processing bottlenecks. As a proof of concept, we applied ExBarSeq to thick tissue sections from mice virally infected with MAPseq viral vectors and demonstrated the extraction of 50 barcoded cells in the visual cortex as well as cell morphologies uncovered via immunostaining. The current work demonstrates high resolution multiplexing of exogenous barcodes and endogenous synaptic proteins and outlines a roadmap for molecularly annotated connectomics at a brain-wide scale.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heterogeneous patterns of ventral tegmental area neuronal activity coordinate nucleus accumbens dopamine release</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine release in the ventral striatum is fundamental to adaptive appetitive behavior. Frustratingly, technological, and methodological hurdles have limited the investigation of the mechanisms effecting phasic dopamine release. Although dopamine neuron activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) surely results in dopamine release, how populations of these neurons coordinate their activities in time to modulate the temporal pattern of release remains unclear. Additionally, burgeoning evidence suggests that control over striatal dopamine release is not solely regulated by the burst firing of VTA neurons or even cell-body activation of these neurons. Here, we recorded VTA neurons while monitoring pharmacologically induced phasic dopamine release events in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core) of anesthetized rats. Although changes in putative dopamine neuron firing were, on average, concomitant with the onset of NAc dopamine release events and to the rate of increase of release (first derivative of dopamine concentration), the tuning of individual VTA neurons to dopamine release was notably heterogenous, with subsets of neurons responding prior to release, during release, or at the time of peak release. Others were notably silent during release but active otherwise. Interestingly, both putative dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons expressed this temporally heterogeneous response pattern, and individual cells did not strongly predict the magnitude of dopamine release events. These data suggest that populations of VTA neurons become active at distinct times of a dopamine release event to sculpt the temporal pattern of release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic Targeting of AII Amacrine Cells restores Retinal Computations performed by the Inner Retina</a></h4>

              
                Most inherited retinal dystrophies display progressive photoreceptor cell degeneration leading to severe visual impairment. Optogenetic reactivation of inner retinal neurons is a promising avenue to restore vision in retinas having lost their photoreceptors. Expression of optogenetic proteins in surviving ganglion cells, the retinal output, allows them to take on the lost photoreceptive function. Nonetheless, this creates an exclusively ON retina by expression of depolarizing optogenetic proteins in all classes of ganglion cells, whereas a normal retina extracts several features from the visual scene, with different ganglion cells detecting light increase (ON) and light decrease (OFF). Refinement of this therapeutic strategy should thus aim at restoring these computations. In an attempt to do so, we used a promoter that targets gene expression to a specific interneuron of the retina called the AII amacrine cell. The AII amacrine cell simultaneously activates the ON pathway and inhibits the OFF pathway. We show that the optogenetic stimulation of AII amacrine cells allows restoration of both ON and OFF responses in the retina, but also mediates other types of retinal processing such as sustained and transient responses. Targeting amacrine cells with optogenetics is thus a promising avenue to restore better retinal function and visual perception in patients suffering from retinal degeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrated transcriptome analysis of Huntingtons disease iPSC-derived and mouse astrocytes implicates dysregulated synaptogenesis, actin, and astrocyte maturation</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat within the Huntingtin (HTT) gene having dysregulated cellular homeostasis in the central nervous system, particularly in the striatum and cortex. Astrocytes establish and maintain neuronal functions through the secretion of soluble factors and physical interactions with other neurovascular unit cell types. Under pathological conditions, astrocytes can become reactive, causing cell state transitions that affect brain function. To investigate transitions between cellular states in unaffected and HD astrocytes at high resolution, single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on human HD patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and on striatal and cortical tissue from a rapidly progressing HD mouse model (R6/2). Analysis of HD human and mouse astrocytes revealed both models have alterations in morphology, glutamate uptake, and dysregulation of astrocyte identity and maturation, whereas dysregulated actin-mediated signaling was unique to human iPSC-derived astrocytes. Representative proteins showed altered levels by Western. In both species, HD transcriptional changes reveal potential astrocyte maturation deficits that were potentially driven by astrogliogenesis transcription factors, including ATF3 and NFIA. When perturbed in a drosophila model of HD, knockdown of NFIA in glia rescued the climbing deficit. These data further support the hypothesis that mutant HTT induces dysregulated astrocyte cell states resulting in dysfunctional astrocytic properties, suggests that some of these states are cell autonomous and maybe unique to human HD, and implicate ATF3 and maturation deficits in HD pathogenesis.

                Hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) within C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Thalamic atrophy occurs in both sporadic and familial FTD but is thought to distinctly affect HRE carriers. Separately, emerging evidence suggests widespread de-repression of transposable elements (TEs) in the brain in several neurodegenerative diseases, including C9orf72 HRE-mediated FTD (C9-FTD). Whether TE activation can be measured in peripheral blood and how the reduction in peripheral C9orf72 expression observed in HRE carriers relates to atrophy and clinical impairment remain unknown. We used the FreeSurfer pipeline and its extensions to assess the effects of C9orf72 HRE and clinical diagnosis (n = 78) on atrophy of thalamic nuclei. We also generated a novel, whole-blood RNA-seq dataset to determine the relationships between peripheral C9orf72 expression, TE activation, thalamic atrophy, and clinical severity (n = 114). We confirmed global thalamic atrophy and reduced C9orf72 expression in HRE carriers. Moreover, we identified disproportionate atrophy of the right mediodorsal lateral nucleus in HRE carriers and showed that C9orf72 expression associated with clinical severity, independent of thalamic atrophy. Strikingly, we found global peripheral activation of TEs, including the human endogenous LINE-1 element, L1HS. L1HS levels were associated with atrophy of multiple pulvinar nuclei, a thalamic region implicated in C9-FTD. Integration of peripheral transcriptomic and neuroimaging data from HRE carriers revealed atrophy of specific thalamic nuclei; demonstrated that C9orf72 levels relate to clinical severity; and identified marked de-repression of TEs, including L1HS, which predicted atrophy of FTD-relevant thalamic nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular and anatomical roadmap of stroke pathology in immunodeficient mice</a></h4>

              
                Background Stroke remains a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. It has become apparent that inflammation and immune mediators have a pre-dominant role in initial tissue damage and long-term recovery following the injury. Still, different immunosuppressed mouse models are necessary in stroke research e.g., to evaluate therapies using human cell grafts. Despite mounting evidence delineating the importance of inflammation in the stroke pathology, it is poorly described to what extent partial immune deficiency influences the overall stroke outcome. Methods Here, we assessed the stroke pathology of popular genetic immunodeficient mouse models, i.e., NOD scid gamma (NSG) and recombination activating gene 2 (Rag2-/-) mice as well as pharmacologically immunosuppressed mice and compared them to immune competent, wildtype (WT) C57BL/6J mice up to three weeks after injury. We performed histology, gene expression profiling, serum analysis and functional behavioural tests to identify the impact of immunosuppression on the stroke progression. Results We detected distinct changes in microglia infiltration, scar-forming and vascular repair in immune-suppressed mice three weeks after injury. Gene expression analysis of stroked tissue revealed the strongest deviation from immune competent mice was observed in NSG mice, for instance, affecting immunological and angiogenic pathways. Pharmacological immunosuppression resulted in the least variation in gene expression compared with the WT. Major differences have been further identified in the systemic inflammatory response following stroke acutely and three weeks following injury. These anatomical, genetic, and systemic changes did not affect functional deficits and recovery in a time course of three weeks. To determine whether the timing of immunosuppression after stroke is critical, we compared mice with acute and delayed pharmacological immunosuppression after stroke. Mice with a delayed immunosuppression (7d) after stroke showed increased inflammatory and scarring responses compared to animals acutely treated with tacrolimus, thus more closely resembling WT pathology. Transplantation of human cells in the brains of immunosuppressed mouse models led to prolonged cell survival in all immunosuppressed mouse models, which was most consistent in NSG and Rag2-/- mice. Conclusions In sum, we detected distinct anatomical and molecular changes in the stroke pathology between the individual immunosuppressed mouse models that should be carefully considered when selecting an appropriate mouse model for stroke research.

                Kinesin-driven organelle transport is crucial for neuron development and maintenance, yet the mechanisms by which kinesins specifically bind their organelle cargoes remain undefined. In contrast to other transport kinesins, the neuronal function and specific organelle adaptors of heterodimeric Kinesin-2 family members KIF3AB and KIF3AC remain unknown. We developed a novel microscopy-based assay to define protein-protein interactions in intact neurons. The experiments found that KIF3AB and KIF3AC both bind KAP. These interactions are mediated by the distal C-terminal tail regions and not the coiled-coil domain. We used live-cell imaging in cultured hippocampal neurons to define the localization and trafficking parameters of KIF3AB and KIF3AC organelle populations. We discovered that KIF3AB/KAP and KIF3AC/KAP bind the same organelle populations and defined their transport parameters in axons and dendrites. The results also show that ~12% of KIF3 organelles contain the RNA binding protein, adenomatous polyposis coli. These data point towards a model in which KIF3AB and KIF3AC use KAP as their neuronal organelle adaptor and that these kinesins mediate transport of a range of organelles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex and BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism matter for exercise-induced increase in neurogenesis and cognition in middle-aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Females show greater benefits of exercise on cognition in both humans and rodents, which may be related to brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the Val66Met polymorphism, within the human BDNF gene, causes impaired activity-dependent secretion of neuronal BDNF and impairments to some forms of memory. We evaluated whether sex and BDNF genotype (Val66Met polymorphism (Met/Met) versus Wild Type (Val/Val)) influenced the ability of voluntary running to increase neurogenesis and cognition in mice. C57BL/6J (13 months) mice were randomly assigned to either a control or an aerobic training (AT) group (running disk access). Mice were trained on the visual discrimination and reversal paradigm in a touch screen-based technology to evaluate cognitive flexibility. BDNF Val/Val mice outperformed BDNF Met/Met mice on both cognitive tasks. Female BDNF Val/Val mice showed greater cognitive flexibility compared to male mice regardless of AT. Despite running less than BDNF Val/Val mice, AT improved both cognitive tasks in BDNF Met/Met mice. AT increased neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus of BDNF Val/Val mice of both sexes and increased the proportion of mature type 3 doublecortin-expressing cells in the dorsal hippocampus of female mice only. Our results indicate AT results in improved cognitive performance in BDNF Met/Met mice and increased hippocampal neurogenesis in BDNF Val/Val mice in middle age. Furthermore, middle-aged female mice may benefit more from AT than males in terms of neuroplasticity, an effect that was influenced by the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism.

	<p>Maternal stress can afflict fetal brain development, putting the offspring at risk of cognitive deficits, including anxiety. The prefrontal cortex (PFC), a protracted maturing region, is notably affected by prenatal stress (PS). However, it remains unclear how PS interferes with the maturation of the GABAergic system, considering its functional adjustment in the PFC during adolescence. The present study thus investigated the long-lasting consequences of PS on the prefrontal GABAergic functions of adolescent offspring. Pregnant Sprague&amp;amp;ndash;Dawley rats were divided into controls and the PS group, which underwent restraint stress during the last week of gestation. Male pups from postnatal days (PND) 40&amp;amp;ndash;42 were submitted to the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Proteins essentially involved in GABAergic signaling were then examined in PFC tissues, including the K+-Cl&amp;amp;minus; cotransporter (KCC2), Na+-K+-Cl&amp;amp;minus; cotransporter (NKCC1), &amp;amp;alpha;1 and &amp;amp;alpha;5 subunits of GABA type A receptors (GABAA receptors), and parvalbumin (PV), along with cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation (pCREB), which reacts in the plasticity regulation of PV-positive interneurons. The results revealed that the higher anxiety-like behavior of PS adolescent rats concurred with the significant decreases of the KCC2 and &amp;amp;alpha;1 subunits, with PV- and pCREB-lowered levels. The findings suggested that PS disrupts the continuance of PFC maturity by reducing the essential elements of GABAergic functions. These changes likely underlie the anxiety emerging in adolescence, possibly progressing to mental disorders.</p>

	<p>Although functional impairment is required for a diagnosis in the DSM 5, the time frame and definition of functional impairment is ambiguous. We present a conceptual review clarifying the difference between functional impairment as a stable trait representing strength or disability in various domains, and functional impairment as secondary to emotional or behavior problems, which is a state sensitive to change with treatment intervention. Functional impairment as a measure of treatment outcome includes both change from baseline and status at the endpoint of treatment. When using a validated measure of function, functional improvement can be defined as the percentage of patients who achieve the Minimal Important Clinical Difference (MCID) and functional remission as the percentage of patients who normalize at treatment endpoint. True treatment remission should be defined as both symptomatic and functional remission.</p>

	<p>Background and purpose: Cognitive and motor impairments are risk factors of major neurocognitive disorders (MNCD). Inability to name the date and use of a walking aid and/or history of falls are two items which are surrogate measures of cognitive and motor impairments. This study aims to examine the association of inability to name the date (i.e., cognitive impairment), use of a walking aid and/or history of falls (i.e., motor impairment) and their combination with incident MNCD in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: A total of 709 participants (mean age 79.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.7; 100% female) of the EPID&amp;amp;eacute;miologie de l&amp;amp;rsquo;OSt&amp;amp;eacute;oporose (EPIDOS) study recruited in Toulouse (France) were selected for this study. EPIDOS is an observational population-based cohort study with a 7-year follow-up period for Toulouse participants. Inability to name the date and use of a walking aid and/or history of falls were collected at baseline. Incident MNCD and their type (i.e., Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and non-AD) were diagnosed at the end of the 7-year follow-up. Results: Overall incidence of MNCD was 29.1%. Cox regressions revealed that inability to name the date and its combination with use of a walking aid and/or history of falls was associated with a significant increased incidence of MNCD (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.10 with p = 0.003 and HR = 1.81 with p = 0.011, respectively) and AD (HR =1.13 with p = 0.003 and HR = 2.80 with p = 0.016, respectively). Conclusions: Increased incident MNCD was reported when inability to name the date and use of a walking aid and/or history of falls were combined, suggesting that this combination of items may be used for risk screening of MNCD in the older population, especially for incident AD.</p>

	<p>The California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II) and the Virtual Environment Grocery Store (VEGS) use list learning and recognition tasks to assess episodic memory. This study aims to: (1) Replicate prior construct validity results among a new sample of young adults and healthy older adults; (2) Extend this work to a clinical sample of older adults with a neurocognitive diagnosis; (3) Compare CVLT-II and VEGS performance among these groups; and (4) Validate the independence of CVLT and VEGS episodic memory performance measures from executive functioning performance measures. Typically developing young adults (n = 53) and older adults (n = 85), as well as older adults with a neurocognitive diagnosis (n = 18), were administered the CVLT-II, VEGS, and D-KEFS CWIT. Results found that (1) the relationship of the VEGS and CVLT-II measures was highly correlated on all variables, (2) compared to the CVLT-II, participants (particularly older adults) recalled fewer items on the VEGS, and (3) the CVLT-II and VEGS were generally independent of D-KEFS CWIT. It appeared that the VEGS may be more difficult than the CVLT-II, possibly reflecting the word length effect. Performance may have also been impacted by the presence of everyday distractors in the virtual environment.</p>

	<p>The chronic form of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is understudied and seems to be linked exclusively to Siberian and Far Eastern TBE virus (TBEV) subtypes. There are limited clinical descriptions demonstrating that chronic TBE can resemble an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like disease. Here, we present a description of a clinical case of progressive chronic TBEV infection with a relapse 35 years after the initial acute infection following a tick bite. The disease manifested as an ALS-like syndrome with bulbar signs, progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, decreased reflexes, and eventual respiratory failure and death. There is no clear differentiation between chronic TBE and postencephalitic syndrome described in European sources. The reactivation of TBEV infection was supported by the presence of anti-TBEV antibodies in serum and antibodies to E protein and to the nonstructural protein NS1 in the CSF. These findings support the diagnosis of a relapse of chronic TBE in this patient.</p>

	<p>The interaction between oral and/or mental cognitive tasks and postural control and mobility remains unclear. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of speech production and cognitive load levels on static balance and timed up and go (TUG) during dual-task activities. Thirty healthy young subjects (25 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4 years old, 17 women) participated in this study. A control situation and two different cognitive arithmetic tasks were tested: counting backward in increments of 3 and 7 under oral (O) and mental (M) conditions during static balance and the TUG. We evaluated the dual-task cost (DTC) and the effect of speech production (SP) and the level of cognitive load (CL) on these variables. There was a significant increase in the centre of pressure oscillation velocity in static balance when the dual task was performed orally compared to the control situation The DTC was more pronounced for the O than for the M. The SP, but not the CL, had a significant effect on oscillation velocity. There was an increase in TUG associated with the cognitive load, but the mental or oral aspect did not seem to have an influence. Mobility is more affected by SP when the cognitive task is complex. This may be particularly important for the choice of the test and understanding postural control disorders.</p>

	<p>The Windkessel model, which is known as a successful model for explaining the hemodynamic circulation, is a mathematical model with a direct correspondence with the electric circuit. We propose a theoretical model for the intracranial aneurysm based on the Windkessel-type steady blood flow. Intracranial aneurysms are well known vascular lesions, which cause subarachnoid hemorrhages. Since an aneurysm is an end-sack formed on the blood vessel, it functions as an unusual blood path that has characteristic features such as a reservoir and bottle neck orifice. We simulate an aneurysm by an electric circuit consisting of three different impedances, resistance, capacitance and inductance. A dumbbell-shaped aneurysm is the most dangerous aneurysm to easily rupture. Our aneurysmal model is created as a two-story aneurysm model for this point, thus namely the five-element Windkessel. Then, the mathematical formula was solved in numerical simulations by changing the size of the aneurysm and the elasticity of the aneurysm wall. An analysis of this model provided that the presence of the daughter aneurysm and the thinning of the aneurysm wall are positively correlated with a sharp increase in blood pressure in the aneurysm dome. Our mathematic aneurysm model proposes a good analogue to the real aneurysm and proved that this model includes soliton that is a non-decreasing wave propagation.</p>

	<p>The electroencephalograph (EEG) microstate is a method used to describe the characteristics of the EEG signal through the brain scalp electrode potential&amp;amp;rsquo;s spatial distribution; as such, it reflects the changes in the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional state. The EEGs of 13 elite archers from China&amp;amp;rsquo;s national archery team and 13 expert archers from China&amp;amp;rsquo;s provincial archery team were recorded under the alpha rhythm during the resting state (with closed eyes) and during archery aiming. By analyzing the differences between the EEG microstate parameters and the correlation between these parameters with archery performance, as well as by combining our findings through standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography source analysis (sLORETA), we explored the changes in the neural activity of professional archers of different levels, under different states. The results of the resting state study demonstrated that the duration, occurrence, and coverage in microstate D of elite archers were significantly higher than those of expert archers and that their other microstates had the greatest probability of transferring to microstate D. During the archery aiming state, the average transition probability of the other microstates transferring to microstate in the left temporal region was the highest observed in the two groups of archers. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation between the duration and coverage of microstates in the frontal region of elite archers and their archery performance. Our findings indicate that elite archers are more active in the dorsal attention system and demonstrate a higher neural efficiency during the resting state. When aiming, professional archers experience an activation of brain regions associated with archery by suppressing brain regions unrelated to archery tasks. These findings provide a novel theoretical basis for the study of EEG microstate dynamics in archery and related cognitive motor tasks, particularly from the perspective of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s mental state.</p>

<p>Neuronal connectomes play a critical role in information storage during learning and memory. We report that dopamine neurons are essential for adaptive olfactory learning in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Dopamine neurodegeneration results in significant learning impairment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Encoding and consolidating information through learning and memory is vital in adaptation and survival. Dopamine (DA) is a critical neurotransmitter that modulates behavior. However, the role of DA in learning and memory processes is not well defined. Herein, we used the olfactory adaptive learning paradigm in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to elucidate the role of DA in the memory pathway. <i>Cat-2</i> mutant worms with low DA synthesis showed a significant reduction in chemotaxis index (CI) compared to the wild type (WT) after short-term conditioning. In dat-1::ICE worms, having degeneration of DA neurons, there was a significant reduction in adaptive learning and memory. When the worms were trained in the presence of exogenous DA (10‚ÄâmM) instead of food, a substantial increase in CI value was observed. Furthermore, our results suggest that both dop-1 and dop-3 DA receptors are involved in memory retention. The release of DA during conditioning is essential to initiate the learning pathway. We also noted an enhanced cholinergic receptor activity in the absence of dopaminergic neurons. The strains expressing GCaMP6 in DA neurons (pdat-1::GCaMP-6::<i>mCherry)</i> showed a rise in intracellular calcium influx in the presence of the conditional stimulus after training, suggesting DA neurons are activated during memory recall. These results reveal the critical role of DA in adaptive learning and memory, indicating that DA neurons play a crucial role in the effective processing of cognitive function.</p>

                Learning in a stochastic and changing environment is a difficult task. Models of learning typically postulate that observations that deviate from the learned predictions are surprising and used to update those predictions. Bayesian accounts further posit the existence of a confidence-weighting mechanism: learning should be modulated by the confidence level that accompanies those predictions. However, the neural bases of this confidence are much less known than the ones of surprise. Here, we used a dynamic probability learning task and high-field MRI to identify putative cortical regions involved in the representation of confidence about predictions during human learning. We devised a stringent test based on the conjunction of four criteria. We localized several regions in parietal and frontal cortices whose activity is sensitive to the confidence of an ideal observer, specifically so with respect to potential confounds (surprise and predictability), and in a way that is invariant to which item is predicted. We also tested for functionality in two ways. First, we localized regions whose activity patterns at the subject level showed an effect of both confidence and surprise in qualitative agreement with the confidence-weighting principle. Second, we found neural representations of ideal confidence that also accounted for subjective confidence. Taken together, those results identify a set of cortical regions potentially implicated in the confidence-weighting of learning.

	<p>Hypothermia therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, some trials have shown that hypothermia therapy has a negative effect on patients with TBI. The treatment of hypothermia in children with TBI remains controversial. We conducted a search of six online databases to validate the literature on comparing hypothermia with normal therapy for children with TBI. Eight randomized controlled trials (514 patients) were included. The meta-analysis indicated that hypothermia therapy may increase the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores. However, in terms of improving the rate of complications, intracranial pressure (ICP), mortality, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and length of stay both in hospital as well as pediatric ICU, the difference was not statistically significant. Hypothermia therapy may have clinical advantages in improving the GOS scores in children with TBI compared with normothermic therapy, but hypothermia therapy may have no benefit in improving the incidence of complications, ICP, mortality, CPP, and length of stay both in pediatric ICU as well as hospital. The decision to implement hypothermia therapy for children with TBI depends on the advantages and disadvantages from many aspects and these must be considered comprehensively.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Cocaine use disorder is a chronic disease with severe consequences and a high relapse rate. There is a critical need to explore the factors influencing relapse in order to achieve more efficient treatment outcomes. Furthermore, there is a great need for easy-to-measure, repeatable, and valid biomarkers that can predict treatment response or relapse. Methods: We reviewed the available literature on the Pubmed database concerning the biomarkers associated with relapse in CUD, including central nervous system-derived, genetic, immune, oxidative stress, and &amp;amp;ldquo;other&amp;amp;rdquo; biomarkers. Results: Fifty-one articles were included in our analysis. Twenty-five imaging brain anatomic and function assessment studies, mostly using fMRI, examined the role of several structures such as the striatum activity in abstinence prediction. There were fewer studies assessing the use of neuropsychological factors, neurotrophins, or genetic/genomic factors, immune system, or oxidative stress measures to predict abstinence. Conclusion: Several biomarkers have been shown to have predictive value. Prospective studies using combined multimodal assessments are now warranted.</p>

	<p>Objective Glioblastoma (GBM), a type of malignant glioma, is the most aggressive type of brain tumor and is associated with high mortality. Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) has been detected in multiple tumors and is involved in tumor initiation and progression. However, the specific role and mechanism of H6PD in GBM remain unclear. Methods We performed pan-cancer analysis of expression and prognosis of H6PD in GBM using the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Subsequently, noncoding RNAs regulating H6PD expression were obtained by comprehensive analysis, including gene expression, prognosis, correlation, and immune infiltration. Finally, tumor immune infiltrates related to H6PD and survival were performed. Results Higher expression of H6PD was statistically significantly associated with an unfavorable outcome in GBM. Downregulation of hsa-miR-124-3p and hsa-miR-516b-5p in GBM was detected from GSE90603. Subsequently, OSMR-AS1 was observed in the regulation of H6PD via hsa-miR-516b-5p. Moreover, higher H6PD expression significantly correlated with immune infiltration of dendritic cells, immune checkpoint expression, and biomarkers of dendritic cells. Conclusions The OSMR-AS1/ miR-516b-5p axis was identified as the highest-potential upstream ncRNA-related pathway of H6PD in GBM. Furthermore, the present findings demonstrated that H6PD blockading might possess antitumor roles via regulating dendritic cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression.</p>

	<p>This study examined the reliability and validity of speech-language pathologists&amp;amp;rsquo; (SLP) estimations of speech intelligibility in dysarthria, including a visual analog scale (VAS) method and a percent estimation method commonly used in clinical settings. Speech samples from 20 speakers with dysarthria of varying etiologies were used to collect orthographic transcriptions from na&amp;amp;iuml;ve listeners n=70 and VAS ratings and percent estimations of intelligibility from SLPs n=21. Intra- and interrater reliability for the two SLP intelligibility measures were evaluated, and the relationship between these measures was assessed. Finally, linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between the na&amp;amp;iuml;ve listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; orthographic transcription scores and the two SLP intelligibility measures. The results indicated that the intrarater reliability for both SLP intelligibility measures was strong, and the interrater reliability between the SLP ratings was moderate to excellent. A moderate positive relationship between SLPs&amp;amp;rsquo; VAS ratings and percent estimations was also observed. Finally, both SLPs&amp;amp;rsquo; percent estimations and VAS ratings were predictive of na&amp;amp;iuml;ve listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; orthographic transcription scores, with SLPs&amp;amp;rsquo; percent estimations being the strongest predictor. In conclusion, the average SLP percent estimations and VAS ratings are valid and reliable intelligibility measures. However, the validity and reliability of these measures vary between SLPs.</p>

	<p>Human herpesviruses (HHVs) have been implicated as possible risk factors in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Persistent lifelong HHVs infections may directly or indirectly contribute to the generation of AD hallmarks: amyloid beta (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and synaptic loss. The present review focuses on summarizing current knowledge on the molecular mechanistic links between HHVs and AD that include processes involved in A&amp;amp;beta; accumulation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, autophagy, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. A PubMed search was performed to collect all the available research data regarding the above mentioned mechanistic links between HHVs and AD pathology. The vast majority of research articles referred to the different pathways exploited by Herpes Simplex Virus 1 that could lead to AD pathology, while a few studies highlighted the emerging role of HHV 6, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein&amp;amp;ndash;Barr Virus. The elucidation of such potential links may guide the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics to counter this devastating neurological disorder that until now remains incurable.</p>

                Background: Burn injury is a global health problem that is most often caused by heat. A burn injury can cause high morbidity and mortality and requires high cost. Therefore, the use of plants as an herbal medicine has the potential to be developed in Indonesia. Aloe vera contains various active ingredients that help the wound healing process, such as glucomannan and acemannan which have the effects on the proliferation of macrophages, fibroblasts, and re-epithelialization. This study aimed to determine the effect of Aloe vera extract in repairing post-burn skin in rats that were analyzed from the number of macrophages, fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness. Methods: This is an experimental study with a posttest-only control group design using 54 Rattus norvegicus Wistar strain rats. The sampling method was simple random sampling consisting of 3 groups, i.e., I. standard group, which were normal rats; II. negative control group, which were given second-degree burns and treated with gel base (without Aloe vera extract); III. treatment groups, which were given second-degree burns and treated with Aloe vera extract gel. Each group was subdivided into three smaller groups (n = 6) according to the time the lesions were evaluated. Skin tissue samplings were carried out on days 3, 14, and 21 after injury to observe the number of macrophages, fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness. Results: There were significant differences in the mean number of macrophages, number of fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness in all groups (p<0.05). Conclusion: Aloe vera extract could accelerate the healing process of burns in rats.

                Background: Data pertaining to risk factors of nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP) among rural Bangladeshi is scarce. This study explored the risk factors associated with NSLBP among rural Bangladeshi adults. Methods: A community-based study was done in Sonargaon Upazila of Narayanganj district of Bangladesh. A total of 343 NSLBP patients were recruited as cases, based on the Bangla version of Community oriented program for control of rheumatic diseases (COPCORD) questionnaire. An equal number of age and sex matched subjects without any rheumatic disease were recruited from the same community. A total of 15 probable factors were analyzed. Age-sex adjusted univariate and age-sex with 13 risk factors adjusted multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were done. Results: The mean age of the participants was 33.1 years old (standard deviation: 9.5). Out of 13 risk factors, history of chronic disease (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 ‚Äì 3.4), prolonged sitting (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.0 ‚Äì 11.0), squatting (OR 7.2, 95% CI 3.2 ‚Äì 16.0), bending of the waist (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8 ‚Äì 7.6), regular lifting or carrying a heavy load (OR 9.2, 95% CI 2.2 ‚Äì 39.7), prolonged standing (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.9 ‚Äì 17.7), occupation related to strenuous physical activity (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 ‚Äì 0.8), overweight (body mass index >=25 kg/m2) (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.8 ‚Äì 5.2) and depression (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4 ‚Äì 3.6) were found to be significantly associated with NSLBP. Conclusions: The study¬†generated knowledge on associated risk factors for NSLBP in rural people of Bangladesh that may facilitate an evidence-based intervention for the target group.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of Fabry disease in Iraq [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Fabry disease occurs due to mutations in the Œ±-galactosidase A (GLA) gene present in the X-chromosome, which results in Œ±-galactosidase A (Œ±-GAL A) enzyme deficiency, leading to the intracellular accumulation of glycosphingolipids like globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). It involves multiorgan dysfunction, particularly affecting kidneys, heart, and central and peripheral nervous system. We intended to evaluate the prevalence of Fabry disease in various regions of Iraq along with the clinical manifestations. Methods: This cross-sectional multi-center study was conducted in Iraq with 1148 patients with variable presentations from January 2018 to June 2022. The demography, patient medical and family history were recorded. Routine clinical investigations were performed along with some specific assessments. Lysosomal Œ±-GAL A enzyme activity was determined using the dried blood spot test followed by tandem mass spectrometry, where values between 200‚Äì2000 pmol/spot*20 h were considered normal. Any patient with Œ±-GAL A activity <100 pmol/spot*20h was sent for genetic testing for confirmation of the diagnosis. Statistical analysis of data involved Pearson‚Äôs chi-squared test. Results: In total, 17 patients had Fabry disease, with a 16:1 male:female ratio. The disorder was predominant in the 10‚Äì30-year age group. Renal dysfunction was the dominant clinical manifestation (82.3%), followed by peripheral neuropathy (35.3%), angiokeratoma (29.4%), corneal verticillate (23.5%), and left ventricular hypertrophy (17.6%). The prevalence of Fabry disease was highest in north Iraq, followed by middle and south regions. Conclusions: A prompt and timely diagnosis of Fabry disease is the cornerstone for preventing complications, especially renal and cardiac involvement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Community-driven ELIXIR activities in single-cell omics [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell omics (SCO) has revolutionized the way and the level of resolution by which life science research is conducted, not only impacting our understanding of fundamental cell biology but also providing novel solutions in cutting-edge medical research. The rapid development of single-cell technologies has been accompanied by the active development of data analysis methods, resulting in a plethora of new analysis tools and strategies every year. Such a rapid development of SCO methods and tools poses several challenges in standardization, benchmarking, computational resources and training. These challenges are in line with the activities of ELIXIR, the European coordinated infrastructure for life science data. Here, we describe the current landscape of and the main challenges in SCO data, and propose the creation of the ELIXIR SCO Community, to coordinate the efforts in order to best serve SCO researchers in Europe and beyond. The Community will build on top of national experiences and pave the way towards integrated long-term solutions for SCO research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of vaccination against COVID-19 on the emotional health of older adults [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the mental and emotional health of the elderly, especially those from low to middle-income countries. However, COVID-19 vaccination may reduce this influence. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the effect of vaccination against COVID-19 on the emotional health of older adults. Methods: We selected a national, random, and stratified sample of non-hospitalized adults aged 60 to 79 years from Peru who intended to receive or had already received the COVID-19 vaccine during recruitment. During June and July 2021, the assessed outcomes were the fear, anxiety, and worry about COVID-19, general anxiety, and depression at baseline and after a month. We estimated the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each altered emotional health outcomes in those who had one and two doses, compared with those who were not vaccinated using multilevel logistic regression with mixed effects. Results: We recruited 861 older adults with 20.8% of loss to follow-up. At baseline, 43.9% had received only one dose of the vaccine, and 49.1% had two doses. In the analysis during follow-up, those who had two doses had less fear (aOR: 0.19; CI 95%: 0.07 to 0.51) and anxiety to COVID-19 (aOR: 0.45; CI 95%: 0.22 to 0.89), compared to unvaccinated. We observed no effects in those with only one dose. Conclusions: Two doses of COVID-19 vaccination in older adults improves their perception of COVID-19 infection consequences. This information could be integrated into the vaccination campaign as an additional beneficial effect.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Neuroimaging Data Model Linear Regression Tool (nidm_linreg): PyNIDM Project [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) is a series of specifications for describing all aspects of the neuroimaging data lifecycle from raw data to analyses and provenance. NIDM uses community-driven terminologies along with unambiguous data dictionaries within a Resource Description Framework (RDF) document to describe data and metadata for integration and query. Data from different studies, using locally defined variable names, can be retrieved by linking them to higher-order concepts from established ontologies and terminologies. Through these capabilities, NIDM documents are expected to improve reproducibility and facilitate data discovery and reuse. PyNIDM is a Python toolbox supporting the creation, manipulation, and querying of NIDM documents. Using the query tools available in PyNIDM, users are able interrogate datasets to find studies that have collected variables measuring similar phenotypic properties. This, in turn, facilitates the transformation and combination of data across multiple studies. The focus of this manuscript is the linear regression tool which is a part of the PyNIDM toolbox and works directly on NIDM documents. It provides a high-level statistical analysis that aids researchers in gaining more insight into the data that they are considering combining across studies. This saves researchers valuable time and effort while showing potential relationships between variables. The linear regression tool operates through a command-line interface integrated with the other tools (pynidm linear-regression) and provides the user with the opportunity to specify variables of interest using the rich query techniques available for NIDM documents and then conduct a linear regression with optional contrast and regularization.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Proximate analysis of the high phytochemical activity of encapsulated Mandai cempedak (Artocarpus champeden) vinegar prepared with maltodextrin and chitosan as wall materials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mandai cempedak vinegar (MCV) is a fermented vinegar produced from the inner skin of cempedak (Artocarpus champeden), which contains antioxidants classified as flavonoids, phenols, and tannins. These bioactive compounds are sensitive to heat and prone to oxidative damage. Therefore, an encapsulation process is proposed to protect the bioactive compounds. This study aimed to design a potential scaling-up formulation of spray-dried encapsulated MCV based on Total Soluble Solid (TSS) with the addition of maltodextrin and chitosan, followed by determining the nutrition and phytochemical values of the formulation. Methods: The formulation employed maltodextrin to achieve TSS of 15, 20, and 25 ¬∫Brix as the primary wall material treatment factor. The second factor was chitosan as auxiliary wall material at 1, 2, and 3% (w/w of maltodextrin). Products were spray-dried at 100 ¬∫C inlet temperature and 80 ¬∫C outlet temperature. Analyses of nutrition, flavonoid, phenol, and tannin were conducted in triplicate for each encapsulated product.¬† Results: The 15 ¬∫Brix of TSS from maltodextrin with 1% chitosan emerged as the best-encapsulating material, giving 7.54% moisture, 0.75% ash, 0.42% protein, 0.35% fat, and 90.94% carbohydrate content, resulting in a phytochemical activity equivalent to 9.13 mg Catechin Equivalent kg-1, 69.61 mg Gallic Acid¬†Equivalent kg-1, and 25.04 mg Tannic¬†Acid Equivalent kg-1. Compared to maltodextrin, the chitosan generally contributed less to the proximate, flavonoid, phenol, and tannin content of the encapsulated MCV. Conclusions: The best formulation contained maltodextrin at 15 ¬∫Brix of TSS and 1% chitosan. Maintaining optimum TSS was a key to producing consistent encapsulated MCV with high phytochemical activity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An exploration of trends and future directions in sustainability performance: A bibliometric analysis of Scopus database [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Current global economic activities are increasingly being perceived as unsustainable. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) statement in 2015, sustainability performance has received significant attention. Thus, it is necessary to better understand the topics of interest and expand cooperation networks to advance studies in integrated efforts. The present bibliometric research intends to assess worldwide research tendency in sustainability performance. Methods: We conducted an extensive bibliometric analysis of published academic articles on sustainability performance (SP) from 1997 to 2021. We reviewed, retrieved, and analysed 3680 papers published in Scopus. Specifically, VOSviewer software was used to conduct document co-authorship and co-occurrence analyses and burst detection analyses. Results: The outcomes reveal that since 1997, the sum of publications has been on the rise steadily. About a third of all global papers on sustainability performance were produced by researchers from the United States and Australia, outnumbering the remaining 138 countries/territories. Furthermore, the ten most prolific authors of sustainability performance are all from universities. Haapala, Karl R. and Murat Kucukvar were the most influential authors found, based on the total publication number of sustainability performance. Conclusions: The bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify the trends in the area of sustainability performance. Therefore, this study identified a significant research gap for future study of practitioners and researchers. The social sustainability and the relationship between the material flow analysis and sustainability performance should be noted. In addition, only the Scopus database has been considered due to its academic prestige. The database includes a large number of articles on sustainability performance. Therefore, the analysis was limited to the Scopus database only. However, other databases, such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, and MedLine, can be used for future research. These can also be used in combination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The global prevalence and association between the risk of myocarditis and mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination: A network meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cases of myocarditis development have been reported after administration of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines. However, the reports vary among the studies, and the types of mRNA vaccines with potential to cause myocarditis remain unidentified. The objective was to assess the cumulative prevalence of myocarditis and determine the association between myocarditis and mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: We performed a network meta-analysis by searching articles in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Information on the prevalence of myocarditis after the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination was collected from each study. Analysis was performed by calculating the pooled prevalence rate, and the association was determined using the Z-test. Data networking was performed using the Bayesian method. Results: A total of 18 papers was included in our analysis. We found that the cumulative prevalence of myocarditis was 1.7, 1.9, 1.2, and 1.1 per 100,000 population after vaccination with different types of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, namely all mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, BNT162b1, mRNA-1273, and the combination of BNT162b1 and mRNA-1273, respectively. Moreover, the results revealed that BNT162b1 vaccination increased the risk of myocarditis by 1.64- and 1.71-folds compared to mRNA-1273 and the combination of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively. Similar risks of developing myocarditis were observed after mRNA-1273 and the combination of BNT162b1 and mRNA-1273 vaccination. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the cumulative prevalence of myocarditis after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination with maximum prevalence was observed after BNT162b2 administration. BNT162b2 was associated with a higher risk of developing myocarditis than the other mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines.

                Chinese herbal medicine formula Zhi Shi Xiao Pi Wan (ZSXPW) is commonly used for gastrointestinal diseases. Previous research showed ZSXPW also suggested for diabetic gastroparesis (DGP) treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ZSXPW in treating adult DGP. Six databases, including Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, China Network Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and Chinese Scientific Journals were searched from their inceptions to November 2021. Only randomized control trials (RCTs) evaluating ZSXPW for adult DGP were included in this review. Two investigators independently evaluated and extracted the data. Total 11 RCTs and 802 participants were included in the review. In these studies, ZSXPW was compared with oral cisapride, domperidone, and mosapride citrate tablets. The outcomes of effective rate, stomach emptying time, stomach emptying rate, motilin, gastrin, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and adverse events were analyzed. The effective rate of ZSXPW is higher than other pharmacotherapies (RR:1.24, 95% CI [1.16,1.32]). The results showed intervention group has better effect on gastric emptying time used (MD: -0.51, 95% CI [-0.81, -0.21]) and gastric emptying rate (MD: 19.32, 95% CI [12.82, 25.83]) than the comparison group. The meta-analysis results showed ZSXPW is effective on adult DGP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Levels of cardiac troponin-T and LDL-C to HDL-C ratio of hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A case-control study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:¬†People with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are frequently at higher risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, which are strongly related to the development of long-term illness and higher mortality. These effects may be caused by several interrelated processes, including the IL-6 driven cytokine storm or uncontrolled angiotensin II stimulation. In addition, the direct viral infection of cardiac myocytes is thought to cause cardiac injury because it increases metabolic demand, activates the immune system, and causes vasculature disruption. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol¬†(HDL-C) ratio values with COVID-19. Methods: During the data collection stage, 90 participants were included, 45 healthy controls and 45 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Each participant provided 5 ml venous blood to begin analyzing cTnT and LDL-C:HDL-C ratio levels in their blood to see whether there is an association between the level of any of these markers and COVID-19 infection using SPSS version 23. Results: This research reported a significant rise in the measured values of cTnT and LDL-C:HDL-C ratio in patients' blood compared to controls, with P-values of 0.025 and 0.000, respectively, in which alpha values < 0.05, These biomarkers hold the promise in predicting COVID-19 severity, and early treatment may help reduce complications. Conclusions: Due to the fact that cTn is a diagnostic marker of disease activity and a strong independent predictor of negative events, its usage in emergency rooms may well be advantageous. If cTn is elevated, hospitalization may be indicated. A difference in the blood LDL-C:HDL-C ratio of COVID-19 patients demonstrated an association with the illness. Because lipid studies are inexpensive and reliable to do, they may aid clinicians in identifying the severity of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Natural killer (NK) cell-derived extracellular-vesicle shuttled microRNAs control T cell responses</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells recognise and kill target cells undergoing different types of stress. NK cells are also capable of modulating immune responses. In particular, they regulate T cell functions. Small RNA next-generation sequencing of resting and activated human NK cells and their secreted EVs led to the identification of a specific repertoire of NK-EV-associated microRNAs and their post-transcriptional modifications signature. Several microRNAs of NK-EVs, namely miR-10b-5p, miR-92a-3p and miR-155-5p, specifically target molecules involved in Th1 responses. NK-EVs promote the downregulation of <i>GATA3</i> mRNA in CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells and subsequent <i>TBX21</i> de-repression that leads to Th1 polarization and IFN-Œ≥ and IL-2 production. NK-EVs also have an effect on monocyte and moDCs function, driving their activation and increased presentation and co-stimulatory functions. Nanoparticle-delivered NK-EV microRNAs partially recapitulate NK-EV effects in mice. Our results provide new insights on the immunomodulatory roles of NK-EVs that may help to improve their use as immunotherapeutic tools.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Label-free three-photon imaging of intact human cerebral organoids for tracking early events in brain development and deficits in Rett syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Human cerebral organoids are unique in their development of progenitor-rich zones akin to ventricular zones from which neuronal progenitors differentiate and migrate radially. Analyses of cerebral organoids thus far have been performed in sectioned tissue or in superficial layers due to their high scattering properties. Here, we demonstrate label-free three-photon imaging of whole, uncleared intact organoids (~2 mm depth) to assess early events of early human brain development. Optimizing a custom-made three-photon microscope to image intact cerebral organoids generated from Rett Syndrome patients, we show defects in the ventricular zone volumetric structure of mutant organoids compared to isogenic control organoids. Long-term imaging live organoids reveals that shorter migration distances and slower migration speeds of mutant radially migrating neurons are associated with more tortuous trajectories. Our label-free imaging system constitutes a particularly useful platform for tracking normal and abnormal development in individual organoids, as well as for screening therapeutic molecules via intact organoid imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Manganese is a physiologically relevant TORC1 activator in yeast and mammals</a></h4>

              
                The essential biometal manganese (Mn) serves as a cofactor for several enzymes that are crucial for the prevention of human diseases. Whether intracellular Mn levels may be sensed and modulate intracellular signaling events has so far remained largely unexplored. The highly conserved target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1, mTORC1 in mammals) protein kinase requires divalent metal cofactors such as magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) to phosphorylate effectors as part of a homeostatic process that coordinates cell growth and metabolism with nutrient and/or growth factor availability. Here, our genetic approaches reveal that TORC1 activity is stimulated in vivo by elevated cytoplasmic Mn levels, which can be induced by loss of the Golgi-resident Mn<sup>2+</sup> transporter Pmr1 and which depend on the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) metal ion transporters Smf1 and Smf2. Accordingly, genetic interventions that increase cytoplasmic Mn<sup>2+</sup> levels antagonize the effects of rapamycin in triggering autophagy, mitophagy, and Rtg1-Rtg3-dependent mitochondrion-to-nucleus retrograde signaling. Surprisingly, our in vitro protein kinase assays uncovered that Mn<sup>2+</sup> activates TORC1 substantially better than Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which is primarily due to its ability to lower the K<sub>m</sub> for ATP, thereby allowing more efficient ATP coordination in the catalytic cleft of TORC1. These findings, therefore, provide both a mechanism to explain our genetic observations in yeast and a rationale for how fluctuations in trace amounts of Mn can become physiologically relevant. Supporting this notion, TORC1 is also wired to feedback control mechanisms that impinge on Smf1 and Smf2. Finally, we also show that Mn<sup>2+</sup>-mediated control of TORC1 is evolutionarily conserved in mammals, which may prove relevant for our understanding of the role of Mn in human diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ubiquitination drives COPI priming and Golgi SNARE localization</a></h4>

              
                Deciphering mechanisms controlling SNARE localization within the Golgi complex is crucial to understanding protein trafficking patterns within the secretory pathway. SNAREs are also thought to prime COPI assembly to ensure incorporation of these essential cargoes into vesicles, but the regulation of these events is poorly understood. Here we report roles for ubiquitin recognition by COPI in SNARE trafficking and in stabilizing interactions between Arf, COPI, and Golgi SNAREs in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. The ability of COPI to bind ubiquitin, but not the dilysine motif, through its N-terminal WD repeat domain of Œ≤'COP or through an unrelated ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) is essential for the proper localization of Golgi SNAREs Bet1 and Gos1. We find that COPI, the ArfGAP Glo3 and multiple Golgi SNAREs are ubiquitinated. Notably, the binding of Arf and COPI to Gos1 is markedly enhanced by ubiquitination of these components. Glo3 is proposed to prime COPI-SNARE interactions; however, Glo3 is not enriched in the ubiquitin-stabilized SNARE-Arf-COPI complex but is instead enriched with COPI complexes that lack SNAREs. These results support a new model for how posttranslational modifications drive COPI priming events crucial for Golgi SNARE localization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Heritability and cross-species comparisons of human cortical functional organization asymmetry</a></h4>

              
                The human cerebral cortex is symmetrically organized along large-scale axes but also presents inter-hemispheric differences in structure and function. The quantified contralateral homologous difference, i.e., asymmetry, is a key feature of the human brain left-right axis supporting functional processes, such as language. Here, we assessed whether the asymmetry of cortical functional organization is heritable and phylogenetically conserved between humans and macaques. Our findings indicate asymmetric organization along an axis describing a functional trajectory from perceptual/action to abstract cognition. Whereas language network showed leftward asymmetric organization, frontoparietal network showed rightward asymmetric organization in humans. These asymmetries were heritable in humans and showed a similar spatial distribution with macaques, in the case of intra-hemispheric asymmetry of functional hierarchy. This suggests (phylo)genetic conservation. However, both language and frontoparietal networks showed a qualitatively larger asymmetry in humans relative to macaques. Overall, our findings suggest a genetic basis for asymmetry in intrinsic functional organization, linked to higher-order cognitive functions uniquely developed in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CXCR4high megakaryocytes regulate host-defense immunity against bacterial pathogens</a></h4>

              
                Megakaryocytes (MKs) continuously produce platelets to support hemostasis and form a niche for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance in the bone marrow. MKs are also involved in inflammation responses; however, the mechanism remains poorly understood. Using single-cell sequencing, we identified a CXCR4 highly expressed MK subpopulation, which exhibited both MK-specific and immune characteristics. CXCR4<sup>high</sup> MKs interacted with myeloid cells to promote their migration and stimulate the bacterial phagocytosis of macrophages and neutrophils by producing TNFŒ± and IL-6. CXCR4<sup>high</sup> MKs were also capable of phagocytosis, processing and presenting antigens to activate T cells. Furthermore, CXCR4<sup>high</sup> MKs also egressed circulation and infiltrated into the spleen, liver, and lung upon bacterial infection. Ablation of MKs suppressed the innate immune response and T cell activation to impair the anti-bacterial effects in mice under the <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> challenge. Using hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell lineage-tracing mouse lines, we show that CXCR4<sup>high</sup> MKs were generated from infection-induced emergency megakaryopoiesis in response to bacterial infection. Overall, we identify the CXCR4<sup>high</sup> MKs, which regulate host-defense immune response against bacterial infection.

                The nitrogenase Fe protein mediates ATP-dependent electron transfer to the nitrogenase MoFe protein during nitrogen fixation, in addition to catalyzing MoFe protein independent substrate (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction and facilitating MoFe protein metallocluster biosynthesis. The precise role(s) of the Fe protein Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster in some of these processes remains ill-defined. Herein, we report crystallographic data demonstrating ATP-dependent chalcogenide exchange at the Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster of the nitrogenase Fe protein when potassium selenocyanate is used as the selenium source, an unexpected result as the Fe protein cluster is not traditionally perceived as a site of substrate binding within nitrogenase. The observed chalcogenide exchange illustrates that this Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster is capable of core substitution reactions under certain conditions, adding to the Fe protein's repertoire of unique properties.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Locally adaptive temperature response of vegetative growth in Arabidopsis thaliana</a></h4>

              
                We investigated early vegetative growth of natural <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accessions in cold, nonfreezing temperatures, similar to temperatures these plants naturally encounter in fall at northern latitudes. We found that accessions from northern latitudes produced larger seedlings than accessions from southern latitudes, partly as a result of larger seed size. However, their subsequent vegetative growth when exposed to colder temperatures was slower. The difference was too large to be explained by random population differentiation, and is thus suggestive of local adaptation, a notion that is further supported by substantial transcriptome and metabolome changes in northern accessions. We hypothesize that the reduced growth of northern accessions is an adaptive response and a consequence of reallocating resources toward cold acclimation and winter survival.

                Opsin 3 (Opn3) is a light-sensitive protein present throughout the mammalian brain, although its functions in this organ are currently unknown. Since Opn3 encoded mRNA increases in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus in response to hyperosmotic stimuli, we have explored the role of Opn3 in this nucleus. By in situ hybridization, we have demonstrated that Opn3 is expressed in neurones expressing both arginine vasopressin and oxytocin in the rat SON, suggesting that OPN3 functions in both neuronal types. Gene profiling analysis by RNA-seq suggested that neuropeptide production is impaired when knocking down Opn3 in the rat SON, as confirmed by quantitative PCR and immunolabelling. Knocking down Opn3 in the rat SON altered physiological parameters including water intake, body temperature and motor activity. Altogether the data indicates that Opn3 in the SON is involved in the regulation of a number of neuropeptides and other proteins that participate in water homeostasis, body temperature and motor activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MISPEL: A deep learning approach for harmonizingmulti-scanner matched neuroimaging data</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale data obtained from aggregation of already collected multi-site neuroimaging datasets has been brought benefits such as higher statistical power, reliability, and robustness to the studies. Despite these promises from growth in sample size, substantial technical variability stemming from differences in scanner specifications exists in the aggregated data and could inadvertently bias any downstream analyses on it. Such a challenge calls for data normalization and/or harmonization frameworks, in addition to a comprehensive criteria to estimate the scanner-related variability and evaluate the harmonization frameworks. In this study, we propose MISPEL (Multi-scanner Image harmonization via Structure Preserving Embedding Learning), a supervised multi-scanner harmonization method. Unlike existing techniques, MIS-PEL does not assume a perfect coregistration across the scans, and the framework is naturally extendable to more than two scanners. We also designed a set of comprehensive criteria to investigate the scanner-related technical variability and evaluate the harmonization techniques. As an essential requirement of our criteria, we introduced a multi-scanner matched dataset of four 3T MRI T1 images, which, to the best of our knowledge is the first dataset of its kind. We also investigated our evaluations using two popular segmentation frameworks: FSL and segmentation in statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Lastly, we compared MISPEL to popular methods of normalization and harmonization, namely White Stripe, RAVEL, and CALAMITI. MISPEL outperformed these methods and is promising for many other neuroimaging modalities.

                Development of the mammalian brain requires precisely controlled differentiation of neurons, glia, and nonneural cells. To investigate protein-level changes in these diverse cell types and their progenitors, we performed single-cell mass cytometry on whole brain (E11.5/E12.5) and microdissected telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon (E13.5-P4) collected at daily timepoints from C57/BL6 mice. Measuring 24,290,787 cells from 112 sample replicates with a 40-antibody panel, we quantified 85 molecularly distinct cell populations across embryonic and postnatal development, including microglia putatively phagocytosing neurites, neural cells, and myelin. Differentiation trajectory analysis also identified two separate pathways for producing oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Comparison with previous studies revealed considerable discrepancies between protein and mRNA abundances in the developing brain, demonstrating the value of protein-level measurements for identifying functional cell states. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of mass cytometry as a high-throughput, scalable platform for single-cell profiling of brain tissue.

                The relationships between microglia and macrophages, especially their lineage segregation outside the yolk sac, have been recently explored, providing a model in which a conversion from macrophages seeds microglia during brain development. However, spatiotemporal evidence to support such microglial seeding and to explain how it occurs has not been obtained. By cell tracking via slice culture, intravital imaging, and Flash tag-mediated labeling, we found that a group of intraventricular macrophages belonging to border-associated macrophages (BAMs), which were abundantly observed along the inner surface of the mouse cerebral wall at embryonic day 12, frequently entered the brain wall. Immunohistochemistry of the tracked cells showed that postinfiltrative BAMs acquired microglial properties while losing a macrophage phenotype. We also found that the intraventricular BAMs were supplied transepithelially from the roof plate. Thus, this study demonstrates that the "roof plate[-&gt;]ventricle[-&gt;]cerebral wall" route is an essential path for microglial colonization into the embryonic mouse brain.

                Human behavior and cognitive function correlate with complex patterns of spatio-temporal brain dynamics, which can be simulated using computational models with different degrees of biophysical realism. We used a data-driven optimization algorithm to determine and classify the types of local dynamics that enable the reproduction of different observables derived from functional magnetic resonance recordings. The phase space analysis of the resulting equations revealed a predominance of stable spiral attractors, which optimized the similarity with the empirical data in terms of the synchronization, metastability, and functional connectivity dynamics. For stable limit cycles, departures from harmonic oscillations improved the fit in terms of functional connectivity dynamics. Eigenvalue analyses showed that the proximity to Hopf bifurcations improved the accuracy of the simulation for wakefulness, while deep sleep was associated with increased stability. Our results provide testable predictions that constrain the landscape of suitable biophysical models, while supporting noise-driven dynamics close to a bifurcation as a canonical mechanism underlying the complex fluctuations that characterize endogenous brain activity.

                Timing plays a critical role in signaling throughout the nervous system. Signaling times vary widely depending on distance and speed, and timing delays influence circuit computations such as coincidence detection, synaptic integration, entrainment, temporal summation, and plasticity. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are a major type of inhibitory neuron with critical roles throughout the brain. Their rapid-spiking characteristics enable them to control the dynamics of neural circuits across a range of time scales. However, little is known about the factors that determine the timing of their synaptic inputs. Here, we measured the conduction velocity (CV) of excitatory axons that target PV interneurons in mouse primary somatosensory cortex. Using a genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) targeted to PV interneurons, we clocked the arrival of excitatory synaptic inputs with sub-millisecond precision in large numbers of cells across multiple layers. Arrival times varied with distance, allowing us to determine the CV of the excitatory axons. Values ranged from 28-241 m/msec across layers 2-5, and interlaminar CV was about twice as fast as intralaminar CV. This will enable more rapid computation within columns, while integration between columns will be slower. hVOS imaging from specific cell types offers a unique opportunity to investigate conduction in axons defined by their targets.

                AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDeep brain stimulation of subcallosal cingulate white matter (SCCwm-DBS) alleviates symptoms of treatment resistant depression (TRD) over months of therapy. Readouts of depression symptom severity derived from neural recordings are needed for more systematic study and improvement of the therapy. In this study, we measured local field potentials (LFP) multiple times a day alongside seven months of therapy using the Activa PC+S in six patients treated with SCCwm-DBS. We found significant changes in oscillatory power between early and late therapy after accounting for stimulation-related distortions, particularly within the {beta} band. We then used a decoder strategy to identify oscillatory activity that tracked with depression measurements over seven months, with asymmetric{delta} and {beta} oscillations contributing to a statistically significant prediction of 10% of the measured depression signal. Simulating its use in clinical decision-making, we demonstrated that the DR-SCC yield clinically meaningful information that can augment other measures of depression state. Ultimately, this DR-SCC provides a data-driven first-step towards objectively tracking chronic recovery after antidepressant DBS implantation and developing adaptive DBS strategies in the presence of active stimulation.

                Spatial frequency (SF) is an important attribute in the visual scene and is a defining feature of visual processing channels. However there remains many unsolved questions about how primate visual cortex, in particular extrastriate areas V2 and V4, codes this fundamental information. Here, using intrinsic signal optical imaging in visual cortex of Macaque monkeys, we quantify the relationship between spatial frequency maps and (1) visual topography, (2) color and orientation maps, and (3) across visual areas V1, V2, and V4. We find that in orientation regions, low to high spatial frequency is mapped orthogonally to orientation; however, in color regions, which is reported to contain orthogonal axes of color and lightness, only low spatial frequencies are represented without a gradient of SF representation. This produces the first observation of a population spatial frequency fluctuation related to the repeating color/orientation organizations. These findings support a generalized hypercolumn model across cortical areas, comprised of two orthogonal parameters with additional parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A translational approach to measuring the neural systems underlying approach-avoidance conflict in humans</a></h4>

              
                Approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) arises from decisions with embedded positive and negative outcomes, and appropriate management of these decisions is essential for adaptive functioning. However, translating key advances on AAC in non-human primates to tasks in humans has proven difficult in part due to the inherent limitations in existing human tasks in isolating relevant neural substrates of behavior. Here, we present, and validate, a novel task in humans (N= 38) of both sexes, derived from work in non-human primates utilizing primary reinforcers (shock/juice), and in doing so identify neural features specific to conflict, implementing a computational model of task behavior. We found that neural patterns of activation within the parietal, frontal, temporal and cingulate regions were associated with conflict-specific avoidance behavior. Importantly, a number of these regions were associated with trait anxiety, implicating a potential link between these neural regions and anxiety-driven avoidance behavior. This task platform may help advance both behavioral and biological research examining the neural patterning underlying approach-avoidance behavior in humans, providing an empirically oriented framework with which to translate between non-human primate and human work.

Significance StatementThe current paper describes and validates a novel task for studying Approach-Avoidance Conflict behavior that capitalizes on innate reinforcers and stringent thresholding, effectively bridging animal and human work in this field. The task is then used to identify the neural correlates of AAC behavior in humans, identifying patterns of activation linked to temporal variation in avoidance behavior specific to conflict. Further, a novel model is developed and applied to the behavioral data to more sensitively quantify response patterns using reinforcement learning, and neural patterns relating to these behavioral effects were identified. Finally, as anxiety is strongly associated in the animal and human literature with avoidance responding, we identified a subgroup of neural effects associated with trait anxiety.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of aquaporin-4 results in glymphatic system dysfunction via brain-wide interstitial fluid stagnation</a></h4>

              
                The glymphatic system is a fluid transport network of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) entering the brain along arterial perivascular spaces, exchanging with interstitial fluid (ISF), ultimately establishing directional clearance of interstitial solutes. CSF transport is facilitated by the expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels on the perivascular endfeet of astrocytes. Mice with genetic deletion of AQP4 (AQP4 KO) exhibit abnormalities in the brain structure and molecular water transport. Yet, no studies have systematically examined how these abnormalities in structure and water transport correlate with glymphatic function. Here we used high-resolution 3D magnetic resonance (MR) non-contrast cisternography, diffusion-weighted MR imaging (MR-DWI) along with intravoxel-incoherent motion (IVIM) DWI, while evaluating glymphatic function using a standard dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging to better understand how water transport and glymphatic function is disrupted after genetic deletion of AQP4. AQP4 KO mice had larger interstitial spaces and total brain volumes resulting in higher water content and reduced CSF space volumes, despite similar CSF production rates and vascular density compared to wildtype mice. The larger interstitial fluid volume likely resulted in increased slow but not fast MR diffusion scores and coincided with reduced glymphatic influx. This markedly altered brain fluid transport in AQP4 KO mice may result from a reduction in glymphatic clearance, leading to stagnation of ISF movement and enlargement of the interstitial space. Overall, diffusion MR is a useful tool to evaluate glymphatic function and may serve as valuable translational biomarker to study glymphatics in human disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional integrity of visual coding following advanced photoreceptor degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Photoreceptor degeneration sufficient to produce severe visual loss often spares the inner retina. This raises the hope that treatments using optogenetics or electrical stimulation, which generate a replacement light input signal in surviving neurons, may restore vision. The success of these approaches is dependent on the capacity of surviving circuits in the early stages of the visual system to generate and propagate an appropriate visual code in the face of neuroanatomical remodelling. To determine the capacity of surviving circuits in advanced retinal degeneration to present an appropriate visual code, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing the optogenetic actuator ReaChR in ON bipolar cells (second order neurons in the visual projection). After crossing this with the rd1 model of photoreceptor degeneration, we compared ReaChR derived responses with photoreceptor-driven responses in wildtype (WT) mice in retinal ganglion cells and visual thalamus. The ReaChR-driven responses in rd1 animals showed low photosensitivity, but in other respects generated a visual code that was very similar to WT. Furthermore, ReaChR rd1 units in the retina had high response reproducibility and showed sensitivity normalisation to code contrast stably across different background intensities. At the single unit level, ReaChR-derived responses exhibited broadly similar variation in light response polarity, contrast sensitivity and temporal frequency tuning as WT. Units from WT and ReaChR rd1 mice clustered together when subjected to unsupervised community detection based on stimulus-response properties. Our data reveal an impressive ability for surviving circuitry to recreate a rich visual code following advanced retinal degeneration and are promising for regenerative medicine in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Linguistic speech processing decreases with advancing age</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundOlder adults process speech differently, but it is not yet clear how aging affects different levels of processing natural, continuous speech, both in terms of bottom-up acoustic analysis and top-down generation of linguistic-based predictions. We studied natural speech processing across the adult lifespan via electroencephalography (EEG) measurements of neural tracking.

GoalsOur goals are to analyze the unique contribution of linguistic speech processing across the adult lifespan using natural speech, while controlling for the influence of acoustic processing. In particular, we focus on changes in spatial and temporal activation patterns in response to natural speech across the lifespan.

Methods52 normal-hearing adults between 17 and 82 years of age listened to a naturally spoken story while the EEG signal was recorded. We investigated the effect of age on acoustic and linguistic processing of speech. Because age correlated with hearing capacity and measures of cognition, we investigated whether the observed age effect is mediated by these factors. Furthermore, we investigated whether there is an effect of age on hemisphere lateralization and on spatiotemporal patterns of the neural responses.

ResultsOur EEG results showed that linguistic speech processing declines with advancing age. Moreover, as age increased, the neural response latency to certain aspects of linguistic speech processing increased. Also acoustic neural tracking (NT) decreased with increasing age but in contrast to linguistic processing, older subjects showed shorter latencies for early acoustic responses to speech. No evidence was found for hemispheric lateralization in neither younger nor older adults during linguistic speech processing. Most of the observed aging effects on acoustic and linguistic processing were not explained by age-related decline in hearing capacity or cognition. However, our results suggest that the effect of increasing neural response latency with age for word-level linguistic processing is likely more due to an age-related decline in cognition than a robust effect of age.

ConclusionSpatial and temporal characteristics of the neural responses to continuous speech change across the adult lifespan for both acoustic and linguistic speech processing. These are most likely explained by compensation mechanisms that occur during healthy aging. Traces of this compensation mechanism are reported as modifications in the neural response to acoustic and linguistic speech characteristics in terms of spatial and temporal differences, suggesting structural and functional changes. Additionally, different frontal patterns were observed for linguistic processing, suggesting that older adults recruit additional frontal brain regions to compensate for the age-related decline.

HighlightsO_LIWith increasing age, linguistic neural tracking of speech decreases.
C_LIO_LIWith increasing age, the processing speed of linguistic aspects of speech slows down.
C_LIO_LIThe processing speed for word-level linguistics is likely affected by cognition.
C_LIO_LIOlder adults rely on compensation mechanisms during speech processing.

                Tractography is widely used in human studies of connectivity with respect to every brain region, function, and is explored developmentally, in adulthood, aging, and in disease. However, the core issue of how to systematically threshold, taking into account the inherent differences in connectivity values for different track lengths, and to do this in a comparable way across studies has not been solved. The study adopted Monte Carlo derived distance-dependent distributions (DDDs) to generate distance-dependent thresholds with various levels of alpha for connections of varying lengths. As a test case, we applied the DDD approach to generate a language connectome. The resulting connectome showed expected short- and long-distance structural connectivity in the close and distant regions within the language network. The finding demonstrates that the DDD approach can be used for both individual and group thresholding. Critically, it offers a standard method that can be applied to various probabilistic tracking datasets.

                Using cross-experiment multivariate classification of EEG patterns, in a recent study we found evidence for a shared familiarity signal for faces, patterns of neural activity that successfully separate trials for familiar and unfamiliar faces across participants and modes of familiarization. Here, our aim was to expand upon this research to further characterize the spatio-temporal properties of this signal. By utilizing the information content present for incidental exposure to personally familiar and unfamiliar faces, we tested how the information content in the neural signal unfolds over time under different task demands - giving truthful or deceptive responses to photographs of genuinely familiar and unfamiliar individuals. For this goal, we re-analyzed data from two previously published experiments using within-experiment leave-one-subject-out and cross-experiment classification of face familiarity. We observed that the general face familiarity signal, consistent with its previously described spatio-temporal properties, is present for long-term personally familiar faces under passive viewing, as well as for acknowledged and concealed familiarity responses. Also, central-posterior regions contain information related to deception. We propose that signals in the 200-400 ms window are modulated by top-down task-related anticipation, while the patterns in the 400-600 ms window are influenced by conscious effort to deceive. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the representational dynamics of concealed knowledge for faces.

                Interoception is the sensation, perception, and control of signals from within the body. It has been associated with a broad range of physiological and psychological processes. Further, interoceptive variables are related to specific regions and networks in the human brain. However, it is not clear whether or how these networks relate empirically to different domains of physiological and psychological health at the population level.

We analysed a dataset of 19 020 individuals (10 055 females, 8 965 males; mean age: 63 years, age range: 45 - 81 years), who have participated in the UK Biobank Study, a very large scale prospective epidemiological health study. Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), allowing for the examination of associations between two sets of variables, we related the functional connectome of brain regions implicated in interoception to a selection of non-imaging health and lifestyle related phenotypes, exploring their relationship within modes of population co-variation.

In one integrated and data driven analysis, we obtained four statistically significant modes. Modes could be categorised into domains of affect and cardiovascular health, breathing, obesity, and subjective health (all p < 0.0001) and were meaningfully associated with distinct neural circuits.

Circuits represent specific neural "fingerprints" of functional domains and set the scope for future studies on the neurobiology of interoceptive involvement in different lifestyle and health related phenotypes. Therefore, our research contributes to the conceptualisation of interoception and may lead to a better understanding of co-morbid conditions in the light of shared interoceptive structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perinatal correlated retinal activity is required for the wiring of visual axons in non-image forming nuclei</a></h4>

              
                The formation of the visual system is a complex multistep process that includes proper assembly between retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon terminals and their relay neurons in the different visual nuclei of the brain. RGC axons reach the main image-forming nuclei (IFN) --the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus-- at perinatal stages and extensively arborize to then refine throughout the first postnatal weeks. Spontaneous activity generated in the immature retina plays an essential role in the fine-tune refinement of exhuberant axonal arborizations but the molecular mechanisms underlying this activity-dependent remodeling process remain poorly characterized. RGC axons, in addition to innervate IFN, target non-image forming nuclei (NIFN), but the impact of spontaneous retinal activity in the development of these accessory nuclei has not yet been described. Here, by genetically altering spontaneous activity in the RGCs of mice we demonstrate that correlated retinal activity also shapes the connectivity of the non-image forming circuit and identify the transcriptional programs modulating this process. Together, our data contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms ruling activity-dependent axon refining in the building of visual circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perceptual warping exposes categorical representations for speech in human brainstem responses</a></h4>

              
                The brain transforms continuous acoustic events into discrete category representations to downsample the speech signal for our perceptual-cognitive systems. Such phonetic categories are highly malleable and heir percepts can change depending on surrounding stimulus context. Previous work suggests these acoustic-phonetic mapping and perceptual warping of speech emerge in the brain no earlier than auditory cortex. Here, we examined whether these auditory-category phenomena inherent to speech perception occur even earlier in the human brain, at the level of auditory brainstem. We recorded speech-evoked frequency following responses (FFRs) during a task designed to induce more/less warping of listeners perceptual categories depending on stimulus presentation order of a speech continuum (random, forward, backward directions). We used a novel clustered stimulus paradigm to rapidly record the high trial counts needed for FFRs concurrent with active behavioral tasks. We found serial stimulus order caused perceptual shifts (hysteresis) near listeners category boundary confirming identical speech tokens are perceived differentially depending on stimulus context. Critically, we further show neural FFRs during active (but not passive) listening are enhanced for prototypical vs. category-ambiguous tokens and are biased in the direction of listeners phonetic label even for acoustically-identical speech stimuli. Our data expose FFRs carry category-level information and suggest top-down processing actively shapes the neural encoding and categorization of speech at subcortical levels. These findings suggest the acoustic-phonetic mapping and perceptual warping in speech perception occur surprisingly early along the auditory neuroaxis, which might aid understanding by reducing ambiguity inherent to the speech signal.
