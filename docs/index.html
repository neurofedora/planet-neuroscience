                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Do_lrXndo3s/article">A model for the origin and development of visual orientation selectivity</a></h4>

<p>by Gratia Nguyen, Alan W. Freeman</p>

Orientation selectivity is a key property of primary visual cortex that contributes, downstream, to object recognition. The origin of orientation selectivity, however, has been debated for decades. It is known that on- and off-centre subcortical pathways converge onto single neurons in primary visual cortex, and that the spatial offset between these pathways gives rise to orientation selectivity. On- and off-centre pathways are intermingled, however, so it is unclear how their inputs to cortex come to be spatially segregated. We here describe a model in which the segregation occurs through Hebbian strengthening and weakening of geniculocortical synapses during the development of the visual system. Our findings include the following. 1. Neighbouring on- and off-inputs to cortex largely cancelled each other at the start of development. At each receptive field location, the Hebbian process increased the strength of one input sign at the expense of the other sign, producing a spatial segregation of on- and off-inputs. 2. The resulting orientation selectivity was precise in that the bandwidths of the orientation tuning functions fell within empirical estimates. 3. The model produced maps of preferred orientation–complete with iso-orientation domains and pinwheels–similar to those found in real cortex. 4. These maps did not originate in cortical processes, but from clustering of off-centre subcortical pathways and the relative location of neighbouring on-centre clusters. We conclude that a model with intermingled on- and off-pathways shaped by Hebbian synaptic plasticity can explain both the origin and development of orientation selectivity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Do_lrXndo3s" width="1" />

<p>by Majed Mohamed Magzoub, Marcos Prunello, Kevin Brennan, Olivier Gevaert</p>

Aberrant DNA methylation disrupts normal gene expression in cancer and broadly contributes to oncogenesis. We previously developed MethylMix, a model-based algorithmic approach to identify epigenetically regulated driver genes. MethylMix identifies genes where methylation likely executes a functional role by using transcriptomic data to select only methylation events that can be linked to changes in gene expression. However, given that proteins more closely link genotype to phenotype recent high-throughput proteomic data provides an opportunity to more accurately identify functionally relevant abnormal methylation events. Here we present a MethylMix analysis that refines nominations for epigenetic driver genes by leveraging quantitative high-throughput proteomic data to select only genes where DNA methylation is predictive of protein abundance. Applying our algorithm across three cancer cohorts we find that using protein abundance data narrows candidate nominations, where the effect of DNA methylation is often buffered at the protein level. Next, we find that MethylMix genes predictive of protein abundance are enriched for biological processes involved in cancer including functions involved in epithelial and mesenchymal transition. Moreover, our results are also enriched for tumor markers which are predictive of clinical features like tumor stage and we find clustering using MethylMix genes predictive of protein abundance captures cancer subtypes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CacuunWYmno" width="1" />

Quantification of the effect of spatial tumour sampling on the patterns of mutations detected in next-generation sequencing data is largely lacking. Here we use a spatial stochastic cellular automaton model of tumour growth that accounts for somatic mutations, selection, drift and spatial constraints, to simulate multi-region sequencing data derived from spatial sampling of a neoplasm. We show that the spatial structure of a solid cancer has a major impact on the detection of clonal selection and genetic drift from both bulk and single-cell sequencing data. Our results indicate that spatial constrains can introduce significant sampling biases when performing multi-region bulk sampling and that such bias becomes a major confounding factor for the measurement of the evolutionary dynamics of human tumours. We also propose a statistical inference framework that incorporates spatial effects within a growing tumour and so represents a further step forwards in the inference evolutionary dynamics from genomic data. Our analysis shows that measuring cancer evolution using next-generation sequencing while accounting for the numerous confounding factors remains challenging. However, mechanistic model-based approaches have the potential to capture the sources of noise and better interpret the data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lVMwD1Xm2Mc" width="1" />

<p>by Lou Safra, Coralie Chevallier, Stefano Palminteri</p>

Depression is characterized by a marked decrease in social interactions and blunted sensitivity to rewards. Surprisingly, despite the importance of social deficits in depression, non-social aspects have been disproportionally investigated. As a consequence, the cognitive mechanisms underlying atypical decision-making in social contexts in depression are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate whether deficits in reward processing interact with the social context and how this interaction is affected by self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms in the general population. Two cohorts of subjects (discovery and replication sample: <i>N</i> = 50 each) took part in an experiment involving reward learning in contexts with different levels of social information (absent, partial and complete). Behavioral analyses revealed a specific detrimental effect of depressive symptoms–but not anxiety–on behavioral performance in the presence of social information, i.e. when participants were informed about the choices of another player. Model-based analyses further characterized the computational nature of this deficit as a negative audience effect, rather than a deficit in the way others’ choices and rewards are integrated in decision making. To conclude, our results shed light on the cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying the interaction between social cognition, reward learning and decision-making in depressive disorders.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PFRLQIsFE1w" width="1" />

<p>by Shiva Rudraraju, Derek E. Moulton, Régis Chirat, Alain Goriely, Krishna Garikipati</p>

Mollusk shells are an ideal model system for understanding the morpho-elastic basis of morphological evolution of invertebrates’ exoskeletons. During the formation of the shell, the mantle tissue secretes proteins and minerals that calcify to form a new incremental layer of the exoskeleton. Most of the existing literature on the morphology of mollusks is descriptive. The mathematical understanding of the underlying coupling between pre-existing shell morphology, <i>de novo</i> surface deposition and morpho-elastic volume growth is at a nascent stage, primarily limited to reduced geometric representations. Here, we propose a general, three-dimensional computational framework coupling pre-existing morphology, incremental surface growth by accretion, and morpho-elastic volume growth. We exercise this framework by applying it to explain the stepwise morphogenesis of seashells during growth: new material surfaces are laid down by accretive growth on the mantle whose form is determined by its morpho-elastic growth. Calcification of the newest surfaces extends the shell as well as creates a new scaffold that constrains the next growth step. We study the effects of surface and volumetric growth rates, and of previously deposited shell geometries on the resulting modes of mantle deformation, and therefore of the developing shell’s morphology. Connections are made to a range of complex shells ornamentations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0dZctqFEsGw" width="1" />

<p>by Jan R. Wessel, David E. Huber</p>

The brain constantly generates predictions about the environment to guide action. Unexpected events lead to surprise and can necessitate the modification of ongoing behavior. Surprise can occur for any sensory domain, but it is not clear how these separate surprise signals are integrated to affect motor output. By applying a trial-to-trial Bayesian surprise model to human electroencephalography data recorded during a cross-modal oddball task, we tested whether there are separate predictive models for different sensory modalities (visual, auditory), or whether expectations are integrated across modalities such that surprise in one modality decreases surprise for a subsequent unexpected event in the other modality. We found that while surprise was represented in a common frontal signature across sensory modalities (the fronto-central P3 event-related potential), the single-trial amplitudes of this signature more closely conformed to a model with separate surprise terms for each sensory domain. We then investigated whether surprise-related fronto-central P3 activity indexes the rapid inhibitory control of ongoing behavior after surprise, as suggested by recent theories. Confirming this prediction, the fronto-central P3 amplitude after both auditory and visual unexpected events was highly correlated with the fronto-central P3 found after stop-signals (measured in a separate stop-signal task). Moreover, surprise-related and stopping-related activity loaded onto the same component in a cross-task independent components analysis. Together, these findings suggest that medial frontal cortex maintains separate predictive models for different sensory domains, but engages a common mechanism for inhibitory control of behavior regardless of the source of surprise.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TPaom7ceY60" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Although TWIK-related spinal cord K<sup>+</sup> (TRESK) channel is expressed in all primary afferent neurons in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), whether TRESK activity regulates trigeminal pain processing is still not established. Dominant-negative TRESK mutations are associated with migraine but not with other types of pain in humans, suggesting that genetic TRESK dysfunction preferentially affects the generation of trigeminal pain, especially headache. Using TRESK global knock-out mice as a model system, we found that loss of TRESK in all TG neurons selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter nociceptors, especially those that do not bind to isolectin B4 (IB4<sup>–</sup>). Similarly, loss of TRESK resulted in hyper-excitation of the small IB4<sup>–</sup> dural afferent neurons but not those that bind to IB4 (IB4<sup>+</sup>). Compared with wild-type littermates, both male and female TRESK knock-out mice exhibited more robust trigeminal nociceptive behaviors, including headache-related behaviors, whereas their body and visceral pain responses were normal. Interestingly, neither the total persistent outward current nor the intrinsic excitability was altered in adult TRESK knock-out DRG neurons, which may explain why genetic TRESK dysfunction is not associated with body and/or visceral pain in humans. We reveal for the first time that, among all primary afferent neurons, TG nociceptors are the most vulnerable to the genetic loss of TRESK. Our findings indicate that endogenous TRESK activity regulates trigeminal nociception, likely through controlling the intrinsic excitability of TG nociceptors. Importantly, we provide evidence that genetic loss of TRESK significantly increases the likelihood of developing headache.</p>

Abstract
<p>The paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) regulates stress, feeding behaviors and other homeostatic processes, but whether PVH also drives defensive states remains unknown. Here we showed that photostimulation of PVH neurons in mice elicited escape jumping, a typical defensive behavior. We mapped PVH outputs that densely terminate in the ventral midbrain (vMB) area, and found that activation of the PVH-&gt;vMB circuit produced profound defensive behavioral changes, including escape jumping, hiding, hyperlocomotion, and learned aversion. Electrophysiological recordings showed excitatory postsynaptic input onto vMB neurons via PVH fiber activation, and <i>in vivo</i> studies demonstrated that glutamate transmission from PVH-&gt;vMB was required for the evoked behavioral responses. Photostimulation of PVH-&gt;vMB fibers induced cFos expression mainly in non-dopaminergic neurons. Using a dual optogenetic-chemogenetic strategy, we further revealed that escape jumping and hiding were partially contributed by the activation of midbrain glutamatergic neurons. Taken together, our work unveils a hypothalamic-vMB circuit that encodes defensive properties, which may be implicated in stress-induced defensive responses.</p>

Abstract<p>The prefrontal cortex plays a central role in guiding decision-making, and its function is altered by alcohol use and an individual’s innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. The primary goal of this work was to determine how neural activity in the prefrontal cortex guides the decision to drink. Towards this goal, the within-session changes in neural activity were measured from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats performing a drinking procedure that allowed them to consume or abstain from alcohol in a self-paced manner. Recordings were obtained from rats that either lacked or expressed an innate risk for excessive alcohol intake - Wistar or Alcohol Preferring ‘P’ rats, respectively. Wistar rats exhibited patterns of neural activity consistent with the intention to drink or abstain from drinking, whereas these patterns were blunted or absent in P rats. Collectively, these data indicate that neural activity patterns in mPFC associated with the intention to drink alcohol are influenced by innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. This observation may indicate a lack of control over the decision to drink by this otherwise well-validated supervisory brain region.</p><p><b>Significance Statement:</b> Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are fundamentally disorders in decision-making; specifically alcohol drinking decisions. Thus, identifying the neural mechanisms regulating drinking decisions may lead to unique prevention and intervention strategies. The current study demonstrates that the intent to drink alcohol is encoded by the activity of neural populations within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, the encoding of this intention signal is greatly reduced in a population of rodents with an extensive family history of high alcohol consumption. These data suggest that identifying strategies to restore the contribution of mPFC in the decision to drink alcohol may provide effective targets to treat an AUD, particularly in those with family history of AUDs.</p>

Abstract<p>One way that drugs of abuse perturb the dopamine system is by triggering large amounts of extracellular dopamine efflux into limbic regions.

After &gt;3 weeks of chained seek-take self-administration of cocaine, male Long Evans rats were given a bilateral intra-BLA or intra-CeA infusion of the D1 antagonist SCH-23390 (2 µg/0.3 µL) for multiple days. Intra-BLA D1 receptor blockade before, but not after the self-administration session, gradually suppressed drug seeking and taking responses and persisted with a change in context with continued D1 blockade. In contrast, intra-CeA D1 receptor blockade caused a rapid reduction in self-administration that showed renewal with a change in context with continued D1 blockade. Further, conditioned place aversion developed with intra-BLA but not intra-CeA infusions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that dopamine D1 receptors in the BLA and CeA both contribute to drug seeking and taking, but may do so through distinct mechanisms.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Drugs of abuse perturb the dopamine system by triggering large amounts of dopamine to efflux into limbic regions.

Abstract<p>In the mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), inhibitory interneurons play an essential role in gating behaviors elicited by sensory exposure to social odors. Several morphological classes have been described, but the full complement of interneurons remains incomplete. In order to develop a more comprehensive view of interneuron function in the AOB, we performed targeted patch clamp recordings from partially-overlapping subsets of genetically-labeled and morphologically-defined interneuron types. <i>Gad2</i> (GAD65), <i>Calb2</i> (calretinin), and <i>Cort</i> (cortistatin)-cre mouse lines were used to drive selective expression of tdTomato in AOB interneurons. <i>Gad2</i> and <i>Calb2-</i>labeled interneurons were found in the internal, external, and glomerular layers, whereas <i>Cort</i>-labeled interneurons were enriched within the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) and external cellular layer (ECL). We found that external granule cells (EGCs) from all genetically-labeled subpopulations possessed intrinsic functional differences that allowed them to be readily distinguished from internal granule cells (IGCs). EGCs showed stronger voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and non-inactivating voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> currents, decreased I<sub>H</sub> currents, and robust excitatory synaptic input. These specific intrinsic properties did not correspond to any genetically-labeled type, suggesting that transcriptional heterogeneity among EGCs and IGCs is not correlated with expression of these particular marker genes. Intrinsic heterogeneity was also seen among AOB juxtaglomerular cells (JGCs), with a major subset of <i>Calb2</i>-labeled JGCs exhibiting spontaneous and depolarization-evoked plateau potentials. These data identify specific physiological features of AOB interneurons types that will assist in future studies of AOB function.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) plays a critical role in processing social chemosensory information. Several morphologically-identified types of AOB inhibitory interneurons are thought to refine and restrict information flow from the AOB to its downstream targets in the limbic system. However, little is known about the electrophysiological and transcriptional diversity among AOB interneuron types. We systematically investigated intrinsic electrophysiological diversity across 5 AOB cell populations in three transgenic mouse lines. Analysis of 26 intrinsic physiological features revealed feature combinations associated with identified morphological AOB cell types, but few associated with the transgenic lines we studied. The results provide quantitative information about functional diversity in AOB interneurons and provide an improved foundation for future studies of AOB circuit function.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe early functional outcomes of nerve transfer surgery in a relatively large cohort of patients with Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Retrospective case analysis of patients with AFM treated with nerve transfer surgery between 2007 and 2018. Surgical criteria were persistent motor deficits after 6 months from onset and available donor nerves. Thirty‐two patients with AFM were evaluated, 16 underwent nerve transfer surgeries. Motor function was evaluated by a licensed occupational therapist using the Active Movement Scale (AMS) preoperatively and during follow‐up examinations. Patients with 6 or more months of follow‐up were included in the analysis. Patients with procedures other than nerve transfers were excluded.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sixteen patients with AFM had nerve transfers, with a male predominance (75%) and median age of 2.5 years (range 4 months‐12 years). Eleven patients had a minimum 6 months follow‐up. Nerve transfers to restore elbow function had 87% excellent recovery for elbow flexion and 67% for elbow extension. Finger and thumb extension were full against gravity in one patient (100%). Shoulder external rotation was excellent in 50% of patients and shoulder abduction in only 20%. Nine out of 10 patients (90%) had resolution of shoulder pseudosubluxation following nerve transfer to the suprascapular nerve.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with AFM with persistent motor deficits after 6 to 9 months after onset benefit from nerve transfer surgery. Restoration of elbow function was more reliable than restoration of shoulder function. We recommend early referral of patients with incomplete recovery to an experienced center in nerve transfers for timely evaluation and treatment.</p>

<p>Correlated electrical activity in neurons is a prominent characteristic of
cortical microcircuits. Despite a growing amount of evidence concerning both
spike-count and subthreshold membrane potential pairwise correlations, little
is known about how different types of cortical neurons convert correlated
inputs into correlated outputs. We studied pyramidal neurons and two classes of
GABAergic interneurons of layer 5 in neocortical brain slices obtained from
rats of both sexes, and we stimulated them with biophysically realistic
correlated inputs, generated using dynamic clamp. We found that the
physiological differences between cell types manifested unique features in
their capacity to transfer correlated inputs. We used linear response theory
and computational modeling to gain clear insights into how cellular properties
determine both the gain and timescale of correlation transfer, thus tying
single-cell features with network interactions. Our results provide further
ground for the functionally distinct roles played by various types of neuronal
cells in the cortical microcircuit.

<p>Identifying the physiological processes underlying the emergence and
maintenance of consciousness is one of the most fundamental problems of
neuroscience, with implications ranging from fundamental neuroscience to the
treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). One major
challenge is to understand how cortical circuits at drastically different
spatial scales, from local networks to brain-scale networks, operate in concert
to enable consciousness, and how those processes are impaired in DOC patients.
In this review, we attempt to relate available neurophysiological and clinical
data with existing theoretical models of consciousness, while linking the
micro- and macro-circuit levels. First, we address the relationships between
awareness and wakefulness on the one hand, and cortico-cortical, and
thalamo-cortical connectivity on the other hand. Second, we discuss the role of
three main types of GABAergic interneurons in specific circuits responsible for
the dynamical re-organization of functional networks. Third, we explore
advances in the functional role of nested oscillations for neural
synchronization and communication, emphasizing the importance of the balance
between local (high-frequency) and distant (low-frequency) activity for
efficient information processing. The clinical implications of these
theoretical considerations are presented. We propose that such cellular-scale
mechanisms could extend current theories of consciousness.

<p>Interaction mechanism in the acoustic communication of actual animals is
investigated by combining mathematical modeling and empirical data. Here we use
a deterministic mathematical model (a phase oscillator model) to describe the
interaction mechanism underlying the choruses of male Japanese tree frogs (Hyla
japonica) in which the male frogs attempt to avoid call overlaps with each
other due to acoustic communication. The mathematical model with a general
interaction term is identified by a Bayesian approach from multiple audio
recordings on the choruses of three male frogs. The identified model
qualitatively reproduces the stationary and dynamical features of the empirical
data, supporting the validity of the model identification. In addition, we
quantify the magnitude of attention paid among the male frogs from the
identified model, and then analyze the relationship between the attention and
behavioral parameters by using a statistical model. The analysis demonstrates
the biologically valid relationship about the negative correlation between the
attention and inter-frog distance, and also indicates the existence of a
behavioral strategy that the male frogs selectively pay attention towards a
less attractive male frog so as to utilize the advantage of their
attractiveness for effective mate attraction.

<p>Synthetic lethality, the finding that the simultaneous knockout of two or
more individually non-essential genes leads to cell or organism death, has
offered a systematic framework to explore cellular function, and also offered
therapeutic applications. Yet, the concept lacks its parallel in neuroscience -
a systematic knowledge base on the role of double or higher order ablations in
the functioning of a neural system. Here, we use the framework of network
control to systematically predict the ablation of neuron pairs and triplets. We
find that surprisingly small sets of 58 pairs and 46 triplets can reduce muscle
controllability, and that these sets are localised in the nervous system in
distinct groups. Further, they lead to highly specific experimentally testable
predictions about mechanisms of loss of control, and which muscle cells are
expected to experience this loss.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10658">Neural Networks as Model Selection with Incremental MDL Normalization. (arXiv:1902.10658v6 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>If we consider the neural network optimization process as a model selection
problem, the implicit space can be constrained by the normalizing factor, the
minimum description length of the optimal universal code. Inspired by the
adaptation phenomenon of biological neuronal firing, we propose a class of
reparameterization of the activation in the neural network that take into
account the statistical regularity in the implicit space under the Minimum
Description Length (MDL) principle. We introduce an incremental version of
computing this universal code as normalized maximum likelihood and demonstrated
its flexibility to include data prior such as top-down attention and other
oracle information and its compatibility to be incorporated into batch
normalization and layer normalization. The empirical results showed that the
proposed method outperforms existing normalization methods in tackling the
limited and imbalanced data from a non-stationary distribution benchmarked on
computer vision and reinforcement learning tasks. As an unsupervised attention
mechanism given input data, this biologically plausible normalization has the
potential to deal with other complicated real-world scenarios as well as
reinforcement learning setting where the rewards are sparse and non-uniform.
Further research is proposed to discover these scenarios and explore the
behaviors among different variants.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48788">Lmx1b is required at multiple stages to build expansive serotonergic axon architectures</a></h4>

Formation of long-range axons occurs over multiple stages of morphological maturation. However, the intrinsic transcriptional mechanisms that temporally control different stages of axon projection development are unknown. Here, we addressed this question by studying the formation of mouse serotonin (5-HT) axons, the exemplar of long-range profusely arborized axon architectures. We report that LIM homeodomain factor 1b (Lmx1b)-deficient 5-HT neurons fail to generate axonal projections to the forebrain and spinal cord. Stage-specific targeting demonstrates that Lmx1b is required at successive stages to control 5-HT axon primary outgrowth, selective routing, and terminal arborization. We show a Lmx1b→Pet1 regulatory cascade is temporally required for 5-HT arborization and upregulation of the 5-HT axon arborization gene, Protocadherin-alphac2, during postnatal development of forebrain 5-HT axons. Our findings identify a temporal regulatory mechanism in which a single continuously expressed transcription factor functions at successive stages to orchestrate the progressive development of long-range axon architectures enabling expansive neuromodulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47988">Two mechanisms regulate directional cell growth in <i>Arabidopsis</i> lateral roots</a></h4>

Morphogenesis in plants depends critically on directional (anisotropic) growth. This occurs principally perpendicular to the net orientation of cellulose microfibrils (CMFs), which is in turn controlled by cortical microtubules (CMTs). In young lateral roots of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, growth anisotropy also depends on RAB-A5c, a plant-specific small GTPase that specifies a membrane trafficking pathway to the geometric edges of cells. Here we investigate the functional relationship between structural anisotropy at faces and RAB-A5c activity at edges during lateral root development. We show that surprisingly, inhibition of RAB-A5c function is associated with increased CMT/CMF anisotropy. We present genetic, pharmacological, and modelling evidence that this increase in CMT/CMF anisotropy partially compensates for loss of an independent RAB-A5c-mediated mechanism that maintains anisotropic growth in meristematic cells. We show that RAB-A5c associates with CMTs at cell edges, indicating that CMTs act as an integration point for both mechanisms controlling cellular growth anisotropy in lateral roots.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47891">Epimutations are associated with CHROMOMETHYLASE 3-induced de novo DNA methylation</a></h4>

In many plant species, a subset of transcribed genes are characterized by strictly CG-context DNA methylation, referred to as gene body methylation (gbM). The mechanisms that establish gbM are unclear, yet flowering plant species naturally without gbM lack the DNA methyltransferase, CMT3, which maintains CHG (H = A, C, or T) and not CG methylation at constitutive heterochromatin. Here, we identify the mechanistic basis for gbM establishment by expressing <i>CMT3</i> in a species naturally lacking <i>CMT3. CMT3</i> expression reconstituted gbM through a progression of de novo CHG methylation on expressed genes, followed by the accumulation of CG methylation that could be inherited even following loss of the <i>CMT3</i> transgene. Thus, gbM likely originates from the simultaneous targeting of loci by pathways that promote euchromatin and heterochromatin, which primes genes for the formation of stably inherited epimutations in the form of CG DNA methylation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47837">Spinal V2b neurons reveal a role for ipsilateral inhibition in speed control</a></h4>

The spinal cord contains a diverse array of interneurons that govern motor output. Traditionally, models of spinal circuits have emphasized the role of inhibition in enforcing reciprocal alternation between left and right sides or flexors and extensors. However, recent work has shown that inhibition also increases coincident with excitation during contraction. Here, using larval zebrafish, we investigate the V2b (Gata3+) class of neurons, which contribute to flexor-extensor alternation but are otherwise poorly understood. Using newly generated transgenic lines we define two stable subclasses with distinct neurotransmitter and morphological properties. These V2b subclasses synapse directly onto motor neurons with differential targeting to speed-specific circuits. <i>In vivo</i>, optogenetic manipulation of V2b activity modulates locomotor frequency: suppressing V2b neurons elicits faster locomotion, whereas activating V2b neurons slows locomotion. We conclude that V2b neurons serve as a brake on axial motor circuits. Together, these results indicate a role for ipsilateral inhibition in speed control.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47037">A new family of cell surface located purine transporters in Microsporidia and related fungal endoparasites</a></h4>

Plasma membrane-located transport proteins are key adaptations for obligate intracellular Microsporidia parasites, because they can use them to steal host metabolites the parasites need to grow and replicate. However, despite their importance, the functions and substrate specificities of most Microsporidia transporters are unknown. Here we provide functional data for a family of transporters conserved in all microsporidian genomes and also in the genomes of related endoparasites. The universal retention among otherwise highly reduced genomes indicates an important role for these transporters for intracellular parasites. Using <i>Trachipleistophora hominis</i>, a Microsporidia isolated from an HIV/AIDS patient, as our experimental model, we show that the proteins are ATP and GTP transporters located on the surface of parasites during their intracellular growth and replication. Our work identifies a new route for the acquisition of essential energy and nucleotides for a major group of intracellular parasites that infect most animal species including humans.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44320">Sub-second dynamics of theta-gamma coupling in Hippocampal CA1</a></h4>

Oscillatory brain activity reflects different internal brain states including neurons' excitatory state and synchrony among neurons. However, characterizing these states is complicated by the fact that different oscillations are often coupled, such as gamma oscillations nested in theta in the hippocampus, and changes in coupling are thought to reflect distinct states. Here, we describe a new method to separate single oscillatory cycles into distinct states based on frequency and phase coupling. Using this method, we identified four theta-gamma coupling states in rat hippocampal CA1. These states differed in abundance across behaviors, phase synchrony with other hippocampal subregions, and neural coding properties suggesting that these states are functionally distinct. We captured cycle-to-cycle changes in oscillatory coupling states and found frequent switching between theta-gamma states showing that the hippocampus rapidly shifts between different functional states. This method provides a new approach to investigate oscillatory brain dynamics broadly.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Past studies have demonstrated that flexible interactions between brain regions support a wide range of goal-directed behaviors. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie adaptive communication between brain regions are not well understood. In this study, we combined theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the sources of top-down biasing signals that influence task-evoked functional connectivity. Subjects viewed sequences of images of faces and buildings and were required to detect repetitions (2-back vs. 1-back) of the attended stimuli category (faces or buildings). We found that functional connectivity between ventral temporal cortex and the primary visual cortex (VC) increased during processing of task-relevant stimuli, especially during higher memory loads. Furthermore, the strength of functional connectivity was greater for correct trials. Increases in task-evoked functional connectivity strength were correlated with increases in activity in multiple frontal, parietal, and subcortical (caudate and thalamus) regions. Finally, we found that TMS to superior intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but not to primary somatosensory cortex, decreased task-specific modulation in connectivity patterns between the primary VC and the parahippocampal place area. These findings demonstrate that the human IPS is a source of top-down biasing signals that modulate task-evoked functional connectivity among task-relevant cortical regions.</span>

Inclusion of female subjects in biomedical research is imperative for understanding the mechanisms of age-related cognitive decline, as more than half of individuals older than 65 are female. Few behavioral and physical assays, however, have been conducted in both sexes within the same study. In the current experiments young and aged male and female rats underwent a battery of cognitive and physical assessments to examine for potential sex and age differences. Physical performance was measured with a rotarod test of motor coordination, assessment of maximum grip strength and swim speed. While there were differences between males and females in rotarod and grip strength, there was also a clear age-dependent decline in physical performance in both sexes. Cognitive assessment included the Morris watermaze test of hippocampal dependent spatial navigation and a biconditional association task (BAT) with a working memory (WM) component. Notably, a similar BAT has previously been validated as a more sensitive assay of age-related cognitive decline than the watermaze in male rats, which is replicated here in both female and male rats. Furthermore, young and aged female rats both spent a similar percent of time in each estrus cycle phase and phase did not influence WM/BAT performance. In conclusion, robust age differences in biconditional association task performance are observed in both sexes with no need for increased cohort size. Thus, future studies utilizing similar behavioral paradigms should be representative of the human population they intend to model through the inclusion of female subjects.

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Recent observations have revealed an association between mood disorders and alterations of the intestinal microbiota, but causality remains yet to be established. Here, using unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) as a mouse model of depression, we show that the UCMS mice display phenotypic alterations characterized by an altered gut microbiota composition, a reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis and a depressive-like behaviors. These phenotypes could be transferred from UCMS donors to naive recipient mice by fecal microbiota transplantation. The cellular and behavioral alterations observed in recipient mice were accompanied by a decrease in the endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling due to lower peripheral levels of fatty acid precursors of eCB ligands. The adverse effects of UCMS-transferred microbiota on adult neurogenesis and behavior in naive recipient mice were alleviated by selectively enhancing the central eCB tone or by adding arachidonic acid, a fatty acid precursor of eCB ligands, to the diet. In the gut of both UCMS donors and recipients, the microbiota composition was characterized by a relative decrease in Lactobacilli abundance, and complementation of the UCMS recipient microbiota with a strain of the Lactobacilli genus was sufficient to restore normal eCB brain levels, hippocampal neurogenesis and to alleviate depressive-like behaviors. Our findings provide a mechanistic scenario for how chronic stress, diet and gut microbiota dysbiosis generate a pathological feed-forward loop that contributes to despair behavior via the central eCB system.

Moral behaviour requires learning how our actions help or harm others. Theoretical accounts of learning propose a key division between "model-free" algorithms that efficiently cache outcome values in actions and "model-based" algorithms that prospectively map actions to outcomes, a distinction that may be critical for moral learning. Here, we tested the engagement of these learning mechanisms and their neural basis as participants learned to avoid painful electric shocks for themselves and a stranger. We found that model-free learning was prioritized when avoiding harm to others compared to oneself. Model-free prediction errors for others relative to self were tracked in the thalamus/caudate at the time of the outcome. At the time of choice, a signature of model-free moral learning was associated with responses in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), and resisting this model-free influence was predicted by stronger connectivity between sgACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Finally, multiple behavioural and neural correlates of model-free moral learning varied with individual differences in moral judgment. Our findings suggest moral learning favours efficiency over flexibility and is underpinned by specific neural mechanisms.

Midbrain dopamine neurons play physiological roles in reward learning and motivated behavior. Inhibitory signaling at somatodendritic dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) synapses modulates excitability of dopamine neurons. The neuropeptide neurotensin is expressed by many inputs to the midbrain and induces long-term depression of D2R synaptic currents (LTDDA), however the source of neurotensin that drives LTDDA is not known. Here we show that LTDDA is driven by neurotensin released by dopamine neurons. Optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons was sufficient to induce LTDDA in the substantia nigra, but not the ventral tegmental area, and was dependent on neurotensin receptors, postsynaptic calcium, and vacuolar-type H+-ATPase activity in the postsynaptic cell. These findings reveal a novel form of signaling between dopamine neurons involving release of the peptide neurotensin, which may act as a feed forward mechanism to increase dopamine neuron excitability.

At birth, descending pathways are still maturing and spinal networks function at a lower excitability state characterized by spontaneous activity. The effects of monoamines, however, are typically examined when spinal networks are in high excitability states when drug-evoked locomotor activity is induced. A gap in our knowledge is how monoamines affect neonatal spinal networks under more physiological, low-state, conditions. Here, we explored receptor and cellular mechanisms mediating dose-dependent control of dopamine on spinal motor networks of the neonatal mouse in vitro. During a low excitability state, low concentrations of dopamine suppressed spontaneous activity by acting on D2, D3, D4 and 2-adrenergic receptors in parallel. Network inhibition was reproduced by blocking dopamine reuptake and metabolism to augment endogenous dopamine levels. Activation of D2 receptors hyperpolarized a subset (33%) of ventral interneurons, but not motoneurons. Similar proportions of descending commissural and V3 interneurons were hyperpolarized indicating that D2 actions are not localized to particular classes of interneurons consistent with the kernel of the locomotor central pattern generator being distributed across several interneuronal classes. High concentrations of dopamine produced excitatory effects mediated mainly by a D1 receptor-mediated increase in motoneuron excitability. High concentrations of dopamine also increased spinal network activity by co-activating D1 and D2 receptors. Our data indicate that the actions of neuromodulators are codependent on their receptor targets and the network state. Under low excitability states, our findings also explain how receptor and cellular mechanisms contribute to the diverse, concentration-dependent control of spinal networks in the neonatal mouse.

The Otx2 homeoprotein transcription factor is expressed in the dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, a mesencephalic nucleus involved in the control of complex behaviors through its projections to limbic structures, including the ventral hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. We find adult mice heterozygous for Otx2 show a hypoanxious phenotype in light-dark box and elevated plus maze paradigms. However, the number of dopaminergic neurons, the integrity of their axons, their projection patterns in target structures, and the amounts of dopamine and dopamine metabolites in targets structures were not modified in the Otx2 mutant. Because OTX2 is expressed by the choroid plexus, secreted into cerebrospinal fluid and transferred to parvalbumin interneurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, we investigated if the hypoanxiety of Otx2 heterozygous mice could result from the decreased synthesis of Otx2 in the choroid plexus. Indeed, hypoanxious phenotype was reversed by the overexpression of Otx2 specifically in choroid plexus of adult Otx2 heterozygous mice, while hypoanxious phenotype could be induced in adult wild type mice by lowering OTX2 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Taken together, OTX2 synthesis by the choroid plexus followed by its secretion into the cerebrospinal fluid is an important regulator of the anxiety phenotype in the mouse.

The research-grade ADOS is a broadly used instrument that informs and steers much of the science of Autism. Despite its broad use, little is known about the empirical variability inherently present in the scores of the ADOS scale, or their appropriateness to define change, to repeatedly use this test to characterize neurodevelopmental trajectories. Here we examine the empirical distributions of research-grade ADOS scores from 1,324 records in a cross-section of the population comprising participants with autism between 5-65 years of age. We find that these empirical distributions violate the theoretical requirements of normality and homogeneous variance, essential for independence between bias and sensitivity. Further, we assess a subset of 52 typical controls vs. those with autism and find lack of proper elements to characterize neurodevelopmental trajectories in a coping nervous system changing at non-uniform, non-linear rates. Lastly, longitudinally repeating the assessments over 4 visits in a subset of the participants with autism for whom verbal criteria kept the same appropriate ADOS modules over the timespan of the 4 visits, reveals that switching the clinician, changes the cutoff scores, and consequently, influences the diagnosis, despite maintaining fidelity in the same test's modules, room conditions and tasks' fluidity per visit. Given the changes in probability distribution shape and dispersion of these ADOS scores, the lack of appropriate metric spaces, and the impact that these elements have on sensitivity-bias co-dependencies, and on longitudinal tracking of autism, we invite a discussion on the use of this test for scientific purposes.

Individual variation in the addiction liability of amphetamines has a heritable genetic component. We previously identified Hnrnph1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1) as a quantitative trait gene underlying decreased methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity in mice. Here, mice with a heterozygous mutation in the first coding exon of Hnrnph1 (H1+/-) showed reduced methamphetamine reinforcement and intake and dose-dependent changes in methamphetamine reward as measured via conditioned place preference. Furthermore, H1+/- mice showed a robust decrease in methamphetamine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens with no change in baseline extracellular dopamine, striatal whole tissue dopamine, dopamine transporter protein, or dopamine uptake. Immunohistochemical and immunoblot staining of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and their forebrain projections for tyrosine hydroxylase did not reveal any major changes in staining intensity, cell number, or in the number of forebrain puncta. Surprisingly, there was a two-fold increase in hnRNP H protein in the striatal synaptosome of H1+/- mice with no change in whole tissue levels. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms linking increased synaptic hnRNP H with decreased methamphetamine-induced dopamine release and behaviors, synaptosomal proteomic analysis identified an increased baseline abundance of several mitochondrial complex I and V proteins that rapidly decreased at 30 min post-methamphetamine administration in H1+/- mice. In contrast, the much lower level of basal synaptosomal mitochondrial proteins in wild-type mice showed a rapid increase in response to methamphetamine. We conclude that H1+/- decreases methamphetamine-induced dopamine release, reward, and reinforcement and induces dynamic changes in basal and methamphetamine-induced synaptic mitochondrial function.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/717553v1?rss=1">Increased sensorimotor activity during categorisation of ambiguous emotional expressions</a></h4>

Actions are rarely devoid of emotional content. Thus, a more complete picture of the neural mechanisms underlying mental simulation of observed actions requires more research using emotion information. The present study used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate mental simulation associated with facial emotion categorisation. Mu rhythm modulation was measured to infer the degree of sensorimotor simulation. Categorising static images of neutral faces as happy or sad was associated with stronger mu suppression than categorising clearly happy or sad faces. Results suggest the sensitivity of the sensorimotor activity to emotional information rather than visual attentional engagement, because further control analyses revealed (1) no effect of emotion type on occipital alpha modulation, and (2) no difference in mu modulation between the conditions of a control task, which required categorising images with the head oriented right, left, or forward as right or left. This finding provides evidence for the role of the sensorimotor activity in a higher form of mental simulation. Consistent with a predictive coding account of action perception, stronger mu suppression during attempted emotion categorisation of neutral faces may involve minimising the mismatch between predicted kinematics of a happy/sad face and the observed stationarity of neutral faces.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/717512v1?rss=1">fMRI reveals language-specific predictive coding during naturalistic sentence comprehension</a></h4>

Much research in cognitive neuroscience supports prediction as a canonical computation of cognition in many domains. Is such predictive coding implemented by feedback from higher-order domain-general circuits, or is it locally implemented in domain-specific circuits? What information sources are used to generate these predictions? This study addresses these two questions in the context of language processing. We present fMRI evidence from a naturalistic comprehension paradigm (1) that predictive coding in the brain's response to language is domain-specific, and (2) that these predictions are sensitive both to local word co-occurrence patterns and to hierarchical structure. Using a recently developed deconvolutional time series regression technique that supports data-driven hemodynamic response function discovery from continuous BOLD signal fluctuations in response to naturalistic stimuli, we found we found effects of prediction measures in the language network but not in the domain-general, multiple-demand network. Moreover, within the language network, surface-level and structural prediction effects were separable. The predictability effects in the language network were substantial, with the model capturing over 37% of explainable variance on held-out data. These findings indicate that human sentence processing mechanisms generate predictions about upcoming words using cognitive processes that are sensitive to hierarchical structure and specialized for language processing, rather than via feedback from high-level executive control mechanisms.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Quantification of gait with wearable technology is promising; recent cross‐sectional studies showed that gait characteristics are potential prodromal markers for Parkinson disease (PD). The aim of this longitudinal prospective observational study was to establish gait impairments and trajectories in the prodromal phase of PD, identifying which gait characteristics are potentially early diagnostic markers of PD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The 696 healthy controls (mean age = 63 ± 7 years) recruited in the Tubingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration study were included. Assessments were performed longitudinally 4 times at 2‐year intervals, and people who converted to PD were identified. Participants were asked to walk at different speeds under single and dual tasking, with a wearable device placed on the lower back; 14 validated clinically relevant gait characteristics were quantified. Cox regression was used to examine whether gait at first visit could predict time to PD conversion after controlling for age and sex. Random effects linear mixed models (RELMs) were used to establish longitudinal trajectories of gait and model the latency between impaired gait and PD diagnosis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sixteen participants were diagnosed with PD on average 4.5 years after first visit (converters; PDC). Higher step time variability and asymmetry of all gait characteristics were associated with a shorter time to PD diagnosis. RELMs indicated that gait (lower pace) deviates from that of non‐PDC approximately 4 years prior to diagnosis.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Together with other prodromal markers, quantitative gait characteristics can play an important role in identifying prodromal PD and progression within this phase. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Accumulating data highlight the contribution of brain mitochondria and bioenergetics to psychiatric disorders and stress-related pathologies. Although anxiety has not received much attention in this booming literature, a bidirectional interplay between anxiety and brain mitochondria and metabolism has recently started to emerge. Substantial observations indicate alterations in mitochondria and metabolism in highly anxious individuals and, conversely, anxiety symptoms in humans suffering from mitochondrial disorders.

Animals use auditory cues generated by defensive responses of others to detect impending danger. Here we identify a neural circuit in rats involved in the detection of one such auditory cue, the cessation of movement-evoked sound resulting from freezing. This circuit comprises the dorsal sub-nucleus of the medial geniculate body (MGD) and downstream areas, the ventral area of the auditory cortex (VA) and the lateral amygdala (LA). This study suggests a role for the auditory offset pathway in processing a natural sound cue of threat.

Sleep, a universal behavior, is critical for diverse aspects of brain function. Chronic sleep disturbance is associated with numerous health consequences, including neurodegenerative disease and cognitive decline. Neurite damage due to apoptosis, trauma, or genetic factors is a common feature of aging, and clearance of damaged neurons is essential for maintenance of brain function. In the central nervous system, damaged neurites are cleared by Wallerian degeneration, in which activated microglia and macrophages engulf damaged neurons. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful model for investigating the relationship between sleep and Wallerian degeneration. Several lines of evidence suggest that glia influence sleep duration, sleep-mediated neuronal homeostasis, and clearance of toxic substances during sleep, raising the possibility that glial engulfment of damaged axons is regulated by sleep. To explore this possibility, we axotomized olfactory receptor neurons and measured the effects of sleep loss or gain on the clearance of damaged neurites. Mechanical sleep deprivation impaired the clearance of damaged neurites, whereas the sleep-promoting drug gaboxadol accelerated clearance. In sleep-deprived animals, multiple markers of glial activation were delayed, including activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, upregulation of the cell corpse engulfment receptor Draper, and innervation of the antennal lobe by glial membranes. These markers were all enhanced when sleep was induced in gaboxadol-treated flies. Taken together, these findings reveal a critical role for sleep in regulation glial activation and engulfment following axotomy, providing a platform for further investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep-dependent modulation of glial function and neurite clearance.nnHighlightsO_LISleep deprivation impairs Wallerian degeneration in fruit flies.nC_LIO_LIPharmacological induction of sleep accelerates Wallerian degeneration.nC_LIO_LISleep promotes innervation surrounding damaged neurites by phagocytic glia.nC_LIO_LISleep increases levels of the glial activation markers Draper and Stat92E.nC_LI

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/716761v1?rss=1">Temperature compensation in a small rhythmic circuit</a></h4>

Temperature affects the conductances and kinetics of the ionic channels that underlie neuronal activity. Each membrane conductance has a different characteristic temperature sensitivity, which raises the question of how neurons and neuronal circuits can operate robustly over wide temperature ranges. To address this, we employed computational models of the pyloric network of crabs and lobsters. We produced multiple different models that exhibit a triphasic pyloric rhythm over a range of temperatures and explored the dynamics of their currents and how they change with temperature. We found that temperature changes the relative contributions of the currents to neuronal activity so that rhythmic activity smoothly slides through changes in mechanisms. Moreover, the responses of the models to extreme perturbations--such as gradually decreasing a current type--are often qualitatively different at different temperatures.

The human anterior insula (aINS) is a topographically organized brain region, in which ventral portions contribute to socio-emotional function through limbic and autonomic connections, whereas the dorsal aINS contributes to cognitive processes through frontal and parietal connections. Open questions remain, however, regarding how aINS connectivity varies over time. We implemented a novel approach combining seed-to-whole-brain sliding-window functional connectivity MRI and k-means clustering to assess time-varying functional connectivity of aINS subregions. We studied three independent large samples of healthy participants and longitudinal datasets to assess inter- and intra-subject stability, and related aINS time-varying functional connectivity profiles to dispositional empathy. We identified four robust aINS time-varying functional connectivity modes that displayed both "state" and "trait" characteristics: while modes featuring connectivity to sensory regions were modulated by eye closure, modes featuring connectivity to higher cognitive and emotional processing regions were stable over time and related to empathy measures.

Whether short-term learning of new words can induce rapid changes in cortical areas involved in distributed neural representation of the lexicon is a hotly debated topic. To answer this question, we examined magnetoencephalographic phase-locked responses elicited in the cerebral cortex by passive presentation of eight novel pseudowords before and immediately after an operant conditioning task. This procedure forced participants to perform an active search for unique meaning of four word-forms that referred to movements of their own body parts. While familiarization with novel word-forms led to bilateral repetition suppression of cortical responses to all eight pseudowords, these reduced responses became more selectively tuned towards newly learned action words in the left hemisphere. Our results suggest that stimulus repetition and active learning of semantic association have separable effects on cortical activity. They also evidence rapid plastic changes in cortical representations of meaningful auditory word-forms after active learning.

The voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 is essential for an adequate perception of painful stimuli. Its mutations cause various pain syndromes in human patients. The hNav1.7/A1632E mutation induces symptoms of erythromelalgia and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), and its main gating change is a strongly enhanced persistent current.nnUsing molecular simulations, we demonstrate that the disease causing persistent current of hNav1.7/A1632E is due to impaired binding of the IFM motif, thus affecting proper function of the recently proposed allosteric fast inactivation mechanism. By using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels, we show that hNav1.7 dimerizes. The disease-linked persistent current depends on the channels functional dimerization status: Using difopein, a 14-3-3 inhibitor known to uncouple dimerization of hNav1.5, we detect a significant decrease in hNav1.7/A1632E induced persistent currents.nnOur work identifies that functional uncoupling of hNav1.7/A1632E dimers rescues the pain-causing molecular phenotype by interferes with an allosteric fast inactivation mechanism, which we link for the first time to channel dimerization. Our work supports the concept of sodium channel dimerization and reveals its relevance to human pain syndromes.

Cohort studies, randomized trials, and post-licensure studies have reported reduced natural and vaccine-derived protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in low- and middle-income countries. While susceptibility of children to rotavirus is known to vary within and between settings, implications for estimation of immune protection are not well understood. We sought to re-estimate naturally-acquired protection against rotavirus infection and RVGE, and to understand how differences in susceptibility among children impacted estimates. We re-analyzed data from studies conducted in Mexico City, Mexico and Vellore, India. Cumulatively, 573 rotavirus-unvaccinated children experienced 1418 rotavirus infections and 371 episodes of RVGE over 17,636 child-months. We developed a model that characterized susceptibility to rotavirus infection and RVGE among children, accounting for aspects of the natural history of rotavirus and differences in transmission rates between settings. We tested whether model-generated susceptibility measurements were associated with demographic and anthropometric factors, and with the severity of RVGE symptoms. We identified greater variation in susceptibility to rotavirus infection and RVGE in Vellore than in Mexico City. In both cohorts, susceptibility to rotavirus infection and RVGE were associated with male sex, lower birth weight, lower maternal education, and having fewer siblings; within Vellore, susceptibility was also associated with lower socioeconomic status. Children who were more susceptible to rotavirus also experienced higher rates of rotavirus-negative diarrhea, and higher risk of moderate-to-severe symptoms when experiencing RVGE. Simulations suggested that discrepant estimates of naturally-acquired immunity against RVGE can be attributed, in part, to between-setting differences in susceptibility of children, but result primarily from the interaction of transmission rates with age-dependent risk for infections to cause RVGE. We found that more children in Vellore than in Mexico City belong to a high-risk group for rotavirus infection and RVGE, and demonstrate that unmeasured individual- and age-dependent susceptibility may influence estimates of naturally-acquired immune protection against RVGE.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QoFUEA-Zyaw" width="1" />

<p>We develop a stochastic whole-brain and body simulator of the nematode
roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and show that it is sufficiently
regularizing to allow imputation of latent membrane potentials from partial
calcium fluorescence imaging observations. This is the first attempt we know of
to "complete the circle," where an anatomically grounded whole-connectome
simulator is used to impute a time-varying "brain" state at single-cell
fidelity from covariates that are measurable in practice. The sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) method we employ not only enables imputation of said latent states
but also presents a strategy for learning simulator parameters via variational
optimization of the noisy model evidence approximation provided by SMC. Our
imputation and parameter estimation experiments were conducted on distributed
systems using novel implementations of the aforementioned techniques applied to
synthetic data of dimension and type representative of that which are measured
in laboratories currently.

boundary conditions, which lead to a reaction transport equation with
multiplicative noise. The temporal behavior of the mean squared displacement is
estimated analytically, and it is shown that the spreading of the initial wave
packet corresponds to Richardson diffusion.

<p>Latency reduction of postsynaptic spikes is a well-known effect of Synaptic
Time-Dependent Plasticity. We expand this notion for long postsynaptic spike
trains, showing that, for a fixed input spike train, STDP reduces the number of
postsynaptic spikes and concentrates the remaining ones. Then we study the
consequences of this phenomena in terms of coding, finding that this mechanism
improves the neural code by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and lowering
the metabolic costs of frequent stimuli. Finally, we illustrate that the
reduction of postsynaptic latencies can lead to the emergence of predictions.

<p>Electrical stimulation of large neural networks is a key tool for
understanding neural population dynamics and ultimately for developing clinical
treatments. However, computational models of cortical networks of spiking
neurons are inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We present an efficient
mean-field model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential
integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons of which we analyse the dynamical properties
and validate the results using detailed network simulations. Bifurcation
diagrams reflecting the network's state reveal asynchronous up and down-states,
bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast
excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. In this
dynamical landscape, electrical stimuli can cause state transitions, such as
turning on and off oscillations. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and
phase-lock endogenous oscillations. The effects of time-varying external
stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning
the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.

Resting-state networks (RSNs) exhibit spontaneous functional connectivity in the resting state. Previous studies have evaluated RSNs mainly based on spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, separation between regional increases in cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption is theoretically difficult using BOLD-fMRI. Such separation can be achieved using quantitative 15O-gas and water positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, 18F-FDG PET can be used to investigate functional connectivity based on changes in glucose metabolism, which reflects local brain activity. Previous studies have highlighted the feasibility and clinical usefulness of 18F-FDG-PET for the analysis of RSNs, and recent studies have utilized simultaneous PET/fMRI for such analyses. While PET provides seed information regarding the focus of the abnormalities (e.g., hypometabolism, reduced target binding), fMRI is used for the analysis of functional connectivity. Thus, as PET and fMRI provide different types of information, integrating these modalities may aid in elucidating the pathological mechanisms underlying certain diseases, and in characterizing individual patients.

Abstract 

P2X receptors are ATP-gated cations channels formed by the homo or hetero-trimeric association from the seven cloned subunits (P2X1-7). P2X receptors are widely distributed in different organs and cell types throughout the body including the nervous system and are involved in a large variety of physiological but also pathological processes in adult mammals.  However, their expression and function during embryogenesis remain poorly understood.  Here, we report the cloning and the comparative expression map establishment of the entire P2X subunit family in the clawed frog Xenopus. Orthologous sequences for 6 mammalian P2X subunits were identified in both X. laevis and X. tropicalis, but not for P2X3 subunit, suggesting a potential loss of this subunit in the Pipidae family. Three of these genes (p2rx1, p2rx2 and p2rx5) exist as homeologs in the pseudoallotetraploid X. laevis, making a total of 9 subunits in this species. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate the high level of conservation of these receptors between amphibian and other vertebrate species. RT-PCR revealed that all subunits are expressed during the development although zygotic p2rx6 and p2rx7 transcripts are mainly detected at late organogenesis stages. Whole mount in situ hybridization shows that each subunit displays a specific spatio-temporal expression profile and that these subunits can therefore be grouped into two groups, based on their expression or not in the developing nervous system. Overlapping expression in the central and peripheral nervous system and in the sensory organs suggests potential heteromerization and/or redundant functions of P2X subunits in Xenopus embryos. The developmental expression of the p2rx subunit family during early phases of embryogenesis indicates that these subunits may have distinct roles during vertebrate development, especially embryonic neurogenesis.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, neuropathologically characterised by progressive loss of neurons in distinct brain areas. We hypothesize that quantifiable network alterations are caused by neurodegeneration. The primary motivation of this study was to assess the specific network alterations in PD patients that are distinct but appear in conjunction with physiological aging.  

178 subjects (130 females) stratified into PD patients, young, middle-aged and elderly healthy controls (age- and sex-matched with PD patients), were analysed using 3D-T1 magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) and diffusion weighted images acquired in 3T MRI scanner. Diffusion modelling and probabilistic tractography analysis were applied for generating voxel-based connectivity index maps from each seed voxel. The obtained connectivity matrices were analysed using graph theoretical tools for characterization of involved network. By network-based statistic (NBS) the interregional connectivity differences between the groups were assessed. Measures evaluating local diffusion properties for anisotropy and diffusivity were computed for characterization of white matter microstructural integrity.

The graph theoretical analysis showed a significant decrease in distance measures - eccentricity and characteristic path length - in PD patients in comparison to healthy subjects. Both measures as well were lower in PD patients when compared to young and middle-aged healthy controls. NBS analysis demonstrated lowered structural connectivity in PD patients in comparison to young and middle-aged healthy subject groups, mainly in frontal, cingulate, olfactory, insula, thalamus and parietal regions. These specific network differences were distinct for PD and were not observed between the healthy subject groups. Microstructural analysis revealed diffusivity alterations within the white matter tracts in PD patients, predominantly in the body, splenium and tapetum of corpus callosum, corticospinal tract and corona radiata, which were absent in normal aging. 

The identified alterations of network connectivity presumably caused by neurodegeneration indicate the disruption in global network integration in PD patients. The microstructural changes identified within the white matter could endorse network reconfiguration. This study provides a clear distinction between the network changes occurring during aging and PD. This will facilitate a better understanding of PD pathophysiology and the direct link between white matter changes and their role in the restructured network topology..

Atxn7, a subunit of SAGA chromatin remodeling complex, is subject to polyglutamine expansion at the amino terminus, causing spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a progressive retinal and neurodegenerative disease. Within SAGA, the Atxn7 amino terminus anchors Non-stop, a deubiquitinase, to the complex. To understand the scope of Atxn7-dependent regulation of Non-stop, substrates of the deubiquitinase were sought. This revealed Non-stop, dissociated from Atxn7, interacts with Arp2/3 and WAVE regulatory complexes (WRC), which control actin cytoskeleton assembly. There, Non-stop countered polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of WRC subunit SCAR. Dependent on conserved <span class="underline">W</span>RC <span class="underline">i</span>nteracting <span class="underline">r</span>eceptor <span class="underline">s</span>equences (WIRS), Non-stop augmentation increased protein levels, and directed subcellular localization, of SCAR, decreasing cell area and number of protrusions. <i>In vivo</i>, heterozygous mutation of Atxn7 rescued haploinsufficiency of SCAR, but heterozygous mutation of SCAR did not significantly rescue knockdown of Atxn7.

We provide the first measures of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes and discuss the physical and visual implications of our findings. We used a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching (decrease in cones/mm<sup>2</sup>), myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density (increase in cones/deg<sup>2</sup>) in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes, offering the potential for better visual acuity. Reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes compared to emmetropes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression.

Meiotic drive is the preferential transmission of a particular allele during sexual reproduction. The phenomenon is observed as spore killing in multiple fungi. In natural populations of <i>Podospora anserina</i>, seven spore killer types (<i>Psk</i>s) have been identified through classical genetic analyses. Here we show that the <i>Spok</i> gene family underlies the <i>Psk</i>s. The combination of <i>Spok</i> genes at different chromosomal locations defines the spore killer types and creates a killing hierarchy within a population. We identify two novel <i>Spok</i> homologs located within a large (74–167 kbp) region (the <i>Spok</i> block) that resides in different chromosomal locations in different strains. We confirm that the SPOK protein performs both killing and resistance functions and show that these activities are dependent on distinct domains, a predicted nuclease and kinase domain. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses across ascomycetes suggest that the <i>Spok</i> genes disperse through cross-species transfer, and evolve by duplication and diversification within lineages.

Working memory maintains information so that it can be used in complex cognitive tasks. A key challenge for this system is to maintain relevant information in the face of task-irrelevant perturbations. In this series of experiments, we investigated the impact of task-irrelevant interruptions on neural representations of working memory. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in humans while they performed a working memory task. On a subset of trials, we interrupted participants with salient, but task-irrelevant objects. To track the impact of these task-irrelevant interruptions on neural representations of working memory, we measured two well-characterized, temporally sensitive EEG markers that reflect active, prioritized working memory representations: the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and lateralized alpha power (8-12hz). Following interruption, we found that CDA momentarily sustained, but was gone by the end of the trial. Lateralized alpha power was immediately influenced by the interrupters, but recovered by the end of the trial. This suggests that dissociable neural processes contribute to the maintenance of working memory information. Additionally, we found that task expectancy modulated the timing and magnitude of how these two neural signals responded to task-irrelevant interruptions, suggesting that the brains response to task-irrelevant interruption is shaped by task context. The distinct time courses of and influence of task context on these two neural signatures of working memory have many interesting theoretical implications about how information is actively maintained in working memory.nnSignificance statementWorking memory plays a central role in intelligent behaviors because it actively maintains relevant information that is easily accessible and manipulatable. In everyday life, we are often interrupted while performing such complex cognitive tasks. Therefore, understanding how working memory responds to and overcomes momentary task-irrelevant interruptions is critical for us to understand how complex cognition works. Here, we unveil how two distinct neural signatures of working memory respond to task-irrelevant interruptions by recording electroencephalogram activity in humans. Our findings raise long-standing theoretical questions about how different neural and cognitive processes contribute to the maintenance of information in working memory.

The amygdala is a brain area critical for the formation of threat memories. However, the nature of the teaching signal(s) that drive plasticity in the amygdala are still under debate. Here, we use optogenetic methods to investigate whether dopamine release in the amygdala contributes to fear learning. Antero- and retrograde labeling showed that a sparse, and relatively evenly distributed population of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons projects to the basal amygdala (BA). In-vivo optrode recordings in behaving mice showed that many VTA neurons, amongst them putative dopamine neurons, are excited by footshocks. Correspondingly, in-vivo fiber photometry of dopamine in the BA revealed robust dopamine concentration transients upon footshock presentation. Finally, silencing VTA dopamine neurons, or their axon terminals in the BA during the footshock, reduced the extent of threat memory retrieval one day later. Thus, VTA dopamine neurons projecting to the BA code for the saliency of the footshock event, and the resulting dopamine release in the BA facilitates threat memory formation.

Cognitive neuroscience research has provided foundational insights into aging, but has focused primarily on the cerebral cortex. However, the cerebellum is subject to the effects of aging. Given the importance of this structure in the performance of motor and cognitive tasks, cerebellar differences stand to provide critical insights into age differences in behavior. But, our understanding of cerebellar functional activation in aging is limited. Thus, we completed a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies across task domains. Unlike in the cortex where an increase in bilateral activation is seen during cognitive task performance with advanced age, cerebellar activation is decreased. Conversely, we see an increase in activation in older adults during motor tasks. We propose that this is due to inputs for comparator processing in the context of control theory (cortical and spinal) that may be differentially impacted in aging. These findings advance our understanding of the aging mind and brain.

The anatomy and physiology of synaptic connections in rodent hippocampal CA1 have been exhaustively characterized in recent decades. Yet, the resulting knowledge remains disparate and difficult to reconcile. Here, we present a data-driven approach to integrate the current state-of-the-art knowledge on the synaptic anatomy and physiology of rodent hippocampal CA1, including axo-dendritic innervation patterns, number of synapses per connection, quantal conductances, neurotransmitter release probability, and short-term plasticity into a single coherent resource. First, we undertook an extensive literature review of paired-recordings of hippocampal neurons and compiled experimental data on their synaptic anatomy and physiology. The data collected in this manner is sparse and inhomogeneous due to the diversity of experimental techniques used by different labs, which necessitates the need for an integrative framework to unify these data. To this end, we extended a previously developed workflow for the neocortex to constrain a unifying in silico reconstruction of the synaptic physiology of CA1 connections. Our work identifies gaps in the existing knowledge and provides a complementary resource towards a more complete quantification of synaptic anatomy and physiology in the rodent hippocampal CA1 region.

Abstract
<p>The future of medicine lies not primarily in cures but in disease modification and prevention. While the science of preclinical detection is young, it is moving rapidly. Preclinical interventions offer hope to decrease the severity of a disease or delay the development of a disorder. With such promise, the research and practice of detecting brain disorders at a preclinical stage present unique ethical challenges that must be addressed to ensure the benefit of these technologies. Direct brain interventions have the potential to impact not just what a patient has but who they are and who they could become. Further, receiving an assessment for a preclinical or prodromal state has potential to impact perceptions about capacity, autonomy and personhood and could become entangled with stigma and discrimination. Exploring ethical issues alongside and integrated into the experimental design and research of these technologies is critical. This review will highlight ethical issues attendant to the current and near future states of preclinical detection across the life span, specifically as it relates to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

Abstract
<p>Sex differences in human cognitive performance are well characterized. However, the neural correlates of these differences remain elusive. This issue may be clarified using nonhuman primates, for which sociocultural influences are minimized. We used the marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) to investigate sex differences in two aspects of executive function: reversal learning and intradimensional/extradimensional (ID/ED) set shifting. Stress reactivity and motor function were also assessed. In agreement with human literature, females needed more trials than males to acquire the reversals. No sex differences in ED set shifting or motivational measures were observed. The findings suggest enhanced habit formation in females, perhaps due to striatal estrogenic effects. Both sexes showed increased urinary cortisol during social separation stressor, but females showed an earlier increase in cortisol and a greater increase in agitated locomotion, possibly indicating enhanced stress reactivity. Independent of sex, basal cortisol predicted cognitive performance. No sex differences were found in motor performance. Associations between brain networks and reversal learning performance were investigated using resting state fMRI. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses revealed sex differences in cognitive networks, with differences in overall neural network metrics and specific regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Correlations between cognitive flexibility and neural connectivity indicate that sex differences in cognitive flexibility are related to sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Overall, our findings reveal sex differences in reversal learning, brain networks, and their relationship in the marmoset, positioning this species as an excellent model to investigate the biological basis of cognitive sex differences.</p>

Abstract
<p>Grasping is an action engraved in the human genome, enabling newborn infants to hang from a monkey-bar immediately after birth. The grasp force provides rich information about the brain’s control of arm movements. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the grasp force increases to improve the hand’s movement precision during reaching. In two reaching experiments, subjects increased grasp force to suppress movement imprecision that arose from both self-generated motor noise and from an unpredictable environment. Furthermore, the grasp force did not increase constantly, but increased specifically along the movement where the hand’s deviation was greatest. The increased grasp was premeditated and was not a reaction to environmental forces, suggesting that the central nervous system has a predictive, state-dependent model of movement precision during reaching. The grasp force provides a high temporal resolution and calibration-less estimate of movement precision adaptation.</p>

Abstract
<p>Despite the importance of the prefrontal-amygdala (AMY) network for emotion processing, valence-dependent coupling within this network remains elusive. In this study, we assessed the effect of emotional valence on brain activity and effective connectivity. We tested which functional pathways within the prefrontal-AMY network are specifically engaged during the processing of emotional valence. Thirty-three healthy adults were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a dynamic faces and dynamic shapes matching task. The valence of the facial expressions varied systematically between positive, negative, and neutral across the task. Functional contrasts determined core areas of the emotion processing circuitry, comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), the AMY, and the right fusiform face area (FFA). Dynamic causal modelling demonstrated that the bidirectional coupling within the prefrontal-AMY circuitry is modulated by emotional valence. Additionally, Bayesian model averaging showed significant bottom-up connectivity from the AMY to the MPFC during negative and neutral, but not positive, valence. Thus, our study provides strong evidence for alterations of bottom-up coupling within the prefrontal-AMY network as a function of emotional valence. Thereby our results not only advance the understanding of the human prefrontal-AMY circuitry in varying valence context, but, moreover, provide a model to examine mechanisms of valence-sensitive emotional dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

Abstract
<p>The neural mechanisms responsible for the initiation and expression of migraines remain unknown. Although there is growing evidence of changes in brainstem anatomy and function between attacks, very little is known about brainstem function and structure in the period immediately prior to a migraine. The aim of this investigation is to use brainstem-specific analyses of diffusion weighted images to determine whether the brainstem pain processing regions display altered structure in individuals with migraine across the migraine cycle, and in particular immediately prior to a migraine. Diffusion tensor images (29 controls, 36 migraineurs) were used to assess brainstem anatomy in migraineurs compared with controls. We found that during the interictal phase, migraineurs displayed greater mean diffusivity (MD) in the region of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV), dorsomedial pons (dmPons)/dorsolateral pons (dlPons), and midbrain periaqueductal gray matter (PAG)/cuneiform nucleus (CNF). Remarkably, the MD returned to controls levels during the 24-h period immediately prior to a migraine, only to increase again within the three following days. Additionally, fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly elevated in the region of the medial lemniscus/ventral trigeminal thalamic tract in migraineurs compared with controls over the entire migraine cycle. These data show that regional brainstem anatomy changes over the migraine cycle, with specific anatomical changes occurring in the 24-h period prior to onset. These changes may contribute to the activation of the ascending trigeminal pathway by either an increase in basal traffic or by sensitizing the trigeminal nuclei to external triggers, with activation ultimately resulting in perception of head pain during a migraine attack.</p>

Abstract<p>Glutamatergic transmission in the brain typically occurs at well-defined synaptic connections, but increasing evidence indicates that neural excitation can also occur through activation of "extrasynaptic" glutamate receptors. Here we investigated the underlying mechanisms and functional properties of extrasynaptic signals that are part of a feedforward path of information flow in the olfactory bulb. This pathway involves glutamatergic interneurons, external tufted cells (eTCs), that are excited by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and in turn excite output mitral cells (MCs) extrasynaptically. Using pair- and triple-cell recordings in rat bulb slices (of either sex), combined with ultrastructural approaches, we first present evidence that eTC-to-MC signaling results from "spillover" of glutamate released at eTC synapses onto GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells in glomeruli. Thus, feedforward excitation is an indirect result of and must co-occur with activation of inhibitory circuitry. Next, to examine the dynamics of the competing signals, we assayed the relationship between the number of spikes in eTCs and excitation of MCs or PG cells in pair-cell recordings. This showed that extrasynaptic excitation in MCs is very weak due to single spikes but rises sharply and supralinearly with increasing spikes, differing from sublinear behavior for synaptic excitation of PG cells. Similar dynamics leading to a preference for extrasynaptic excitation were also observed during recordings of extrasynaptic and inhibitory currents in response to OSN input of increasing magnitude. The observed alterations in the balance between extrasynaptic excitation and inhibition in glomeruli with stimulus strength could underlie an intraglomerular mechanism for olfactory contrast enhancement.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Glutamatergic transmission in the brain occurs primarily at anatomically defined synaptic connections, but increasing evidence supports the prevalence of "extrasynaptic" mechanisms. Here we investigated extrasynaptic glutamatergic transmission between two types of excitatory cells in glomeruli of the rodent olfactory bulb, as well as its relationship with respect to local GABAergic inhibition. Our results indicate that weak stimuli preferentially favor inhibition over extrasynaptic excitation, but differences in the non-linear properties between extrasynaptic excitation and inhibition result in strong stimuli favoring extrasynaptic excitation. The shift in balance between extrasynaptic excitation and inhibition with stimulus strength could provide a novel intraglomerular mechanism for olfactory contrast enhancement, helping the brain discriminate different but similar odors.</p>

Abstract<p>Approach-avoidance conflict arises when the drives to pursue reward and avoid harm are incompatible. Previous neuroimaging studies of approach-avoidance conflict have shown large variability in reported neuroanatomical correlates. These prior studies have generally neglected to account for potential sources of variability, such as individual differences in choice preferences and modeling of hemodynamic response during conflict. In the present study, we controlled for these limitations using a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). This enabled us to measure participant-specific per-trial estimates of conflict during an approach-avoidance task. We also employed a variable epoch method to identify brain structures specifically sensitive to conflict. In a sample of 28 human participants, we found that only a limited set of brain structures (inferior frontal gyrus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right pre-supplementary motor area) are specifically correlated with approach-avoidance conflict. These findings suggest that controlling for previous sources of variability increases the specificity of the neuroanatomical correlates of approach-avoidance conflict.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Approach-avoidance conflict is implicated in many psychiatric syndromes. Previous fMRI studies of this important process have potential biases caused by overlooking individual differences in the evaluation of reward and threat in their analyses. We present a method to model individual differences in approach-avoidance conflict and demonstrate how to incorporate this model into fMRI analyses. We found our approach to have greater specificity than previous studies, which highlights the importance of capturing large variability in participant behavior.</p>

Abstract<p>Large-scale brain networks are increasingly recognized as important for the generation of seizures in epilepsy. However, how a network evolves from a healthy state through the process of epileptogenesis remains unclear. To address this question, here, we study longitudinal epicranial background EEG recordings (30 electrodes, EEG free from epileptiform activity) of a mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We analyse functional connectivity networks and observe that over the time-course of epileptogenesis the networks become increasingly asymmetric. Furthermore, computational modelling reveals that a set of nodes, located outside of the region of initial insult, emerges as particularly important for the network dynamics. These findings are consistent with experimental observations, thus demonstrating that ictogenic mechanisms can be revealed on the EEG, that computational models can be used to monitor unfolding epileptogenesis and that both the primary focus and epileptic network play a role in epileptogenesis.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> We provide the first description of how functional connectivity and network dynamics inferred from background EEG evolve during epileptogenesis. We focus on background EEG because it allows for direct comparison of functional networks before and after experimental intervention. We show that network dynamics inferred by means of computational modelling are different at early and later stages of epileptogenesis. Our findings provide further support for clinical potential of background EEG.</p>

Abstract<p>The orphan receptor GPR88 is highly expressed in D1R- and D2R-medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and has been associated to striatum-dependent functions in rodents. The total deletion of <i>Gpr88</i> in mice was shown to decrease anxiety-like behaviors, increase stereotypies and locomotion, and impair motor coordination and motor learning. Knowing the opposing role of D1R- and D2R-MSNs, we here investigated the respective roles of GPR88 in the two MSN subtypes for these behaviors. To do so, we compared effects of a conditional <i>Gpr88</i> gene knockout (KO) in D1R-MSNs (D1R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice) or D2R-MSNs (A<sub>2A</sub>R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice) with effects of the total <i>Gpr88</i> KO (CMV-<i>Gpr88</i> mice). Overall, most phenotypes of CMV-<i>Gpr88</i> mice were recapitulated in A<sub>2A</sub>R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice, including reduced marble burying, increased social interactions, increased locomotor activity and stereotypies in the open field, and reduced motor coordination in the rotarod. Exceptions were the reduced habituation to the open field and reduced motor skill learning, which were observed in CMV-<i>Gpr88</i> and D1R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice, but not in A<sub>2A</sub>R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice. D1R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice otherwise showed no other phenotype in this study. Our data together show that GPR88 modulates the function of both D1R- and D2R-MSNs, and that GPR88 activity in these two neuron populations has very different and dissociable impacts on behavior. We suggest that GPR88 in D2R-MSNs shapes defensive and social behavior and contributes in maintaining the inhibition of basal ganglia outputs to control locomotion, stereotypies and motor coordination, while GPR88 in D1R-MSNs promotes novelty habituation and motor learning.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> GPR88, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, has been implicated in the regulation of striatum-dependent behaviors. In the striatum, GPR88 is most abundant in both medium spiny neurons expressing dopamine D1 and D2 receptors.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Excessive inflammation in the CNS and the periphery can result in neurodegeneration and parkinsonism. Recent evidence suggests that immune responses in Parkinson's disease patients are dysregulated, leading to an increased inflammatory reaction to unspecific triggers. Although alpha‐synuclein pathology is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, it has not been investigated if pathologic alpha‐synuclein is a specific trigger for excessive inflammatory responses in Parkinson's disease.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated the immune response of primary human monocytes and a microglial cell line to pathologic forms of alpha‐synuclein by assessing cytokine release upon exposure.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that pathologic alpha‐synuclein (mutations, aggregation) results in a robust inflammatory activation of human monocytes and microglial BV2 cells. The activation is conformation‐dependent, with increasing fibrillation and early‐onset mutations having the strongest effect on immune activation. We also found that activation of immune cells by extracellular alpha‐synuclein is potentiated by extracellular vesicles, possibly by facilitating the uptake of alpha‐synuclein. Blood extracellular vesicles from Parkinson's disease patients induce a stronger activation of monocytes than blood extracellular vesicles from healthy controls. Most importantly, monocytes from Parkinson's disease patients are dysregulated and hyperactive in response to stimulation with pathologic alpha‐synuclein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that α‐syn pathology in the CNS is sufficient to induce the monocyte dysregulation in the periphery of a mouse model.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, our data suggests that alpha‐synuclein pathology and dysregulation of monocytes in Parkinson's disease can act together to induce excessive inflammatory responses to alpha‐synuclein.</p>

<p>Characterising brain activity at rest is of paramount importance to our
understanding both of general principles of brain functioning and of the way
brain dynamics is affected in the presence of neurological or psychiatric
pathologies. We measured the time-reversal symmetry of spontaneous
electroencephalographic brain activity recorded from three groups of patients
and their respective control group under two experimental conditions (eyes open
and closed). We evaluated differences in time irreversibility in terms of
possible underlying physical generating mechanisms. The results showed that
resting brain activity is generically time-irreversible at sufficiently long
time scales, and that brain pathology is generally associated with a reduction
in time-asymmetry, albeit with pathology-specific patterns. The significance of
these results and their possible dynamical aetiology are discussed. Some
implications of the differential modulation of time asymmetry by pathology and
experimental condition are examined.

<p>In this work, a dense recurrent convolutional neural network (DRCNN) was
constructed to detect sleep disorders including arousal, apnea and hypopnea
using Polysomnography (PSG) measurement channels provided in the 2018 Physionet
challenge database. Our model structure is composed of multiple dense
convolutional units (DCU) followed by a bidirectional long-short term memory
(LSTM) layer followed by a softmax output layer. The sleep events including
sleep stages, arousal regions and multiple types of apnea and hypopnea are
manually annotated by experts which enables us to train our proposed network
using a multi-task learning mechanism. Three binary cross-entropy loss
functions corresponding to sleep/wake, target arousal and apnea-hypopnea/normal
detection tasks are summed up to generate our overall network loss function
that is optimized using the Adam method. Our model performance was evaluated
using two metrics: the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and the
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To measure our
model generalization, 4-fold cross-validation was also performed. For training,
our model was applied to full night recording data. Finally, the average AUPRC
and AUROC values associated with the arousal detection task were 0.505 and
0.922, respectively on our testing dataset. An ensemble of four models trained
on different data folds improved the AUPRC and AUROC to 0.543 and 0.931,
respectively. Our proposed algorithm achieved the first place in the official
stage of the 2018 Physionet challenge for detecting sleep arousals with AUPRC
of 0.54 on the blind testing dataset.

<p>Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, together with head direction, place,
speed and border cells, are major contributors to the organization of spatial
representations in the brain. In this work we introduce a novel theoretical and
algorithmic framework able to explain the emergence of hexagonal grid-like
response patterns from head direction cells' responses. We show that this
pattern is a result of minimal variance encoding of neurons. The novelty lies
into the formulation of the encoding problem through the modern Frame Theory
language, specifically that of equiangular Frames, providing new insights about
the optimality of hexagonal grid receptive fields. The model proposed overcomes
some crucial limitations of the current attractor and oscillatory models. It is
based on the well-accepted and tested hypothesis of Hebbian learning, providing
a simplified cortical-based framework that does not require the presence of
theta velocity-driven oscillations (oscillatory model) or translational
symmetries in the synaptic connections (attractor model). We moreover
demonstrate that the proposed encoding mechanism naturally explains axis
alignment of neighbor grid cells and maps shifts, rotations and scaling of the
stimuli onto the shape of grid cells' receptive fields, giving a
straightforward explanation of the experimental evidence of grid cells
remapping under transformations of environmental cues.

Previous studies have found alterations in 40 Hz oscillatory activity in response to auditory stimuli in adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The current study sought to examine the specificity and developmental trajectory of these findings by driving the cortex to oscillate at a range of frequencies in both children and adults with and without ASD. Fifteen participants with ASD (3 female, aged 6-23 years) and 15 age-matched controls (4 female, aged 6-25 years) underwent dense-array EEG as they listened to a carrier tone amplitude-modulated by a sinusoid linearly increasing in frequency from 0-100 Hz over two seconds. EEG data were analyzed for inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and single-trial power (STP). Older participants with ASD displayed significantly decreased ability to phase-lock to the stimulus in the low gamma frequency range relative to their TD counterparts, while younger ASD and TD did not significantly differ from each other. An interaction between age and diagnosis suggested that TD and ASD also show different developmental trajectories for low gamma power; TD showed a significant decrease in low gamma power with age, while ASD did not. Regardless of age, increased low gamma STP was significantly correlated with increased clinical scores for repetitive behaviors in the ASD group, particularly insistence on sameness. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting alterations in auditory processing in ASD. Older ASD participants showed more pronounced low gamma deficits than younger participants, suggesting an altered developmental trajectory for neural activity contributing to auditory processing deficits that may also be more broadly clinically relevant. Future studies are needed employing a longitudinal approach to confirm findings of this cross-sectional study.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is earning a role in the therapeutic arsenal of cocaine use disorder. A widespread and still growing number of studies have reported beneficial use of repeated TMS (rTMS) in reduction of craving, intake and cue-induced craving in cocaine addicts. In spite of these encouraging findings, many issues are still unresolved such as brain area to be stimulated, laterality of the effects, coil geometry and stimulation protocols/parameters. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a more tolerable protocol administered at lower intensities and shorter intervals than conventional repeated TMS (rTMS) protocols. Yet, its effects on cocaine craving and length of abstinence in comparison with standard high frequency (10-15Hz) protocols have never been evaluated so far. In the present paper we describe the effect of the bilateral iTBS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in a population (n=25) of treatment-seeking cocaine addicts, in an outpatient setting, and compare them with 15 Hz stimulation of the same brain area (n=22). The results indicate that iTBS produces effects on cocaine consumption and cocaine craving virtually superimposable to the 15 Hz rTMS group. Both treatments had low numbers of dropouts and similar side-effects, safety and tolerability profiles. While larger studies are warranted to confirm these observations, iTBS appears to be a valid approach to be considered in treatment-seeking cocaine addicts, especially in light of its brief duration (3 mins) vs 15 Hz stimulation (15 mins). The use of iTBS would allow increasing the number of patients treated per day with current rTMS devices, thus reducing patient discomfort and hopefully reducing drop-out rates without compromising clinical effectiveness.

Background: Event related potential (ERP) components, such as P3, N2, and FRN, are potential metrics for assessing feedback response as a form of performance monitoring. Most research studies investigate these ERP components using clinical or research-grade electroencephalography (EEG) systems. Wearable EEGs, which are an affordable alternative, have the potential to assess feedback response using ERPs but have not been sufficiently evaluated. Feedback-related ERPs also have not been scientifically evaluated in interactive settings that are similar to daily computer use. In this study, a consumer-grade wearable EEG system was assessed for its feasibility to collect feedback-related ERPs through an interactive software module that provided an environment in which users were permitted to navigate freely within the program to make decisions.
Methods: The recording hardware, which costs less than $1500 in total, incorporated the OpenBCI Cyton Board with Daisy chain, a consumer-grade EEG system that costs $949 USD. 17 participants interacted with an oddball paradigm and an interactive module designed to elicit feedback-related ERPs. The features of interests for the oddball paradigm were the P3 and N2 components. The features of interests for the interactive module were the the P3, N2, and FRN components elicited in response to positive, neutral, and two types of negative feedback. The FRN was calculated by subtracting the positive feedback response from the negative feedback responses.
Results: The P3 and N2 components of the oddball paradigm indicated statistically significant differences between infrequent targets and frequent targets which is in line with current literature. The P3 and N2 components elicited in the interactive module indicated statistically significant differences between positive, neutral, and negative feedback responses. There were no significant differences between the FRN types and significant interactions with channel group and FRN type.
Conclusion: The OpenBCI Cyton, after some modifications, shows potential for eliciting and assessing P3, N2, and FRN components, which are important indicators for performance monitoring, in an interactive setting.

Several studies indicate the functional importance of the motor cortex for higher cognition, language and semantic processing, and place the neural substrate of these processes in sensorimotor action-perception circuits linking motor, sensory and perisylvian language regions. Interestingly, in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), semantic processing of action and emotion words seems to be impaired and is associated with hypoactivity of the motor cortex during semantic processing. In this study, the relationship between semantic processing, fine motor skills and clinical symptoms was investigated in 19 individuals with ASD and in 22 typically-developing matched controls. Participants completed two semantic decision tasks involving words from different semantic categories, a test of alexithymia (the Toronto Alexithymia Scale), and a test of fine motor skills (the Purdue Pegboard Test). A significant Group x Word Category interaction in accuracy (p &lt; .05) demonstrated impaired semantic processing for action words, but not object words in the autistic group. There was no significant group difference when processing abstract emotional words or abstract neutral words.  Moreover, our study revealed deficits in fine motor skills as well as evidence for alexithymia in the ASD group, but not in neurotypical controls. We interpret the data in terms of an underlying dysfunction of the action-perception system in ASD which has a specific impact on semantic language processing.

Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain–computer interface (BCI) is a tool to non-invasively
control computers by translating the electrical activity of the brain. This technology has the
potential to provide patients who have severe generalized myopathy, such as those suffering from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with the ability to communicate. Recently, auditory oddball
paradigms have been developed to implement more practical event-related potential (ERP)-based
BCIs because they can operate without ocular activities. These paradigms generally make use
of clinical (over 16-channel) EEG devices and natural sound stimuli for maintaining the user’s
motivation during the BCI operation; however, most of ALS patients who took part in auditory
ERP-based BCIs tended to complain about the following factors: (i) total device cost and (ii) setup
time. The development of a portable auditory ERP-based BCI would overcome considerable
obstacles that prevent the use of this technology in communication in everyday life. To address this
issue, we analyzed prefrontal single-channel EEG data acquired from a consumer-grade single-
channel EEG device using a natural sound-based auditory oddball paradigm. In our experiments,
EEG data was gathered from nine healthy subjects and one ALS patient. The performance of
auditory ERP-based BCI was quantified under offline condition and two online conditions. The
offline analysis indicated that our paradigm maintained a high level of detection accuracy (%)
and ITR (bits/min) across all subjects through a cross-validation procedure (for five commands:
70.0 ± 16.1 and 1.29 ± 0.93, for four commands: 73.8 ± 14.2 and 1.16 ± 0.78, for three commands:
78.7 ± 11.8 and 0.95 ± 0.61, and for two commands: 85.7 ± 8.6 and 0.63 ± 0.38). Furthermore, the
first online analysis demonstrated that our paradigm also achieved high performance for new
data in an online data acquisition stream (for three commands: 80.0 ± 19.4 and 1.16 ± 0.83). The
second online analysis demonstrated online performances on the different day of offline and first online analyses (for three commands: 62.5 ± 14.3 and 0.43 ± 0.36). These results indicate that prefrontal single-channel EEGs have the potential to contribute to the development of a user-friendly portable auditory ERP-based BCI.

Apologizing is an effective interpersonal conflict resolution strategy, but whether organizations should issue public apologies after crises has been less clear. Recently it was shown that public apologies are effective, especially when they provide a comprehensive account of what happened and clear actions taken by the company to address the problems. Intriguingly, public apologies may be most effective when the crisis source resides within the organization itself, suggesting that the company has control over it. In the current study we first attempted to replicate this behavioral finding by presenting participants with multiple crisis scenarios (e.g., ignition failures in a new car model) followed by one of two written apologies: one stating that the crisis source was internal to and controllable by the organization, and the other that it was external and uncontrollable. Replicating the previous study, we found that the internal-controllable public apology was most effective. We then examined the neural basis of this public apology assessment and found that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex appears to mediate the believability of organizational control, and the precuneus uses the information for the apology assessment. Examination of complex social interactions, such as the public’s response to corporate crises, help elucidate high-level brain function.

The inflammatory microenvironment in the retina plays a vital role in the pathogenesis and progression of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Microglial inflammatory cytokines production leads to gliosis and apoptosis of retinal neurons, and ultimately, visual loss. Cell-based therapies using grafted olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) have demonstrated modulation of degenerative microenvironments in the central nervous system (CNS), in a number of animal models. However, mechanisms by which grafted OECs can reduce degeneration in the retina are not well understood.
In the present study, we set up an in vitro OEC/BV2 microglia co-culture system, and an in vivo Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat model, used cell transplantation, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, Western Blot to explore the mechanisms by which OECs affect expression of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines and polarization of M(IL-6) and M(Arg1) type microglial activation in the retina. We found that compared with the LPS (Lipopolysaccharide) and olfactory nerve fibroblast (ONF), the OEC and BV2 co-culture group modulate microglial cytokines releasing towards the anti-inflammation, and away from the pro-inflammation, which was followed by higher IL-4 and IL-10 and lower IL-6 and TNF-a in their expression levels. In vivo, the transplantation group significantly reduced activated resident microglia/infiltrated macrophage, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RCS rats retina, increased anti-inflammatory cytokines in transplantation area. Additionally, we found that OECs down-regulated the JAK2/STAT3 (Janus Kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3) pathway. Thirdly, OEC transplantation reduced Caspase-3 expression, protected inner retinal neurons and photoreceptors and therefore, delayed the visual function degeneration. In conclusion, our data suggest that OECs delay retinal degeneration in RP, at least in part through immunomodulation of microglia via the JAK/STAT pathway.

Abstract
Müller glial cells (MGC) are stem cells in the retina. Although their regenerative capacity is very low in mammals, the use of MGC as stem cells to regenerate photoreceptors (PHRs) during retina degenerations, such as in retinitis pigmentosa, is being intensely studied. Changes affecting PHRs in diseased retinas have been thoroughly investigated; however, whether MGC are also affected is still unclear. We here investigated whether MGC in retinal degeneration 1 (rd1) mouse, an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa, have impaired stem cell properties or structure. rd1 MGC showed an altered morphology, both in culture and in the whole retina. Using mixed neuron-glial cultures obtained from newborn mice retinas, we determined that proliferation was significantly lower in rd1 than in wild type (wt) MGC. Levels of stem cell markers, such as Nestin and Sox2, were also markedly reduced in rd1 MGC compared to wt MGC in neuron-glial cultures and in retina cryosections, even before the onset of PHR degeneration. We then investigated whether neuron-glial crosstalk was involved in these changes. Noteworthy, Nestin expression was restored in rd1 MGC in co-culture with wt neurons. Conversely, Nestin expression decreased in wt MGC in co-culture with rd1 neurons, as occurred in rd1 MGC in rd1 neuron-glial mixed cultures. These results imply that MGC proliferation and stem cell markers are reduced in rd1 retinas and might be restored by their interaction with “healthy” PHRs, suggesting that alterations in rd1 PHRs lead to a disruption in neuron-glial crosstalk affecting the regenerative potential of MGC.

The globus pallidus occupies a critical position in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia motor control system. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide gated (HCN) channels play an important role in the modulation of neuronal excitability. In vivo extracellular single unit recording, behavioral test and immunohistochemistry were performed to explore the possible modulation of endogenous HCN channels in the globus pallidus under parkinsonian states. In MPTP parkinsonian mice, micro-pressure application of the selective HCN channel antagonist, ZD7288, decreased the firing rate in 10 out of the 28 pallidal neurons, while increased the firing rate in another 15 out of the 28 neurons. In 6-OHDA parkinsonian rats, ZD7288 also bidirectionally regulated the spontaneous firing activity of the globus pallidus neurons. The proportion of pallidal neurons with ZD7288-induced slowing of firing rate tended to reduce in both parkinsonian animals. Morphological studies revealed a weaker staining of HCN channels in the globus pallidus under parkinsonian state. Finally, behavioral study demonstrated that intrapallidal microinjection of ZD7288 alleviated locomotor deficits in MPTP parkinsonian mice. These results suggest that endogenous HCN channels modulate the activities of pallidal neurons under parkinsonian states.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48625">PUMILIO, but not RBMX, binding is required for regulation of genomic stability by noncoding RNA <i>NORAD</i></a></h4>

<i>NORAD</i> is a conserved long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is required for genome stability in mammals, and which acts as a negative regulator of PUMILIO (PUM) proteins in the cytoplasm. Previously we showed that loss of <i>NORAD</i> or PUM hyperactivity results in premature aging in mice (Kopp et al., 2019). Recently, however, it was reported that <i>NORAD</i>  regulates genome stability through an interaction with the RNA binding protein RBMX in the nucleus. Here we addressed the contributions of <i>NORAD</i>:PUM and <i>NORAD</i>:RBMX interactions to genome maintenance by this lncRNA in human cells. Extensive RNA FISH and fractionation experiments established that <i>NORAD</i> localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm with or without DNA damage. Moreover, genetic rescue experiments demonstrated that PUM binding is required for maintenance of genomic stability by <i>NORAD</i> whereas binding of RBMX is dispensable for this function. These data provide an important foundation for further mechanistic dissection of the <i>NORAD</i>-PUMILIO axis in genome maintenance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46689">FcγRIIB-I232T polymorphic change allosterically suppresses ligand binding</a></h4>

FcγRIIB binding to its ligand suppresses immune cell activation. A single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) change, I232T, in the transmembrane (TM) domain of FcγRIIB loses its suppressive function, which is clinically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Previously, we reported that I232T tilted FcγRIIB's TM domain. In this study, combining with molecular dynamics simulations and single-cell FRET assay, we further reveal that such tilting by I232T unexpectedly bends the FcγRIIB's ectodomain towards plasma membrane to allosterically impede FcγRIIB's ligand association. I232T substitution reduces <i>in-situ</i> two-dimensional binding affinities and association rates of FcγRIIB to interact with its ligands, IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 by three to four folds. This allosteric regulation by a SNP provides an intrinsic molecular mechanism for the functional loss of FcγRIIB-I232T in SLE patients.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46417">Mechanism of pharmacochaperoning in a mammalian K<sub>ATP</sub> channel revealed by cryo-EM</a></h4>

ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels composed of a pore-forming Kir6.2 potassium channel and a regulatory ABC transporter sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells to maintain glucose homeostasis. Mutations that impair channel folding or assembly prevent cell surface expression and cause congenital hyperinsulinism. Structurally diverse K<sub>ATP</sub> inhibitors are known to act as pharmacochaperones to correct mutant channel expression, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we compare cryoEM structures of a mammalian K<sub>ATP</sub> channel bound to pharmacochaperones glibenclamide, repaglinide, and carbamazepine. We found all three drugs bind within a common pocket in SUR1. Further, we found the N-terminus of Kir6.2 inserted within the central cavity of the SUR1 ABC core, adjacent the drug binding pocket. The findings reveal a common mechanism by which diverse compounds stabilize the Kir6.2 N-terminus within SUR1's ABC core, allowing it to act as a firm 'handle' for the assembly of metastable mutant SUR1-Kir6.2 complexes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45977">Skin vasculature and hair follicle cross-talking associated with stem cell activation and tissue homeostasis</a></h4>

Skin vasculature cross-talking with hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) is poorly understood. Skin vasculature undergoes dramatic remodeling during adult mouse hair cycle. Specifically, a horizontal plexus under the secondary hair germ (HPuHG) transiently neighbors the HFSC activation zone during the quiescence phase (telogen). Increased density of HPuHG can be induced by reciprocal mutations in the epithelium (<i>Runx1</i>) and endothelium (<i>Alk1</i>) in adult mice, and is accompanied by prolonged HFSC quiescence and by delayed entry and progression into the hair growth phase (anagen). Suggestively, skin vasculature produces BMP4, a well-established HFSC quiescence-inducing factor, thus contributing to a proliferation-inhibitory environment near the HFSC. Conversely, the HFSC activator Runx1 regulates secreted proteins with previously demonstrated roles in vasculature remodeling. We suggest a working model in which coordinated remodeling and molecular cross-talking of the adult epithelial and endothelial skin compartments modulate timing of HFSC activation from quiescence for proper tissue homeostasis of adult skin.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44838">Primate prefrontal neurons signal economic risk derived from the statistics of recent reward experience</a></h4>

Risk derives from the variation of rewards and governs economic decisions, yet how the brain calculates risk from the frequency of experienced events, rather than from explicit risk-descriptive cues, remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex process risk derived from reward experience. Monkeys performed in a probabilistic choice task in which the statistical variance of experienced rewards evolved continually. During these choices, prefrontal neurons signaled the reward-variance associated with specific objects (‘object risk’) or actions (‘action risk’). Crucially, risk was not derived from explicit, risk-descriptive cues but calculated internally from the variance of recently experienced rewards. Support-vector-machine decoding demonstrated accurate neuronal risk discrimination. Within trials, neuronal signals transitioned from experienced reward to risk (risk updating) and from risk to upcoming choice (choice computation). Thus, prefrontal neurons encode the statistical variance of recently experienced rewards, complying with formal decision variables of object risk and action risk.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42906">Nanoscale organization of rotavirus replication machineries</a></h4>

Rotavirus genome replication and assembly take place in cytoplasmic electron dense inclusions termed viroplasms (VPs). Previous conventional optical microscopy studies observing the intracellular distribution of rotavirus proteins and their organization in VPs have lacked molecular-scale spatial resolution, due to inherent spatial resolution constraints. In this work we employed super-resolution microscopy to reveal the nanometric-scale organization of VPs formed during rotavirus infection, and quantitatively describes the structural organization of seven viral proteins within and around the VPs. The observed viral components are spatially organized as 5 concentric layers, in which NSP5 localizes at the center of the VPs, surrounded by a layer of NSP2 and NSP4 proteins, followed by an intermediate zone comprised of the VP1, VP2, VP6. In the outermost zone, we observed a ring of VP4 and finally a layer of VP7. These findings show that rotavirus VPs are highly organized organelles.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42720">Identification of an emphysema-associated genetic variant near <i>TGFB2</i> with regulatory effects in lung fibroblasts</a></h4>

Murine studies have linked TGF-b signaling to emphysema, and human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies of lung function and COPD have identified associated regions near genes in the TGF-b superfamily. However, the functional regulatory mechanisms at these loci have not been identified. We performed the largest GWAS of emphysema patterns to date, identifying ten GWAS loci including an association peak spanning a 200kb region downstream from <i>TGFB2</i>. Integrative analysis of publicly available eQTL, DNaseI, and chromatin conformation data identified a putative functional variant, rs1690789, that may regulate <i>TGFB2</i> expression in human fibroblasts. Using chromatin conformation capture, we confirmed that the region containing rs1690789 contacts the <i>TGFB2</i> promoter in fibroblasts, and CRISPR/Cas-9 targeted deletion of a ~100bp region containing rs1690789 resulted in decreased <i>TGFB2</i> expression in primary human lung fibroblasts. These data provide novel mechanistic evidence linking genetic variation affecting the TGF-b pathway to emphysema in humans.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Somatosensory signals play roles in the fine control of dexterous movements through a somatosensory–motor integration mechanism. While skilled individuals are typically characterized by fine-tuned somatosensory functions and dexterous motor skills, it remains unknown whether and in what manner their bridging mechanism, the tactile–motor and proprioceptive–motor integration functions, plastically changes through extensive sensorimotor experiences. Here, we addressed this issue by comparing physiological indices of these functions between pianists and nonmusicians. Both tactile and proprioceptive stimuli to the right index finger inhibited corticospinal excitability measured by a transcranial magnetic stimulation method. However, the tactile and proprioceptive stimuli exerted weaker and stronger inhibitory effects, respectively, on corticospinal excitability in pianists than in nonmusicians. The results of the electroencephalogram measurements revealed no significant group difference in the amplitude of cortical responses to the somatosensory stimuli around the motor and somatosensory cortices, suggesting that the group difference in the inhibitory effects reflects neuroplastic adaptation of the somatosensory–motor integration functions in pianists. Penalized regression analyses further revealed an association between these integration functions and motor performance in the pianists, suggesting that extensive piano practice reorganizes somatosensory–motor integration functions so as to enable fine control of dexterous finger movements during piano performances.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">ABSTRACT</div>Much evidence suggests that reversal learning is mediated by cortico-striatal circuitries with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) playing a prominent role. The OFC is a functionally heterogeneous region, but potential differential roles of lateral (lOFC) and medial (mOFC) portions in visual reversal learning have yet to be determined. We investigated the effects of pharmacological inactivation of mOFC and lOFC on a deterministic serial visual reversal learning task for rats. For reference, we also targeted other areas previously implicated in reversal learning: prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) prefrontal cortex, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Inactivating mOFC and lOFC produced opposite effects; lOFC impairing, and mOFC improving, performance in the early, perseverative phase specifically. Additionally, mOFC inactivation enhanced negative feedback sensitivity, while lOFC inactivation diminished feedback sensitivity in general. mOFC and lOFC inactivation also affected novel visual discrimination learning differently; lOFC inactivation paradoxically improved learning, and mOFC inactivation had no effect. We also observed dissociable roles of the OFC and the IL/PrL. Whereas the OFC inactivation affected only perseveration, IL/PrL inactivation improved learning overall. BLA inactivation did not affect perseveration, but improved the late phase of reversal learning. These results support opponent roles of the rodent mOFC and lOFC in deterministic visual reversal learning.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Perturbation of the developmental refinement of the corticospinal (CS) pathway leads to motor disorders.

Findings from one largely restricted injection suggest a hitherto unsuspected early innervation of the gray matter.

These data indicate that a single cell-intrinsic factor represses multiple extrinsic signaling pathways to ensure irreversible neurogenic commitment.

<p>by Jessica M. Conway, Alan S. Perelson, Jonathan Z. Li</p>

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively controls HIV infection, suppressing HIV viral loads. Suspension of therapy is followed by rebound of viral loads to high, pre-therapy levels. However, there is significant heterogeneity in speed of rebound, with some rebounds occurring within days, weeks, or sometimes years. We present a stochastic mathematical model to gain insight into these post-treatment dynamics, specifically characterizing the dynamics of short term viral rebounds (≤ 60 days). Li et al. (2016) report that the size of the expressed HIV reservoir, i.e., cell-associated HIV RNA levels, and drug regimen correlate with the time between ART suspension and viral rebound to detectable levels. We incorporate this information and viral rebound times to parametrize our model. We then investigate insights offered by our model into the underlying dynamics of the latent reservoir. In particular, we refine previous estimates of viral recrudescence after ART interruption by accounting for heterogeneity in infection rebound dynamics, and determine a recrudescence rate of once every 2-4 days. Our parametrized model can be used to aid in design of clinical trials to study viral dynamics following analytic treatment interruption. We show how to derive informative personalized testing frequencies from our model and offer a proof-of-concept example. Our results represent first steps towards a model that can make predictions on a person living with HIV (PLWH)’s rebound time distribution based on biomarkers, and help identify PLWH with long viral rebound delays.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n51SDowLqAU" width="1" />

<p>by Eric Libby, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne, Sayed-Rzgar Hosseini, Andreas Wagner</p>

Syntrophy allows a microbial community as a whole to survive in an environment, even though individual microbes cannot. The metabolic interdependence typical of syntrophy is thought to arise from the accumulation of degenerative mutations during the sustained co-evolution of initially self-sufficient organisms. An alternative and underexplored possibility is that syntrophy can emerge spontaneously in communities of organisms that did not co-evolve. Here, we study this <i>de novo</i> origin of syntrophy using experimentally validated computational techniques to predict an organism’s viability from its metabolic reactions. We show that pairs of metabolisms that are randomly sampled from a large space of possible metabolism and viable on specific primary carbon sources often become viable on new carbon sources by exchanging metabolites. The same biochemical reactions that are required for viability on primary carbon sources also confer viability on novel carbon sources. Our observations highlight a new and important avenue for the emergence of metabolic adaptations and novel ecological interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lwFO2DBjszo" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ZwQASFIYZ4o/article">Foraging as an evidence accumulation process</a></h4>

<p>by Jacob D. Davidson, Ahmed El Hady</p>

The patch-leaving problem is a canonical foraging task, in which a forager must decide to leave a current resource in search for another. Theoretical work has derived optimal strategies for when to leave a patch, and experiments have tested for conditions where animals do or do not follow an optimal strategy. Nevertheless, models of patch-leaving decisions do not consider the imperfect and noisy sampling process through which an animal gathers information, and how this process is constrained by neurobiological mechanisms. In this theoretical study, we formulate an evidence accumulation model of patch-leaving decisions where the animal averages over noisy measurements to estimate the state of the current patch and the overall environment. We solve the model for conditions where foraging decisions are optimal and equivalent to the marginal value theorem, and perform simulations to analyze deviations from optimal when these conditions are not met. By adjusting the drift rate and decision threshold, the model can represent different “strategies”, for example an incremental, decremental, or counting strategy. These strategies yield identical decisions in the limiting case but differ in how patch residence times adapt when the foraging environment is uncertain. To describe sub-optimal decisions, we introduce an energy-dependent marginal utility function that predicts longer than optimal patch residence times when food is plentiful. Our model provides a quantitative connection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence accumulation models of decision making. Moreover, it provides a theoretical framework for potential experiments which seek to identify neural circuits underlying patch-leaving decisions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZwQASFIYZ4o" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25556?af=R">The contribution of acute infarcts to cerebral small vessel disease progression</a></h4>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the contribution of acute infarcts, evidenced by diffusion‐weighted imaging positive (DWI+) lesions to progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and other cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) markers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed 10 monthly 3 T MRIs in 54 elderly individuals with SVD. MRI included high‐resolution multi‐shell DWI, and 3D FLAIR, T1 and SWI. We determined DWI+ lesion evolution, WMH progression rate (mL/month), and number of incident lacunes and microbleeds, and calculated for each marker the proportion of progression explained by DWI+ lesions.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 39 DWI+ lesions on 21/472 DWI scans in 9/54 subjects. Of the 36 DWI+ lesions with follow‐up MRI, two evolved into WMH, four into a lacune (three of which with cavity &lt; 3 mm), three into a microbleed, and 27 were not detectable on follow‐up. WMH volume increased at a median rate of 0.027 (0.005‐0.073) mL/month, but was not significantly higher in subjects with DWI+ lesions compared to those without (<i>p</i> = 0.195). Of the two DWI+ lesions evolving into WMH on follow‐up, one explained 23% of the total WMH volume increase in one subject, whereas WMH regressed in the other subject. DWI+ lesions preceded 4/5 incident lacunes, and 3/10 incident microbleeds.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DWI+ lesions explain only a small proportion of the total WMH progression. Hence, WMH progression seems to be mostly driven by factors other than acute infarcts. DWI+ lesions explain the majority of incident lacunes and small cavities, and almost a third of incident microbleeds, confirming that WMH, lacunes, and microbleeds, although heterogeneous on MRI, can have a common initial appearance on MRI.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Drug resistant epilepsy causes great danger in clinical and still lacks effective treatments.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here, we used multifaceted approaches combining electrophysiology, optogenetics and chemogenetics in a classic phenytoin resistant epilepsy model to reveal the key target of subicular pyramidal neurons in phenytoin resistance.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>In vivo</i> neural recording showed that the firing rate of pyramidal neurons in the subiculum, but not other hippocampal subregions, could not be inhibited by phenytoin in phenytoin resistant rats. Selective inhibition of subicular pyramidal neurons by optogenetics or chemogenetics reversed phenytoin resistance, while selective activation of subicular pyramidal neurons induced phenytoin resistance. Moreover, long‐term low frequency stimulation at the subiculum, which is clinically feasible, significantly inhibited the subicular pyramidal neurons and reversed phenytoin resistance. Further, <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiology revealed that off‐target of phenytoin on sodium channels of subicular pyramidal neurons were involved in the phenytoin resistance, and clinical neuroimage data suggested the volume of the subiculum in drug‐resistant patients was related with the usage of sodium channel inhibitors.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results highlight that the subicular pyramidal neurons may be a key “switch” control of drug resistant epilepsy and represent a new potential target for precise treatments.</p>

<p>Mechanical sensitization is one of the most difficult clinical pain problems to treat. However, the molecular and genetic bases of mechanical nociception are unclear. Here we develop a <i>Drosophila</i> model of mechanical nociception to investigate the ion channels and signaling pathways that regulate mechanical nociception. We fabricated von Frey filaments that span the subthreshold to high noxious range for <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. Using these, we discovered that pressure (force/area), rather than force per se, is the main determinant of aversive rolling responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. We demonstrated that the RTK PDGF/VEGF receptor (Pvr) and its ligands (Pvfs 2 and 3) are required for mechanical nociception and normal dendritic branching. Pvr is expressed and functions in class IV sensory neurons, whereas Pvf2 and Pvf3 are produced by multiple tissues. Constitutive overexpression of Pvr and its ligands or inducible overexpression of Pvr led to mechanical hypersensitivity that could be partially separated from morphological effects. Genetic analyses revealed that the Piezo and Pain ion channels are required for mechanical hypersensitivity observed upon ectopic activation of Pvr signaling. PDGF, but not VEGF, peptides caused mechanical hypersensitivity in rats. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF receptor Type 2 (VEGFR-2) signaling attenuated mechanical nociception in rats, suggesting a conserved role for PDGF and VEGFR-2 signaling in regulating mechanical nociception. VEGFR-2 inhibition also attenuated morphine analgesic tolerance in rats. Our results reveal that a conserved RTK signaling pathway regulates baseline mechanical nociception in flies and rats.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hypersensitivity to touch is poorly understood and extremely difficult to treat. Using a refined <i>Drosophila</i> model of mechanical nociception, we discovered a conserved VEGF-related receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway that regulates mechanical nociception in flies. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of VEGF receptor Type 2 signaling in rats causes analgesia and blocks opioid tolerance. We have thus established a robust, genetically tractable system for the rapid identification and functional analysis of conserved genes underlying mechanical pain sensitivity.</p>

<p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of neuronal depolarization thought to underlie migraine aura. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator involved in migraine pathophysiology. Evidence for functional connectivity between CSD and CGRP has triggered scientific interest in the possibility that CGRP antagonism may disrupt vascular responses to CSD and the ensuing plasma protein extravasation (PPE). Using imaging tools that allow us to generate continuous, live, high-resolution views of spatial and temporal changes that affect arteries and veins in the dura and pia, we determined the extent to which CGRP contributes to the induction of arterial dilatation or PPE by CSD in female rats, and how these events are affected by the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody (anti-CGRP-mAb) fremanezumab. We found that the CSD-induced brief dilatation and prolonged constriction of pial arteries, prolonged dilatation of dural arteries and PPE are all unaffected by fremanezumab, whereas the brief constriction and prolonged dilatation of pial veins are affected. In comparison, although CGRP infusion gave rise to the expected dilatation of dural arteries, which was effectively blocked by fremanezumab, it did not induce dilatation in pial arteries, pial veins, or dural veins. It also failed to induce PPE. Regardless of whether the nociceptors become active before or after the induction of arterial dilatation or PPE by CSD, the inability of fremanezumab to prevent them suggests that these events are not mediated by CGRP, a conclusion with important implications for our understanding of the mechanism of action of anti-CGRP-mAbs in migraine prevention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The current study identifies fundamental differences between two commonly used models of migraine, CSD induction and systemic CGRP infusion. It raises the possibility that conclusions drawn from one model may not be true or relevant to the other. It sharpens the need to accept the view that there is more than one truth to migraine pathophysiology and that it is unlikely that one theory will explain all types of migraine headache or the mechanisms of action of drugs that prevent it. Regarding the latter, it is concluded that not all vascular responses in the meninges are born alike and, consequently, that drugs that prevent vascular dilatation through different molecular pathways may have different therapeutic outcomes in different types of migraine.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/30/5986?rss=1">Neuromodulatory Action of Picomolar Extracellular A{beta}42 Oligomers on Presynaptic and Postsynaptic Mechanisms Underlying Synaptic Function and Memory</a></h4>

<p>Failure of anti-amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) therapies against Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by high amounts of the peptide in the brain, raised the question of the physiological role of Aβ released at low concentrations in the healthy brain. To address this question, we studied the presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms underlying the neuromodulatory action of picomolar amounts of oligomeric Aβ<sub>42</sub> (oAβ<sub>42</sub>) on synaptic glutamatergic function in male and female mice. We found that 200 pm oAβ<sub>42</sub> induces an increase of frequency of miniature EPSCs and a decrease of paired pulse facilitation, associated with an increase in docked vesicle number, indicating that it augments neurotransmitter release at presynaptic level. oAβ<sub>42</sub> also produced postsynaptic changes as shown by an increased length of postsynaptic density, accompanied by an increased expression of plasticity-related proteins such as cAMP-responsive element binding protein phosphorylated at Ser133, calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II phosphorylated at Thr286, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, suggesting a role for Aβ in synaptic tagging. These changes resulted in the conversion of early into late long-term potentiation through the nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G intracellular cascade consistent with a cGMP-dependent switch from short- to long-term memory observed <i>in vivo</i> after intrahippocampal administration of picomolar amounts of oAβ<sub>42</sub>. These effects were present upon extracellular but not intracellular application of the peptide and involved α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These observations clarified the physiological role of oAβ<sub>42</sub> in synaptic function and memory formation providing solid fundamentals for investigating the pathological effects of high Aβ levels in the AD brains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> High levels of oligomeric amyloid-β<sub>42</sub> (oAβ<sub>42</sub>) induce synaptic dysfunction leading to memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, at picomolar concentrations, the peptide is needed to ensure long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Here, we show that extracellular 200 pm oAβ<sub>42</sub> concentrations increase neurotransmitter release, number of docked vesicles, postsynaptic density length, and expression of plasticity-related proteins leading to the conversion of early LTP into late LTP and of short-term memory into long-term memory. These effects require α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and are mediated through the nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G pathway. The knowledge of Aβ function in the healthy brain might be useful to understand the causes leading to its increase and detrimental effect in AD.</p>

<p>Attention can be subdivided into several components, including alertness and spatial attention. It is believed that the behavioral benefits of attention, such as increased accuracy and faster reaction times, are generated by an increase in neural activity and a decrease in neural variability, which enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of task-relevant neural populations. However, empirical evidence regarding attention-related changes in neural variability in humans is extremely rare. Here we used EEG to demonstrate that trial-by-trial neural variability was reduced by visual cues that modulated alertness and spatial attention. Reductions in neural variability were specific to the visual system and larger in the contralateral hemisphere of the attended visual field. Subjects with higher initial levels of neural variability and larger decreases in variability exhibited greater behavioral benefits from attentional cues. These findings demonstrate that both alertness and spatial attention modulate neural variability and highlight the importance of reducing/quenching neural variability for attaining the behavioral benefits of attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention is thought to improve perception by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the neuronal populations that encode the attended stimulus. Signal-to-noise ratio can be enhanced by increasing neural response (signal) and/or by reducing neural variability (noise). The ability of attention to increase neural responses has been studied extensively, but the effects of attention on neural variability have rarely been examined in humans. Here, we demonstrate that modulating different components of attention, including alertness and spatial attention, reduces neural variability in humans. Furthermore, we show that subjects with larger reductions in neural variability exhibit greater behavioral benefits from attention. These results demonstrate that reduction of neural variability is a fundamental feature of attentional processes in humans with clear behavioral importance.</p>

<p>The middle temporal gyrus (MTG) has been shown to be recruited during the processing of words, but also during the observation of actions. Here we investigated how information related to words and gestures is organized along the MTG. To this aim, we measured the BOLD response in the MTG to video clips of gestures and spoken words in 17 healthy human adults (male and female). Gestures consisted of videos of an actress performing object-use pantomimes (iconic representations of object-directed actions; e.g., playing guitar), emblems (conventional gestures, e.g., thumb up), and meaningless gestures. Word stimuli (verbs, nouns) consisted of video clips of the same actress pronouncing words. We found a stronger response to meaningful compared with meaningless gestures along the whole left and large portions of the right MTG. Importantly, we observed a gradient, with posterior regions responding more strongly to gestures (pantomimes and emblems) than words and anterior regions showing a stronger response to words than gestures. In an intermediate region in the left hemisphere, the response was significantly higher to words and emblems (i.e., items with a greater arbitrariness of the sign-to-meaning mapping) than to pantomimes. These results show that the large-scale organization of information in the MTG is driven by the input modality and may also reflect the arbitrariness of the relationship between sign and meaning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we investigated the organizing principle of information in the middle temporal gyrus, taking into consideration the input-modality and the arbitrariness of the relationship between a sign and its meaning. We compared the middle temporal gyrus response during the processing of pantomimes, emblems, and spoken words. We found that posterior regions responded more strongly to pantomimes and emblems than to words, whereas anterior regions responded more strongly to words than to pantomimes and emblems. In an intermediate region, only in the left hemisphere, words and emblems evoked a stronger response than pantomimes. Our results identify two organizing principles of neural representation: the modality of communication (gestural or verbal) and the (arbitrariness of the) relationship between sign and meanings.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/30/5949?rss=1">Diacylglycerol Lipase-Alpha Regulates Hippocampal-Dependent Learning and Memory Processes in Mice</a></h4>

<p>Diacylglycerol lipase-α (DAGL-α), the principal biosynthetic enzyme of the endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) on neurons, plays a key role in CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis, but its contribution to global hippocampal-mediated processes remains unknown. Thus, the present study examines the role that DAGL-α plays on LTP in hippocampus, as well as in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory tasks, and on the production of endocannabinoid and related lipids through the use of complementary pharmacologic and genetic approaches to disrupt this enzyme in male mice. Here we show that DAGL-α gene deletion or pharmacological inhibition disrupts LTP in CA1 of the hippocampus but elicits varying magnitudes of behavioral learning and memory deficits in mice. In particular, <i>DAGL</i>-α<sup>–/–</sup> mice display profound impairments in the Object Location assay and Morris Water Maze (MWM) acquisition engaging in nonspatial search strategies. In contrast, WT mice administered the DAGL-α inhibitor DO34 show delays in MWM acquisition and reversal learning, but no deficits in expression, extinction, forgetting, or perseveration processes in this task, as well as no impairment in Object Location. The deficits in synaptic plasticity and MWM performance occur in concert with decreased 2-AG and its major lipid metabolite (arachidonic acid), but increases of a 2-AG diacylglycerol precursor in hippocampus, PFC, striatum, and cerebellum. These novel behavioral and electrophysiological results implicate a direct and perhaps selective role of DAGL-α in the integration of new spatial information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we show that genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of diacylglycerol lipase-α (DAGL-α) impairs hippocampal CA1 LTP, differentially disrupts spatial learning and memory performance in Morris water maze (MWM) and Object Location tasks, and alters brain levels of endocannabinoids and related lipids. Whereas <i>DAGL</i>-α<sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibit profound phenotypic spatial memory deficits, a DAGL inhibitor selectively impairs the integration of new information in MWM acquisition and reversal tasks, but not memory processes of expression, extinction, forgetting, or perseveration, and does not affect performance in the Objection Location task. The findings that constitutive or short-term DAGL-α disruption impairs learning and memory at electrophysiological and selective <i>in vivo</i> levels implicate this enzyme as playing a key role in the integration of new spatial information.</p>

<p>Epidemiological studies indicate that insulin resistance (IR), a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, is associated with an increased risk of major depression. Here, we demonstrated that male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited peripheral metabolic impairments reminiscent of IR accompanied by elevated circulating levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), whereas both parameters were normalized by chronic treatment with metformin (Met). Given the role of BCAAs in the regulation of tryptophan influx into the brain, we then explored the activity of the serotonin (5-HT) system. Our results indicated that HFD-fed mice displayed impairment in the electrical activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons, attenuated hippocampal extracellular 5-HT concentrations and anxiety, one of the most visible and early symptoms of depression. On the contrary, Met stimulated 5-HT neurons excitability and 5-HT neurotransmission while hindering HFD-induced anxiety. Met also promoted antidepressant-like activities as observed with fluoxetine. In light of these data, we designed a modified HFD in which BCAA dietary supply was reduced by half. Deficiency in BCAAs failed to reverse HFD-induced metabolic impairments while producing antidepressant-like activity and enhancing the behavioral response to fluoxetine. Our results suggest that Met may act by decreasing circulating BCAAs levels to favor serotonergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and promote antidepressant-like effects in mice fed an HFD. These findings also lead us to envision that a diet poor in BCAAs, provided either alone or as add-on therapy to conventional antidepressant drugs, could help to relieve depressive symptoms in patients with metabolic comorbidities.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Insulin resistance in humans is associated with increased risk of anxiodepressive disorders. Such a relationship has been also found in rodents fed a high-fat diet (HFD). To determine whether insulin-sensitizing strategies induce anxiolytic- and/or antidepressant-like activities and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, we tested the effects of metformin, an oral antidiabetic drug, in mice fed an HFD. Metformin reduced levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids, which regulate tryptophan uptake within the brain. Moreover, metformin increased hippocampal serotonergic neurotransmission while promoting anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, a diet poor in these amino acids produced similar beneficial behavioral property. Collectively, these results suggest that metformin could be used as add-on therapy to a conventional antidepressant for the comorbidity between metabolic and mental disorders.</p>

<p>The human PFC has been associated more with meta-perceptual as opposed to meta-memory decisions from correlational neuroimaging investigations. Recently, metacognitive abilities have also been shown to be causally dependent upon anterior and dorsal PFC in nonhuman primate lesion studies. Two studies, using postdecision wagering paradigms and reversible inactivation, challenged this meta-perceptual versus meta-memory notion and showed that dorsal and anterior prefrontal areas are associated with metamemory for experienced objects and awareness of ignorance, respectively. Causal investigations are important but scarce; nothing is known, for example, about the causal contributions of prefrontal subregions to spatial metamemory. Here, we investigated the effects of dorsal versus ventral PFC lesions on two-alternative forced-choice spatial discrimination tasks in male macaque monkeys. Importantly, we were rigorous in approach and applied three independent but complementary indices used to quantify individual animals' metacognitive ability ("Type II sensitivity") by two variants of <i>meta-d'/d'</i> and phi coefficient (). Our results were consistent across indices: while neither lesions to superior dorsolateral PFC nor orbitofrontal cortex impaired spatial recognition performance, only monkeys with superior dorsolateral PFC lesions were impaired in meta-accuracy. Together with the observation that the same orbitofrontal cortex lesioned monkeys were impaired in updating rule value in a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test analog, we therefore document a functional double-dissociation between these two PFC regions. Our study presents important causal evidence that other dimensions, namely, domain-specific processing (e.g., spatial vs nonspatial metamemory), also need considerations in understanding the functional specialization in the neural underpinnings of introspection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study demonstrates macaque monkeys' metacognitive capability of introspecting its own memory success is causally dependent on intact superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortices but not the orbitofrontal cortices. Combining neurosurgical techniques on monkeys and state-of-the-art measures of metacognition, we affirm a critical role of the PFC in supporting spatial meta-recognition memory and delineate functional specificity within PFC for distinct elements of metacognition.</p>

<p>The speed of motor reaction to an external stimulus varies substantially between individuals and is slowed in aging. However, the neuroanatomical origins of interindividual variability in reaction time (RT) remain unclear. Here, we combined a cognitive model of RT and a biophysical compartment model of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) to characterize the relationship between RT and microstructure of the corticospinal tract (CST) and the optic radiation (OR), the primary motor output and visual input pathways associated with visual-motor responses. We fitted an accumulator model of RT to 46 female human participants' behavioral performance in a simple reaction time task. The non-decision time parameter (<i>T</i><sub>er</sub>) derived from the model was used to account for the latencies of stimulus encoding and action initiation. From multi-shell DWI data, we quantified tissue microstructure of the CST and OR with the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model as well as the conventional diffusion tensor imaging model. Using novel skeletonization and segmentation approaches, we showed that DWI-based microstructure metrics varied substantially along CST and OR. The <i>T</i><sub>er</sub> of individual participants was negatively correlated with the NODDI measure of the neurite density in the bilateral superior CST. Further, we found no significant correlation between the microstructural measures and mean RT. Thus, our findings suggest a link between interindividual differences in sensorimotor speed and selective microstructural properties in white-matter tracts.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does our brain structure contribute to our speed to react? Here, we provided anatomically specific evidence that interindividual differences in response speed is associated with white-matter microstructure. Using a cognitive model of reaction time (RT), we estimated the non-decision time, as an index of the latencies of stimulus encoding and action initiation, during a simple reaction time task. Using an advanced microstructural model for diffusion MRI, we estimated the tissue properties and their variations along the corticospinal tract and optic radiation. We found significant location-specific correlations between the microstructural measures and the model-derived parameter of non-decision time but not mean RT. These results highlight the neuroanatomical signature of interindividual variability in response speed along the sensorimotor pathways.</p>

<p>The striatum comprises of multiple functional territories involved with multilevel control of behavior. Disinhibition of different functional territories leads to territory-specific hyperkinetic and hyperbehavioral symptoms. The ventromedial striatum, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, is typically associated with limbic input but was historically linked to high-level motor control. In this study, performed in female Long–Evans rats, we show that the NAc core directly controls motor behavior on multiple timescales. On the macro-scale, following NAc disinhibition, the animals manifested prolonged hyperactivity, expressed as excessive normal behavior, whereas on the micro-scale multiple behavior transitions occurred, generating short movement segments. The underlying striatal network displayed population-based local field potential transient deflections (LFP spikes) whose rate determined the magnitude of the hyperactivity and whose timing corresponded to unitary behavioral transition events. Individual striatal neurons preserved normal baseline activity and network interactions following the disinhibition, maintaining the normal encoding of behavioral primitives and forming a sparse link between the LFP spikes and single neuron activity. Disinhibition of this classically limbic territory leads to profound motor changes resembling hyperactivity and attention deficit. These behavioral and neuronal results highlight the direct interplay on multiple timescales between different striatal territories during normal and pathological conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key part of the striatal limbic territory. In the current study we show that this classically limbic area directly controls motor behavior on multiple timescales. Focal disinhibition of the NAc core in freely behaving rats led to macro-scale hyperactivity and micro-scale behavioral transitions, symptoms typically associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The behavioral changes were encoded by the striatal LFP signal and single-unit spiking activity in line with the neuronal changes observed during tic expression following disinhibition of the striatal motor territory. These results point to the need to extend the existing parallel functional pathway concept of basal ganglia function to include the study of limbic-motor cross-territory interactions in both health and disease.</p>

<p>Rodents are the most commonly studied model system in neuroscience, but surprisingly few studies investigate the natural sensory stimuli that rodent nervous systems evolved to interpret. Even fewer studies examine neural responses to these natural stimuli. Decades of research have investigated the rat vibrissal (whisker) system in the context of direct touch and tactile stimulation, but recent work has shown that rats also use their whiskers to help detect and localize airflow. The present study investigates the neural basis for this ability as dictated by the mechanical response of whiskers to airflow. Mechanical experiments show that a whisker's vibration magnitude depends on airspeed and the intrinsic shape of the whisker. Surprisingly, the direction of the whisker's vibration changes as a function of airflow speed: vibrations transition from parallel to perpendicular with respect to the airflow as airspeed increases. Recordings from primary sensory trigeminal ganglion neurons show that these neurons exhibit responses consistent with those that would be predicted from direct touch. Trigeminal neuron firing rate increases with airspeed, is modulated by the orientation of the whisker relative to the airflow, and is influenced by the whisker's resonant frequencies. We develop a simple model to describe how a population of neurons could leverage mechanical relationships to decode both airspeed and direction. These results open new avenues for studying vibrissotactile regions of the brain in the context of evolutionarily important airflow-sensing behaviors and olfactory search. Although this study used only female rats, all results are expected to generalize to male rats.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The rodent vibrissal (whisker) system has been studied for decades in the context of direct tactile sensation, but recent work has indicated that rats also use whiskers to help localize airflow. Neural circuits in somatosensory regions of the rodent brain thus likely evolved in part to process airflow information. This study investigates the whiskers' mechanical response to airflow and the associated neural response. Airspeed affects the magnitude of whisker vibration and the response magnitude of whisker-sensitive primary sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion. Surprisingly, the direction of vibration and the associated directionally dependent neural response changes with airspeed. These findings suggest a population code for airflow speed and direction and open new avenues for studying vibrissotactile regions of the brain.</p>

<p>Columnar structure is a basic unit of the brain, but the mechanism underlying its development remains largely unknown. The medulla, the largest ganglion of the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> visual center, provides a unique opportunity to reveal the mechanisms of 3D organization of the columns. In this study, using N-cadherin (Ncad) as a marker, we reveal the donut-like columnar structures along the 2D layer in the larval medulla that evolves to form three distinct layers in pupal development. Column formation is initiated by three core neurons, R8, R7, and Mi1, which establish distinct concentric domains within a column. We demonstrate that Ncad-dependent relative adhesiveness of the core columnar neurons regulates their relative location within a column along a 2D layer in the larval medulla according to the differential adhesion hypothesis. We also propose the presence of mutual interactions among the three layers during formation of the 3D structures of the medulla columns.</p>

<p>Neural circuit development involves the coordinated growth and guidance of axons. During this process, axons encounter many different cues, but how these cues are integrated and translated into growth is poorly understood. In this study, we report that receptor signaling does not follow a linear path but changes dependent on developmental stage and coreceptors involved. Using developing chicken embryos of both sexes, our data show that calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein-coupled receptor important for regulating calcium homeostasis, regulates neurite growth in two distinct ways. First, when signaling in isolation, CaSR promotes growth through the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway. At later developmental stages, CaSR enhances tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)/BDNF-mediated neurite growth. This enhancement is facilitated through a switch in the signaling cascade downstream of CaSR (i.e., from the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway to activation of GSK3α Tyr279). TrkB and CaSR colocalize within late endosomes, cotraffic and coactivate GSK3, which serves as a shared signaling node for both receptors. Our study provides evidence that two unrelated receptors can integrate their individual signaling cascades toward a nonadditive effect and thus control neurite growth during development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work highlights the effect of receptor coactivation and signal integration in a developmental setting. During embryonic development, neurites grow toward their targets guided by cues in the extracellular environment. These cues are sensed by receptors at the surface that trigger intracellular signaling events modulating the cytoskeleton. Emerging evidence suggests that the effects of guidance cues are diversified, therefore expanding the number of responses. Here, we show that two unrelated receptors can change the downstream signaling cascade and regulate neuronal growth through a shared signaling node. In addition to unraveling a novel signaling pathway in neurite growth, this research stresses the importance of receptor coactivation and signal integration during development of the nervous system.</p>

Abstract<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. GABA A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) are pentameric ionotropic channels. Subunit composition of the receptors is associated with the affinity of GABA binding and its downstream inhibitory actions. Fluctuations in subunit expression levels with increasing age have been demonstrated in animal and human studies. However, our knowledge regarding the age-related hippocampal GABA<sub>A</sub>R expression changes is limited and based on rat studies. This study is the first analysis of the aging-related changes of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit expression in the CA1, CA2/3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the mouse hippocampus. Utilizing Western blotting and immunohistochemistry we found that the GABAergic system is robust, with no significant age-related differences in GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1, α2, α3, α5, β3 and 2 subunit expression level differences found between the young (6 months) and old (21 months) age groups in any of the hippocampal regions examined. However, we detected a localized decrease of α2 subunit expression around the soma, proximal dendrites and in the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions that is accompanied by a pronounced upregulation of the α2 subunit immunoreactivity in the neuropil of aged mice. In summary, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are well preserved in the mouse hippocampus during normal aging although GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the hippocampus are severely affected in age-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The current knowledge on GABAergic age-related alterations across different regions of the mouse brain is limited. These findings highlight that hippocampal GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit composition and receptor function is well preserved in the hippocampus during normal aging in mice. Aging is the main risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders characterized by established remodeling of the hippocampal GABAergic system. Mice are frequently used as diseases models of aging, and the majority of the transgenic animal based research on neurodegenerative conditions has been conducted with mouse models, but the age-related GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit expression changes have not been examined in the mouse brain. Therefore, studies like this are necessary to understand the importance of age in study design and interpretation of results.</p>

<p>Plasticity after stroke is a complex phenomenon initiated by the functional
reorganization of the brain, especially in the perilesional tissue. At
macroscales, the reestablishment of segregation within the affected hemisphere
and interhemispheric integration has been extensively documented in the
reconfiguration of brain networks. However, the local connection mechanisms
generating such global network changes are still largely unknown as well as
their potential to better predict the outcome of patients. To address this
question, time must be considered as a formal variable of the problem and not
just a simple repeated observation. Here, we hypothesize that the temporal
formation of basic connection blocks such as intermodule edges and intramodule
triangles would be sufficient to determine the large-scale brain reorganization
after stroke. To test our hypothesis, we adopted a statistical approach based
on temporal exponential random graph models (tERGMs). First, we validated the
overall performance on synthetic time-varying networks simulating the
reconfiguration process after stroke. Then, using longitudinal functional
connectivity measurements of resting-state brain activity, we showed that both
the formation of triangles within the affected hemisphere and interhemispheric
links are sufficient to reproduce the longitudinal brain network changes from 2
weeks to 1 year after the stroke. Finally, we showed that these temporal
connection mechanisms are over-expressed in the subacute phase as compared to
healthy controls and predicted the chronic language and visual outcome
respectively in patients with subcortical and cortical lesions, whereas static
approaches failed to do so. Our results indicate the importance of considering
time-varying connection properties when modeling dynamic complex systems and
provide fresh insights into the network mechanisms of stroke recovery.

<p>The human connectome has become the very frequent subject of study of
brain-scientists, psychologists, and imaging experts in the last decade. With
diffusion magnetic resonance imaging techniques, unified with advanced data
processing algorithms, today we are able to compute braingraphs with several
hundred, anatomically identified nodes and thousands of edges, corresponding to
the anatomical connections of the brain. The analysis of these graphs without
refined mathematical tools is hopeless. These tools need to address the high
error rate of the MRI processing workflow, and need to find structural causes
or at least correlations of psychological properties and cerebral connections.
Until now, structural connectomics was only rarely able identifying such causes
or correlations. In the present work, we study the frequent neighbor sets of
the most deeply investigated brain area, the hippocampus. By applying the
Frequent Network Neighborhood mapping method, we identified frequent
neighbor-sets of the hippocampus, which may influence numerous psychological
parameters, including intelligence-related ones. We have found neighbor sets,
which have significantly higher frequency in subjects with high-scored Penn
Matrix tests, and with low-scored Penn Word Memory tests. Our study utilizes
the braingraphs, computed from the imaging data of the Human Connectome
Project's 414 subjects, each with 463 anatomically identified nodes.

<p>Stroke-induced disturbances of large-scale cortical networks are known to be
associated with the extent of motor deficits. We argue that identifying brain
networks representative of motor behavior in the resting brain would provide
significant insights for current neurorehabilitation approaches. Particularly,
we aim to investigate the global configuration of brain rhythms and their
relation to motor skill, instead of learning performance as broadly studied. We
empirically approach this problem by conducting a three-dimensional physical
space visuomotor learning experiment during electroencephalographic (EEG) data
recordings with thirty-seven healthy participants. We demonstrate that
across-subjects variations in average movement smoothness as the quantified
measure of subjects' motor skills can be predicted from the global
configuration of resting-state EEG alpha-rhythms (8-14 Hz) recorded prior to
the experiment. Importantly, this neural signature of motor skill was found to
be orthogonal to (independent of) task -- as well as to learning-related
changes in alpha-rhythms, which we interpret as an organizing principle of the
brain. We argue that disturbances of such configurations in the brain may
contribute to motor deficits in stroke, and that reconfiguring stroke patients'
brain rhythms by neurofeedback may enhance post-stroke neurorehabilitation.

<p>The theory of communication through coherence (CTC) proposes that brain
oscillations reflect changes in the excitability of neurons, and therefore the
successful communication between two oscillating neural populations depends not
only on the strength of the signal emitted but also on the relative phases
between them. More precisely, effective communication occurs when the emitting
and receiving populations are properly phase locked so the inputs sent by the
emitting population arrive at the phases of maximal excitability of the
receiving population. To study this setting, we consider a population rate
model consisting of excitatory and inhibitory cells modelling the receiving
population, and we perturb it with a time-dependent periodic function modelling
the input from the emitting population. We consider the stroboscopic map for
this system and compute numerically the fixed and periodic points of this map
and their bifurcations as the amplitude and the frequency of the perturbation
are varied. From the bifurcation diagram, we identify the phase-locked states
as well as different regions of bistability. We explore carefully the dynamics
emphasizing its implications for the CTC theory. In particular, we study how
the input gain depends on the timing between the input and the inhibitory
action of the receiving population. Our results show that naturally an optimal
phase locking for CTC emerges, and provide a mechanism by which the receiving
population can implement selective communication. Moreover, the presence of
bistable regions, suggests a mechanism by which different communication regimes
between brain areas can be established without changing the structure of the
network

<p>This paper suggests a statistical framework for describing the relations
between the physical and conceptual entities of a brain-like model. In
particular, features and concept instances are put into context. This may help
with understanding or implementing a similar model. The paper suggests that
features are in fact the wiring. With this idea, the actual length of the
connection is important, because it is related to firing rates and neuron
synchronization. The paper then suggests that concepts are neuron groups that
link features and concept instances are the signals from those groups.
Therefore, features become the static framework of the interconnected neural
system and concepts are combinations of these, as determined by the external
stimulus and the neural synaptic strengths. Along with this statistical model,
it is possible to propose a simplified design for a neuron, based on an action
potential and variable output signal. A strong comparison with Hebbian theory
is then proposed, with some test results to support the theory.

Top-down, feedback projections account for a large portion of all connections between neurons in the thalamocortical system, yet their precise role remains the subject of much discussion. A large number of studies has focused on investigating how sensory information is transformed across hierarchically-distributed processing stages in a feedforward fashion, and computational models have shown that purely feedforward artificial neural networks can even outperform humans in pattern classification tasks. What is then the functional role of feedback connections? Several key roles have been identified, ranging from attentional modulation to, crucially, conscious perception. Specifically, most of the major theories on consciousness postulate that feedback connections would play an essential role in enabling sensory information to be consciously perceived. Consequently, it follows that their efficacy in modulating target regions should drastically decrease in nonconscious brain states (non-REM sleep, anesthesia) compared to conscious ones (wakefulness), and also in instances when a given sensory stimulus is not perceived compared to when it is. Until recently, however, this prediction could only be tested with correlative experiments, due to the lack of techniques to selectively manipulate and measure the activity of feedback pathways. In this paper we will review the most recent literature on the functions of feedback connections across brain states and based on the presence or absence of perception. We will focus on experiments studying mismatch negativity, a phenomenon which has been hypothesized to rely on top-down modulation but which persists during nonconscious states. While feedback modulation is generally dampened in nonconscious states and enhanced when perception occurs, there are clear deviations from this rule. As we will discuss, this may pose a challenge to most theories of consciousness, and possibly require a change in how the level of consciousness in supposedly nonconscious states is assessed.

The numbers and strengths of synapses in the brain change throughout development, and even into adulthood, as synaptic inputs are added, eliminated, and refined in response to ongoing neural activity. A number of experimental techniques can assess these changes, including single- cell electrophysiological recording which offers measurements of synaptic inputs with high temporal resolution. Coupled with electrical stimulation, photoactivatable opsins, and caged compounds, to facilitate fine spatiotemporal control over release of neurotransmitters, electrophysiological recordings allow for precise dissection of presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms of action. Here, we discuss the strengths and pitfalls of various techniques commonly used to analyze synapses, including miniature excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents, evoked release, and optogenetic stimulation. Together, these techniques can provide multiple lines of convergent evidence to generate meaningful insight into the emergence of circuit connectivity and maturation. A full understanding of potential caveats and alternative explanations for findings is essential to avoid data misinterpretation.

To evaluate the contribution of the DNA methylation and DNA demethylation pathways in retinal development, we studied DNA methylation in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and retinal neurons using a combination of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data obtained in our study and WGBS data collected from previous studies. The data was analyzed using Hidden Markov Model- and change point-based methods to identify methylome states in different segments of the studied genomes following genome annotation. We found that promoters of rod and cone phototransduction genes and rod photoreceptor genes, but not genes required for the development and function of other retinal phenotypes, were highly methylated in DNA isolated from human and murine fetal retinas (which mostly contain RPCs) and postnatal murine RPCs. While these highly methylated genomic regions were inherited by non-photoreceptor phenotypes during RPC differentiation, the methylation of these promoters was significantly reduced during RPC differentiation into photoreceptors and accompanied by increased expression of these genes. Our analysis of DNA methylation during embryogenesis revealed low methylation levels in genomic regions containing photoreceptor genes at the inner cell mass stage, but a sharp increase in methylation at the epiblast stage, which remained the same later on (except for DNA demethylation in photoreceptors). Thus, our data suggest that the DNA demethylation pathway is required for photoreceptor phenotypes in the developing retina. Meanwhile, the role of the DNA methylation and DNA demethylation pathways during RPC differentiation into non-photoreceptor retinal phenotypes might be less important.

Status epilepticus (SE, a prolonged seizure activity) leads to reactive astrogliosis and astroglial apoptosis in the regional specific manners, independent of hemodynamics. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) activity is relevant to these distinct astroglial responses. Since various regulatory signaling molecules beyond PARP1 activity may be involved in the distinct astroglial response to SE, it is noteworthy to explore the roles of protein kinases in PARP1-mediated reactive astrogliosis and astroglial apoptosis following SE, albeit at a lesser extent. In the present study, inhibitions of protein kinase C (PKC), AKT and extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), but not calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), attenuated CA1 reactive astrogliosis accompanied by reducing PARP1 activity following SE, respectively. However, inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 deteriorated SE-induced dentate astroglial loss concomitant with the diminished PARP1 activity. Following SE, PKC- and AKT inhibitors diminished phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa (PEA15)-S104 and -S116 phosphorylations in CA1 astrocytes, but not in dentate astrocytes, respectively. Inhibitors of PKC, AKT and ERK1/2 also abrogated SE-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-S311 and -S468 phosphorylations in CA1 astrocytes. In contrast, both AKT and ERK1/2 inhibitors enhanced NF-κB-S468 phosphorylation in dentate astrocytes. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitor aggravated dentate astroglial loss following SE. AKT inhibition deteriorated dentate astroglial loss and led to CA1 astroglial apoptosis following SE, which were ameliorated by AKT activation. These findings suggest that activities of PARP1, PEA15 and NF-κB may be distinctly regulated by PKC, AKT and ERK1/2, which may be involved in regional specific astroglial responses following SE.

α5 subunit containing GABA type A receptors (GABAARs) have long been an enigmatic receptor subtype of interest due to their specific brain distribution, unusual surface localization and key role in synaptic plasticity, cognition and memory. These receptors are uniquely positioned to sculpt both the developing and mature hippocampal circuitry due to high overall expression and a distinct peak during the critical synapse formation period during the second postnatal week. Unlike the majority of other GABAARs, they exhibit both receptor clustering at extrasynaptic sites via interactions with the radixin scaffold as well as synaptic sites via gephyrin, thus contributing respectively to tonic currents and synaptic GABAergic neurotransmission. α5 GABAAR signaling can be altered in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and mental retardation and by inflammation in CNS injury and disease. Due to the unique physiology and pharmacology of α5 GABAARs, drugs targeting these receptors are being developed and tested as treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and mild cognitive impairment. This review focuses on advances in understanding how the α5 subunit contributes to GABAAR neurobiology. In particular I discuss both recent insights and remaining knowledge gaps for the functional role of these receptors, pathologies associated with α5 GABAAR dysfunction, and the effects and potential therapeutic uses of α5 receptor subtype targeted drugs.

In the present study, we conducted microarray gene expression profiling to explore the direction of differentiation of human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) treated with rosmarinic acid (RA).  hAECs have several clinical advantages over other types of stem cells, including availability, low immunogenicity, low rejection rate, nontumorigenecity, and less ethical constraint. On the other hand, RA is a phenolic compound having several health benefits, including neuroprotective and antidepressant-like activities. In this study, hAECs were isolated from discarded term placenta and were treated with 20 μM RA for seven days. Microarray gene expression profiling was conducted for three biological replicates of RA-treated and untreated control cells on day 0 and day 7. Gene set enrichment analysis, and gene annotation and pathway analysis were conducted using online data mining tools GSEA and DAVID. Gene expression profiling showed that RA treatment biased hAECs towards ectodermal lineage progression, regulated transcription factors involved in neuronal differentiation, regulated neural specific epigenetic modifiers and several extracellular signaling pathways of neural induction, and significantly inhibited Notch signaling pathway. Gene expression profiling of RA-treated hAECs reveals for the first time a potential role of RA in neural induction and neuronal differentiation of hAECs. Having a naturally occurring compound as differentiation inducer as well as a readily available source of stem cells would have great advantages for the cell-based therapies. Findings from our genome-wide analysis could provide a foundation for further in-depth investigation.

There is a pressing need to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the depression symptoms in patients with post-stroke depression (PSD) in order to inform targeted therapeutic approaches. While previous research has demonstrated a reorganization in the functional brain network of PSD, it remains uncertain whether or not it also occurs in the structural brain network. We therefore aim to investigate the structural brain network of patients with PSD as compared to post-stroke non-depression (PSND) patients. In addition, our research considers the relationship between network metrics and functional measurements. Thirty-one PSD patients and twenty-three PSND patients were recruited. All patients underwent MRI and functional assessments, including the Barthel Index, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Diffusion tensor imaging was used to construct the structural brain network and to conduct the subsequent graph theoretical analysis. Network measures were computed and compared between PSD and PSND patients. Associations between functional assessments and network measures were studied as well. We successfully detected increased global and local efficiency in patients with PSD. Regions with disrupted local connections were located primarily in the cognitive and limbic systems. More importantly, PSD patients’ global and regional network measures were associated with depression severity, as measured by HAMD. These findings suggest that disrupted global and local network topologies might contribute to PSD patients’ depression symptoms. Therefore, connectome-based network measures could be potential bio-markers for evaluating stroke patients’ depression levels.

Recent studies have demonstrated the close relationship between the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and resting state functional connectivity changes in the normal healthy people. However, little is known about the different parameters changes of the most vulnerable regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we collected resting-state perfusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data including 40 AD patients and 30 healthy controls. By using voxel wise arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion, we firstly identified several regions of the altered rCBF in the AD patients. And then, by using resting state fMRI analysis including amplitude low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and seed based functional connectivity, we explored the changes of the functional activities and connectivities based on the identified rCBF regions. We extracted the cognitive related parameters and search for the sensitive biomarker to differentiate the AD and normal controls. As the results, compared with controls, the AD patients showed distinct disruption of rCBF, which were mainly located in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and left precuneus (PCu). ALFF was performed based on the seven regions identified by the ASL method, AD patients showed significantly decreased ALFF in left PCC, left IPL, right MTG, left MOG, and left PCu and increased ALFF in the bilateral DLPFC. We constitute the network based on the seven regions and found the decreased connectivity among the identified regions in the AD patients, predicting to the disruption of the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN) and visual network (VN). Furthermore, these abnormal parameters are closely correlated with cognitive performances in the AD patients. We combined the rCBF and ALFF value of PCC/PCu as biomarker to differciate the two groups and reached the sensitivity of 85.3% and speciﬁcity of 88.5%. Conclusively, our findings suggested that disrupted regional cerebral blood flow, functional activity and connectivity in specific cognitive related regions in Alzheimer’s disease, which can be used as the valuable imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases are among the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. The disease-related socioeconomic burden is expected to increase with the steadily increasing life expectancy. In spite of decades of clinical and basic research, most strategies designed to manage degenerative brain diseases are palliative. This is not surprising as neurodegeneration progresses “silently” for decades before symptoms are noticed. Importantly, conceptual models with heuristic value used to study neurodegeneration have been constructed retrospectively, based on signs and symptoms already present in affected patients; a circumstance that may confound causes and consequences. Hence, innovative, paradigm-shifting views of the etiology of these diseases are necessary to enable their timely prevention and treatment.
Here, we outline four alternative views, not mutually exclusive, on different etiological paths towards neurodegeneration. First, we propose neurodegeneration as being a secondary outcome of a primary cardiovascular cause with vascular pathology disrupting the vital homeostatic interactions between the vasculature and the brain resulting in cognitive impairment, dementia, and cerebrovascular events such as stroke. Second, we suggest that the persistence of senescent cells in neuronal circuits may favor, together with systemic metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration to occur. Third, we argue that neurodegeneration may start in response to altered body and brain trophic interactions established via the hardwire that connects peripheral targets with central neuronal structures or by means of extracellular vesicle-mediated communication. Lastly, we elaborate on how lifespan body dysbiosis may be linked to the origin of neurodegeneration. We highlight the existence of bacterial products that modulate the gut-brain axis causing neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction.
As a concluding section, we end by recommending research avenues to investigate these etiological paths in the future. This think that this requires an integrated, interdisciplinary conceptual research approach based on the investigation of multimodal aspects of physiology and pathophysiology. It involves utilizing proper conceptual models, experimental animal units, and identifying currently unused opportunities derived from human data. Overall, the proposed etiological paths and experimental recommendations will be important guidelines for future cross-discipline research to overcome the translational roadblock and to develop causative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract
Background and objective: Low Intensity Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) is a new form of non-invasive brain modulation with promising data; however, systematic reviews on the brain modulatory effects of TUS on both animals and humans have not been well conducted. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on the studies using the TUS to modulate the brain functions and associated behavioral changes in both animals and humans. 
Methods: A literature search for published studies in the past 10 years was conducted. Two authors independently reviewed the relevant articles. Data were extracted and qualitatively summarized. Quality of studies was assessed by the SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool for preclinical studies or PEDro scale for clinical studies. 
Results: A total of 24 animal studies (506 animals) and 11 human studies (213 subjects) were included. Findings based on most animal studies demonstrated the excitatory or suppressive modulatory effects of ultrasonic stimulations on motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, auditory and visual areas. Brain modulatory effects also were found among healthy human subjects in seven studies and two clinical studies suggested TUS may result in potential benefits on patients with disorder of consciousness or chronic pain. The safety concerns of TUS seem to be minor based on the human studies. 
Conclusions: TUS appears to be a viable technique in modulating the brain functions; however, research on TUS is still in its early stages, especially in human studies. Parameters need to be optimized before launching systematic investigations in humans.

Aim: To assess changes in the developmental trajectory of corticospinal tracts maturation in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). 
Methods: Neuroimaging data were obtained from 36 children with HCP for both the more affected and less affected hemispheres, and, for purposes of direct comparison, between groups, 15 typically developing children. With diffusion tensor imaging, we estimated the mean fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity of the corticospinal tract, parameters indicative of factors including myelination and axon density. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed as a neurophysiologic measure of corticospinal tract integrity and organization. Resting motor threshold was obtained per hemisphere, per patient.
Results: We observed a significant axial diffusivity and mean diffusivity developmental trajectory, both of which were inversely related to age (decrease in axial diffusivity and diffusivity corresponding to increased age) in both hemispheres of typically developing children (p&lt;0.001). This maturation process was absent in both more affected and less affected hemispheres of children with HCP. Additionally, the TMS-derived previously established resting motor threshold developmental trajectory was preserved in the less affected hemisphere of children with HCP (n=26; p&lt;0.0001) but this trajectory was absent in the more affected hemisphere. 
Conclusions: Corticospinal tract maturation arrests in both hemispheres of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, possibly reflecting perinatal disruption of corticospinal tract myelination and axonal integrity.

Transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is a promising therapy for ischemic stroke. Previously, we had reported that the secondary degeneration occurred in the ipsilateral substantia nigra (SN) after permanent distal branch of middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) in Sprague-Dawley rats. However, whether BMSCs have neurorestorative effects on the secondary damage in the SN after focal cerebral infarction has not known. In this study, rats were subjected to dMCAO followed by intravenous administration of BMSCs 1 day later. We found that transplanted BMSCs survived and migrated to cortical infarct areas and ipsilateral SN. Furthermore, BMSCs promoted neurogenesis through proliferation and differentiation in the SN after dMCAO. Rats implanted with BMSCs showed significant improvement in their performance of modified neurological severity scores and adhesive-removal test. Engrafted BMSCs enhanced survival of dopaminergic neuron, reduced gliosis in the ipsilateral SN, and increased contents of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the ipsilateral striatum after dMCAO. With pseudorabies virus-152 as a retrograde tracer, we also demonstrated that BMSCs could effectively enhance the cortico-striatum-nigral connections. These results suggest that BMSCs transplantation exerts neurorestorative effects after cortical infarction through promoting endogenous neurogenesis, increasing contents of DA and its metabolites, alleviating the secondary neuronal damage in the SN, enhancing the cortico-striatum-nigral projections pathway, and finally improving the neurological functional outcome.

Restoration of neuronal connectivity after lesion of the central nervous system, such as spinal cord injury, is one of the biggest challenges in modern medicine. In particular, the accumulation of axon growth inhibitory factors at the site of injury constitutes a major obstacle to structural and thus functional repair. We previously investigated a group of prenylflavonoids derived from hops for their capacity to promote neuroregeneration and identified a molecule called ENDF1 that was very potent to enhance regrowth and branching of neurites from dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture on growth promoting substrates. In the present study, we investigated ENDF1's capacity to promote regeneration of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro in the presence of three main components of the extracellular matrix acting as axon growth inhibitors: Semaphorin3A, EphrinA4 and mixed chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans. We report that ENDF1 application significantly promoted the percentages of sensory neurons able to regrow their neurites regardless of the presence of those inhibitors, and this to an extent similar to the one obtained after NGF treatment. Moreover, ENDF1 strongly enhanced the total neurite length and the complexity of neurites extending from neurons challenged with axon growth inhibitors. Importantly, although the impact of NGF and ENDF1 on the regeneration of neurons was similar, the regenerative activity of ENDF1 was not compromised by an inhibitor of the NGF receptor TrkA (GW441756), indicating that ENDF1 and NGF act through different signaling pathways.

Here, we describe a cost-effective setup for targeted photoconversion of fluorescent signals into electron dense ones. This approach has offered invaluable insights in the morphology and function of fine neuronal structures. The technique relies on the localised oxidation of diaminobenzidine (DAB) mediated by excited fluorophores. This paper includes a detailed description of how to build a simple photoconversion setup that can increase reliability and throughput of this well-established technique. The system described here, is particularly well-suited for thick neuronal tissue, where light penetration and oxygen diffusion may be limiting DAB oxidation. To demonstrate the system, we use Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM) to visualise functionally-labelled individual synaptic vesicles released onto an identified layer 5 neuron in an acute cortical slice. The setup significantly simplifies the photoconversion workflow, increasing the depth of photoillumination, improving the targeting of the region of interest and reducing the time required to process each individual samples. We have tested this setup extensively for the photoconversion of FM 1-43FXand Lucifer Yellowboth excited at 473nm. In principle, the system can be adapted to any dye or nanoparticle able to oxidize DAB when excited by a specific light wavelength.

Background: To study the extent that neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) influence the cognitive and functional decline in frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
Methods: We assessed the progression of NPS and their influence on cognitive and functional progression in a group of FTD [n=36] and AD patients [n=47] at two different stages of the disease (2.5 years). A standardized scale was used to assess NPS - Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer’s Disease (CUSPAD), which tracks different symptoms including depression, psychotic symptoms, as well as sleep, and conduct problems. In addition, in a subsample of patients (AD n=14 and FTD n= 14), we analyzed another group of NPS by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Cognitive declines were tracked by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE); and functionality was tracked by using the Lawton scale and the Barthel Index. 
Results: The presence of NPS impacts cognitive and functional decline in both groups of patients 2.5 years after disease onset. However, we observed a dissociable profile of the affectation of NPS in each group. In the AD group, results indicate that the progression of depressive symptoms and sleep problems predict cognitive and functional decline. In contrast, the progression of a mixed group of NPS including conduct problems and delusions predict cognitive and functional decline in FTD. 
Conclusion: The presence of NPS have a critical impact on the prediction of cognitive decline in FTD and AD patients after 2.5 years of disease progression. Our results demonstrate the importance of assessing different types of NPS in neurodegenerative disorders which in turn, predict disease progression.  Future studies should assess the role of NPS in predicting different neurocognitive pathways and in neurodegeneration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47177">Characterizing functional pathways of the human olfactory system</a></h4>

The central processing pathways of the human olfactory system are not fully understood. The olfactory bulb projects directly to a number of cortical brain structures, but the distinct networks formed by projections from each of these structures to the rest of the brain have not been well-defined. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and k-means clustering to parcellate human primary olfactory cortex into clusters based on whole-brain functional connectivity patterns. Resulting clusters accurately corresponded to anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, and frontal and temporal piriform cortices, suggesting dissociable whole-brain networks formed by the subregions of primary olfactory cortex. This result was replicated in an independent data set. We then characterized the unique functional connectivity profiles of each subregion, producing a map of the large-scale processing pathways of the human olfactory system. These results provide insight into the functional and anatomical organization of the human olfactory system.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Maternal depression is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment in offspring. This study examined relationships among postnatal maternal depressive symptoms, the functional reward network and behavioral problems in 4.5-year-old boys (57) and girls (65). We employed canonical correlation analysis to evaluate whether the resting-state functional connectivity within a reward network, identified through an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of fMRI studies, was associated with postnatal maternal depressive symptoms and child behaviors. The functional reward network consisted of three subnetworks, that is, the mesolimbic, mesocortical, and amygdala–hippocampus reward subnetworks. Postnatal maternal depressive symptoms were associated with the functional connectivity of the mesocortical subnetwork with the mesolimbic and amygdala–hippocampus complex subnetworks in girls and with the functional connectivity within the mesocortical subnetwork in boys. The functional connectivity of the amygdala–hippocampus subnetwork with the mesocortical and mesolimbic subnetworks was associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems in girls, while in boys, the functional connectivity of the mesocortical subnetwork with the amygdala–hippocampus complex and the mesolimbic subnetworks was associated with the internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively. Our findings suggest that the functional reward network might be a promising neural phenotype for effects of maternal depression and potential intervention to nurture child behavioral development.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Seeing familiar faces prompts the recall of diverse kinds of person-related knowledge. How this information is encoded within the well-characterized face-/person-selective network remains an outstanding question. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, participants rated famous faces in 10 tasks covering 5 domains of person knowledge (social, episodic, semantic, physical, and nominal). Comparing different cognitive domains enabled us to 1) test the relative roles of brain regions in specific cognitive processes and 2) apply a multivariate network-level representational similarity analysis (NetRSA) to gain insight into underlying system-level organization. Comparing across cognitive domains revealed the importance of multiple domains in most regions, the importance of social over nominal knowledge in the anterior temporal lobe, and the functional subdivision of the temporoparietal junction into perceptual superior temporal sulcus and knowledge-related angular gyrus. NetRSA revealed a strong divide between regions implicated in ``default-mode” cognition and the fronto-lateral elements that coordinated more with ``core” perceptual components (fusiform/occipital face areas and posterior superior temporal sulcus). NetRSA also revealed a taxonomy of cognitive processes, with semantic retrieval being more similar to episodic than nominal knowledge. Collectively, these results illustrate the importance of coordinated activity of the person knowledge network in the instantiation of the diverse cognitive capacities of this system.</span>

The physiological functions of astrocytes within neural circuits remain incompletely understood. There has been progress in this regard from recent work on striatal astrocytes, where detailed studies are emerging. In this review, findings on striatal astrocyte identity, form, and function, are summarized with a focus on how astrocytes regulate striatal neurons, circuits, and behavior. Specific features of striatal astrocytes are highlighted to illustrate how they may be specialized to regulate medium spiny neurons (MSNs) by responding to, and altering, excitation and inhibition.

<p>by Paul A. Roberts, Ryan M. Huebinger, Emma Keen, Anne-Marie Krachler, Sara Jabbari</p>

As antimicrobial resistance increases, it is crucial to develop new treatment strategies to counter the emerging threat. In this paper, we consider combination therapies involving conventional antibiotics and debridement, coupled with a novel anti-adhesion therapy, and their use in the treatment of antimicrobial resistant burn wound infections. Our models predict that anti-adhesion–antibiotic–debridement combination therapies can eliminate a bacterial infection in cases where each treatment in isolation would fail. Antibiotics are assumed to have a bactericidal mode of action, killing bacteria, while debridement involves physically cleaning a wound (e.g. with a cloth); removing free bacteria. Anti-adhesion therapy can take a number of forms. Here we consider adhesion inhibitors consisting of polystyrene microbeads chemically coupled to a protein known as multivalent adhesion molecule 7, an adhesin which mediates the initial stages of attachment of many bacterial species to host cells. Adhesion inhibitors competitively inhibit bacteria from binding to host cells, thus rendering them susceptible to removal through debridement. An ordinary differential equation model is developed and the antibiotic-related parameters are fitted against new <i>in vitro</i> data gathered for the present study. The model is used to predict treatment outcomes and to suggest optimal treatment strategies. Our model predicts that anti-adhesion and antibiotic therapies will combine synergistically, producing a combined effect which is often greater than the sum of their individual effects, and that anti-adhesion–antibiotic–debridement combination therapy will be more effective than any of the treatment strategies used in isolation. Further, the use of inhibitors significantly reduces the minimum dose of antibiotics required to eliminate an infection, reducing the chances that bacteria will develop increased resistance. Lastly, we use our model to suggest treatment regimens capable of eliminating bacterial infections within clinically relevant timescales.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SQI4Hedh_e8" width="1" />

<p>by Enrico Seiler, Kathrin Trappe, Bernhard Y. Renard</p>

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has changed the way we regard evolution. Instead of waiting for the next generation to establish new traits, especially bacteria are able to take a shortcut via HGT that enables them to pass on genes from one individual to another, even across species boundaries. The tool Daisy offers the first HGT detection approach based on read mapping that provides complementary evidence compared to existing methods. However, Daisy relies on the acceptor and donor organism involved in the HGT being known. We introduce DaisyGPS, a mapping-based pipeline that is able to identify acceptor and donor reference candidates of an HGT event based on sequencing reads. Acceptor and donor identification is akin to species identification in metagenomic samples based on sequencing reads, a problem addressed by metagenomic profiling tools. However, acceptor and donor references have certain properties such that these methods cannot be directly applied. DaisyGPS uses MicrobeGPS, a metagenomic profiling tool tailored towards estimating the genomic distance between organisms in the sample and the reference database. We enhance the underlying scoring system of MicrobeGPS to account for the sequence patterns in terms of mapping coverage of an acceptor and donor involved in an HGT event, and report a ranked list of reference candidates. These candidates can then be further evaluated by tools like Daisy to establish HGT regions. We successfully validated our approach on both simulated and real data, and show its benefits in an investigation of an outbreak involving Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/efbsFNCMjHE" width="1" />

<p>by Madhura R. Joglekar, Logan Chariker, Robert Shapley, Lai-Sang Young</p>

Neuroscience models come in a wide range of scales and specificity, from mean-field rate models to large-scale networks of spiking neurons. There are potential trade-offs between simplicity and realism, versatility and computational speed. This paper is about large-scale cortical network models, and the question we address is one of scalability: would scaling down cell density impact a network’s ability to reproduce cortical dynamics and function? We investigated this problem using a previously constructed realistic model of the monkey visual cortex that is true to size. Reducing cell density gradually up to 50-fold, we studied changes in model behavior. Size reduction without parameter adjustment was catastrophic. Surprisingly, relatively minor compensation in synaptic weights guided by a theoretical algorithm restored mean firing rates and basic function such as orientation selectivity to models 10-20 times smaller than the real cortex. Not all was normal in the reduced model cortices: intracellular dynamics acquired a character different from that of real neurons, and while the ability to relay feedforward inputs remained intact, reduced models showed signs of deficiency in functions that required dynamical interaction among cortical neurons. These findings are not confined to models of the visual cortex, and modelers should be aware of potential issues that accompany size reduction. Broader implications of this study include the importance of homeostatic maintenance of firing rates, and the functional consequences of feedforward versus recurrent dynamics, ideas that may shed light on other species and on systems suffering cell loss.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pIYdVbiLCUQ" width="1" />

<p>by Bhavin S. Khatri, Richard A. Goldstein</p>

Developmental system drift is a likely mechanism for the origin of hybrid incompatibilities between closely related species. We examine here the detailed mechanistic basis of hybrid incompatibilities between two allopatric lineages, for a genotype-phenotype map of developmental system drift under stabilising selection, where an organismal phenotype is conserved, but the underlying molecular phenotypes and genotype can drift. This leads to number of emergent phenomenon not obtainable by modelling genotype or phenotype alone. Our results show that: 1) speciation is more rapid at smaller population sizes with a characteristic, Orr-like, power law, but at large population sizes slow, characterised by a sub-diffusive growth law; 2) the molecular phenotypes under weakest selection contribute to the earliest incompatibilities; and 3) pair-wise incompatibilities dominate over higher order, contrary to previous predictions that the latter should dominate. The population size effect we find is consistent with previous results on allopatric divergence of transcription factor-DNA binding, where smaller populations have common ancestors with a larger drift load because genetic drift favours phenotypes which have a larger number of genotypes (higher sequence entropy) over more fit phenotypes which have far fewer genotypes; this means less substitutions are required in either lineage before incompatibilities arise. Overall, our results indicate that biophysics and population size provide a much stronger constraint to speciation than suggested by previous models, and point to a general mechanistic principle of how incompatibilities arise the under stabilising selection for an organismal phenotype.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LCizs-nbjwE" width="1" />

<p>Critical brain hypothesis has been intensively studied both in experimental
and theoretical neuroscience over the past two decades. However, some important
questions still remain: (i) What is the critical point the brain operates at?
(ii) What is the regulatory mechanism that brings about and maintains such a
critical state? (iii) The critical state is characterized by scale-invariant
behavior which is seemingly at odds with definitive brain oscillations? In this
work we consider a biologically motivated model of Izhikevich neuronal network
with chemical synapses interacting via spike-timingdependent plasticity (STDP)
as well as axonal time delay. Under generic and physiologically relevant
conditions we show that the system is organized and maintained around a
synchronization transition point as opposed to an activity transition point
associated with an absorbing state phase transition. However, such a state
exhibits experimentally relevant signs of critical dynamics including
scale-free avalanches with finite-size scaling as well as branching ratios.
While the system displays stochastic oscillations with highly correlated
fluctuations, it also displays dominant frequency modes seen as sharp peaks in
the power spectrum. The role of STDP as well as time delay is crucial in
achieving and maintaining such critical dynamics, while the role of inhibition
is not as crucial. In this way we provide definitive answers to all three
questions posed above. We also show that one can achieve supercritical or
subcritical dynamics if one changes the average time delay associated with
axonal conduction.

<p>During the last two decades, various models have been proposed for fish
collective motion. These models are mainly developed to decipher the biological
mechanisms of social interaction between animals. They consider very simple
homogeneous unbounded environments and it is not clear that they can simulate
accurately the collective trajectories. Moreover when the models are more
accurate, the question of their scalability to either larger groups or more
elaborate environments remains open. This study deals with learning how to
simulate realistic collective motion of collective of zebrafish, using
real-world tracking data. The objective is to devise an agent-based model that
can be implemented on an artificial robotic fish that can blend into a
collective of real fish. We present a novel approach that uses Quality
Diversity algorithms, a class of algorithms that emphasise exploration over
pure optimisation. In particular, we use CVT-MAP-Elites, a variant of the
state-of-the-art MAP-Elites algorithm for high dimensional search space.
Results show that Quality Diversity algorithms not only outperform classic
evolutionary reinforcement learning methods at the macroscopic level (i.e.
group behaviour), but are also able to generate more realistic biomimetic
behaviours at the microscopic level (i.e. individual behaviour).

<p>Deep neural network (DNN) models for computer vision are now capable of
human-level object recognition. Consequently, similarities in the performance
and vulnerabilities of DNN and human vision are of great interest. Here we
characterize the response of the VGG-19 DNN to images of the Scintillating Grid
visual illusion, in which white dots are perceived to be partially black. We
observed a significant deviation from the expected monotonic relation between
VGG-19 representational dissimilarity and dot whiteness in the Scintillating
Grid. That is, a linear increase in dot whiteness leads to a non-linear
increase and then, remarkably, a decrease (non-monotonicity) in
representational dissimilarity. In control images, mostly monotonic relations
between representational dissimilarity and dot whiteness were observed.
Furthermore, the dot whiteness level corresponding to the maximal
representational dissimilarity (i.e. onset of non-monotonic dissimilarity)
matched closely with that corresponding to the onset of illusion perception in
human observers. As such, the non-monotonic response in the DNN is a potential
model correlate for human illusion perception.

Cortical synapse organization supports a range of dynamic states on multiple spatial and temporal scales, from synchronous slow wave activity (SWA), characteristic of deep sleep or anesthesia, to fluctuating, asynchronous activity during wakefulness (AW). Such dynamic diversity poses a challenge for producing efficient large-scale simulations that embody realistic metaphors of short- and long-range synaptic connectivity. In fact, during SWA and AW different spatial extents of the cortical tissue are active in a given timespan and at different levels, which implies a wide variety of loads of local computation and communication. A balanced evaluation of simulation performance and robustness should therefore include tests of a variety of cortical dynamic states. Here, we demonstrate performance scaling of our proprietary Distributed and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation engine in both SWA and AW for bi-dimensional grids of neural populations, which reflects the modular organization of the cortex. We explored networks up to 192x192 modules, each composed of 1250 integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency adaptation, and exponentially decaying inter-modular synaptic connectivity with varying spatial decay constant. For the largest networks the total number of synapses was over 70 billion. The execution platform included up to 64 dual-socket nodes, each socket mounting 8 Intel Xeon Haswell processor cores @ 2.40GHz clock. Network initialization time, memory usage, and execution times showed good scaling performances from 1 to 1024 processes, implemented using the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. We achieved simulation speeds of between 2.3x10^9 and 4.1x10^9 synaptic events per second for both cortical states in the explored range of inter-modular interconnections.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00173">Developmental Regulation of KCC2 Phosphorylation Has Long-Term Impacts on Cognitive Function</a></h4>

GABAA receptor-mediated currents shift from excitatory to inhibitory during postnatal brain development in rodents. A postnatal increase in KCC2 protein expression is considered to be the sole mechanism controlling the developmental onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic transmission, but here we identify a key role for KCC2 phosphorylation in the developmental EGABA shift. Preventing phosphorylation of KCC2 in vivo at either residue serine 940 (S940), or at residues threonine 906 and threonine 1007 (T906/T1007), delayed or accelerated the postnatal onset of KCC2 function, respectively. Several models of neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett syndrome, Fragile X and Down’s syndrome exhibit delayed postnatal onset of hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition, but whether the timing of the onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition during development plays a role in establishing adulthood cognitive function is unknown; we have used the distinct KCC2-S940A and KCC2-T906A/T1007A knock-in mouse models to address this issue. Altering KCC2 function resulted in long-term abnormalities in social behavior and memory retention. Tight regulation of KCC2 phosphorylation is therefore required for the typical timing of the developmental onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition, and it plays a fundamental role in the regulation of adulthood cognitive function.

Visual perception is most often studied as a “passive” process in which an observer fixates steadily at point in space so that stimuli can be delivered to the system with spatial precision. Analysis of neuronal signals related to vision is generally keyed to stimulus onset, stimulus movement, etc.; i.e., events external to the observer. In natural “active” vision however, information is systematically acquired by using eye movements including rapid (saccadic) eye movements, as well as smooth ocular pursuit of moving objects and slower drifts. Here we consider the use of alternating saccades and fixations to gather information from a visual scene. In this Perspective we note that active saccadic sampling behavior imposes robust temporal patterning on the activity of neuron ensembles and large-scale neural dynamics throughout the brain’s visual pathways whose mechanistic effects on information processing are not yet fully understood. The spatio-temporal sequence of eye movements elicits a succession of temporally predictable quasi-rhythmic sensory inputs, whose encoding is enhanced by entrainment of low frequency oscillations to the rate of eye movements. Review of the pertinent findings underscores the fact that temporal coordination between motor and visual cortices is critical for understanding neural dynamics of active vision and posits that phase entrainment of neuronal oscillations plays a mechanistic role in this process.

Tissue perfusion is a necessary condition for vessel survival that can be compromised under ischemic conditions. Following stroke, delayed effects of early brain reperfusion on the vascular substrate necessary for remodelling, perfusion and maintenance of proper peri-lesional hemodynamics are unknown. Such aspects of ischemic injury progression may be critical for neurological recovery in stroke patients. This study aims to describe the impact of early, non-thrombolytic reperfusion on the vascular brain component and its potential contribution to tissue remodelling and long-term functional recovery beyond the acute phase after stroke in 3-month-old male C57bl/6 mice.  Permanent (pMCAO) and transient (60 min, tMCAO) brain ischemia mouse models were used for characterizing the effect of early, non-thrombolytic reperfusion on the brain vasculature. Analysis of different vascular parameters (vessel density, proliferation, degeneration and perfusion) revealed that, while early middle cerebral artery recanalisation was not sufficient to prevent sub-acute vascular degeneration within the ischemic brain regions, brain reperfusion promoted a secondary wave of vascular remodelling in the peri-lesional regions, which led to improved perfusion of the ischemic boundaries and late-phase neurological recovery.  This study concluded that acute, non-thrombolytic artery recanalisation following stroke favours late-phase vascular remodelling and improves peri-lesional perfusion, contributing to secondary functional recovery.

Paraffin embedding is widely used in microscopic imaging for preparing biological specimens. However, owing to significant fluorescence quenching during the embedding process, it is not compatible with fluorescent-labeling techniques, such as transgenic and viral labeling using green fluorescent protein (GFP). Here we investigated the quenching mechanism and optimized the embedding process to improve the preservation of fluorescence intensity. The results showed that dehydration is the main reason of fluorescence quenching during paraffin embedding, caused by full denaturation of GFP molecules in ethyl alcohol. To evaluate fluorescent and morphological preservation, we modified the embedding process using tertiary butanol (TBA) instead of ethyl alcohol. Fluorescence intensity following TBA dehydration increased 12.08-fold of that observed in the traditional method. We obtained uniform fluorescence maintenance throughout the whole mouse brain, while the continuous apical dendrites, spines, and axon terminals were shown evenly within the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Moreover, we embedded a whole rat brain labeled with AAV in the prelimbic cortex (Prl). With the axon terminals in different areas, such as the caudate putamen, thalamus, and pyramidal tract, the results showed a continuous tract of Prl neurons throughout the whole brain. Meanwhile, this method was suitable to tdTomota labeled samples. These findings indicated this modified embedding method could be compatible with GFP and provides a potential turning point for applications in the fluorescent labeling of samples.

Objective: To investigate the potential regional homogeneity (ReHo) brain activity changes in patients with corneal ulcer (CU) and their possible relationship with clinical symptoms. 
Materials and methods: 40 patients with CU (26 men and 14 women), and 40 healthy controls (HCs) (26 men and 14 women) closely matched in age, sex and weight underwent resting-state functional MRI scans respectively. The ReHo method was applied to evaluate synchronous neural activity changes. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to show high test-retest stability and high degree of sensitivity and specificity.. We utilized the correlation analysis to calculate the relationship between the average ReHo signal values in different brain areas and the clinical symptoms in CU patients.
Results: Compared with the HCs, CU patients had significantly increased ReHo values in right cerebellum posterior lobe, left cerebellum posterior lobe, left inferior temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, left angular gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, right angular gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus，and decreased ReHo values in right anterior cingulate and left precentral gyrus. ROC curve analysis of each brain regions showed the accuracy of AUC was perfect except the right cerebellum posterior lobe. Nevertheless, there was no clear evidence of prominent relevance between the average ReHo values in brain areas and the clinical symptoms. 
Conclusion: CU caused dysfunctional adaption in different brain areas, which including relatively increased values and decreased values. This finding may help us take a further step in exploring the underlying pathologic mechanisms of CU.

Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) is a common method for mapping functional brain networks. However, estimation of these networks is affected by the presence of a common global systemic noise, or global signal (GS). Previous studies have shown that the common preprocessing steps of removing the GS may create spurious correlations between brain regions. In this paper, we decompose fMRI signals into 5 spatial and 3 temporal intrinsic mode functions (SIMF and TIMF, respectively) by means of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is an adaptive data-driven method widely used to analyze non-linear and non-stationary phenomena. For each SIMF, functional connectivity matrices were computed by means of the Pearson correlation between TIMFs of different brain areas. Thus, instead of a single connectivity matrix, we obtained 5*3 = 15 functional connectivity matrices. Given the high correlation and global efficiency values of the connectivity matrices related to the low spatial maps (SIMF3, SIMF4, and SIMF5), our results suggest that these maps can be considered as spatial global signal masks. Thus, by summing up the first two SIMFs extracted from the fMRI signals, we have automatically excluded the GS  which is now voxel-specific. We compared the performance of our method with the conventional GS regression and to the results when the GS was not removed. While the correlation pattern identified by the other methods suffers from a low level of precision in identifying the correct brain network connectivity, our approach demonstrated expected connectivity patterns for the default mode network and task-positive network.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00735">Targeting the Synapse in Alzheimer’s Disease</a></h4>

Dynamic gain and loss of synapses is fundamental to healthy brain function. While Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) treatment strategies have largely focussed on beta-amyloid and tau protein pathologies, the synapse itself may also be a critical endpoint to consider regarding disease modification.  Disruption of mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, eventually resulting in a net loss of synapses, is implicated as an early pathological event in AD.  Synaptic dysfunction therefore may be a final common biological mechanism linking protein pathologies to disease symptoms.  This review summarises evidence supporting the idea of early neuroplastic deficits being prevalent in AD. Changes in synaptic density can occur before overt neurodegeneration and should not be considered to uniformly decrease over the course of the disease.  Instead, synaptic levels are influenced by an interplay between processes of degeneration and atrophy, and those of maintenance and compensation at regional and network levels.  How these neuroplastic changes are driven by amyloid and tau pathology are varied.  A mixture of direct effects of amyloid and tau on synaptic integrity, as well as indirect effects on processes such as inflammation and neuronal energetics are likely to be at play here.  Focussing on the synapse and mechanisms of neuroplasticity as therapeutic opportunities in AD raises some important conceptual and strategic issues regarding translational research, and how preclinical research can inform clinical studies.  Nevertheless, substrates of neuroplasticity represent an emerging complementary class of drug target that would aim to normalise synapse dynamics and restore cognitive function in the AD brain.

Simulations of electrical activity of networks of morphologically detailed neuron models allow for a better understanding of the brain. State-of-the-art simulations describe the dynamics of ionic currents and biochemical processes within branching topological representations of the neurons. Acceleration of such simulation is possible in the weak scaling limit by modelling neurons as indivisible computation units and increasing the computing power. Strong scaling and simulations close to biological time are difficult, yet required for the study of synaptic plasticity and other use cases requiring simulation of neurons for long periods of time. Current methods rely on parallel Gaussian elimination, computing triangulation and substitution of many branches simultaneously.
Existing limitations are: (a) high heterogeneity of compute time per neuron leads to high computational load imbalance; and (b) difficulty in providing a computation model that fully utilises the computing resources on distributed multi-core architectures with Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) capabilities.

To address these issues, we present a strategy that extracts flow-dependencies between parameters of the ODEs and the algebraic solver of individual neurons. Based on the resulting dependencies map, we provide three techniques for memory, communication, and computation reorganization that yield a load-balanced distributed asynchronous execution. The new computation model distributes datasets and balances computational workload across a distributed memory space, exposing a tree-based parallelism of neuron topological structure, an embarrassingly parallel execution model of neuron subtrees, and a SIMD acceleration of subtree state updates.

The capabilities of our methods are demonstrated on a prototype implementation developed on the core compute kernel of the NEURON scientific application, built on the HPX runtime system for the ParalleX execution model. Our implementation yields a fully-asynchronous  distributed and parallel simulation that accelerates single neuron to medium-sized neural networks. Benchmark results display better strong scaling properties, finer-grained parallelism, and lower time to solution compared to the state of the art, on a wide range of distributed multi-core compute architectures.

We propose event-related cortical sources estimation from subject-independent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings for motor imagery brain computer interface (BCI). By using wavelet-based maximum entropy on the mean (wMEM), task-specific EEG channels are selected to predict right hand and right foot sensorimotor tasks, employing spatial pattern analysis with and without covariance estimation regularization. EEG from five healthy individuals (Dataset IVa, BCI Competition III) were evaluated by a cross-subject paradigm. Prediction performance was evaluated via a two-layer feed-forward neural network, where the classifier was trained and tested by data from two subjects independently. The highest mean prediction accuracy achieved by using subject-pair (ay-al) specific selected EEG channels was on average (90:36+/-5:59) and outperformed that achieved by using all available channels (83:21+/-12:26). Significant improvements in performance suggest a role of wMEM for channel selection in BCI. Spatially projected cortical sources may be useful for capturing inter-subject associative sensorimotor brain dynamics and pave the way towards subject-independent BCI.

Professional pride is a positive emotion that includes self-reflection or evaluation and attitude toward one’s own occupational group. Uniforms can encourage the wearer to have professional pride. The current study aimed to elucidate the neural basis of professional pride using an experimental task related to the self in uniform and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The person-adjective matching task, in which a participant or other in uniform or casual wear was presented with positive and negative words, was used for scanning fMRI. Imaging data from 21 adults who had an occupation requiring a uniform were analyzed to identify the main and interaction effects of individual (self vs. other), clothes (uniform vs. casual wear), and valence (positive vs. negative). Identified brain activities were correlated with psychological scales including the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and Group Environment Questionnaire. Whole brain analyses found that the interaction between individual and clothes was present in multiple regions such as the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left middle and inferior temporal gyri, left posterior superior temporal sulcus, right temporoparietal junction, left lingual gyrus, left calcarine cortex, right insula, left caudate, and right putamen. In particular, activities in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, left calcarine cortex, and right putamen in the self/uniform condition were positively correlated with several psychological scales. These results suggest that professional pride may be represented through multiple brain networks related to empathy, reward, and emotion regulation as well as the theory-of-mind network. The neural basis of professional pride is closely related to positive self-evaluation and group cohesion.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00249">Evidence for the Rhythmic Perceptual Sampling of Auditory Scenes</a></h4>

Converging results suggest that perception is controlled by rhythmic processes in the brain. In the auditory domain, neuroimaging studies show that the perception of sounds is shaped by rhythmic activity prior to the stimulus, and electrophysiological recordings have linked delta and theta band activity to the functioning of individual neurons. These results have promoted theories of rhythmic modes of listening and generally suggest that the perceptually relevant encoding of acoustic information is structured by rhythmic processes along auditory pathways. A prediction from this perspective  ̶  which so far has not been tested  ̶  is that such rhythmic processes also shape how acoustic information is combined over time to judge extended soundscapes. The present study was designed to directly test this prediction. Human participants judged the overall change in perceived frequency content in temporally extended (1.2 to 1.8 s) soundscapes, while the perceptual use of the available sensory evidence was quantified using psychophysical reverse correlation. Model-based analysis of individual participant’s perceptual weights revealed a rich temporal structure, including linear trends, a U-shaped profile tied to the overall stimulus duration, and importantly, rhythmic components at the time scale of 1 to 2Hz. The collective evidence found here across four versions of the experiment supports the notion that rhythmic processes operating on the delta time scale structure how perception samples temporally extended acoustic scenes.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00049">The Energy Homeostasis Principle: Neuronal Energy Regulation Drives Local Network Dynamics Generating Behavior</a></h4>

Understanding how neurons arrange themselves into neural networks that result in behaviors is a major goal in neuroscience. Most theoretical and experimental efforts have focused on a top-down approach which seeks to identify neuronal correlates of behaviors. This has been accomplished by effectively mapping specific behaviors to distinct neural patterns or by creating computational models that produce a desired behavioral outcome. Nonetheless, these approaches, have only implicitly considered the fact that neural tissue, like any other physical system, is subjected to several restrictions and boundaries of operations. 
	Here, we proposed a new, bottom-up conceptual paradigm: The Energy Homeostasis Principle, where the balance between energy income, expenditure, and availability are the key parameters in determining the dynamics of neuronal phenomena found from molecular to behavioral levels. Neurons display high energy consumption relative to other cells, with metabolic consumption of the brain representing 20% of the whole-body oxygen uptake, which contrasts with this organ representing only 2% of the body weight. Also, neurons have specialized surrounding tissue that provides the necessary energy which in the case of the central nervous system, is provided by astrocytes. Moreover, and unlike other cell types with high energy demands such as muscle cells, neurons have a strict aerobic metabolism. These facts indicate that neurons are highly sensitive to energy limitations with Gibb’s free energy dictating the direction of all cellular metabolic processes. From this activity, the largest energy is by far, expended by action potentials and post-synaptic potentials, therefore, plasticity can be reinterpreted on their energy context. Consequently, neurons, through their synapses, would impose energy demands over post-synaptic neurons in a close loop-manner, modulating the dynamics of local circuits. Therefrom, energy dynamics end up impacting the homeostatic mechanisms of neuronal networks. Furthermore, local energy management emerges also as a neural population property, where most of the energy expenses are triggered by sensory or other modulatory input. Local energy management in neurons may be sufficient to explain the emergence of behavior, enabling the assessment of which and how properties arise in neural circuits. Importantly, the Energy Homeostasis Principle proposal is also readily testable in simple neuronal networks.

Background: The brain is protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), constituted by endothelial cells supported by pericytes and astrocytes. In Alzheimer’s Disease a dysregulation of the BBB occurs since the early phases of the disease leading to an increased access of solutes and immune cells that can participate to the central inflammatory response. Here we investigated whether astrocytes may influence endothelial-leukocytes interaction in the presence of amyloid-β (Aβ). Methods: We used an in vitro BBB model, where endothelial cells, cultured alone or with astrocytes were exposed for 5 h to Aβ, both under resting or inflammatory conditions (TNFα and IFNγ), to evaluate endothelial barrier properties, as well as transendothelial migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: In the co-culture model, barrier permeability to solutes was increased by all treatments, but migration was only observed in inflammatory conditions and was prevented by Aβ treatment. On the contrary, in endothelial monocultures, Aβ induced leukocytes migration under resting conditions and did not modify that induced by inflammatory cytokines. In endothelial astrocyte co-cultures, a low molecular weight isoform of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, important to allow interaction with PBMCs, was increased after 5 h exposure to inflammatory cytokines, an effect that was prevented by Aβ. This modulation by Aβ was not observed in endothelial monocultures. In addition, endothelial expression of β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (Gnt-III), responsible for the formation of the low molecular weight ICAM-1 isoform, was enhanced in inflammatory conditions, but negatively modulated by Aβ only in the co-culture model. miR-200b, increased in astrocytes following Aβ treatment and may represent one of the factors involved in the control of Gnt-III expression. Conclusions: These data point out that, at least in the early phases of Aβ exposure, astrocytes play a role in the modulation of leucocytes migration through the endothelial layer.

It is now widely accepted that glia cells and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABA) interneurons dynamically regulate synaptic transmission and neuronal activity in time and space. This paper presents a biophysical model that captures the interaction between an astrocyte cell, a GABA interneuron and pre/postsynaptic neurons. Specifically, GABA released from a GABA interneuron triggers in astrocytes the release of calcium (Ca^(2+)) from the endoplasmic reticulum via the inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP_3) pathway. This results in gliotransmission which elevates the presynaptic transmission probability rate (PR) causing weight potentiation and a gradual increase in postsynaptic neuronal firing, which eventually stabilises. However, by capturing the complex interactions between IP_3, generated from both GABA and the 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) pathway, and PR, this paper shows that this interaction not only gives rise to an initial weight potentiation phase but also this phase is followed by postsynaptic bursting behaviour. Moreover, the model will show that there is a presynaptic frequency range over which burst firing can occur. The proposed model offers a novel cellular level mechanism that may underpin both seizure-like activity and neuronal synchrony across different brain regions.

Primary cultures of glial and endothelial cells are important tools for basic and translational neuroscience research. Primary cell cultures are usually generated from rodent brain although considerable differences exist between human and rodent glia and endothelial cells. Because many translational research projects aim to identify mechanisms that eventually lead to diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to target human diseases, glia, and endothelial cultures are needed that better reflect the human central nervous system (CNS). Pig brain is easily accessible and, in many aspects, close to the human brain. We established an easy and cost-effective method to isolate and culture different primary glial and endothelial cells from adult pig brain. Oligodendrocyte, microglia, astrocyte and endothelial primary cell cultures were generated from the same brain tissue and grown for up to 8 weeks. Primary cells showed lineage-specific morphology and expressed specific markers with a purity ranging from 60 to 95%. Cultured oligodendrocytes myelinated neurons and microglia secreted tumor necrosis factor alpha when induced with lipopolysaccharide. Endothelial cells showed typical tube formation when grown on Matrigel. Astrocytes enhanced survival of co-cultured neurons and were killed by Aquaporin-4 antibody positive sera from patients with Neuromyelitis optica. In summary, we established a new method for primary oligodendrocyte, microglia, endothelial and astrocyte cell cultures from pig brain that provide a tool for translational research on human CNS diseases.

Sensorimotor gating refers to the ability to filter incoming sensory information in a stimulus-laden environment and disruption of this physiological process has been documented in psychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive aberrations. Lack of efficacious medications to treat sensorimotor gating perturbations signifies the need to elucidate molecular mechanisms for therapeutic intervention. Notably, we recently reported a role for purinergic P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs) in regulation of sensorimotor gating using prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle reflex. P2X4Rs are ion channels gated by adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP).  Ivermectin (IVM) induced PPI deficits in C57BL/6J mice in a P2X4R-specific manner. Furthermore, mice deficient in P2X4Rs [P2X4R knockout (KO)] exhibited PPI deficits that were alleviated by dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists demonstrating an interaction between P2X4Rs and DA receptors in PPI regulation. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that increased DA neurotransmission underlies IVM-mediated PPI deficits. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of D1 and D2 receptor antagonists, SCH 23390 and raclopride respectively and D1 agonist, SKF 82958 on IVM-mediated PPI deficits. To gain mechanistic insights, we investigated the interaction between IVM and dopaminergic drugs on signaling molecules linked to PPI regulation in the ventral striatum. SCH 23390 significantly attenuated the PPI disruptive effects of IVM to a much greater degree than that of raclopride. SKF 82958 failed to potentiate IVM-mediated PPI disruption. At the molecular level, modulation of D1 receptors altered IVM’s effects on dopamine and cyclic-AMP regulated phosphoprotein of 32kDa (DARPP-32) phosphorylation. IVM interacted with the DA receptors antagonists in regulation Ca2+/calmodulin kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) phosphorylation, but not its downstream target, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Current findings suggest an involvement for D1 and D2 receptors in IVM-mediated PPI disruption via modulation of DARPP-32. Taken together, the findings suggest that stimulation of P2X4Rs can lead to DA hyperactivity and disruption of information processing, implicating P2X4Rs as a novel drug target for treatment of psychiatric disorders characterized by sensorimotor gating deficits.

Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant intracellular antioxidant. GSH depletion leads to oxidative stress and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). In mice, the acute systemic inhibition of GSH synthesis by L-buthionine-S-R-sulfoximine (BSO) triggers a protective response and a subsequent increase in the CNS GSH content. This response might be modulated by a peripheral increment of circulating nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is an important activator of antioxidant pathways mediated by tropomyosin-related kinase receptor A (TrkA). Here, we report that peripheral administration of BSO increased plasma NGF levels. Additionally, BSO increased NGF levels and activated the NGF/TrkA/Akt pathway in striatal neurons. Moreover, the response in the striatum included an increased transcription of nrf2, gclm, lat1, eaac1, and xct, all of which are involved in antioxidant responses, and L-cys/L-cys2 and glutamate transporters. Using antibody against NGF confirmed that peripheral NGF activated the NGF/TrkA/Akt/Nrf2 pathway in the striatum and subsequently increased the transcription of gclm, nrf2, lat1, eaac1, and xct. These results provide evidence that the reduction of peripheral GSH pools increases peripheral NGF circulation that orchestrates a neuroprotective response in the CNS, at least in the striatum, through the NGF/TrkA/Akt/Nrf2 pathway

Background: The modality effect plays the central role in learning and memory functions. Retrieval failure constitutes a common memory impairment that occurs among patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, little knowledge exists about the relation between modality effect and delayed recall impairment in PD. The primary goal of this study was to compare delayed free recall performance between three different memory modalities (verbal, visual, and cross visual-verbal) in a sample of non-demented patients with mild PD progression. The secondary goal was to explore the frequency of deficient performance on the basis of normative comparisons on each of the three delayed free-recall measures. Method: A total of 71 non-demented patients with mild Parkinson’s disease progression were recruited for the administration of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT), and the Greek Version of Face-Name Associative Memory Examination (GR-FNAME12). Results: The percentages of deficient-performances for the three delayed free recall measures were 45.1% (32/71), 39.4% (28/71) and 31% (22/71) for the GR-FNAME12, ROFCT and RAVLT, respectively. The results indicated no significant difference between performances of the GR-FNAME12 and ROCFT, both of which were significantly lower than performance on the RAVLT. Conclusions: In conclusion, delayed free recall appears to be more severely affected in the cross visual-verbal and visual memory modalities than in verbal-memory modalities in the early phase of PD progression.

These days the important role of retinoids in adult brain functionality and homeostasis is well accepted and has been proven by genomic as well as non-genomic mechanisms. In the healthy brain, numerous biological processes e.g. cell proliferation, neurogenesis, dendritic spine formation as well as modulation of the immune system have been attributed to retinoid signaling.  This, together with the finding that retinoid metabolism is impaired in Alzheimer’s disease, led to preclinical and early clinical testing of natural and synthetic retinoids as innovative pharmaceuticals with multifactorial properties. Acitretin, an aromatic retinoid, was found to exert anti-amyloidogenic effect in mouse models for Alzheimer’s disease as well as in human patients by stimulating the alpha-secretase ADAM10. The lipophilic drug was already demonstrated to easily pass the blood brain barrier after i.p. administration and increased nest building capability in the 5xFAD mouse model. Additionally, we analyzed the immune-modulatory capacity of acitretin via a  multiplex array in the 5xFAD mouse model and evaluated some of our findings in human CSF derived from a pilot study  using acitretin. Although several serum analytes did not display changes, IL-6 was found to be significantly increased in both - mouse and human neural material. This demonstrates that acitretin exerts an immune stimulatory effect – besides the alpha-secretase induction – which could impact the alleviation of learning and memory disabilities observed in the mouse model.

Although the neural mechanism supporting episodic recollection has been well characterized in younger adults, exactly how recollection is supported in older adults remains unclear. The electrophysiological correlate of recollection – the parietal retrieval success effect – for example, has been shown to be sensitive to both the amount of information recollected and the accuracy of remembered information in younger adults. To date, there is mixed evidence that parietal effect also scales with the amount of information remembered in older adults whilst there is little evidence that the same mechanism is sensitive to the accuracy of recollected information. Here, we address one potential concern when investigating Event Related Potentials (ERPs) among older adults – namely, the greater potential for single trial latency variability to smear and reduces the amplitudes of averaged ERPs. We apply a well-established algorithm for correcting single trial latency variability, Residual Iteration Decomposition Analysis (RIDE), to investigate whether the parietal retrieval success effect among older adults is sensitive to retrieval accuracy. Our results reveal that, similar to younger adults, older adult parietal retrieval success effects scale with the accuracy of recollected information – i.e., is greater in magnitude when recollected information is of high accuracy, reduced in magnitude when accuracy is low, and entirely absent when guessing. The results help clarify the functional significance of the neural mechanism supporting recollection in older adults whilst also highlighting the potential issues with interpreting average ERPs in older adult populations.

<p>by Christopher J. Bates, Ilker Yildirim, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Peter Battaglia</p>

Humans can easily describe, imagine, and, crucially, <i>predict</i> a wide variety of behaviors of liquids—splashing, squirting, gushing, sloshing, soaking, dripping, draining, trickling, pooling, and pouring—despite tremendous variability in their material and dynamical properties. Here we propose and test a computational model of how people perceive and predict these liquid dynamics, based on coarse approximate simulations of fluids as collections of interacting particles. Our model is analogous to a “game engine in the head”, drawing on techniques for interactive simulations (as in video games) that optimize for efficiency and natural appearance rather than physical accuracy. In two behavioral experiments, we found that the model accurately captured people’s predictions about how liquids flow among complex solid obstacles, and was significantly better than two alternatives based on simple heuristics and deep neural networks. Our model was also able to explain how people’s predictions varied as a function of the liquids’ properties (e.g., viscosity and stickiness). Together, the model and empirical results extend the recent proposal that human physical scene understanding for the dynamics of rigid, solid objects can be supported by approximate probabilistic simulation, to the more complex and unexplored domain of fluid dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HdFwenUGB3I" width="1" />

<p>by Xing Chen, Chi-Chi Zhu, Jun Yin</p>

In recent years, increasing associations between microRNAs (miRNAs) and human diseases have been identified. Based on accumulating biological data, many computational models for potential miRNA-disease associations inference have been developed, which saves time and expenditure on experimental studies, making great contributions to researching molecular mechanism of human diseases and developing new drugs for disease treatment. In this paper, we proposed a novel computational method named Ensemble of Decision Tree based MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (EDTMDA), which innovatively built a computational framework integrating ensemble learning and dimensionality reduction. For each miRNA-disease pair, the feature vector was extracted by calculating the statistical measures, graph theoretical measures, and matrix factorization results for the miRNA and disease, respectively. Then multiple base learnings were built to yield many decision trees (DTs) based on random selection of negative samples and miRNA/disease features. Particularly, Principal Components Analysis was applied to each base learning to reduce feature dimensionality and hence remove the noise or redundancy. Average strategy was adopted for these DTs to get final association scores between miRNAs and diseases. In model performance evaluation, EDTMDA showed AUC of 0.9309 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and AUC of 0.8524 in local LOOCV. Additionally, AUC of 0.9192+/-0.0009 in 5-fold cross validation proved the model’s reliability and stability. Furthermore, three types of case studies for four human diseases were implemented. As a result, 94% (Esophageal Neoplasms), 86% (Kidney Neoplasms), 96% (Breast Neoplasms) and 88% (Carcinoma Hepatocellular) of top 50 predicted miRNAs were confirmed by experimental evidences in literature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NTml9lcjzb8" width="1" />

<p>by Walter Basile, Marco Salvatore, Claudio Bassot, Arne Elofsson</p>

Intrinsic disorder is more abundant in eukaryotic than prokaryotic proteins. Methods predicting intrinsic disorder are based on the amino acid sequence of a protein. Therefore, there must exist an underlying difference in the sequences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins causing the (predicted) difference in intrinsic disorder. By comparing proteins, from complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteomes, we show that the difference in intrinsic disorder emerges from the linker regions connecting Pfam domains. Eukaryotic proteins have more extended linker regions, and in addition, the eukaryotic linkers are significantly more disordered, 38% vs. 12-16% disordered residues. Next, we examined the underlying reason for the increase in disorder in eukaryotic linkers, and we found that the changes in abundance of only three amino acids cause the increase. Eukaryotic proteins contain 8.6% serine; while prokaryotic proteins have 6.5%, eukaryotic proteins also contain 5.4% proline and 5.3% isoleucine compared with 4.0% proline and ≈ 7.5% isoleucine in the prokaryotes. All these three differences contribute to the increased disorder in eukaryotic proteins. It is tempting to speculate that the increase in serine frequencies in eukaryotes is related to regulation by kinases, but direct evidence for this is lacking. The differences are observed in all phyla, protein families, structural regions and type of protein but are most pronounced in disordered and linker regions. The observation that differences in the abundance of three amino acids cause the difference in disorder between eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins raises the question: Are amino acid frequencies different in eukaryotic linkers because the linkers are more disordered or do the differences cause the increased disorder?<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VF5f6giyZIo" width="1" />

The collection of immunoglobulin genes in an individual’s germline, which gives rise to B cell receptors via recombination, is known to vary significantly across individuals. In humans, for example, each individual has only a fraction of the several hundred known V alleles. Furthermore, the currently-accepted set of known V alleles is both incomplete (particularly for non-European samples), and contains a significant number of spurious alleles. The resulting uncertainty as to which immunoglobulin alleles are present in any given sample results in inaccurate B cell receptor sequence annotations, and in particular inaccurate inferred naive ancestors. In this paper we first show that the currently widespread practice of aligning each sequence to its closest match in the full set of IMGT alleles results in a very large number of spurious alleles that are not in the sample’s true set of germline V alleles. We then describe a new method for inferring each individual’s germline gene set from deep sequencing data, and show that it improves upon existing methods by making a detailed comparison on a variety of simulated and real data samples. This new method has been integrated into the partis annotation and clonal family inference package, available at https://github.com/psathyrella/partis, and is run by default without affecting overall run time.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XWDkjKZG-o0" width="1" />

ABSTRACT<p>Many experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, including in epilepsy research. However, rats and mice are social animals; and individual housing constitutes a stressful situation. The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of individual housing as compared to conditions maintaining social contact on stress markers and epilepsy. Control male mice socially housed during pretest and then transferred to individual cages for six weeks displayed anhedonia, increased anxiety and biological markers of stress as compared to pretest values or mice kept socially housed during six weeks. Pilocarpine-treated mice housed together showed increased levels of anhedonia, anxiety and stress markers as well as decreased cognitive performance as compared to the control group. The differences were more significant in pilocarpine-treated mice housed individually. Anxiety correlated linearly with cognitive performance and stress markers independently of the experimental conditions. In the male rat pilocarpine model, seizures were sixteen times more frequent in singly housed animals as compared to animals kept in pairs. Daily interactions with an experimenter in otherwise singly housed animals was sufficient to produce results identical to those found in animals kept in pairs. We propose that social isolation produces a severe phenotype in terms of stress and seizure frequency as compared to animals maintaining social contact (at least in these two models), a factor that needs to be taken into account for data interpretation, in particular for preclinical studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Many experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, a stressful condition for social animals, even in an enriched environment context. Using the pilocarpine model of epilepsy in rats and mice, we report that singly housing animals develop a more severe phenotype in terms of stress and epilepsy as compared to animals maintaining social contact. We propose that social isolation adds a degree of complexity for the interpretation of data, which may be particularly relevant for preclinical studies.</p>

Abstract<p>The paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) regulates stress, feeding behaviors and other homeostatic processes, but whether PVH also drives defensive states remains unknown. Here we showed that photostimulation of PVH neurons in mice elicited escape jumping, a typical defensive behavior. We mapped PVH outputs that densely terminate in the ventral midbrain area, and found that activation of the PVH-&gt;ventral midbrain (vMB) circuit produced profound defensive behavioral changes, including escape jumping, hiding, hyperlocomotion, and learned aversion. Electrophysiological recordings showed excitatory post-synaptic input onto ventral midbrain neurons via PVH fiber activation, and <i>in vivo</i> studies demonstrated that glutamate transmission from PVH-&gt;vMB was required for the evoked behavioral responses. Photostimulation of PVH-&gt;vMB fibers induced cFos expression mainly in non-dopaminergic neurons. Using a dual optogenetic-chemogenetic strategy, we further revealed that escape jumping and hiding were partially contributed by the activation of midbrain glutamatergic neurons. Taken together, our work unveils a hypothalamic-vMB circuit that encodes defensive properties, which may be implicated in normal stress-induced defensive responses.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) neurons are known to be involved in various homeostatic regulation. Despite the known activation of PVH neurons by various stresses, whether these neurons are directly involved in defensive behaviors during stressful events is not clear. This study reveals a direction projection from PVH to ventral midbrain (vMB) regions. Acute activation of either PVH neurons or specific PVH-&gt;vMB projections elicited stress, escape jumping, hiding and learned aversion, all related to defensive behaviors, which was partially contributed by midbrain glutamatergic neurons. Our study thus identifies a previously unknown role for the PVH-&gt;vMB neural pathway in promoting a defensive behavioral program.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Compared to older Caucasians, older African Americans have higher risks of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) and lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau biomarker levels. It is not known whether tau‐related differences begin earlier in life or whether race modifies other AD‐related biomarkers such as inflammatory proteins.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed multiplex cytokine analysis in a healthy middle‐aged cohort with family history of AD (n = 68) and an older cohort (n = 125) with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment, or AD dementia. After determining baseline interleukin (IL)‐9 level and AD‐associated IL‐9 change to differ according to race, we performed immunohistochemical analysis for proteins mechanistically linked to IL‐9 in brains of African Americans and Caucasians (n = 38), and analyzed postmortem IL‐9–related gene expression profiles in the publicly available Mount Sinai cohort (26 African Americans and 180 Caucasians).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to Caucasians with NC, African Americans with NC had lower CSF tau, p‐Tau<sub>181</sub>, and IL‐9 levels in both living cohorts. Conversely, AD was only correlated with increased CSF IL‐9 levels in African Americans but not Caucasians. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed perivascular, neuronal, and glial cells immunoreactive to IL‐9, and quantitative analysis in independent US cohorts showed AD to correlate with molecular changes (upstream differentiation marker and downstream effector cell marker) of IL‐9 upregulation only in African Americans but not Caucasians.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Baseline and AD‐associated IL‐9 differences between African Americans and Caucasians point to distinct molecular phenotypes for AD according to ancestry. Genetic and nongenetic factors need to be considered in future AD research involving unique populations. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The substantial clinical improvement in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT), combined with the poor response of proximal intracranial occlusions to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), led to questions regarding the utility of bridging therapy (BT; IVT followed by MT) compared to direct mechanical thrombectomy (dMT) for AIS patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate the comparative safety and efficacy of BT and dMT in AIS patients. We included all observational studies and post hoc analyses from randomized controlled clinical trials that provided data on the outcomes of AIS patients with LVO stratified by IVT treatment status prior to MT.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 38 eligible observational studies (11,798 LVO patients, mean age = 68 years, 56% treated with BT). In unadjusted analyses, BT was associated with a higher likelihood of 3‐month functional independence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32–1.76), 3‐month functional improvement (common OR [cOR] for 1‐point decrease in modified Rankin Scale score = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.18–1.97), early neurological improvement (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.83–1.76), successful recanalization (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.02–1.46), and successful recanalization with ≤2 device passes (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.43–3.64) compared to dMT. BT was also related to a lower likelihood of 3‐month mortality (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.57–0.73). In the adjusted analyses, BT was independently associated with a higher likelihood of 3‐month functional independence (adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.26–1.91) and lower odds of 3‐month mortality (adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66–0.97) compared to dMT. The two groups did not differ in functional improvement (adjusted cOR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.89–1.74) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.61–1.25).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BT appears to be associated with improved functional independence without evidence for safety concerns, compared to dMT, for AIS patients with LVO. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Hierarchical movement sequences are often assumed to mirror an anatomical hierarchy of brain regions. Using representational fMRI analysis, Yokoi and Diedrichsen challenge this common assumption. Although the primary motor cortex represents elementary movements, chunk and sequence representations coexist in the premotor and parietal cortices.

Recent work has begun to elucidate the vascular and neural mechanisms underlying the BOLD signal. The dilatory response is distributed throughout the vascular network. Arteries actively dilate within a second following neural activity increases, while venous distensions are passive and have a time course that last tens of seconds. Vasodilation, and thus local blood flow, is controlled by the activity of both neurons and astrocytes via multiple different pathways. The relationship between sensory-driven neural activity and the vascular dynamics in sensory areas are well-captured with a linear convolution model. However, depending on the behavioral state or brain region, the coupling between neural activity and hemodynamic signals can be weak or even inverted.</p></div>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Maternal autoantibodies are a risk factor for impaired brain development in the offspring. Antibodies (AB) against the NR1 (GluN1) subunit of the <i>N</i>‐Methyl‐D‐Aspartate‐receptor (NMDAR) are among the most frequently diagnosed anti‐neuronal surface AB, yet little is known about effects on fetal development during pregnancy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We established a murine model of <i>in utero</i> exposure to human recombinant NR1 and isotype‐matched non‐reactive control (CTL) ABs. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected on embryonic days 13 and 17 each with 240 μg of human monoclonal AB. Offspring were investigated for acute and chronic effects on NMDAR function, brain development and behavior.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Transferred NR1 AB enriched in the fetus and bound to synaptic structures in the fetal brain. Density of NMDAR was considerably reduced (up to ‐49.2%) and electrophysiological properties altered, reflected by decreased amplitudes of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in young neonates (‐34.4%). NR1 AB‐treated animals displayed increased early postnatal mortality (+27.2%), impaired neurodevelopmental reflexes, altered blood pH and reduced bodyweight. During adolescence and adulthood, animals showed hyperactivity (+27.8% median activity over 14 days), lower anxiety and impaired sensorimotor gating. NR1 AB caused long‐lasting neuropathological effects also in aged mice (10 months), such as reduced volumes of cerebellum, midbrain and brainstem.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The data collectively support a model in which asymptomatic mothers can harbor low‐level pathogenic human NR1 AB that are diaplacentally transferred causing neurotoxic effects on neonatal development. Thus, AB‐mediated network changes may represent a – potentially treatable – neurodevelopmental congenital brain disorder contributing to lifelong neuropsychiatric morbidity in affected children.</p>

Abstract<p>Breathing requires precise control of respiratory muscles to ensure adequate ventilation. Neurons within discrete regions of the brainstem produce oscillatory activity to control the frequency of breathing. Less is understood about how spinal and pontomedullary networks modulate the activity of respiratory motor neurons to produce different patterns of activity during different behaviors (i.e. during exercise, coughing, swallowing, vocalizing, or at rest) or following disease or injury. Here, we use a chemogenetic approach to inhibit the activity of glutamatergic V2a neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord of neonatal and adult mice to assess their potential roles in respiratory rhythm generation and patterning respiratory muscle activity. Using whole body plethysmography, we show that V2a neuron function is required in neonatal mice to maintain the frequency and regularity of respiratory rhythm. However, silencing V2a neurons in adult mice increases respiratory frequency and ventilation, without affecting regularity. Thus, the excitatory drive provided by V2a neurons is less critical for respiratory rhythm generation in adult compared to neonatal mice. In addition, we used simultaneous electromyography recordings of the diaphragm and extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles in conscious adult mice to examine the role of V2a neurons in patterning respiratory muscle activity. We find that silencing V2a neurons activates extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles at rest, when they are normally inactive, with little impact on diaphragm activity. Thus, our results indicate that V2a neurons participate in a circuit that serves to constrain the activity of extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles so that they are active only when needed.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles are crucial for increasing ventilation during exercise or following disease and injury, yet the neural mechanisms that ensure that they are recruited only when needed are not known. By silencing the activity of V2a neurons we reveal an important role for these neurons in preventing extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscle activity at rest. Unlike in neonatal mice, silencing V2a neurons in adult mice does not disrupt respiratory rhythm generation or have a major impact on diaphragm activity. Our results support the feasibility of targeting V2a containing circuits to control extradiaphragmatic muscles without impairing respiratory rhythm generation to treat patients with neuromuscular disease or spinal cord injury.</p>

Abstract<p>Sphingomyelin (SM) supports brain myelination, a process closely associated with cognitive maturation. The presence of SM in breast milk suggests a role in infant nutrition, however, little is known about SM contribution to healthy cognitive development. We investigated the link between early life dietary SM, later cognitive development and myelination using an exploratory observational study of neurotypical children. SM levels were quantified in infant nutrition products fed in the first 3 months of life and associated with myelin content (brain MRI) as well as cognitive development (Mullen Scales of Early Learning).</p><p>Higher levels of SM were significantly associated with higher rates of change in verbal development in the first 2 years of life (r=0.65, P&lt;0.001), as well as, higher levels of myelin content at 12-24 months, delayed onset and/or more prolonged rates of myelination in different brain areas. Second, we explored mechanisms of action using in vitro models (Sprague Dawley rat pups). In vitro data showed SM treatment resulted in increased proliferation (P=0.0133 and P=0.0434 at 4 and 10 days in vitro (DIV)), maturation (P=0.467 at 4 days DIV) and differentiation (P=0.0123 and P=0.0369 at 4 and 10 DIV) of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, as well as increased axon myelination (P=0.0005 at 32 DIV).</p><p>These findings indicate an impact of dietary SM on cognitive development in healthy children, potentially modulated by oligodendrocytes and increased axon myelination. Future research should include randomized controlled trials to substantiate efficacy of SM for cognitive benefits together with preclinical studies examining SM bioavailability and brain uptake.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The presences of sphingomyelin (SM) in breast milk suggests it has an important role in infant nutrition. Ways of measuring SM in milk are only recently developed, meaning little is known about its role in brain development. In this study, we used two approaches to explore this further. First, we investigated the link between early life SM obtained from the diet with later brain development and brain structure in a group of healthy children. Second, we examined the mechanism behind these effects using experimental models of brain development. Our findings in children indicate a positive impact of SM on brain development supported by experimental models. Future studies need to investigate further to build on the findings of our preliminary work.</p>

Evidence that cortical neural activity unfolds as a sequence of metastable states is accumulating at fast pace. Metastable activity occurs both in response to an external stimulus and during ongoing, self-generated activity. These spontaneous metastable states are increasingly found to subserve internal representations that are not locked to external triggers, including states of deliberations, attention and expectation. Moreover, decoding stimuli or decisions via metastable states can be carried out trial-by-trial. Focusing on metastability will allow us to shift our perspective on neural coding from traditional concepts based on trial-averaging to models based on dynamic ensemble representations.</p><p>Recent theoretical work has started to characterize the mechanistic origin and potential roles of metastable representations. In this article we review recent findings on metastable activity, how it may arise in biologically realistic models, and its potential role for representing internal states as well as relevant task variables.</p></div>

Using a high resolution in situ hybridization technique we have measured PIEZO1, PIEZO2 and TRPV1 transcripts in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons.   Consistent with previous studies, PIEZO2 transcripts were highly expressed in most DRG neurons, including the largest diameter neurons implicated in mediating touch and proprioception.  In contrast, PIEZO1 transcripts were selectively expressed in smaller diameter DRG neurons, which are implicated in mediating nociception.  Moreover, neurons expressing PIEZO1 were distinct from those neurons that strongly expressed TRPV1, one of the channels implicated in heat-nociception.   Using an in vivo functional test for the selective expression, we found that Yoda1, a PIEZO1-specific agonist, induced a mechanical hyperalgesia that displayed a significantly prolonged time course compared with that induced by capsaicin, a TRPV1-specific agonist.  Taken together, our results indicate that PIEZO1 should be considered a potential candidate for the long sought channel mediating mechano-nociception.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00749">Effects of Age, Cognition, and Neural Encoding on the Perception of Temporal Speech Cues</a></h4>

Older adults commonly report difficulty understanding speech, particularly in adverse listening environments. These communication difficulties may exist in the absence of peripheral hearing loss. Older adults, both with normal hearing and with hearing loss, demonstrate temporal processing deficits that affect speech perception. The purpose of the present study is to investigate aging, cognition, and neural processing factors that may lead to deficits on perceptual tasks that rely on phoneme identification based on a temporal cue – vowel duration. A better understanding of the neural and cognitive impairments underlying temporal processing deficits could lead to more focused aural rehabilitation for improved speech understanding for older adults with normal hearing. 
This investigation was conducted in younger (YNH) and older normal-hearing (ONH) participants who completed three measures of cognitive functioning known to decline with age: working memory, processing speed, and inhibitory control. To evaluate perceptual and neural processing of auditory temporal contrasts, identification functions for the contrasting word-pair WHEAT and WEED were obtained on a nine-step continuum of vowel duration, and frequency-following responses (FFRs) and cortical auditory-evoked potentials (CAEPs) were recorded to the two endpoints of the continuum. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the cognitive, peripheral, and/or central mechanisms that may contribute to perceptual performance. 
YNH participants demonstrated higher cognitive functioning on all three measures compared to ONH participants. The slope of the identification function was steeper in YNH than in ONH participants, suggesting a clearer distinction between the contrasting words in the YNH participants. FFRs revealed better response waveform morphology and more robust phase-locking in YNH compared to ONH participants. ONH participants also exhibited earlier latencies for CAEP components compared to the YNH participants. Linear regression analyses revealed that cortical processing significantly contributed to the variance in perceptual performance in the WHEAT/WEED identification functions. These results suggest that reduced neural precision contributes to age-related speech perception difficulties that arise from temporal processing deficits.

Previous study has proved the specific role of prefrontal-parietal network in the rapid goal-directed chunking (RGDC), which could dissociate the prefrontal activity from the working memory demand or encoding difficulty. However, it remains unknown how the prefrontal and parietal cortices collaborate to accomplish RGDC. A novel experiment design using Chinese characters as materials wad conduced with eighteen undergraduate students (9 females, mean age = 22.4 years) while recoding electroencephalogram (EEG). The radical-level chunking, accomplished in a timely stringent way, made a strict contrast with the stroke-level chunking whose cognitive brain processing were far less coherent due to the irregular and unpredictable chunking procedure. Comparing to the stoke-level chunking, RGDC like radical-level chunking showed an early increase of gamma band synchronization over parietal and occipital cortices, followed by enhanced power in the beta-gamma band (25-38 Hz) over frontal areas in the regular versus irregular chunking conditions. We suggest that the posterior rhythmic activities in the gamma band may underlie the processes that are directly associated with perceptual manipulations of chunking, while the subsequent beta-gamma activation over frontal area appears to reflect the reinforcement of the selected rules over alternative options, which would differentiate goal-directed chunking from chunking processes accomplished in a more implicit manner.

A hand mental rotation task (HMRT) is a task wherein a person judges whether an image of a rotated hand is of the right or left hand. Two performance strategies are expected to come into play when performing these tasks: a visual imagery (VI) strategy, in which an image is mentally rotated, and a motor imagery (MI) strategy, in which the movement of a person’s own hand is simulated. Although elderly people generally take some time to perform these tasks, ability differs greatly between individuals. The present study hypothesizes that there is a relationship between differences in task performance strategy and performance ability, and it compares performance strategy among elderly people divided into groups with a short mental rotation time and a long mental rotation time. In response to images of the palm, both groups displayed a medial-lateral effect in which responses were faster for images where the third finger was rotated toward the midline of the body than images rotated in the opposite direction, and we inferred that an MI strategy was primarily employed. Meanwhile, in response to images of the back of the hand, a medial-lateral effect was also observed in the group with a long mental rotation time and not in the group with the shortest mental rotation time (VI strategy). These results suggest that different strategies for performing HMRT tasks are used by elderly people with a short mental rotation time and those with a long mental rotation time.

The impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on procedural memory has received significantly less attention than declarative memory. Although to date studies on procedural memory have yielded mixed findings, many rehabilitation protocols (e.g., errorless learning) rely on the procedural memory system, and assume that it is relatively intact. The aim of the current study was to determine whether individuals with TBI are impaired on a task of procedural memory as a group, and to examine the presence of individual differences in performance. We administered to a sample of 36 individuals with moderate-severe TBI and 40 healthy comparisons (HC) the rotary pursuit (RP) task, and then examined their rate of learning, as well as their retention of learning. Our analyses revealed that while individuals with TBI spent a significantly shorter amount of time on target as a group, they did not retain significantly less procedural learning, and as a group their rate of learning was not different from HCs. However, there were high individual differences in both groups, indicating that some individuals might not be able to take advantage of treatment methods designed to leverage intact procedural memory system. Future work is needed to better assess and characterize procedural memory in individuals with TBI across a larger battery of tasks in experimental and clinical setting as memory and learning status may predict rehabilitation success.

In working memory (WM), the ability to concurrently integrate different types of information and maintain or manipulate them promotes the flow of ongoing tasks. WM is a key component of normal human cognition. In this study, we applied a combined voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis to investigate the relationship between the ability of object and spatial working memory (WM), and regional gray matter density (GMD), as well as intrinsic functional connectivity. The VBM analysis showed a positive correlation between the individual difference of object WM and GMD in the right middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and the left superior temporal gyrus (STG), which are responsible for coding object information and processing the shape of an object. The individual difference of the spatial WM was positively related to GMD in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) located in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which confirmed that it is an important region for memory stores and maintains WM spatial representations. Further functional connectivity analysis revealed that the individual difference of object WM was significantly correlated with the rsFC of right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) – left postcentral gyrus (PostCG)/right precentral gyrus (PreCG)/left supplementary motor area (SMA). Whereas the capacity of spatial WM was significantly associated with the FC strength of left dlPFC – left precuneus, right dlPFC – right MFG, and left superior frontal sulcus (SFS) – left SMA/ right inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Our findings suggested that object WM is associated with the structure and functional organization of the brain regions involved in the ventral pathway (occipital - temporal regions) and the capacity of spatial WM is related to the dorsal pathway (frontal - parietal regions).

Neuroanatomy suggests that adjacent neocortical neurons share a similar set of afferent synaptic inputs, as opposed to neurons localized to different areas of the neocortex. In the present study, we made simultaneous single-electrode patch clamp recordings from two or three adjacent neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of the ketamine-xylazine anesthetized rat in vivo to study the correlation patterns in their spike firing during both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. One difference with previous studies of pairwise neuronal spike firing correlations was that here we identified several different quantifiable parameters in the correlation patterns by which different pairs could be compared. The questions asked were if the correlation patterns between adjacent pairs were similar and if there was a relationship between the degree of similarity and the layer location of the pairs. In contrast, our results show that for putative pyramidal neurons within layer III and within layer V, each pair of neurons is to some extent unique in terms of their spiking correlation patterns. Interestingly, our results also indicated that these correlation patterns did not substantially alter between spontaneous and evoked activity. Our findings are compatible with the view that the synaptic input connectivity to each neocortical neuron is at least in some aspects unique. A possible interpretation is that plasticity mechanisms, which could either be initiating or be supported by transcriptomic differences, tend to differentiate rather than harmonize the synaptic weight distributions between adjacent neurons of the same type.

Connections in nervous systems are disproportionately concentrated on a small subset of neural elements that act as
network hubs. Hubs have been found across different of species and scales ranging from C.elegans to mouse, rat, cat,
macaque and human, suggesting a role for genetic influences. The recent availability of brain-wide gene expression

Canonical epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin remodeling, play a role in numerous life processes, particularly neurodevelopment. Epigenetics explains the development of cells in an organism with the same DNA sequence into different cell types with various functions. However, previous studies on epigenetics have are only focused on the chromatin level. Recently, epigenetic modifications of RNA, which mainly include 6-methyladenosine (m6A), pseudouridine, 5-methylcytidine (m5C), inosine (I), 2’-O-ribosemethylation, and 1-methyladenosine (m1A), have gained increasing attention.Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are a type of noncoding RNA without a 5’ cap or 3’ poly (A) tail, are abundantly found in the brain and might respond to and regulate synaptic function. Also, circRNAs have various functions, such as microRNA sponge, regulation of gene transcription and interaction with RNA binding protein.In addition, circRNAs are methylated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A). In this review, we discuss the crucial roles of epigenetic modifications of circRNAs, such as m6A, in the genesis and development of neurons and in synaptic function and plasticity. Thus, this type of changes in circRNAs might be a therapeutic target in central nervous system (CNS) disorders and could aid the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with clopidogrel plus aspirin has been suggested by American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for minor stroke (MS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. The purpose of this study was to find the potential subgroups that benefit from DAT. We aimed to compare the efficacy of clopidogrel–aspirin therapy with that of aspirin therapy in MS/TIA patients stratified by CYP2C19 genotype and risk profiles.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>CYP2C19 loss‐of‐function allele (LoFA) carriers were defined as patients with LoFA of either *2 or *3. Low‐ and high‐risk profile was defined as Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) &lt;3 and ≥3, respectively. Stroke recurrence at 1 year was considered primary outcome.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of a total 2,933 MS/TIA patients, there were 1,726 (58.8%) LoFA carriers and 1,068 (36.4%) patients at high risk (ESRS ≥3). No significant difference for stroke recurrence between the clopidogrel–aspirin group and aspirin alone group was found in LoFA carriers (11.2% vs 13.3%, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64~1.09). In stratified analyses by CYP2C19 genotype and ESRS, HRs (95% CIs) of the clopidogrel–aspirin therapy for stroke recurrence were 1.00 (0.70~1.42), 0.63 (0.41~0.97), 0.62 (0.40~0.96), and 0.52 (0.31~0.88) among subgroups of LoFA carriers at low risk, LoFA carriers at high risk, LoFA noncarriers at low risk, and LoFA noncarriers at high risk, respectively, with <i>p</i> = 0.021 for interaction.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, LoFA carriers do not benefit from DAT, but there is significant benefit for LoFA carriers who are at high risk. The benefit of clopidogrel in Chinese MS/TIA patients depends on CYP2C19 genotype and risk profile. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Here, we review the neural circuit bases of habits, compulsions, and addictions, behaviors which are all characterized by relatively automatic action performance. We discuss relevant studies primarily from the rodent literature, and describe how major headway has been made in identifying the brain regions and neural cell types whose activity is modulated during the acquisition and performance of these automated behaviors. The dorsal striatum and cortical inputs to this structure have emerged as key players in the wider basal ganglia circuitry encoding behavioral automaticity, and changes in the activity of different neuronal cell-types in these brain regions have been shown to co-occur with the formation of these automatic behaviors. We highlight how disordered functioning of these neural circuits can result in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as OCD and drug addiction. Finally, we discuss how the next phase of research in the field may benefit from integration of approaches for access to cells based on their genetic makeup, activity, connectivity and precise anatomical location.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00027">Sensory Modulation Disorder (SMD) and Pain: A New Perspective</a></h4>

Sensory modulation disorder (SMD) affects sensory processing across single or multiple sensory systems. The sensory over-responsivity (SOR) subtype of SMD is manifested clinically as a condition in which non-painful stimuli are perceived as abnormally irritating, unpleasant, or even painful. Moreover, SOR interferes with participation in daily routines and activities, co-occurs with daily pain hyper-sensitivity, and reduces quality of life due to bodily pain. 
Laboratory behavioral studies have confirmed abnormal pain perception, as demonstrated by hyperalgesia and an enhanced lingering painful sensation, in children and adults with SMD. Advanced quantitative sensory testing has revealed the mechanisms of altered pain processing in SOR whereby despite the existence of normal peripheral sensory processing, there is enhanced facilitation of pain transmitting pathways along with preserved but delayed inhibitory pain modulation. These findings point to central nervous system involvement as the underlying mechanism of pain hypersensitivity in SOR. Based on the mutual central processing of both non-painful and painful sensory stimuli, we suggest shared mechanisms such as cortical hyper-excitation, an excitatory-inhibitory neuronal imbalance, and sensory modulation alterations. This is supported by novel findings indicating that SOR is a risk factor and comorbidity of chronic non-neuropathic pain disorders. 
This is the first review to summarize current empirical knowledge investigating SMD and pain, a sensory modality not yet part of the official SMD realm. We propose a neurophysiological mechanism-based model for the interrelation between pain and SMD. Embracing the pain domain could significantly contribute to the understanding of this condition’s pathogenesis and how it manifests in daily life, as well as suggesting the basis for future potential mechanism-based therapies.

Electroencephalography (EEG) data can be used to decode an attended speech source in normal-hearing (NH) listeners using high-density EEG caps, as well as around-the-ear EEG devices. The technology may find application in identifying the target speaker in a cocktail party like scenario and steer speech enhancement algorithms in cochlear implants (CIs). However, the worse spectral resolution and the electrical artifacts introduced by a CI may limit the applicability of this approach to CI users. 
The goal of this study was to investigate whether selective attention can be decoded in CI users using an around-the-ear EEG system (cEEGrid). The performances of high-density cap EEG recordings and cEEGrid EEG recordings were compared in a selective attention paradigm using an envelope tracking algorithm. Speech from two audio books was presented through insert earphones to NH listeners and via direct audio cable to the CI users. 10 NH listeners and 10 bilateral CI users participated in the study. Participants were instructed to attend to one out of the two concurrent speech streams while data were recorded by a 96-channel scalp EEG and an 18-channel cEEGrid setup simultaneously. Reconstruction performance was evaluated by means of parametric correlations between the reconstructed speech and both, the envelope of the attended and the unattended speech stream. 
Results confirm the feasibility to decode selective attention by means of single-trial EEG data in NH and CI users using a high-density EEG. All NH listeners and 9 out 10 CI achieved high decoding accuracies. The cEEGrid was successful in decoding selective attention in 5 out of 10 NH listeners. The same result was obtained for CI users.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that boys throw balls faster, farther and more accurately than girls. This is largely due to well-known anatomical and muscle physiological differences that play a central role in overarm throwing. With the objective to understand the potential contribution of coordinative aspects in this gender difference, this large cross-sectional study examined a simplified forearm throw that eliminated the physical advantages of male individuals. As hypothesized, the gender disparity disappeared, but only in the age groups younger than 20 years. Two fine-grained spatiotemporal metrics displayed a similar age-dependent gender disparity. As throwing experience did not explain this age-dependency, the results are discussed in the context of spatial abilities and video game experience, both more pronounced in males. In contrast, a measure of intrinsic rhythmicity developed over successive throws did not reveal any gender differences, speaking to the fundamental tendency in humans to fall into rhythmic patterns. This computational study was performed in a large cohort in the context of an outreach activity, demonstrating that robust quantitative measures can also be obtained in less controlled environments. The findings also alert that motor neuroscience may need to pay more attention to gender differences.

Biological membranes show lateral and transverse asymmetric lipid distribution. Cholesterol localizes in both hemilayers, but in the external one it is mostly condensed in lipid-ordered microdomains (raft domains), together with saturated phosphatidyl lipids and sphingolipids (including sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids). Membrane asymmetries induce special membrane biophysical properties and behave as signals for several physiological and/or pathological processes. Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is associated with a perturbation in different membrane properties. Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein together with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are the most characteristic cellular changes observed in this disease. The extracellular presence of Aβ peptides forming senile plaques, , together with soluble oligomeric species of Aβ, are considered the major cause of the synaptic dysfunction of AD. The association between Aβ peptide and membrane lipids has been extensively studied. It has been postulated that cholesterol content and cholesterol distribution condition Aβ production and posterior accumulation in membranes and, hence, cell dysfunction. Several lines of evidence suggest that Aβ partitions in the cell membrane and accumulates mostly in raft domains, the site where the cleavage of the precursor AβPP by β- and γ- secretase is also thought to occur. The main consequence of the pathogenesis of AD is the disruption of the cholinergic pathways in the cerebral cortex and in the basal forebrain. In parallel, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has been extensively related to membrane properties. Since its transmembrane domain exhibits extensive contacts with the surrounding lipids, the acetylcholine receptor function is conditioned by its lipid microenvironment. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is present in high-density clusters in the cell membrane where it localizes mainly in lipid-ordered domains. Perturbations of sphingomyelin or cholesterol composition alter acetylcholine receptor location. Therefore, Aβ processing, Aβ partitioning and acetylcholine receptor location and function can be manipulated by changes in membrane lipid biophysics. Understanding these mechanisms should provide insights into new therapeutic strategies for prevention and/or treatment of AD. Here, we discuss the implications of lipid-protein interactions at the cell membrane level in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. The onset and progression of this pathology are correlated with several changes in the brain, including the formation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide and the intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. In addition, dysregulated neuronal plasticity, synapse loss, and a reduction in cellular energy metabolism have also been described. Canonical Wnt signaling has also been shown to be downregulated in AD. Remarkably, we showed previously that the in vivo inhibition of Wnt signaling accelerates the appearance of AD markers in transgenic (Tg) and wild-type (WT) mice. Additionally, we found that Wnt signaling stimulates energy metabolism, which is critical for the ability of Wnt to promote the recovery of cognitive function in AD. Therefore, we hypothesized that activation of canonical Wnt signaling in a presymptomatic transgenic animal model of AD would improve some symptoms. To explore the latter, we used a transgenic mouse model (J20 Tg) with mild AD phenotype expression (high levels of amyloid aggregates) and studied the effect of andrographolide (ANDRO), an activator of canonical Wnt signaling. We found that presymptomatic administration of ANDRO in J20 Tg mice prevented the reduction in cellular energy metabolism markers. Moreover, treated animals showed improvement in cognitive performance. At the synaptic level, J20 Tg animals showed severe deficiencies in presynaptic function as determined by electrophysiological parameters, all of which were completely restored to normal by ANDRO administration. Finally, an analysis of hippocampal synaptosomes by electron microscopy revealed that the length of synapses was restored with ANDRO treatment. Altogether, these data support the idea that the activation of canonical Wnt signaling during presymptomatic stages could represent an interesting pharmacological strategy to delay the onset of AD

Brain tissue contains autofluorescing elements that potentially impede accurate identification of neurons when visualized with fluorescent microscopy. Age-related accumulation of molecules with autofluorescent properties, such as lipofuscin, can possess spectral profiles that invade the typical emission range of fluorophores commonly utilized in fluorescent microscopy. The traditional method for accounting for this native fluorescence is to apply lipophilic dyes that are able to sequester these unwanted signals. While effective, such dyes can present a range of problems including the obstruction of fluorescent probe emissions. The present study utilizes aged primate midbrain tissue stained for tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin to investigate an image processing approach for removing autofluorescence utilizing spectral imaging and linear unmixing. This technique is then compared against the traditional, dye-based autofluorescence sequestration method using Sudan Black B (SBB). Spectral imaging and linear unmixing yielded significantly higher cell numbers than SBB treatment. This finding suggests that computational approaches for removing autofluorescence in neural tissue are both viable and preferential to dye-based approaches for estimation of cell body numbers.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Whether auditory processing of speech relies on reference to the articulatory motor information of speaker remains elusive. Here, we addressed this issue under a two-brain framework. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to record the brain activities of speakers when telling real-life stories and later of listeners when listening to the audio recordings of these stories. Based on between-brain seed-to-voxel correlation analyses, we revealed that neural dynamics in listeners’ auditory temporal cortex are temporally coupled with the dynamics in the speaker’s larynx/phonation area. Moreover, the coupling response in listener’s left auditory temporal cortex follows the hierarchical organization for speech processing, with response lags in A1+, STG/STS, and MTG increasing linearly. Further, listeners showing greater coupling responses understand the speech better. When comprehension fails, such interbrain auditory-articulation coupling vanishes substantially. These findings suggest that a listener’s auditory system and a speaker’s articulatory system are inherently aligned during naturalistic verbal interaction, and such alignment is associated with high-level information transfer from the speaker to the listener. Our study provides reliable evidence supporting that references to the articulatory motor information of speaker facilitate speech comprehension under a naturalistic scene.</span>

Gamma oscillations are hypothesized to temporally coordinate sensory encoding. Shin and Moore found a distinct subtype of fast spiking interneurons (FS) in SI that are nonsensory responsive and spike regularly at gamma intervals. These “gamma regular nonsensory FS” could potentially mediate perceptually relevant oscillations, independent of the LFP and sensory drive.

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/29/5816?rss=1">A Model of Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy Type 1 Reveals a Role of Glycosphingolipids in Neuronal Polarity</a></h4>

<p>Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy Type 1 (HSAN1) is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited neuropathy, clinically characterized by a loss of distal peripheral sensory and motoneuronal function. Mutations in subunits of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) have been linked to the majority of HSAN1 cases. SPTs catalyze the condensation of l-serine with palmitoyl-CoA, the first committed and rate-limiting step in <i>de novo</i> sphingolipid biosynthesis. Despite extensive investigation, the molecular pathogenesis of HSAN1 remains controversial. Here, we established a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) model of HSAN1 by generating a <i>sptl-1(c363g</i>) mutation, encoding SPTL-1(C121W) and equivalent to human SPTLC1<sup>C133W</sup>, at the <i>C. elegans</i> genomic locus through CRISPR. The <i>sptl-1(c363g</i>) homozygous mutants exhibited the same larval lethality and epithelial polarity defect as observed in <i>sptl-1(RNAi</i>) animals, suggesting a loss-of-function effect of the SPTL-1(C121W) mutation. <i>sptl-1(c363g)</i>/+ heterozygous mutants displayed sensory dysfunction with concomitant neuronal morphology and axon-dendrite polarity defects, demonstrating that the <i>C. elegans</i> model recapitulates characteristics of the human disease. <i>sptl-1(c363g</i>)-derived neuronal defects were copied in animals with defective sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes downstream of SPTL-1, including ceramide glucosyltransferases, suggesting that SPTLC1<sup>C133W</sup> contributes to the HSAN1 pathogenesis by limiting the production of complex sphingolipids, including glucosylceramide. Overexpression of SPTL-1(C121W) led to similar epithelial and neuronal defects and to reduced levels of complex sphingolipids, specifically glucosylceramide, consistent with a dominant-negative effect of SPTL-1(C121W) that is mediated by loss of this downstream product. Genetic interactions between SPTL-1(C121W) and components of directional trafficking in neurons suggest that the neuronal polarity phenotype could be caused by glycosphingolipid-dependent defects in polarized vesicular trafficking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The symptoms of inherited metabolic diseases are often attributed to the accumulation of toxic intermediates or byproducts, no matter whether the disease-causing enzyme participates in a biosynthetic or a degradation pathway. By showing that the phenotypes observed in a <i>C. elegans</i> model of HSAN1 disease could be caused by loss of a downstream product (glucosylceramide) rather than the accumulation of a toxic byproduct, our work provides new insights into the origins of the symptoms of inherited metabolic diseases while expanding the repertoire of sphingolipid functions, specifically, of glucosylceramides. These findings not only have their most immediate relevance for neuroprotective treatments for HSAN1, they may also have implications for a much broader range of neurologic conditions.</p>

<p>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is characterized by neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Here, we provide the first evidence of striking morphological alterations in dentate granule cells (DGCs) of FTD patients and in a mouse model of the disease, Tau<sup>VLW</sup> mice. Taking advantage of the fact that the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) gives rise to newborn DGCs throughout the lifetime in rodents, we used RGB retroviruses to study the temporary course of these alterations in newborn DGCs of female Tau<sup>VLW</sup> mice. In addition, retroviruses that encode either PSD95:GFP or Syn:GFP revealed striking alterations in the afferent and efferent connectivity of newborn Tau<sup>VLW</sup> DGCs, and monosynaptic retrograde rabies virus tracing showed that these cells are disconnected from distal brain regions and local sources of excitatory innervation. However, the same cells exhibited a predominance of local inhibitory innervation. Accordingly, the expression of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers of inhibitory synapses was markedly increased in the DG of Tau<sup>VLW</sup> mice and FTD patients. Moreover, an increased number of neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons in the DG correlated with a reduced number of activated egr-1<sup>+</sup> DGCs in Tau<sup>VLW</sup> mice. Finally, we tested the therapeutic potential of environmental enrichment and chemoactivation to reverse these alterations in mice. Both strategies reversed the morphological alterations of newborn DGCs and partially restored their connectivity in a mouse model of the disease. Moreover, our data point to remarkable morphological similarities between the DGCs of Tau<sup>VLW</sup> mice and FTD patients.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show, for the first time to our knowledge, that the population of dentate granule cells is disconnected from other regions of the brain in the neurodegenerative disease frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These alterations were observed in FTD patients and in a mouse model of this disease. Moreover, we tested the therapeutic potential of two strategies, environmental enrichment and chemoactivation, to stimulate the activity of these neurons in mice. We found that some of the alterations were reversed by these therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>Chronic pain is a serious debilitating disease for which effective treatment is still lacking. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) has been implicated in nociceptive processing at both peripheral and spinal neurons. However, whether ASIC1a also contributes to pain perception at the supraspinal level remains elusive. Here, we report that ASIC1a in ACC is required for thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity associated with chronic pain. ACC-specific genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of ASIC1a reduced the probability of cortical LTP induction and attenuated inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in male mice. Using cell type-specific manipulations, we demonstrate that ASIC1a in excitatory neurons of ACC is a major player in cortical LTP and pain behavior. Mechanistically, we show that ASIC1a tuned pain-related cortical plasticity through protein kinase C -mediated increase of membrane trafficking of AMPAR subunit GluA1 in ACC. Importantly, postapplication of ASIC1a inhibitors in ACC reversed previously established nociceptive hypersensitivity in both chronic inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain models. These results suggest that ASIC1a critically contributes to a higher level of pain processing through synaptic potentiation in ACC, which may serve as a promising analgesic target for treatment of chronic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic pain is a debilitating disease that still lacks effective therapy. Ion channels are good candidates for developing new analgesics. Here, we provide several lines of evidence to support an important role of cortically located ASIC1a channel in pain hypersensitivity through promoting long-term synaptic potentiation in the ACC. Our results indicate a promising translational potential of targeting ASIC1a to treat chronic pain.</p>

<p>The accumulation of misfolded proteins is a common pathological feature of many neurodegenerative disorders, including synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by the presence of α-synuclein (α-syn)-containing Lewy bodies. However, although recent studies have investigated α-syn accumulation and propagation in neurons, the molecular mechanisms underlying α-syn transmission have been largely unexplored. Here, we examined a monogenic form of synucleinopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in lysosomal ATP13A2/PARK9. These studies revealed that lysosomal exocytosis regulates intracellular levels of α-syn in human neurons. Loss of PARK9 function in patient-derived dopaminergic neurons disrupted lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, reduced lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage, increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and impaired lysosomal exocytosis. Importantly, this dysfunction in lysosomal exocytosis impaired α-syn secretion from both axons and soma, promoting α-syn accumulation. However, activation of the lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) was sufficient to upregulate lysosomal exocytosis, rescue defective α-syn secretion, and prevent α-syn accumulation. Together, these results suggest that intracellular α-syn levels are regulated by lysosomal exocytosis in human dopaminergic neurons and may represent a potential therapeutic target for PD and other synucleinopathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease linked to the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in patient neurons. However, it is unclear what the mechanism might be. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for lysosomal exocytosis in clearing intracellular α-syn and show that impairment of this pathway by mutations in the PD-linked gene ATP13A2/PARK9 contributes to α-syn accumulation in human dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, upregulating lysosomal exocytosis by increasing lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels was sufficient to rescue defective α-syn secretion and accumulation in patient neurons. These studies identify lysosomal exocytosis as a potential therapeutic target in diseases characterized by the accumulation of α-syn, including PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00737">Insights From Dynamic Neuro-Immune Imaging on Murine Immune Responses to CNS Damage</a></h4>

Technological advances in 2-Photon Laser Scanning Microscopy (2P-LSM) have allowed novel insights into in vivo immune response in a variety of tissue microenvironments. While imaging of peripheral tissues has provided an abundance of data with regards to immune cell dynamics, central nervous system (CNS) imaging is comparatively inhibited by tissue accessibility and manipulation. Despite these limitations, the results of dynamic intravital neuro-immune imaging thus far have provided foundational insights into basic CNS biology. Utilizing a combination of intravital and ex vivo 2P-LSM we have observed novel pathways allowing immune cells, stromal cells, cancer cells and proteins to communicate between the CNS parenchyma and peripheral vasculature. Similar to what has been reported in the intestinal tract, we have visualized myeloid cells extend dendritic processes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) into pial blood vessels. Furthermore, transient vessel leaks seen during systemic inflammation provide opportunities for cellular protein to be exchanged between the periphery and CNS. These insights provide new, visual information regarding immune surveillance and antigen presentation within the CNS. Furthermore, when combining intravital 2P-LSM and microfluidic devices complexed with mathematical modeling, we are gaining new insights into the intravascular behavior of circulating immune cells. This new knowledge into the basic mechanisms by which cells migrate to and interact with the CNS provide important considerations for the design of neuroelectric devices that have the potential to connect the peripheral-neural microenvironments in a unique, artificial interface.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00030">Control of Presynaptic Parallel Fiber Efficacy by Activity-Dependent Regulation of the Number of Occupied Release Sites</a></h4>

Parallel fiber (PF) synapses show pronounced and lasting facilitation during bursts of high-frequency activity. They typically connect to their target neurons via a single active zone (AZ), harboring few release sites (~2-8) with moderate initial vesicular release probability (~0.2-0.4). In light of these biophysical characteristics it seems surprising that PF synapses can sustain facilitation during high-frequency periods of tens of action potentials (APs). Recent findings suggest an increase in the number of occupied release sites due to ultra-rapid (~180 s-1), Ca2+ dependent recruitment of synaptic vesicles (SVs) from replenishment sites as major presynaptic mechanism of this lasting facilitation. On the molecular level, Synaptotagmin 7 or Munc13s have been suggested to be involved in mediating facilitation at PF synapses. The recruitment of SVs from replenishment sites appears to be reversible on a slower time-scale, thereby, explaining that PF synapses rapidly depress and ultimately become silent during low-frequency activity. Hence, PF synapses show high-frequency facilitation but low-frequency depression. This behavior is explained by regulation of the number of occupied release sites at the AZ by AP frequency.

Schwann cells are exquisitely sensitive to the elasticity of their environment and their differentiation and capacity to myelinate depend on the transduction of mechanical stimuli by YAP and TAZ.  YAP/TAZ, in concert with other transcription factors, regulate several pathways including lipid and sterol biosynthesis as well as extracellular matrix receptor expression such as integrins and G-proteins.  Yet, the characterization of the signaling downstream YAP/TAZ in Schwann cells is incomplete.  Myelin sheath production by Schwann cell coincides with rapid up-regulation of numerous transcription factors. Here we show that ablation of YAP/TAZ alters the expression of transcription regulators known to regulate Schwann cell myelin gene transcription and differentiation.  Furthermore, we link YAP/TAZ to two DNA binding proteins, Cc2d1b and Purβ, which have no described roles in myelinating glial cells.  We demonstrate that silencing of either Cc2d1b or Purβ limits the formation of myelin segments.  These data provide a deeper insight into the myelin gene transcriptional network and the role of YAP/TAZ in myelinating glial cells.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00170">The Role of TRESK in Discrete Sensory Neuron Populations and Somatosensory Processing</a></h4>

Two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels generate K+ leak current, which serves a vital role in controlling and modulating neuronal excitability. This diverse family of K+ channels exhibit distinct expression and function across neuronal tissues. TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel (TRESK) is a K2P channel with a particularly enriched role in sensory neurons and in vivo pain pathways. Here, we explored the role of TRESK across molecularly distinct sensory neuron populations and assessed its contribution to different sensory modalities. We found TRESK mRNA only in select populations of C- and A-δ nociceptors, in addition to low threshold D-hair afferents. Neurons from mice in which TRESK has been ablated demonstrated marked hyperexcitability, which was amplified under inflammatory challenge. Detailed behavioural phenotyping of TRESK knockout mice revealed specific deficits in somatosensory processing of noxious and non-noxious stimuli. These results demonstrate novel roles of TRESK in somatosensory processing and offer important information to those wishing to target the channel for therapeutic means.

A growing body of evidence supports the close relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD), a severe psychiatric disease more common among women than men, and alterations of the immune/inflammatory system. However, despite the large number of studies aimed at understanding the molecular bases of this association, a lack of information exists on the potential crosstalk between systems known to be involved in depression and components of the inflammatory response, especially with respect to sex differences.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin with a well-established role in MDD etiopathology: it is altered in depressed patients as well as in animal models of the disease and its changes are restored by antidepressant drugs. Interestingly, this neurotrophin is also involved in the inflammatory response. Indeed, it can be secreted by microglia, the primary innate immune cells in the central nervous system whose functions may be in turn regulated by BDNF.
With these premises, in this study we investigated the reciprocal impact of BDNF and the immune system by evaluating the neuroinflammatory response in male and female BDNF-heterozygous mutant mice acutely treated with the cytokine-inducer lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Specifically, we assessed the potential insurgence of an LPS-induced sickness behavior as well as changes of inflammatory mediators in the mouse hippocampus and frontal cortex, with respect to both genotype and sex.
We found that the increased inflammatory response induced by LPS in the brain of male mice was independentby the genotype, whereas in the female it was restricted to the heterozygous mice with no changes in the wild-type group, suggestive of a role for BDNF in the sex-dependent effect of the inflammatory challenge.
Considering the involvement of both BDNF and neuroinflammation in several psychiatric diseases and the diverse incidence of such pathologies in males and females, a deeper investigation of the mechanisms underlying their interaction may have a critical translational relevance.

Neurodevelopmental disorders represent a challenging biological and medical problem due to their genetic and phenotypic complexity. In many cases, we lack the comprehensive understanding of disease mechanism necessary for targeted therapeutic development. One key component that could improve both mechanistic understanding and clinical trial design is reliable molecular biomarkers. Presently, no objective biological markers exist to evaluate most neurodevelopmental disorders.  Here we discuss how systems biology and 'omic' approaches could address the mechanistic and biomarker limitations in these afflictions. We present heuristic principles for testing the potential of systems biology to identify mechanisms and biomarkers of disease in the example of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a well-defined monogenic defect in MECP2. We propose that such an approach can not only aid in monitoring clinical disease severity, but can also provide a measure of target engagement in clinical trials. By deepening our understanding of the “big picture” of systems biology, this path could even help generate hypotheses for drug development programs, hopefully resulting in new treatments for these devastating conditions.

Sensory processing disorder (SPD), a developmental regulatory condition characterized by marked under- or over-responsivity to non-noxious sensory stimulation, is a common but poorly understood disorder that can profoundly affect mood, cognition, social behavior and adaptive life skills. Little is known about the etiology and neural underpinnings. Clinical research indicates that children with SPD show greater prevalence of difficulties in complex cognitive behavior including working memory, behavioral flexibility, and regulation of sensory and affective functions, which are related to prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatal, and midbrain regions. Neuroimaging may provide insight into mechanisms underlying SPD, and animal experiments provide important evidence that is not available in human studies. Rhesus monkeys (N = 73) were followed over a 20-year period from birth into old age. We focused on a single sensory modality, the tactile system, measured at 5-7 years, because of its critical importance for nourishment, attachment, and social reward in development. Positron emission tomography imaging was conducted at ages 12-18 years to quantify the availability of the D1 and D2 subtypes of the DA receptor (D1R and D2R), and the DA transporter (DAT). Heightened tactile responsivity was related to (a) elevated D1R in PFC overall, including lateral, ventrolateral, medial, anterior cingulate (aCg), frontopolar, and orbitofrontal (OFC) subregions, as well as nucleus accumbens (Acb), (b) reduced D2R in aCg, OFC, and substantia nigra / ventral tegmental area, and (c) elevated DAT in putamen. These findings suggest a mechanism by which DA pathways may be altered in SPD. These pathways are associated with reward processing and pain regulation, providing top-down regulation of sensory and affective processes. The balance between top-down cognitive control in the PFC-Acb pathway and bottom-up motivational function of the VTA-Acb-PFC pathway is critical for successful adaptive function. An imbalance in these two systems might explain DA-related symptoms in children with SPD, including reduced top-down regulatory function and exaggerated responsivity to stimuli. These results provide more direct evidence that SPD may involve altered DA receptor and transporter function in PFC, striatal, and midbrain regions. More work is needed to extend these results to humans.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00028">The Lateralization of Speech-Brain Coupling Is Differentially Modulated by Intrinsic Auditory and Top-Down Mechanisms</a></h4>

The lateralization of neuronal processing underpinning hearing, speech, language, and music is widely studied, vigorously debated, and still not understood in a satisfactory manner. One set of hypotheses focuses on the temporal structure of perceptual experience and links auditory cortex asymmetries to underlying differences in neural populations with differential temporal sensitivity (e.g. ideas advanced by Zatorre et al. 20021; Poeppel 20032). The Asymmetric Sampling in Time theory (AST; Poeppel 20032), builds on cytoarchitectonic differences between auditory cortices and predicts that modulation frequencies within the range of, roughly, the syllable rate, are more accurately tracked by the right hemisphere. To date, this conjecture is reasonably well supported, since - while there is some heterogeneity in the reported findings - the predicted asymmetrical entrainment has been observed in various experimental protocols. Here, we show that under specific processing demands, the rightward dominance disappears. We propose an enriched and modified version of the asymmetric sampling hypothesis in the context of speech. Recent work (Rimmele et al. 20183) proposes two different mechanisms to underlie the auditory tracking of the speech envelope: one derived from the intrinsic oscillatory properties of auditory regions; the other induced by top-down signals coming from other non-auditory regions of the brain. We propose that under non-speech listening conditions, the intrinsic auditory mechanism dominates and thus, in line with AST, entrainment is rightward lateralized, as is widely observed. However, (i) depending on individual brain structural/functional differences, and/or (ii) in the context of specific speech listening conditions, the relative weight of the top-down mechanism can increase. In this scenario, the typically observed auditory sampling asymmetry (and its rightward dominance) diminishes or vanishes.

Background: Multi-site MRI studies are often necessary for recruiting sufficiently-sized samples when studying rare conditions. However, they require pooling data from multiple scanners into a single data set, and therefore it is critical to evaluate the variability of quantitative MRI measures within and across scanners used in multi-site studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of structural and diffusion weighted MRI measurements acquired on seven scanners at five medical centers as part of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN) multisite study. 

Methods: The American College of Radiology phantom was imaged monthly to measure reproducibility of signal intensity and uniformity within and across seven 3T scanners from General Electric, Philips, and Siemens vendors. One healthy adult male volunteer was imaged repeatedly on all seven scanners under the TACERN structural and diffusion weighted protocol (5 b=0 s/mm2 and 30 b=1000 s/mm2) over a period of 5 years (age 22-27 years). Reproducibility of inter- and intra-scanner brain segmentation volumes and diffusion tensor imaging metrics fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) within white matter regions was quantified with coefficient of variation.  

Results: ACR Phantom signal intensity and uniformity were similar across scanners and changed little over time, with a mean intra-scanner coefficient of variation of 3.6% and 1.8%, respectively. The mean inter- and intra-scanner coefficients of variation of brain structure volumes derived from T1-weighted images of the human phantom were 3.3% and 1.1%, respectively. The mean inter- and intra-scanner coefficients of variation of FA in white matter regions were 4.5% and 2.5%, while the mean inter- and intra-scanner coefficients of variation of MD in white matter regions were 5.4% and 1.5%. 

Conclusions: Our results suggest that volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging measurements are highly reproducible between and within scanners and provide typical variation amplitudes that can be used as references to interpret future findings in the TACERN network.

Erythropoietin (EPO) not only is a hormone that promotes erythropoiesis but also has a neuroprotective effect on hypoxic neurons related with their known antiapoptotic action. In a focal brain-hypoxia model, our group have previously demonstrated that recombinant-human EPO (rHu-Epo) can protect neurons with a Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) expression of EPO-receptor (EPO-R) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). We and others also have reported that repetitive seizures can mimic a hypoxic-like condition by HIF-1nuclear translocationand high neuronal expression P-gp. Here, we document not only that excitotoxic stress can also induce the expression of EPO-R, but rHu-EPO can reverse the P-gp transport activity under the mentioned hypoxic-like conditions. A single status epilepticus (SE) of twenty minutes was induced in adult rats using the lithium-pilocarpine model. In vitro, primary cultures of neurons were briefly exposed to an excitotoxic concentration of glutamate (300 µM), while cultured astroglial-cells were treated for 6h with 0.3 mM of CoCl2, and later, the inhibitory effect of increased concentrations of rHu-Epo on Rhodamine 123 (Rho-123) P-gp dependent efflux was assayed. The specific P-gp blocker Tariquidar (1 µM) or saline, were used as positive or negative inhibitory controls respectively. SE promoted high co-expression of P-gp and EPO-R in cortical neurons and astrocytes. In vitro, neurons treated with glutamic acid exhibited nuclear translocation of HIF-1 and NFB and high overexpression P-gp and EPO-R. In cultured astroglial-cells treated with CoCl2, rHu-Epo recovered significantly the Rho-123 retention in a similar way of tariquidar. Our results confirm that convulsive stress promotes nuclear translocations of HIF- and NFkB transcription factors with a concomitant induction of neuronal expression of P-gp and EPO-R, suggesting that convulsive stress could mimic a hypoxic condition without oxygen deprivation. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that rHu-Epo can inhibit the Rho-123 efflux activity. All these data suggest that EPO/EPO-R system stimulation could play a central role not only in brain cell protection after different stress signals, but also it could reverse the pharmacoresistant phenotype in refractory epilepsy as well as in other pharmacoresistant hypoxic brain diseases simultaneously expressing EPO-R and P-gp.

Synaptic modification in cortical structures underlies the acquisition of novel information that results in learning and memory formation.  In the adult dentate gyrus, circuit remodeling is boosted by the generation of new granule cells (GCs) that contribute to specific aspects of memory encoding. These forms of plasticity decrease in the aging brain, where both the rate of adult neurogenesis and the speed of morphological maturation of newly-generated neurons decline. In the young-adult brain, a brief novel experience accelerates the integration of new neurons. The extent to which such degree of plasticity is preserved in the aging hippocampus remains unclear. In this work, we characterized the time course of functional integration of adult-born GCs in middle-aged mice. We performed whole-cell recordings in developing GCs from Ascl1CreERT2;CAGfloxStopTom mice and found a late onset of functional excitatory synaptogenesis, which occurred at 4 weeks (vs. 2 weeks in young-adult mice). Overall mature excitability and maximal glutamatergic connectivity were achieved at 10 weeks. In contrast, large mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) in CA3 displayed mature morphological features including filopodial extensions at 4 weeks, suggesting that efferent connectivity develops faster than afference. Notably, new GCs from aging mice exposed to enriched environment for 7 days showed an advanced degree of maturity at 3 weeks, revealed by the high frequency of excitatory postsynaptic responses, complex dendritic trees, and large size of MFBs with filopodial extensions. These findings demonstrate that adult-born neurons act as sensors that transduce behavioral stimuli into major network remodeling in the aging brain.

Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder and characterized by recurrent and unprovoked seizures. A critical pathological factor in the seizure genesis is neuronal loss. Until now, apart from the known regulatory cell death pathways, the newest one is ferroptosis, a newly discovered type of cell death with the features of iron accumulation and excessive production of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). In our present work, it was illustrated that ferroptosis occurred in murine models of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling and pilocarpine (Pilo)-induced seizures. In both of these two seizure models, treatment with ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) efficiently alleviated seizures. This was through elevated levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and glutathione (GSH) as well as inhibitions of lipid degradation product including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malonaldehyde (MDA), iron accumulation and PTGS2 mRNA in hippocampus. It is concluded that ferroptosis is involved in the seizure genesis in PTZ- and Pilo-treated mice, and suppression of ferroptosis mitigates PTZ kindling and Pilo-induced seizures in mice.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00247">Cathodal Occipital tDCS Is Unable to Modulate the Sound Induced Flash Illusion in Migraine</a></h4>

Migraine is a highly disabling disease characterized by recurrent pain.Despite an intensive effort, mechanisms of migraine pathophysiology,  still represent an unsolved issue. Evidences from both animals and humans studies suggest that migraine is characterized by hyperresponsivity or hyperexcitability of sensory cortices, especially the visual cortex. This phenomenon, in turn, may affect multisensory processing. Indeed, migraineurs present with an abnormal, reduced, perception of the Sound-induced Flash Illusion (SiFI), a crossmodal illusion that relies on optimal integration of visual and auditory stimuli by the occipital visual cortex. Decreasing visual cortical excitability with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can increase the SiFI in healthy subjects.
Moving from these issues , we applied cathodal tDCS over the visual cortex of migraineurs, with and without aura, in order to decrease cortical excitability and thus physiologically restoring the perception of a reliable SiFI. Differently from our expectations tDCS was unable to reliably modulate SiFI in migraine. The chronic, relatively excessive, visual cortex hyperexcitability, , featuring the migraineur brain, may render tDCS ineffective for restoring multisensory processing in this disease.

Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a neuropsychiatric affective disorder that can develop after traumatic life-events. Exposure-based therapy is currently one of the most effective treatments for PTSD. However, exposure to traumatic stimuli is so aversive that a significant number of patients drop-out of therapy during the course of treatment. Among various attempts to develop novel therapies that bypass such aversiveness, neurofeedback appears promising. With neurofeedback, patients can unconsciously self-regulate brain activity via real-time monitoring and feedback of the EEG or fMRI signals. With conventional neurofeedback methods, however, it is difficult to induce neural representation related to specific trauma because the feedback is based on the neural signals averaged within specific brain areas. To overcome this difficulty, novel neurofeedback approaches such as Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) might prove helpful. Instead of the average BOLD signals, DecNef allows patients to implicitly regulate multivariate voxel patterns of the BOLD signals related with feared stimuli.  Here, we review recent advances in application of neurofeedback to PTSD treatments, including the DecNef. This review is intended to be informative for neuroscientists in general as well as practitioners planning to use neurofeedback as a therapeutic strategy for PTSD. 
Methods:  Follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted to compare DecNef effect with those of conventional EEG/fMRI-based neurofeedback on PTSD amelioration. To elucidate the possible mechanisms of DecNef on fear reduction, we mathematically modeled the effects of exposure-based and counter conditioning separately and applied it to the data obtained from past DecNef studies. Finally, we conducted DecNef on four PTSD patients.
Results: Our mathematical model suggested that exposure is the key component for DecNef effects in the past studies. Following DecNef a significant reduction of PTSD severity was observed. This effect was comparable to those reported for conventional neurofeedback approach. 
Conclusions: Although a much larger number of participants will be needed in future, DecNef could be a promising therapy that bypasses the unpleasantness of conscious exposure associated with conventional therapies for fear related disorders, including PTSD.

HIV-1 associated neuropathy is the most common neurological complication of HIV, with debilitating pain affecting the quality of life. HIV-1 gp120 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV neuropathy via direct neurotoxic effects or indirect pro-inflammatory responses. Studies have shown that gp120-induced release of mediators from Schwann cell induce CCR5-dependent DRG neurotoxicity; However, CCR5 antagonists failed to improve pain in HIV infected individual. Thus, there is an urgent need for better understanding its pathogenesis and developing effective therapeutic strategies. Because lysosomal exocytosis in Schwann cells is an indispensable process for regulating myelination and demyelination, we determined the extent to which gp120 affected lysosomal exocytosis in human Schwann cells. We demonstrated that gp120 promoted the movement of lysosomes towards plasma membrane, induced lysosomal exocytosis, and increased the release of ATP into the extracellular media. Mechanistically, we demonstrated lysosome de-acidification, and activation of P2X4 and VNUT to underlie gp120-induced lysosome exocytosis. Functionally, we demonstrated that gp120-induced lysosome exocytosis and release of ATP from Schwann cell lead to increase in intracellular calcium and generation of cytosolic reactive oxygen species in DRG neurons. Our results suggest that gp120-induced lysosome exocytosis and the release of ATP from Schwann cells affect DRG neurons function and contribute to pathogenesis of HIV-1 associated neuropathy.

Alzheimer ’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, which is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. Neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss are the major neuropathological hallmarks in AD brains. TMP21 is a key molecule for protein trafficking in cells. Growing evidence indicated indicates that TMP21 is dysregulated in AD, which plays a pivotal role in neuritic plaque formation. Therefore, we aim to review the dysregulation of TMP21 in AD, the role of TMP21 in neuritic plaque formation and underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the potential role of TMP21 in neurofibrillary tangle formation, synaptic impairment and neuronal loss is discussed. It will provide an outlook into the potential of regulating TMP21 as a therapeutic approach for AD treatment.

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by a clinical triad of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein. Homozygosity for the HD-causing mutation is extremely rare; thus, the majority of HD patients express the mutant huntingtin protein in addition to reduced levels of the non-pathogenic huntingtin protein. Deficits in synaptic plasticity, including hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), have been identified in various mouse models of HD and are thought to contribute to the debilitating cognitive symptoms associated with the disease. However, the bulk of these studies used N-terminal fragment or homozygous knock-in mouse models of HD at symptomatic ages, and our understanding of the onset and progression of synaptic plasticity deficits in the HD brain is lacking. To better understand the time-course of synaptic plasticity deficits in HD, as well as the impact of heterozygous and homozygous huntingtin mutations, we quantified basal synaptic connectivity, presynaptic release probability, presynaptically-mediated post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) and postsynaptically-mediated LTP at presymptomatic, early symptomatic and late symptomatic ages in heterozygous and homozygous Q175FDN knock-in HD mice. Our results demonstrate clear age-dependent effects of the HD-causing mutation on both short and long-term plasticity that generally emerge earlier in homozygous mice. Interestingly, deficits in presynaptic short-term plasticity were more closely linked to disease progression than deficits in postsynaptic long-term potentiation, and heterozygous mice were more susceptible to an LTP deficit when induced by high frequency stimulation compared to theta burst stimulation. To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the most thorough characterization to date of the onset and progression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits in a mouse model of HD, and should prove valuable to future studies exploring cellular mechanisms underlying the debilitating cognitive decline in HD.

Proper axonal growth and guidance is essential for neuron differentiation and development.  Abnormal neuronal development due to genetic or epigenetic influences can contribute to neurological and mental disorders such as Down syndrome, Rett syndrome and autism. Identification of the molecular targets that promote proper neuronal growth and differentiation may restore structural and functional neuroplasticity and thus improve functional performance in neurodevelopmental disorders. Using differentiated human neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the present study demonstrated that, in early stages differentiation of human NPCs, neuron-targeted overexpression constitutively active Rac1 (Rac1CA) and constitutively active Cdc42 (Cdc42CA) enhance expression of P-Cav-1, T-Cav-1 and P-cofilin and increases axonal growth. Similarly, neuron-targeted over-expression of Cav-1 (termed SynCav1) also increases axonal development by increased axon length and volume. Moreover, inhibition of Cav-1(Y14A) phosphorylation blunts Rac1/Cdc42-mediated axonal growth and differentiation of human NPCs, and SynCav1(Y14A)-treated NPCs exhibited blunted axonal growth. These results suggest that: 1) P-Cav-1 is necessary for proper axonal growth during early stages of neuronal differentiation, 2) SynCav1-mediated axonal growth is dependent upon Cav-1 phosphorylation, 3) Rac1/Cdc42CA-mediated neuronal growth may in part be dependent upon P-Cav-1.  In conclusion, Cav-1 phosphorylation is essential for axonal growth during early stage of human neuronal differentiation.

Background/Aims: 
Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is induced by chronic deficit of brain perfusion, contributes to a persistent or progressive cognitive dysfunction, which is characterized by diverse neuropathological manifestations. There are currently no effective medications available. White matter damage (WMD) and cortical neuron death may be caused by CCH, which are related to cognitive impairment, while the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the study, a database of the transcriptome level was built to determine potential biomarkers in cortex of CCH.
Methods: CCH was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by permanent occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries. Rats were randomly divided into three groups: Sham-operated group (n=24), the 4th and 8th week of CCH groups (total=56, n=28 for each group). Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris water maze task. WMD and neuron damage were detected using diffusion tensor imaging and histological analysis, respectively. Western blotting analysis of various markers was used to examine neuronal death. Whole-transcriptome microarray was performed to assess mRNA, circRNA, and lncRNA expression profiles at 4th and 8th weeks after CCH. Diversified bioinformatic tools were performed to analyse and predict the key biological processes and signaling pathways of differentially expressed RNAs and co-expressed potential target genes. Co-expression networks of mRNA-circRNA-miRNA and lncRNA-mRNA were constructed.
Results: Compared to the sham group, cognitive impairment, disintegration of white matter, blood-brain barrier damage and neuron death were induced by CCH. Neuron death including apoptosis and necroptosis might occur in the cortex of CCH. We constructed the regulatory networks of whole-transcriptomic including differentially expressed mRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs, and related biological functions and pathways involved in neurological disease, cell death and survival, energy and metabolism, et al. Our results also indicated that Cyr61 mRNA may play a role in the CCH-related cortical neuronal death. 
Conclusion: WMD and cortical neuronal death are worthy of attention in the pathogenesis of CCH. Additionally, the present results provide potential evidence at the whole-transcription level for CCH, offering candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

The anatomical organization of distinct regions in the insect brain often reflects their functions. In the present study, the brain structure of A. lucorum was examined by using immunolabeling and three-dimensional reconstruction. The results revealed the location and volume of prominent neuropils, such as the antennal lobes, optic lobes, anterior optic tubercles, central body, lateral accessory lobes, mushroom lobes, and distinct tritocerebral neuropils. As expected, this brain is similar to that of other insects. One exception, however, is that the antennal lobes were found to be the most prominent neuropils. Their size relative to the entire brain is the largest among all insect species studied so far. In contrast, the calyx, a region getting direct input from the antennal lobe, has a smaller size relative to the brain than that of other species. These findings may suggest that olfaction plays an essential role for A. lucorum.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00183">Age Differences in Encoding-Related Alpha Power Reflect Sentence Comprehension Difficulties</a></h4>

When sentence processing taxes verbal working memory, comprehension difficulties arise. This is specifically the case when processing resources decline with advancing adult age. Such decline likely affects the encoding of sentences into working memory, which constitutes the basis for successful comprehension. To assess age differences in encoding-related electrophysiological activity, we recorded the electroencephalogram from three age groups (24, 43, 65 years). Using an auditory sentence comprehension task, age differences in encoding-related oscillatory power were examined with respect to the accuracy of the given response. That is, the difference in oscillatory power between correctly and incorrectly encoded sentences, yielding subsequent memory effects (SME), was compared across age groups. Across age groups, we observed an age-related SME inversion in the alpha band from a power decrease in younger adults to a power increase in older adults. We suggest that this SME inversion underlies age-related comprehension difficulties. With alpha being commonly linked to inhibitory processes, this shift may reflect a change in the cortical inhibition–disinhibition balance. A cortical disinhibition may imply enriched sentence encoding in younger adults. In contrast, resource limitations in older adults may necessitate an increase in cortical inhibition during sentence encoding to avoid an information overload. Overall, our findings tentatively suggest that age-related comprehension difficulties are associated with alterations to the electrophysiological dynamics subserving general higher cognitive functions.

Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is a significant complication of surgery in elderly patients. Emerging researches showed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of POCD. Here we aimed to identify potential key lncRNAs involved in the development of POCD. LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in hippocampal tissues from POCD and control mice were analyzed by microarray assay. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to probe the functions of dysregulated genes. Then, important factors of the mainly affected biological processes were measured in the hippocampus. Correlated coding-noncoding co-expression (CNC) networks were constructed. Finally, the potential key pairs of lncRNA and target mRNA implicated in POCD were probed. Our results showed that a total of 868 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 690 expressed mRNAs were identified. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways. Surgery-induced inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis were significantly increased in hippocampal tissues of aged mice. In CNC network analysis, we found that LncRNA uc009qbj.1 was negatively correlated with apoptosis-associated gene Vrk2 level. LncRNA ENSMUST00000174338 correlated positively with expression of the inflammation and apoptosis-associated gene Smad7. LncRNA NONMMUT00000123687 mediated gene expression by binding the inflammation-regulated transcription factor Meis2. Our results suggested that these potential key lncRNAs and mRNAs may play a vital role in the development of POCD through mediating neuronal inflammation or apoptosis.

It has been demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) can regulate the transcription of its target gene, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) , and thus enhance the expression of the IDE protein. The protein can degrade β amyloid (Aβ), a core pathological product of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). PPARγ can also regulate the transcription of other target gene, β-amyloid cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), and thus inhibit the expression of the BACE1 protein. BACE1 can hydrolyze amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor of Aβ. In adipose tissue, PPARγ agonists can inhibit the phosphorylation of PPARγ by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which in turn affects the expression of target genes regulated by PPARγ. PPARγ agonists may also exert inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of PPARγ in the brain, thereby affecting the expression of the aforementioned PPARγ target genes and reducing Aβ levels. The present study confirmed this hypothesis by showing that PPARγ agonist pioglitazone attenuated the neuronal apoptosis of primary rat hippocampal neurons induced by Aβ1-42, downregulated CDK5 expression, weakened the binding of CDK5 to PPARγ, reduced PPARγ phosphorylation, increased the expression of PPARγ and IDE, decreased the expression of BACE1, reduced APP production, and downregulated intraneuronal Aβ1-42 levels. These effects were inhibited by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. After CDK5 silencing with CDK5 shRNA, the above effect of pioglitazone was not observed, except when upregulating the expression of PPARγ in Aβ1-42 treated neurons. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that pioglitazone could inhibit the phosphorylation of PPARγ in vitro by inhibiting CDK5 expression, which in turn affected the expression of PPARγ target genes Ide and Bace1, thereby promoting Aβ degradation and reducing Aβ production. This reduced Aβ levels in the brain, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects in an AD model.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which afflicts an estimated 20 million people worldwide, is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and constitutes the fourth leading cause of death in the developed world. The major neuropathological features of AD are synaptic and neuronal degeneration and the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The main protein component of the amyloid plaques is the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ). Accumulation of Aβ in the brain of AD patients is thought to be central in the pathogenesis of AD. During the last decade, it has become been clear that the synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration underlying early cognitive impairments are caused by small aggregates termed Aβ oligomers.
The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a layer of tightly packed cells that normally regulates the entry of substances into the brain, whiles maintains the removal of toxic molecules from brain to blood. Alzheimer ́s patients and research models evidence BBB impairment and dysfunction accompanying AD. It is not clearly understood if Aβ clearance through the BBB is affected in AD and whether this dynamic is affected by an impaired peripheral clearance due to other non-neurological pathological conditions. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a spectrum of liver disorders characterized by accumulation of fat in the liver accompanied by varying degrees of inflammation and hepatocyte injury. In the last decade, NAFLD has been the focus of intense research due of its pandemic reach (estimated prevalence between 20 and 30% of the general population). This review summarizes the current state of the literature linking NAFLD and Alzheimer ́s disease, highlighting the role of the major Aβ efflux and clearance player - the LRP1 receptor- which is abundantly expressed in liver, brain, and vasculatures.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00173">Incidental Learning: A Systematic Review of Its Effect on Episodic Memory Performance in Older Age</a></h4>

Episodic memory is the capacity to encode, store, and retrieve information of specific past events. Several studies have shown that decline in episodic memory accompanies aging, but most of these studies assessed memory performance through intentional learning. In this approach, the individuals deliberately acquire knowledge. Yet, another method to evaluate episodic memory performance - receiving less attention by the research community - is incidental learning. Here, participants do not explicitly intent to learn. Incidental learning becomes increasingly important over the lifespan, since people spent less time in institutions where intentional learning is required (e.g., school, university, or at work). Yet, we know little how incidental learning impacts episodic memory performance in advanced age. Likewise, the neural mechanisms underlying incidental learning in older age remain largely unknown. 
Thus, the immediate goal of this review was to summarize the existing literature on how incidental learning changes with age and how neural mechanisms map onto these age-related changes. We considered behavioural as well as neuroimaging studies using incidental learning paradigms (alone or in combination with intentional learning) to assess episodic memory performance in elderly adults. We conducted a systematic literature search on the Medline/PubMed, Cochrane and OVID SP databases and searched the reference lists of articles. The search yielded 238 studies, of which 27 concerned incidental learning and episodic memory in older adults.
In sum, these studies suggest that aging particularly affects episodic memory after incidental learning for cognitively demanding tasks. Monitoring deficits in older adults might account for these findings since cognitively demanding tasks need increased attentional resources. On a neuronal level, dysregulation of the default-mode-network mirrors monitoring deficits, with an attempt to compensate through increased frontal activity. Future (neuroimaging) studies should systematically evaluate retrieval tasks with diverging cognitive load and consider the influence of attention and executive functions in more detail.

To effectively promote life-long health and resilience against — for example — neurodegenerative diseases, evidence-based recommendations must acknowledge the complex multidimensionality not only of the diseases but also of personal lifestyle. In a straightforward descriptive and heuristic framework, 50+ potential lifestyle factors cluster around diet (D), education (E), exercise (E) and purpose (P), unveiling their many relationships across domains and scales. The resulting systematics and its visualization might be a small but helpful step towards the development of more comprehensive, interdisciplinary models of lifestyle-dependent risk and resilience and a means to explain the opportunities and limitations of preventive measures to the public and other stakeholders. Most importantly, this perspective onto the subject implies that not all lifestyle factors are created equal but that there is a hierarchy of values and needs that influences the success of life-style based interventions.

There are inherent trade-offs between the flexibility and the capacity of working memory, or the ability to temporarily hold information “in mind.” In a recent issue of Neuron, Bouchacourt and Buschman (2019) present a new model of working memory that demonstrates how coordinated activity between specialized sensory networks and flexible higher-order networks may support these competing constraints.

Neuronal populations respond within a small number of relevant dimensions. New research by Trautmann et al. (2019) shows that spike sorting is not necessary to extract the important features of this low-dimensional population signal. Combined responses of multiple neurons (multiunit activity) only generate small changes in the extracted signals.

POm-mediated plasticity may be critical for coordinating learning-related sensorimotor circuitry.

They advocate for adopting tasks with greater behavioral richness that evoke diverse neuronal correlates, with manipulations tailored to these specific activity patterns.

The promises of nanomedicine are extensive. Graphene, the first true two-dimensional material to exist in isolation, is the type of new nanomaterial that results in interest for novel biomedical applications. From Michael Chrichton’s tragic protagonist in The Terminal Man to the recent growth in start-up companies seeking to transfer consciousness, the fictive present and future call to mind visions of devices that enable neural interfacing and control. Although these ideas may create questions as to ethics for neuroscience in the future, the current state-of-the-art for implanted devices is far more limited in scope. Progress in brain-computer interfaces holds great promise for patients following stroke (Ramos-Murguialday, Broetz et al. 2013), to control prosthetic limbs (Hochberg, Serruya et al. 2006, Donoghue, Nurmikko et al. 2007) , with the motor degeneration characteristic of Parkinson’s disease (Little, Pogosyan et al. 2013), and for a variety of other disorders and diseases (Chaudhary, Birbaumer et al. 2016). Graphene may be poised for incorporation into such devices. As the presence of graphene becomes more widespread and commonplace across the biomedical sciences, the relatively larger body of work detailing the biological effects of carbon nanotubes may serve as a template guiding the utility of graphene for biological applications (Kostarelos, Bianco et al. 2009). 
Graphene-based materials for interfacing with the peripheral nervous system have been reviewed elsewhere (Domínguez-Bajo, González-Mayorga et al. 2017). We instead focus on new directions for application to the central nervous system. This review is limited to preclinical applications, although graphene and graphene-based devices may someday advance to clinical implementation.  We begin with an overview of graphene manufacturing advances, applications to hybrid materials systems as well as drug delivery strategies. This is followed by an overview of work performed with non-murine models.  Finally, the interaction of graphene with murine neural systems, both in vivo and in-vitro is examined.  Despite a sizable body of work, to date there remain many unresolved questions as to cytotoxicity and the mechanisms underlying the graphene-cellular interaction that must be addressed moving forward.

In today’s society it becomes increasingly important to assess which non-human and non-verbal beings possess consciousness. This review aims to delineate criteria for consciousness especially in animals, while also taking into account intelligent artifacts. First, we circumscribe what we mean with “consciousness” and describe key features of subjective experience: qualitative richness, situatedness, intentionality and interpretation, integration and the combination of dynamic and stabilizing properties. We argue that consciousness has a biological function, which is to present the subject with a multimodal, situational survey of the surrounding world and body, subserving complex decision-making and goal-directed behavior. This survey reflects the brain’s capacity for internal modelling of external events underlying changes in sensory state. Next, we follow an inside-out approach: how can the features of conscious experience, correlating to mechanisms inside the brain, be logically coupled to externally observable (‘outside’) properties? Instead of proposing criteria that would each define a “hard” threshold for consciousness, we outline six indicators: (i) goal-directed behavior and model-based learning, (ii) anatomic and physiological substrates for generating integrative multimodal representations, (iii) psychometrics and meta-cognition, (iv) episodic memory, (v) susceptibility to illusions and multistable perception, and (vi) specific visuospatial behaviors. Rather than emphasizing a particular indicator as being decisive, we propose that the consistency amongst these indicators can serve to assess consciousness in particular species. The integration of scores on the various indicators yields an overall, graded criterion for consciousness, somewhat comparable to the Glasgow Coma Scale for unresponsive patients. When considering theoretically derived measures of consciousness, it is argued that their validity should not be assessed on the basis of a single quantifiable measure, but requires cross-examination across multiple pieces of evidence, including the indicators proposed here. Current intelligent machines, including deep learning neural networks and agile robots, are not indicated to be conscious yet. Instead of assessing machine consciousness by a brief Turing-type of test, evidence for it may gradually accumulate when we study machines ethologically and across time, considering multiple behaviors that require flexibility, improvisation, spontaneous problem-solving and the situational conspectus typically associated with conscious experience.

Maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in lymphatic fluids is necessary for proper hearing. Despite its significance, the mechanisms that maintain the cochlear lymphatic Ca2+ concentrations within a certain range are not fully clarified. We investigated the functional expression of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), which plays a pivotal role in sensing extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Western blotting for CaSR revealed an approximately 130-kDa protein expression in cochlear tissue extracts and immunohistochemical analysis revealed its expression specifically in type I fibrocytes in the spiral ligament, fibrocytes in the supralimbal and limbal regions, the epithelium of the osseous spiral lamina, and the smooth muscle cells of the spiral modiolar arteries. Ca2+ imaging demonstrated that extracellular Ca2+ increased the levels of intracellular Ca2+ in CaSR-expressing fibrocytes in the spiral ligament, and that this was suppressed by the CaSR inhibitor, NPS2143. Furthermore, hearing thresholds were moderately elevated by intracochlear application of the CaSR inhibitors NPS2143 and calhex231, across a range of frequencies (8-32 kHz). These results demonstrate the functional expression of CaSR in the cochlear perilymphatic compartment. In addition, the elevated hearing thresholds that are achieved by inhibiting CaSR suggest this is a required mechanism for normal hearing, presumably by sensing perilymphatic Ca2+ to stabilize Ca2+ concentrations within a certain range. These results provide novel insight into the mechanisms regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in the cochlea and provide a new perspective on cochlear physiology.

The remarkable physiology of the electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) made it one of the first model species in science.  It was pivotal for understanding animal electricity in the 1700’s, was investigated by Humboldt and Faraday in the 1800’s, was leveraged to isolate the acetylcholine receptor in the 20th century, and has inspired the design of new power sources and provided insights to electric organ evolution in the 21st century.  And yet few studies have investigated the electric eel’s behavior.  This review focuses on a series of recently discovered behaviors that evolved alongside the eel’s extreme physiology.  Eels use their high-voltage electric discharge to remotely control prey by transcutaneously activating motor neurons.  Hunting eels use this behavior in two different ways. When prey have been detected, eels use high-voltage to cause immobility by inducing sustained, involuntary muscle contractions.  On the other hand, when prey are hidden, eels often use brief pulses to induce prey twitch, which causes a water movement detected by the eel’s mechanoreceptors.  Once grasped in the eel’s jaws, difficult prey are often subdued by sandwiching them between the two poles (head and tail) of the eel’s powerful electric organ.  The resulting concentration of the high-voltage discharge, delivered at high-rates, causes involuntary fatigue in prey muscles. This novel strategy for inactivating muscles is functionally analogous to poisoning the neuromuscular junction with venom.  For self-defense, electric eels leap from the water to directly electrify threats, efficiently activating nociceptors to deter their target.  The latter behavior supports a legendary account by Alexander von Humboldt who described a battle between electric eels and horses in 1800.  Finally, electric eels use high-voltage not only as a weapon, but also to efficiently track fast moving prey with active electroreception.  In conclusion, remarkable behaviors go hand in hand with remarkable physiology.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00734">Biological Assessment of a 18F-Labeled Sulforhodamine 101 in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease as a Potential Astrocytosis Marker</a></h4>

Neurodegenerative diseases have mainly been associated with neuronal death. Recent investigations have shown that astroglia may modulate neuroinflammation in the early and late stages of the disease. [11C]Deuterodeprenyl ([11C]DED) is a tracer that has been used for reactive astrocyte detection in Alzheimer’s disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, among others, with some limitations. To develop a new radiotracer for detecting astrocytosis and overcoming associated difficulties, we recently reported the synthesis of a sulfonamide derivative of Sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), labelled with 18F, namely SR101 N-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl) sulfonamide ([18F]2B-SRF101). The red fluorescent dye SR101 has been used as a specific marker of astroglia in the neocortex of rodents using in vivo models. In the present work we performed a biological characterisation of the new tracer including biodistribution and micro-PET/computed tomography (CT) images. PET/CT studies with [11C]DED were also done to compare with [18F]2B-SRF101 in order to assess its potential as an astrocyte marker.
Biodistribution studies with [18F]2B-SRF101 were carried out in C57BL6J black and transgenic (3xTg) mice. A hepatointestinal metabolization as well as the pharmacokinetic profile were determined, showing appropriate characteristics to become a PET diagnostic agent.  Dynamic PET/CT studies were carried out with [18F]2B-SRF101 and [11C]DED to evaluate the distribution of both tracers in the brain. 

A significant difference in [18F]2B-SRF101 uptake was especially observed in the cortex and hippocampus, and it was higher in 3xTg mice than it was in the control group. These results suggested that [18F]2B-SRF101 is a promising candidate for more extensive evaluation as an astrocyte tracer. 

The difference observed for [18F]2B-SRF101 was not found in the case of [11C]DED. The comparative studies between [18F]2B-SRF101 and [11C]DED suggest that both tracers have different roles as astrocytosis markers in this animal model, and could provide different and complementary information at the same time. In this way, by means of a multitracer approach, useful information could be obtained for the staging of the disease.

Background and purpose: Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated T2D-related brain structural and functional changes that are partly associated with cognitive decline. However, less is known about the underlying mechanisms. Chronic hyperglycemia and microvascular complications are the two of most important risk factors related to cognitive decline in diabetes. Cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), such as those defined by lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and microhemorrhages, are also associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. In this study, we examined brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in patients in the early stages of T2D without CSVDs to focus on glucose metabolism factors and avoid the interference of vascular risk factors on T2D-related brain damage.
Methods: T2D patients with disease durations of less than five years and without any signs of CSVDs (n＝34) were compared with healthy control subjects (n＝24). Whole-brain region-based functional connectivity was analyzed with network-based statistics (NBS), and brain surface morphology was examined. In addition, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was conducted for all subjects.
Results: At the whole-brain region-based functional connectivity level, thirty-three functional connectivities were changed in T2D patients relative to those in controls, mostly manifested as hyperconnectivities and mainly located between the sensory-motor network and auditory network. Some of the connectivities were positively correlated with blood glucose level, insulin resistance, and MoCA scores in the T2D group. The network-level analysis also showed between-network hyperconnectivity in T2D patients but no significant changes in within-network connectivity. In addition, there were no significant differences in MoCA scores or brain morphology measures, including cortical thickness, surface area, mean curvature, and gray/white matter volume, between the two groups.
Conclusion: The findings indicate that brain hyperconnectivity occurs in the early stages of T2D without CSVDs before the presence of significant brain morphology change and cognitive decline, which may be a neuroimaging basis for predicting cognitive decline in early T2D patients.

As the third cause of death and cognitive decline in industrialized countries, stroke is a major burden for society. Vascular risks factors such as hypertension and diabetes are involved in most stroke patients, aggravate stroke severity, but are still poorly taken into account in preclinical studies. Microangiopathy and sustained inflammation are exacerbated, likely explaining the severity of stroke in those patients. We sought to demonstrate that intravenous administration of human adipose derived-mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSC) that have immunomodulatory properties, could accelerate sensorimotor recovery, prevent long-term spatial memory and promote neurogenesis, in diabetic or hypertensive mice subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). Diabetic (streptozotocin IP) or hypertensive (L-NAME per os) male C57Bl6 mice subjected to pMCAo, were treated by hADMSC (500,000 cells IV) 2 days post stroke. Infarct volume, neurogenesis microglial/macrophage density, T-lymphocytes density, astrocytes density and vessel density were monitored 7 days after cells injection and at 6 weeks. Neurological sensorimotor deficit and spatial memory were assessed until six weeks post stroke. Whatever the vascular risk factor, hADMSC showed no effect on functional recovery/cognitive decline prevention at short or long-term assessment, nor significantly modified neurogenesis microglial/macrophage, T-lymphocytes, astrocytes and vessel density. This work is part of a European program (H2020, RESSTORE). We discuss the discrepancy of our results with those obtained in rats and the importance of timing, source and type of cells according to the species that is considered. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms preventing recovery should help for successful clinical translation but first could allow identifying good and bad responders to cell therapy in stroke.

Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Increasing evidence suggest that inflammatory cytokines are important mediators for the onset and progression of GBS. A number of clinical studies have demonstrated elevated levels of Th1, Th2 and Th17 related cytokines in the patients with GBS, but results were inconsistent across studies.  Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood inflammatory cytokine levels between the patients with GBS and healthy individuals. The database search identified 30 studies encompassing 1302 GBS patients and 1073 controls to be included. The random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that blood tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (Hedges g,1.544; 95% CI, 0.923-2.165; p &lt; 0.001), interleukin-1β (IL-1β; Hedges g, 0.678; 95% CI, 0.183-1.172; p = 0.007), IL-6 (Hedges g, 0.630; 95% CI, 0.100 -1.160; p = 0.02), IL-4 (Hedges g, 0.822; 95% CI, 0.220-1.423; p = 0.007 ), IL-17 (Hedges g, 1.452; 95% CI, 0.331-2.573; p = 0.011), interferon-γ (Hedges g,1.104; 95% CI, 0.490-1.719; p &lt; 0.001) and C-reactive protein (Hedges g, 0.909; 95% CI, 0.453-1.365; p &lt; 0.001) levels were significantly increased in the patients with GBS when compared with controls. In contrast, the blood IL-10 and TGF-β levels were not significantly associated with GBS. Furthermore, the meta-analysis found that cerebrospinal fluid IL-17 levels were significantly associated with GBS (Hedges g, 1.882; 95% CI, 0.104-3.661; p = 0.038). Taken together, our results clarified the circulating inflammatory cytokine profile in the patients with GBS, and revealed that Th1, Th2 and Th17 related cytokines were highly elevated in the GBS patients, and suggesting the potential of these cytokines to be used as biomarkers for GBS.

Adolescence is a unique period in which higher cognition develops to adult-level, while plasticity of neuron and behavior is at one of its peak. Yet, cognitive training studies for adolescents has been sparse and neural correlates of the training effects yet to be established. This study investigated the effects of multicomponent training of cognitive control (MTCC) in order to examine whether the training enhanced adolescents' cognitive control ability and if the effects were generalizable to other cognitive domains. Cognitive control refers to the ability to adjust a series of thoughts and behaviors in correspondence to an internal goal, and involves inhibition, working memory, shifting, and dual tasking as subcomponents. The participants were middle school students (aged 11–14) and randomly assigned to either a training group or an active control group. The training group performed 30 minutes of MTCC per day for six weeks. To identify the training effects, we examined the cognitive performance, regional gray matter, and their relationship. The training group showed modest improvement in a visuospatial fluid intelligence test (Block Design) after MTCC, which was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In addition, the training effect on the gray matter volume (time × group interaction) was observed in the right inferior cortex (rIFC). While the control group showed a typical reduction in the rIFC volume, the training group showed a relative increase in the homologous region. The relative change in rIFC volume was associated with the change in Stroop performance. These results imply that MTCC may affect brain structure relevant to inhibitory control process.

In EEG measurements, processing of periodic sounds in the ascending auditory pathway generates the frequency-following response (FFR) phase-locked to the fundamental frequency (F0) and its harmonics of a sound. We measured FFRs to the steady-state (vowel) part of syllables /ba/ and /aw/ occurring in binaural rapid streams of speech sounds as frequently repeating standard syllables or as infrequent (p = .2) deviant syllables among standard /wa/ syllables. Our aim was to study whether concurrent active phonological processing affects early processing of irrelevant speech sounds reflected by FFRs to these sounds. To this end, during syllable delivery, our healthy adult participants performed tasks involving written letters delivered on a computer screen in a rapid stream. The stream consisted of vowel letters written in red, infrequently occurring consonant letters written in the same color, and infrequently occurring vowel letters written in blue. In the phonological task, the participants were instructed to press a response key to the consonant letters differing phonologically but not in color from the frequently occurring red vowels, whereas in the non-phonological task, they were instructed to respond to the vowel letters written in blue differing only in color from the frequently occurring red vowels. We observed that the phonological task enhanced responses to deviant /ba/ syllables but not responses to deviant /aw/ syllables. This suggests that active phonological task performance may enhance processing of such small changes in irrelevant speech sounds as the 30-ms difference in the initial formant-transition time between the otherwise identical syllables /ba/ and /wa/ used in the present study.

Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) is a prospective tool to enhance the emotion regulation capability of participants and to alleviate their emotional disorders. The hippocampus is a key brain region in the emotional brain network and plays a significant role in social cognition and emotion processing in the brain. However, few studies have focused on the emotion NF of the hippocampus. This study investigated the feasibility of NF training of healthy participants to self-regulate the activation of the hippocampus and assessed the effect of rtfMRI-NF on the hippocampus before and after training. Twenty-six right-handed healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to the experimental group receiving hippocampal rtfMRI-NF (n = 13) and the control group (CG) receiving rtfMRI-NF from the intraparietal sulcus rtfMRI-NF (n = 13) and completed a total of 4 NF runs. The hippocampus and the intraparietal sulcus were defined based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard template, and NF signal was measured as a percent signal change relative to the baseline obtained by averaging the fMRI signal for the preceding 20 s long rest block. NF signal (percent signal change) was updated every 2 s and was displayed on the screen. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and regional homogeneity values were calculated to evaluate the effects of NF on spontaneous neural activity in resting state fMRI. A standard general linear model (GLM) analysis was separately conducted for each fMRI NF run. Results showed that the activation of hippocampus increased after 4 NF training runs. The hippocampal activity of the experiment group participants was higher than that of the CG. They also showed elevated hippocampal activity and the greater amygdala-hippocampus connectivity. The anterior temporal lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, and amygdala of brain regions associated with emotional processing were activated during training. We presented a proof-of-concept study using rtfMRI-NF for hippocampus up-regulation in the recall of positive autobiographical memories. The current study may provide a new method to regulate our emotions and can potentially be applied to the clinical treatment of emotional disorders.

The brain networks underlying human multiple-cue judgment, the judgment of a continuous criterion based on multiple cues, have been examined in a few recent studies, and the ventral precuneus has been found to be a key region. Specifically, activation differences in ventral precuneus (as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) has been linked to an exemplar-based judgment process, where judgments are based on memory for previous similar cases. What aspects of exemplar-based judgment ventral precuneus supports is however poorly understood. Ventral precuneus is a brain region important for various episodic memory processes, where increased engagement of this region together with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the medial temporal lobes (MTL) during learning have been linked to retrieval success. Several alternatives are plausible, for example that reduced brain activity in ventral precuneus during learning to make exemplar-based judgments could reflect reduced needs for visuo-spatial attention as a function of learning to master the task. The present study used fMRI during a multiple-cue judgment task to gain novel neurocognitive evidence informative for the link between learning-related activity changes in ventral precuneus and exemplar-based judgment. Participants (N = 27) spontaneously learned to make judgments during fMRI, in a multiple-cue judgment task specifically designed to induce exemplar-based processing. Contrasting brain activity during late learning to early learning indeed revealed higher activity in ventral precuneus, the bilateral MTL and the vmPFC. Activity in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC was found to parametrically increase between each judgment event, and activity levels in the ventral precuneus predicted performance after learning. These results are interpreted such that the ventral precuneus supports the aspects of exemplar-based processes that are related to episodic memory, tentatively by building and retrieving memory representations for judgment.

The reduction of neuronal responses to repeated stimulus presentation occurs in many sensory neurons, also in the inferior colliculus of birds. Response adaptation plays a role in perceptual auditory phenomena like the precedence effect. The cellular mechanisms that cause response adaptation are not well described. Adaptation must be explicable by changes in the activity of input neurons, short-term synaptic plasticity of the incoming connections, excitability changes of the neuron under consideration or influences of inhibitory or modulatory network connections. Using whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices of the embryonic chicken brain we wanted to understand the intrinsic and synaptic contributions to adaptation in the core of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. We described two neuron types in the chicken ICCc based on their action potential firing patterns: Phasic/onset neurons showed strong intrinsic adaptation but recovered more rapidly. Tonic/sustained firing neurons had weaker adaptation but often had additional slow components of recovery from adaptation. Chicken ICCc neurons received mostly mixed AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamatergic synaptic inputs. In the majority of ICCc neurons the input synapses underwent short-term depression. With a simulation of the putative population output activity of the chicken ICCc we showed that the different adaptation profiles of the neuron classes could shift the emphasize of stimulus encoding from transients at long intervals to ongoing parts at short intervals. Thus we report here that description of biophysical and synaptic properties can help to explain adaptive phenomena in central auditory neurons.

Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment in humans and currently disables 466 million people across the world. Congenital deafness affects at least one in 500 newborns, and over 50% are hereditary in nature. To date, existing pharmacologic therapies for genetic and acquired etiologies of deafness are severely limited. With the advent of modern sequencing technologies, there is a vast compendium of growing genetic alterations that underlie human hearing loss, which can be targeted by therapeutics such as gene therapy. Recently, there has been tremendous progress in the development of gene therapy vectors to treat sensorineural hearing loss in animal models in vivo. Nevertheless, significant hurdles remain before such technologies can be translated towards clinical use. These include addressing the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB), engineering more specific and effective delivery vehicles, improving surgical access, and validating novel targets. In this review, we both highlight recent progress and outline challenges associated with in vivo gene therapy for human sensorineural hearing loss.

At the beginning of the XX century, in view of the growing international recognition of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the Spanish authorities took some important steps to support Cajal´s scientific work. This recognition peaked in 1906, when Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Spanish government provided Cajal a state-of-the-art laboratory in Madrid to allow him to continue with his research and they funded salaries to pay his first tenured collaborators, the number of which increased further after the creation of the Junta para Ampliación de Estudios -JAE. The JAE was an organism set up to help promising researchers develop their careers in different ways, thereby contributing to the development of science in Spain. Although largely forgotten or relatively unknown, there has been a recent revival in the recognition of the school that developed around Cajal, collectively referred to as the Spanish Neurological School (or colloquially, as the Cajal School or School of Madrid). Almost all Cajal’s collaborators were men, although a limited number of female scientists spent part of their careers at the heart of the Cajal School. Here we discuss these women and their work in the laboratory in Madrid. We have tracked the careers of Laura Forster (from Australia/United Kingdom), Manuela Serra, María Soledad Ruiz-Capillas and María Luisa Herreros (all Spanish), through their scientific publications, both in the journal founded by Cajal and elsewhere, and from other documentary sources. To complete the picture, we also outline the careers of other secondary figures that contributed to the production and running of Cajal’s laboratory in Madrid. We show here that the dawn of Spanish neuroscience included a number of contributions from female researchers who to date, have received little recognition.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00069">Hibernation Impairs Odor Discrimination – Implications for Alzheimer’s Disease</a></h4>

Reversible formation of PHF-like phosphorylated tau an early feature of Alzheimer´s disease (AD) was previously shown to occur in torpor during hibernation of Syrian hamsters. Here, we tackled the question to what extend hibernating Syrian hamsters can serve as a model for for the early stage of AD. During early AD  , anosmia, the loss of olfactory function, is a common and typical feature. We, thus, investigated tau phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity and behavioral physiology of the olfactory system during hibernation. Tau was phosphorylated on several AD -relevant epitopes, and distribution of PHF-like phosphorylated tau in the olfactory bulb was quite similar to what is seen in AD. Tau phosphorylation was not associated with a destabilization of microtubules or actin filaments and did not lead to fibril formation. Previously we observed a transient spine reduction in pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, which is correlated to the distribution of phosphorylated tau. Consistently, in the olfactory bulb the granule cells, which are devoid of phosphorylated tau, do not show a reduction in their spines. Contrary to previous reports no reduction in synaptic proteins was observed. However, when the effect of hibernation on olfactory memory was tested using a two odor discrimination task, non-hibernating animals showed a significant preference for the odor presented with a food reward, whereas hibernating animals did not. We conclude that hibernation is associated with a specific olfactory memory deficit, which might not be attributed to the formation of PHF-like phosphorylated tau within the olfactory bulb. We discuss a possible involvement of modulatory input provided by cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, which are affected by hibernation.

Introduction: The loss of nigrosome-1 which is also referred to as the swallow tail sign (STS) in T2* weighted iron-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently emerged as a new biomarker for idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD). However, consistent recognition of the STS is difficult due to individual variations and different imaging parameters. Radiomics might have the potential to overcome these shortcomings. Therefore, we chose to explore whether radiomic features of nigrosome-1 of substantia nigra (SN) based on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) could help to differentiate IPD patients from healthy controls (HCs).
Methods: Three-dimensional multi-echo gradient-recalled echo images (0.86×0.86×1.00 mm3) were obtained at 3.0 T MRI for QSM in 87 IPD patients and 77 HCs. Regions of interest (ROIs) of the SN below the red nucleus were manually drawn on both sides, and subsequently, volumes of interest (VOIs) were segmented (these ROIs included 4 1mm slices). Then, 105 radiomic features (including 18 histogram features, 13 shape features, 74 texture features) of bilateral VOIs in the two groups were extracted. Forty features were selected according to the ensemble feature selection method which combined analysis of variance, random forest and recursive feature elimination. The selected features were further utilized to distinguish IPD patients from HC using SVM classifier with 10 rounds of 3-fold cross-validation. Finally, the representative features were analyzed using an unpaired t-test with Bonferroni correction and correlated with the UPDRS-III scores.
Results: The classification results from SVM were: area under curve (AUC): 0.96±0.02; accuracy: 0.88±0.03; sensitivity: 0.89±0.06; and specificity: 0.87±0.07. Five representative features were selected to show their detailed difference between IPD patients and HCs: 10 Percentile and Median in IPD patients were higher than those in HCs (all p&lt;0.00125), while, GLRLM-Long Run Low Gray Level Emphasis, GLSZM-Gray Level Non-Uniformity and volume (all p&lt;0.00125) in IPD patients were lower than those in HCs. The 10 percentile was positively correlated with UPDRS-III score (r=0.35, p=0.001).
Conclusion: Radiomic features of nigrosome-1 region of SN based on QSM could be useful in the diagnosis of IPD and could serve as a surrogate marker for the STS.

Identifying older adults at risk for memory impairment is an important goal for initiating early treatment and prevention strategies. We examined the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of older and younger adults before and after cognitive effort as a marker for subsequent memory decline, focusing on the connectivity between the left anterior hippocampus (laHC) and the posterior hippocampi (pHC). Results showed that for younger adults, post-effort increases in laHC-pHC connectivity were related to increases in connectivity between the laHC and the hubs of the default mode network. However, for older adults, post-effort increases in the RSFC of laHC-pHC were related to decreases in the connectivity of the laHC and right precentral gyrus. Thus, the correlation between intra-HC and inter-HC RSFC was altered with cognitive effort and aging. Importantly, older adults who had lower post-effort RSFC between the laHC and the pHC demonstrated a decline in an episodic memory 2 years later. Hence, the change in intra-HC RSFC following cognitive effort was able to predict subsequent memory function with aging in our sample.

Background: Performing cognitive and motor tasks simultaneously interferes with gait performance and may lead to falls in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in elderly individuals with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training.
Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function (Stroop color and word test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B), gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task cost (DTC). Gait performance was evaluated during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task).
Results: Both groups showed significant improvements on the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed better performance than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence. Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in elderly individuals with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function.

While walking was once thought to be a highly automated process, it requires higher-level cognition with older age. Like other cognitive tasks, it also becomes further challenged with increased cognitive load (e.g., the addition of an unrelated dual task) and often results in poorer performance (e.g., slower speed). It is not well known, however, how intrinsic neural network communication relates to walking speed, nor to this “cost” to gait performance; i.e., “dual-task cost”. The current study investigates the relationship between network connectivity, using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), and individual differences in older adult walking speed. Fifty participants (35 female; 84±4.5 years) from the MOBILIZE Boston Study cohort underwent an MRI protocol and completed a gait assessment during two conditions: walking quietly at a preferred pace and while concurrently performing a serial subtraction task. Within and between neural network connectivity measures were calculated from resting-state fMRI and were correlated with walking speeds and the dual-task cost (i.e., the percent change in speed between conditions). Among the fMRI correlates, faster walking was associated with increased connectivity between motor and cognitive networks and decreased connectivity between limbic and cognitive networks. Smaller dual-task cost was associated with increased connectivity within the motor network and increased connectivity between the ventral attention and executive networks. These findings support the importance of both motor network integrity as well as inter-network connectivity amongst higher-level cognitive networks in older adults’ ability to maintain mobility, particularly under dual-task conditions.

Neuroimaging MRI data in scientific research is increasingly pooled, but the reliability of such studies may be hampered by the use of different hardware elements. This might introduce bias, for example when cross-sectional studies pool data acquired with different head coils, or when longitudinal clinical studies change head coils halfway. In the present study, we aimed to estimate this possible bias introduced by using different head coils to create awareness and to avoid misinterpretation of results. We acquired, with both an 8 channel and 32 channel head coil, T1-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging and resting state fMRI images at 3T MRI (Philips Achieva) with stable acquisition parameters in a large group of cognitively healthy participants (n=77). Standard analysis methods, i.e. voxel-based morphometry, tract-based spatial statistics and resting state functional network analyses, were used in a within-subject design to compare 8 and 32 channel head coil data. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for both head coils showed similar ranges, although the 32 channel SNR profile was more homogeneous. Our data demonstrates specific patterns of grey and white matter volume differences between head coils, related to altered image contrast and therefore, altered tissue segmentation. White matter connectivity (fractional anisotropy and diffusivity measures) showed hemispherical dependent differences between head coils, and functional connectivity in resting state networks was higher using the 32 channel head coil in posterior cortical areas. This study shows that, even when acquisition protocols are harmonized, the results of standardized analysis models can be severely affected by the use of different head coils. Researchers should be aware of this when combining multiple neuroimaging MRI datasets, to prevent coil-related bias and avoid misinterpretation of their findings.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as focal neurological deficit caused by ischemia resolving within 24 hrs. In a secondary analysis of a large monocentric cohort of 446 TIA patients, we explored the frequency and determinants of DWI lesions on high‐resolution MRI. Overall, 240 (54%) of all TIA patients presented with DWI lesions. These patients had higher NIHSS and ABCD2 scores and presented more frequently with vessel occlusion and perfusion deficits, but had similar functional outcome at 3 months. Taken together high‐resolution DWI provides evidence of ischemic brain injury in the majority of TIA patients.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) starts in early childhood with loss of visual acuity and color vision deficits. <i>OPA1</i> mutations are responsible for the majority of cases, but in a proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of ADOA, the cause remains unknown. This study aimed to identify novel ADOA‐associated genes and explore their causality.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Linkage analysis and sequencing were performed in multi‐generation families and unrelated patients to identify disease‐causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated <i>in silico</i> and confirmed experimentally using the zebrafish model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We defined a new ADOA locus on 7q33‐q35 and identified three different missense variants in <i>SSBP1</i> (NM_001256510.1; c.113G&gt;A (p.(Arg38Gln)), c.320G&gt;A (p.(Arg107Gln)) and c.422G&gt;A (p.(Ser141Asn))) in affected individuals from two families and two singletons with ADOA and variable retinal degeneration. The mutated arginine residues are part of a basic patch that is essential for single‐strand DNA binding. The loss of a positive charge at these positions is very likely to lower the affinity of SSBP1 to ssDNA. Antisense‐mediated knockdown of endogenous <i>ssbp1</i> mRNA in zebrafish resulted in compromised differentiation of retinal ganglion cells. A similar effect was achieved when mutated mRNAs were administered. These findings point to an essential role of <i>ssbp1</i> in retinal development and the dominant‐negative nature of the identified human variants, which is consistent with the segregation pattern observed in two multi‐generation families studied.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SSBP1 is an essential protein for mtDNA replication and maintenance. Our data established pathogenic variants in <i>SSBP1</i> as a cause of ADOA and variable retinal degeneration.</p>

The development of two-photon microscopy has revolutionized our understanding of how synapses are formed and how they transform synaptic inputs in dendritic spines – tiny protrusions that cover the dendrites of pyramidal neurons that receive most excitatory synaptic information in the brain. These discoveries have led us to better comprehend the neuronal computations that take place at the level of dendritic spines as well as within neuronal circuits with unprecedented resolution. Here we describe a method that uses a two-photon (2P) microscope and 2P uncaging of caged neurotransmitters for the activation of single and multiple spines in the dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. In addition, we propose a cost-effective description of the components necessary for the construction of a one laser source-2P microscope capable of nearly simultaneous 2P uncaging of neurotransmitters and 2P calcium imaging of the activated spines and nearby dendrites. We provide a brief overview on how the use of these techniques have helped researchers in the last 15 years unravel the function of spines in a) information processing, b) storage and c) integration of excitatory synaptic inputs.

Introduction: In-vivo quantification of the serotonin transporter (SERT) guided our understanding of many neuropsychiatric disorders. A recently introduced bolus plus constant infusion protocol has been shown to allow the reliable determination of SERT binding with reduced scan time. In this work, the outcomes of two methods, a bolus injection paradigm on a GE PET camera and a bolus plus infusion paradigm on a combined Siemens PET/MR camera were compared.
Methods: 7 healthy subjects underwent paired PET and paired PET/MR scans each with intravenous double-blind application of 7.5 mg citalopram or saline in a randomized cross-over study design. While PET scans were performed according to standard protocols and nondisplaceable binding potentials (BPND) were calculated using the multi-linear reference tissue model, during PET/MR measurements [11C]DASB was applied as bolus plus constant infusion and BPND was calculated using the steady state method and data acquired at tracer equilibrium. Occupancies were calculated as the relative decrease in BPND between saline and citalopram scans. 
Results:  During placebo scans, a mean difference in BPND of -0.08 (-11.71%) across all ROIs was found between methods. PET/MR scans resulted in higher BPND estimates than PET scans in all ROIs except the midbrain. A mean difference of -0.19 (-109.40%) across all ROIs between methods was observed for citalopram scans. PET/MR scans resulted in higher BPND estimates than PET scans in all ROIs. For occupancy, a mean difference of 23.12% (21.91%) was observed across all ROIs. PET/MR scans resulted in lower occupancy compared to PET scans in all ROIs except the temporal cortex. While for placebo, BPND of high-binding regions (thalamus and striatum) exhibited moderate reliability (ICC=0.66), during citalopram scans ICC decreased (0.36-0.46). However, reliability for occupancy remained high (0.57-0.82). 
Conclusion: Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of reliable and non-invasive SERT quantification using a [11C]DASB bolus plus constant infusion protocol at a hybrid PET/MR scanner, which might facilitate future pharmacological imaging studies. Highest agreement with established methods for quantification of occupancy and SERT binding potentials at baseline was observed in subcortical high-binding regions.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable and progressively fatal neurodegenerative disease that manifests with distinct clinical phenotypes, which are seen in neuroimaging and clinical studies. T2- and proton density (PD)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displays hyperintense signal along the corticospinal tract (CST) in some ALS patients with upper motor neuron (UMN)-predominant signs. These patients tend to be younger and have signiﬁcantly faster disease progression. We hypothesize that such ALS patients with CST hyperintensity (ALS-CST+) comprise a clinical subtype distinct from other ALS subtypes, namely patients with UMN-predominant ALS without CST hyperintensity, classic ALS, and ALS with frontotemporal dementia. Novel approaches such as fractal dimension analysis on conventional MRI (cMRI) and advanced MR techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging reveal significant differences between ALS-CST+ and the aforementioned ALS subtypes. Our unbiased neuroimaging studies demonstrate that the ALS-CST+ group, which can be initially identified by T2-, PD-, and FLAIR-weighted cMRI, is distinctive and distinguishable from other ALS subtypes with possible differences in disease pathogenesis.

During speech perception listeners rely on multimodal input and make use of both auditory and visual information. When presented with speech, for example syllables, the differences in brain responses to distinct stimuli are not, however, caused merely by the acoustic or visual features of the stimuli. The congruency of the auditory and visual information and the familiarity of a syllable, that is, whether it appears in the listener’s native language or not, also modulates brain responses. We investigated how the congruency and familiarity of the presented stimuli affect brain responses to audio-visual (AV) speech in 12 adult Finnish native speakers and 12 adult Chinese native speakers. They watched videos of a Chinese speaker pronouncing syllables (/pa/, /pha/, /ta/, /tha/, /fa/) during a magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurement where only /pa/ and /ta/ were part of Finnish phonology while all the stimuli were part of Chinese phonology. The stimuli were presented in audio-visual (congruent or incongruent), audio only, or visual only conditions. The brain responses were examined in five time-windows: 75–125 ms, 150–200 ms, 200–300 ms, 300–400 ms and 400–600 ms. We found significant differences for the congruency comparison in the fourth time-window (300–400 ms) in both sensor and source level analysis. Larger responses were observed for the incongruent stimuli than for the congruent stimuli. For the familiarity comparisons no significant differences were found. The results are in line with earlier studies reporting modulation of brain responses for audio-visual congruency around 250–500 ms. This suggests a much stronger process for the general detection of mismatch between predictions based on lip movements and the auditory signal than for the top-down modulation of brain responses based on phonological information.

The idea that intelligence is embedded not only in a single brain network, but instead in a complex, well-optimized system of complementary networks, has led to the development of whole brain network analysis. Using graph theory to analyze resting-state functional MRI data, we investigated the brain graph networks (or brain networks) of high intelligence quotient (HIQ) children. To this end, we computed the “hub disruption index κ”, an index sensitive to graph network modifications. We found significant topological differences in the integration and segregation properties of brain networks in HIQ compared to standard IQ children, not only for the whole brain graph, but also for each hemispheric graph, and for the homotopic connectivity. Moreover, two profiles of HIQ children, homogenous and heterogeneous, based on the differences between the two main IQ subscales (verbal comprehension index (VCI) and perceptual reasoning index (PRI)), were compared. Brain networks changes were more pronounced in the heterogeneous HIQ than in the homogeneous HIQ subgroups. Finally, we found significant correlations between the graph networks’ changes and the full-scale IQ (FSIQ), as well as the subscales VCI and PRI. Specifically, the higher the FSIQ the greater was the brain organization modification in the whole brain, the left hemisphere, and the homotopic connectivity. These results shed new light on the relation between functional connectivity topology and high intelligence, as well as on different intelligence profiles.

Magnetic resonance images of brain tumors are routinely used in neuro-oncology clinics for diagnosis, treatment planning and post-treatment tumor surveillance. Currently, physicians spend considerable time manually delineating different structures of the brain. Spatial and structural variations, as well as intensity inhomogeneity across images, make the problem of computer- assisted segmentation very challenging. We propose a new image segmentation framework for tumor delineation that benefits from two state-of-the-art machine learning architectures in computer vision, i.e., Inception modules and U-Net image segmentation architecture. Furthermore, our framework includes two learning regimes, i.e., learning to segment intra-tumoral structures (necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core, peritumoral edema, and enhancing tumor) or learning to segment glioma sub-regions (whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor). These learning regimes are incorporated into a newly proposed loss function which is based on the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). In our experiments, we quantified the impact of introducing the Inception modules in the U-Net architecture, as well as, changing the objective function for the learning algorithm from segmenting the intra-tumoral structures to glioma sub-regions. We found that incorporating Inception modules significantly improved the segmentation performance (p &lt; 0.001) for all glioma sub-regions. Moreover, in architectures with Inception modules, the models trained with the learning objective of segmenting the intra-tumoral structures outperformed the models trained with the objective of segmenting the glioma sub-regions for the whole tumor (p &lt; 0.001). The improved performance is linked to multiscale features extracted by newly introduced Inception module and the modified loss function based on the DSC.

The presubiculum plays a key role in processing and integrating spatial and head-directional information. Layer III neurons of the presubiculum provide strong projections to the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex in the rat. Our previous study revealed that the terminal distribution of efferents from layer III cells of the presubiculum was organized in a band-like fashion within the medial entorhinal cortex, and the transverse axis of these zones ran parallel to the rhinal fissure. Identifying axonal branching patterns of layer III neurons of the presubiculum is important to further elucidate the functional roles of the presubiculum. In the present study, we visualized all axonal processes and terminal distributions of single presubicular layer III neurons in the rat, using in vivo injection of a viral vector expressing membrane-targeted palmitoylation site-attached green fluorescent protein. We found that layer III of the rat presubiculum comprised multiple types of neurons (n=12) with characteristic patterns of axonal collateralization, including cortical projection neurons (n=6) and several types of intrinsic connectional neurons (n=6). Two of six cortical projection neurons provided two or three major axonal branches to the medial entorhinal cortex and formed elaborate terminal arbors within the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. The width and axis of the area of their terminal distribution resembled that of the band-like terminal field seen in our massive-scale observation. Two of the other four cortical projection neurons gave off axonal branches to the medial entorhinal cortex and also to the subiculum, and each of the other two neurons sent axons to the subiculum or parasubiculum. Patterns of axonal arborization of six intrinsic connectional neurons were distinct from each other, with four neurons sending many axonal branches to both superficial and deep layers of the presubiculum and the other two neurons showing sparse axonal branches with terminations confined to layers III-V of the presubiculum. These data demonstrate that layer III of the rat presubiculum consists of multiple types of cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and also suggest that inputs from a single presubicular layer III neuron can directly affect a band-like zone of the medial entorhinal cortex.

Aging is a multifactorial phenomenon that results in several changes at cellular and molecular levels and is considered the main risk factor for some neurodegenerative diseases. Several evidences show the participation of the kallikrein-kinin system in neurodegeneration and this system has been associated with inflammation and immunogenic responses in the central and peripheral systems by the activation of the B1 and B2 receptors. Previous work by our group showed that bradykinin and the B2 receptor played a possible role in neuroprotection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the participation of B2 receptors in cell viability, neuroinflammatory response and neuroplasticity in organotypic hippocampal cultures of 6 and 12 month old mice. It was observed that activation of the B2 receptor by bradykinin decreased the inflammatory response and increased plasticity in 12 months old slices. Conversely, there was an increase in the inflammatory response and a decrease in neural plasticity in the six-months old slices. In both ages an increase in cell viability was observed. This data suggests that the function of the kinin B2 receptor in the hippocampus is modulated by age, providing neuroprotective action in old age.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>It is well established that motor impairment often occurs alongside healthy aging, leading to problems with fine motor skills and coordination. Although previously thought to be caused by neuronal death accumulating across the lifespan, it is now believed that the source of this impairment instead stems from more subtle changes in neural connectivity. The dendritic spine is a prime target for exploration of this problem because it is the postsynaptic partner of most excitatory synapses received by the pyramidal neuron, a cortical cell that carries much of the information processing load in the cerebral cortex. We repeatedly imaged the same dendrites in young adult and aged mouse motor cortex over the course of 1 month to look for differences in the baseline state of the dendritic spine population. These experiments reveal increased dendritic spine density, without obvious changes in spine clustering, occurring at the aged dendrite. Additionally, aged dendrites exhibit elevated spine turnover and stabilization alongside decreased long-term spine survival. These results suggest that at baseline the aged motor cortex may exist in a perpetual state of relative instability and attempts at compensation. This phenotype of aging may provide clues for future targets of aging-related motor impairment remediation.</span>

<p>Distinct clinical syndromes have been associated with pathogenic <i>MT‐ATP6</i> variants. In this cohort study, we identified 125 individuals (60 families) including 88 clinically affected individuals and 37 asymptomatic carriers. Thirty‐one individuals presented with Leigh syndrome and 7 with neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa. The remaining 50 patients presented with variable nonsyndromic features including ataxia, neuropathy, and learning disability. We confirmed maternal inheritance in 39 families and demonstrated that tissue segregation patterns and phenotypic threshold are variant dependent. Our findings suggest that <i>MT‐ATP6</i>–related mitochondrial DNA disease is best conceptualized as a mitochondrial disease spectrum disorder and should be routinely included in genetic ataxia and neuropathy gene panels.

Background: There is accumulating evidence suggesting a connection between the gut and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Gut microbiota may play an important role in the intestinal lesions in PD patients.
Objective: This study aims to determine whether gut microbiota differs between PD patients and healthy controls in Northeast of China, and to identify the factors that influence the changes in the gut microbiota. 
Methods: We enrolled 51 PD patients and 48 healthy controls in this study. Microbial species in stool samples were determined through 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. Dietary intakes were collected from subset of 42 patients and 23 controls using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Gut microbiota species richness, diversity, differential abundance of individual taxa between PD patients and controls, and the relationship between the gut microbiota abundance and the dietary and clinical factors were analyzed.
Results: PD patients showed decreased species richness, phylogenetic diversity, β-diversity, and altered relative abundance in several taxa compared to the controls. PD-associated clinical scores appeared to be the most influential factors that correlated with the abundance of a variety of taxa. The most consistent findings suggested by multiple analyses used in this study were the increase of Akkermansia and the decrease of Lactobacillus in PD patients in Northeast China.
Conclusion: Gut microbiota significantly differed between a group of PD patients and healthy controls in Northeast China, with decreased species richness, phylogenetic diversity, β-diversity, and altered relative abundance in several taxa compared to the controls.

Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (ITON) is a condition that is often associated with traumatic brain injury and can result in significant vision loss due to degeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons at the time of injury or within the ensuing weeks. We used a mouse model of eye-directed air-blast exposure to characterize the histopathology of blast-induced ITON. This injury caused a transient elevation of intraocular pressure with subsequent retinal ganglion cell death and axon degeneration that was similar throughout the length of the optic nerve. Deficits in active anterograde axon transport to the superior colliculus accompanied axon degeneration and first appeared in peripheral representations of the retina. Glial area in the optic nerve increased early after injury and involved a later period of additional expansion. The increase in area involved a transient change in astrocyte organization independent of axon degeneration. While levels of many cytokines and chemokines did not change, IL-1α and IL-1β increased in both the optic nerve and retina. In contrast, glaucoma shows distal to proximal axon degeneration with astrocyte remodeling and increases in many cytokines and chemokines. Further, direct traumatic optic neuropathies have a clear site of injury with rapid, progressive axon degeneration and cell death. These data show that blast-induced ITON is a distinct neuropathology from other optic neuropathies.

The choice of the reference electrode scheme is an important step in event-related potential (ERP) analysis. In order to explore the optimal electroencephalogram reference electrode scheme for the ERP signal related to facial recognition, we investigated the influence of average reference (AR), mean mastoid reference (MM) and Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST) on the N170 component via statistical analysis, statistical parametric scalp mappings (SPSM) and source analysis. The statistical results showed that the choice of reference electrode scheme has little effect on N170 latency (p&gt;0.05), but has a greater impact on N170 amplitude (p&lt;0.05). ANOVA results show that, for the three references scheme, there was statistically significant difference between N170 latency and amplitude induced by the unfamiliar face and that induced by the scrambled face (p&lt;0.05). Specifically, the SPSM results show an anterior and a temporo-occipital distribution for AR and REST, with just anterior distribution shown for MM. However, the circumstantial evidence provided by source analysis is more consistent with SPSM of AR and REST. These results indicate that the experimental results under the AR and REST references are more objective and appropriate. Thus, it is more appropriate to use AR and REST reference scheme settings in future facial recognition experiments.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00047">The Orientation Selectivity of Spike-LFP Synchronization in Macaque V1 and V4</a></h4>

Orientation selectivity is a fundamental property of visual cortical neurons and plays a crucial role in pattern perception. Although many studies have dedicated to explain how the orientation selectivity emerged, the mechanism underlying orientation selectivity is still not clear. In this work, we investigated the synchronization between spikes and local field potentials (LFP) in gamma band, with the aim of providing a new avenue to analyze the orientation selectivity. The experimental data were recorded by utilizing two chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, where each array consisted of 48 electrodes and was placed over V1 and V4 respectively in two macaques performing a selective visual attention task. An unbiased and robust measure for quantifying the synchronization between spikes and LFP was employed in the analysis process, which is termed as spike-triggered correlation matrix synchronization (SCMS) and performs reliably for limited samples of data. We observed the spike-LFP synchronization in three cases, i.e. spikes and LFP in V1, spikes and LFP in V4, spikes in V4 and LFP in V1. From the orientation tuning curves based on the spike-LFP synchronization, it is found that there is a strong correlation between the synchronization and grating orientation. The neurons in both V1 and V4 exhibit orientation selectivity, but V1 is stronger. In addition, the spike-LFP synchronization strength between V1 and V4 also shows orientation selectivity to drifting gratings. It means that the synchronization not only reflects the basic features of visual stimulation, but also describes the orientation tuning characteristics of neurons in different regions. Our results suggest that the spike-LFP synchronization can be used as an alternative and effective method to study the mechanism for generating orientation selectivity of visual neurons.

Objective: The aim of this review was to synthesize, using random-effects model of meta-analysis, the link between dopaminergic system and Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods: A detailed analysis protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database prior to data extraction (CRD42018110798). Electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Psyc-ARTICLES were searched up to December 2018 for studies that examined dopamine and dopamine receptors in relation to Alzheimer’s disease. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated to assess group differences in the levels of dopaminergic neurometabolites.
Results: Seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria. Collectively, they included 512 patients and 500 healthy controls. There were significantly lower levels of dopamine in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with controls (SMD= -1.56, 95% CI: -2.64 to -0.49). In addition, dopamine 1 receptor (SMD=-5.05, 95% CI: -6.14 to -3.97) and dopamine 2 receptor (SMD=-1.13, 95% CI: -1.52 to -0.74) levels were decreased in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with controls. The results of network meta-analysis indicated that the rank of correlation with Alzheimer’s disease from highest to lowest was dopamine (0.74), dopamine 2 receptor (0.49), dopamine 3 receptor (0.46), dopamine 4 receptor (0.33), dopamine 5 receptor (0.31), and dopamine 1 receptor (0.64).
Conclusions: Overall, decreased levels of dopaminergic neurotransmitters were linked with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Nonetheless, there is a clear need for more prospective studies to validate these hypotheses.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural progenitor proliferation, neuronal migration, areal organization, and pioneer axon wiring are critical events during early forebrain development, yet remain incompletely understood, especially in human. Here, we studied forebrain development in human embryos aged 5 to 8 postconceptional weeks (WPC5–8), stages that correspond to the neuroepithelium/early marginal zone (WPC5), telencephalic preplate (WPC6 &amp; 7), and incipient cortical plate (WPC8). We show that early telencephalic neurons are formed at the neuroepithelial stage; the most precocious ones originate from local telencephalic neuroepithelium and possibly from the olfactory placode. At the preplate stage, forebrain organization is quite similar in human and mouse in terms of areal organization and of differentiation of Cajal-Retzius cells, pioneer neurons, and axons. Like in mice, axons from pioneer neurons in prethalamus, ventral telencephalon, and cortical preplate cross the diencephalon–telencephalon junction and the pallial–subpallial boundary, forming scaffolds that could guide thalamic and cortical axons at later stages. In accord with this model, at the early cortical plate stage, corticofugal axons run in ventral telencephalon in close contact with scaffold neurons, which express CELSR3 and FZD3, two molecules that regulates formation of similar scaffolds in mice.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The prefrontal cortex is vital for a range of cognitive processes, including working memory, attention, and decision-making. Notably, its absence impairs the performance of tasks requiring the maintenance of information through a delay period. In this paper, we formulate a rodent task—which requires maintenance of delay-period activity—as a Markov decision process and treat optimal task performance as an (active) inference problem. We simulate the behavior of a Bayes optimal mouse presented with 1 of 2 cues that instructs the selection of concurrent visual and auditory targets on a trial-by-trial basis. Formulating inference as message passing, we reproduce features of neuronal coupling within and between prefrontal regions engaged by this task. We focus on the micro-circuitry that underwrites delay-period activity and relate it to functional specialization within the prefrontal cortex in primates. Finally, we simulate the electrophysiological correlates of inference and demonstrate the consequences of lesions to each part of our in silico prefrontal cortex. In brief, this formulation suggests that recurrent excitatory connections—which support persistent neuronal activity—encode beliefs about transition probabilities over time. We argue that attentional modulation can be understood as the contextualization of sensory input by these persistent beliefs.</span>

The sensory recruitment model envisages visual working memory (VWM) as an emergent property that is encoded and maintained in sensory (visual) regions. The model implies that enhanced sensory-perceptual functions, as in synaesthesia, entail a dedicated VWM-system, showing reduced visual cortex activity as a result of neural specificity. By contrast, sensory-perceptual decline, as in old age, is expected to show enhanced visual cortex activity as a result of neural broadening. To test this model, young grapheme-colour synaesthetes, older adults and young controls engaged in a delayed pair-associative retrieval and a delayed matching-to-sample task, consisting of achromatic fractal stimuli that do not induce synaesthesia. While a previous analysis of this dataset (Pfeifer et al., 2016) has focused on cued retrieval and recognition of pair-associates (i.e. long-term memory), the current study focuses on visual working memory and considers, for the first time, the crucial delay period in which no visual stimuli are present, but working memory processes are engaged. Participants were trained to criterion and demonstrated comparable behavioural performance on VWM tasks. Whole-brain and region-of-interest-analyses revealed significantly lower activity in synaesthetes’ middle frontal gyrus and visual regions (cuneus, inferior temporal cortex) respectively, suggesting greater neural efficiency relative to young and older adults in both tasks. The results support the sensory recruitment model and can explain age and individual WM-differences based on neural specificity in visual cortex.

Over the past 2,500 years, contemplative traditions have explored the nature of the mind using meditation. More recently, neuroimaging research on meditation has revealed differences in brain function and structure in meditators. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. In order to understand how meditation shapes global activity through the brain, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics across the whole-brain functional network using the Intrinsic Ignition Framework. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that different states of consciousness differ in their underlying dynamical complexity, i.e., how the broadness of communication is elicited and distributed through the brain over time and space. In this work, controls and experienced meditators were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during resting-state and meditation (focused attention on breathing). Our results evidenced that the dynamical complexity underlying meditation shows less complexity than during resting-state in the meditator group but not in the control group. Furthermore, we report that during resting-state, the brain activity of experienced meditators showed higher metastability (i.e., a wider dynamical regime over time) than the one observed in the control group. Overall, these results indicate that the meditation state operates in a different dynamical regime compared to the resting-state.

Objective
In children screened for dizziness with vergence disorders, we tested short and long term efficacy of orthoptic vergence training (OVT) and instructions to reduce screen usage.
Methods
Prospective study. Of the 179 children referred for vertigo or dizziness (over 3 years) and ophthalmological disorder as the only problem after complete oto-neuro-vestibular testing, 69 presented vergence insufficiency, and 49 accepted to participate to this study. 109 healthy children served as controls. All subjects performed classic orthoptic evaluation and video binocular movement recordings during various oculomotor tasks. Patients were evaluated before OVT (M0), after the end of OVT (M3) and 6 months later (M9). Statistics compared orthoptic and oculomotor parameters between patients and controls over time with one-way ANCOVA, and mixed models, controlling for age and gender.
Results
Patients reported vertigo that was usually rotatory, lasting &lt;15 min, associated or alternating with headache (50%). Their exposure to small videoscreens and TV was intensive (~3.6 h per day). At M0, all orthoptic and oculomotor parameters were statistically different in patients relative to controls (p&lt;0.0001) except for divergence. At M3, vertigo symptoms had disappeared in all of the patients, and all eye movement parameters improved significantly (p&lt;0.0001). At M9, this improvement remained stable or continued. 
Conclusion
Vergence disorders (assessed by abnormal orthoptic and oculomotor parameters) can generate symptoms of dizziness in children. Orthoptic treatment and instruction to reduce screen usage has a significant and long term effect on vertigo symptoms as well as oculomotor performances. Dizzy children should be screened for vergence disorders.

Limited in part by the spatial resolution of typical in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, recent neuroimaging studies have only identified a connectivity-based shell-core-like partitioning of the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in humans. This has hindered the process of making a more refined description of the Acb using non-invasive neuroimaging technologies and approaches. In this study, high-resolution ex vivo macaque brain diffusion MRI data were acquired to investigate the tractography-based parcellation of the Acb. Our results identified a shell-core-like partitioning in macaques that is similar to that in humans as well as an alternative solution that subdivided the Acb into four parcels, the medial shell, the lateral shell, the ventral core, and the dorsal core. Furthermore, we characterized the specific anatomical and functional connectivity profiles of these Acb subregions and generalized their specialized functions to establish a fine-grained macaque Acb brainnetome atlas. This atlas should be helpful in neuroimaging, stereotactic surgery, and comparative neuroimaging studies to reveal the neurophysiological substrates of various diseases and cognitive functions associated with the Acb.

Electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments are contaminated by large gradient artefacts (GA). The amplitude of the GA depends on the area of the wire loops formed by the EEG leads, as well as on the rate of switching of the magnetic field gradients, which are essential for MR imaging. Average artefact subtraction (AAS), the method most commonly used method for GA correction, relies on the EEG amplifier having a large enough dynamic range to characterize the artefact voltages. Low-pass filtering (250 Hz cut-off) is generally used to attenuate the high-frequency voltage fluctuations of the GA, but even with this precaution channel saturation can occur, particularly during acquisition of high spatial resolution MRI data. Previous work has shown that the ribbon cable, used to connect the EEG cap and amplifier, makes a significant contribution to the GA, since the cable geometry produces large effective wire-loop areas. However, by appropriately connecting the wires of the ribbon cable to the EEG cap it should be possible to minimize the overall range and root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the GA by producing partial cancellation of the cap and cable contributions. Here by modifying the connections of the EEG cap to a 1 m ribbon cable we were able to reduce the range of the GA for a high-resolution coronal echo planar Imaging (EPI) acquisition by a factor of ~ 1.6 and by a factor of ~ 1.15 for a standard axial EPI acquisition. These changes could potentially be translated into a reduction in the required dynamic range, an increase in the EEG bandwidth or an increase in the achievable image resolution without saturation, all of which could be beneficially exploited in EEG-fMRI studies. The re-wiring could also prevent the system from saturating when small subject movements occur using the standard recording bandwidth.

Adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) have attracted considerable attention as an important molecular target for the design of Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapeutic compounds. Here, we studied the transcriptional regulation of the A2AR gene in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from PD patients and in the striatum of the well-validated, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD mouse model.  We report an increase in A2AR mRNA expression and protein levels in both human cells and mice striata, and in the latter we could also observe a consistent reduction in DNA methylation at gene promoter and an increase in histone H3 acetylation at lysine 9. Of particular relevance in clinical samples, we also observed higher levels in the receptor gene expression in younger subjects, as well as in those with less years from disease onset and less severe disease according to clinical scores. In conclusion, the present findings provide further evidence of the relevant role of A2AR in PD and, based on the clinical data, highlight its potential role as disease biomarker for PD especially at the initial stages of disease development. Furthermore, our preclinical results also suggest selective epigenetic mechanisms targeting gene promoter as tool for the development of new treatments.

Objectives: To evaluate white matter hyperintensities (WMH) quantification reproducibility from multiple aspects of view, examine the effects of scan-rescan procedure, types of scanner, imaging protocols, scanner software upgrade, and automatic segmentation tools on WMH quantification results using MRI. 
Methods: Six post-stroke subjects (4 males; mean age 62.8, range 58-72 years) were scanned and rescanned with both 3D T1-weighted, 2D and 3D T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI across four different MRI scanners within 12 hours. Two automated WMH segmentation and quantification tools were used to measure WMH volume based on each MR scan. Robustness was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV).
Results: Experimental results show that the best reproducibility was achieved by using 3D T2-FLAIR MRI under intra-scanner setting with CV ranging from 2.69% to 2.97%, while the largest variability resulted from comparing WMH volumes measured based on 2D T2-FLAIR MRI with those of 3D T2-FLAIR MRI, with CV values in the range of 15.62%-29.33%. The WMH quantification variability based on 2D MRIs is larger than 3D MRIs due to their large slice thickness. In addition to image acquisition, the choice of automatic WMH segmentation tool also has a large impact on WMH quantification.
Conclusions: WMH reproducibility is one of the primary issues to be considered in multicenter and longitudinal studies. The study provides solid guidance in assisting multicenter and longitudinal study design to achieve meaningful results with enough power.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00668">Identifying Imaging Markers for Predicting Cognitive Assessments Using Wasserstein Distances Based Matrix Regression</a></h4>

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe type of neurodegeneration which worsens human memory, thinking and cognition along a temporal continuum. How to identify the informative  phenotypic neuroimaging markers and accurately predict cognitive assessment are crucial for early detection and diagnosis Alzheimer's disease. Regression models are widely used to predict the relationship between imaging biomarkers and cognitive assessment, and identify discriminative neuroimaging markers. Most existing methods use different matrix norms as the similarity measures of the empirical loss or regularization to improve the prediction performance, but ignore the inherent geometry of the cognitive data. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a novel robust matrix regression model with imposing Wasserstein distances on both loss function and regularization. It successfully integrate Wasserstein distance into the regression model, which can excavate the latent geometry of cognitive data. We introduce an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed new model with convergence analysis. Empirical results on cognitive data of the  ADNI cohort demonstrate the great effectiveness of the proposed method for clinical cognitive predication.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00618">Characterizing Rapid Fluctuations of Resting State Functional Connectivity in Demyelinating, Neurodegenerative, and Psychiatric Conditions: From Static to Time-Varying Analysis</a></h4>

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at resting state (RS) has been widely used to characterize the main brain networks. Functional connectivity (FC) has been mostly assessed assuming that FC is stationary across the whole fMRI examination. However, FC is highly variable at a very fast time-scale, as demonstrated by neurophysiological techniques. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) is a novel approach that allows capturing reoccurring patterns of interaction among functional brain networks. Aim of this review is to provide a description of the methods currently used to assess dFC on RS fMRI data, and to summarize the main results of studies applying dFC in healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). An overview of the main results obtained in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions is also provided.
The most popular dFC approach is based on the so-called “sliding windows”, in which the RS fMRI acquisition is divided in small temporal segments (windows). A window of fixed length is shifted over RS fMRI time courses, and data within each window are used to calculate FC and its variability over time. Sliding windows can be combined with clustering techniques to identify recurring FC states or used to assess global dFC properties of large-scale functional networks or specific brain regions. 
dFC studies have used heterogeneous methodologies so far. Despite this, similar results have been obtained across investigations. In healthy subjects, the default-mode network (DMN) exhibited the highest degree of connectivity dynamism. In MS patients, abnormal global dFC properties and dFC strengths were found mainly in sensorimotor, DMN and salience networks, and were associated with more severe structural MRI damage and with more severe physical and cognitive disability. Conversely, abnormal dFC measures of the temporal network were correlated with better cognitive performances and less severe fatigue. In patients with neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, dFC abnormalities of the DMN, attention and executive networks were associated to more severe clinical manifestations.
Dynamic FC helps to provide novel insights into fundamental properties of functional networks, and improves the understanding of brain reorganization mechanisms. Future technical advances might help to clarify dFC association with disease prognosis and response to treatment.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00040">A Computational Model of Attention Control in Multi-Attribute, Context-Dependent Decision Making</a></h4>

Real-life decisions often require a comparison of multi-attribute options with various benefits and costs, and the evaluation of each option depends partly on the other ones in the choice set (i.e., the choice context). Although reinforcement learning models have successfully described choice behavior, it remains unclear how multi-attribute information is taken into account for making a context-dependent decision in reinforcement learning algorithms. Here we develop a computational model of attention control that includes context effects on multi-attribute decisions, linking a context-dependent choice model with a reinforcement learning model. The overall model suggests that the distinctiveness of attributes guides an individual’s preferences among multi-attribute options via an attention-control mechanism that determines whether choices are selectively biased toward the most distinctive attribute (selective attention) or proportionally distributed based on the relative distinctiveness of attributes (divided attention). To test the model, we conducted a behavioral experiment in rhesus monkeys, in which they made simple multi-attribute decisions over three conditions that manipulated the degree of distinctiveness between alternatives: (1) four foods of different size and calorie; (2) four pieces of the same food in different colors; and (3) four identical pieces of food. The model simulation of the choice behavior captured the preference bias (i.e., overall preference structure) and the choice persistence (repeated choices) in the empirical data, providing evidence for the respective influences of attention and memory on preference bias and choice persistence. Our study provides insights into computations underlying multi-attribute decisions, linking attentional control to decision-making processes.

Microglial receptors CD33 and TREM2 exhibit opposite effects on Aβ pathology and microglial activity in AD mice. In crosstalk between these receptors, TREM2 is required for differential gene expression in 5xFAD mice deficient for CD33 and acts downstream of CD33.

Prions are lethal pathogens, which cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals. They are unique infectious agents and are composed of self-propagating multi-chain assemblies of misfolded host-encoded prion protein (PrP). Understanding prion structure is fundamental to understanding prion disease pathogenesis however to date, the high-resolution structure of authentic ex vivo infectious prions remains unknown. Advances in determining prion structure have been severely impeded by the difficulty in recovering relatively homogeneous prion particles from infected brain and definitively associating infectivity with the PrP assembly state. Recently however, images of highly infectious ex vivo PrP rods that produce prion-strain specific disease phenotypes in mice have been obtained using cryo-electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. These images have provided the most detailed description of ex vivo mammalian prions reported to date and have established that prions isolated from multiple strains have a common hierarchical structure. Misfolded PrP is assembled into 20 nm wide rods containing two fibres, each with double helical repeating substructure, separated by a characteristic central gap 8–10 nm in width. Irregularly structured material with adhesive properties distinct to that of the fibres is present within the central gap of the rod. Prions are clearly distinguishable from non-infectious recombinant PrP fibrils generated in vitro and from all other propagating protein structures so far described in other neurodegenerative diseases. The basic architecture of mammalian prions appears to be exceptional and fundamental to their lethal pathogenicity.

Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) is a Na+-dependent transporter that plays a key role in glutamate homeostasis by removing excess glutamate in the central nervous system (CNS).  GLT-1 dysregulation occurs in various neurological diseases including Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and epilepsy.  Downregulation or dysfunction of GLT-1 has been a common finding across these diseases but how this occurs is still under investigation.  This review aims to highlight post-translational regulation of GLT-1 which leads to its downregulation including sumoylation, palmitoylation, nitrosylation, ubiquitination and subcellular localization.  Various therapeutic interventions to restore GLT-1, their proposed mechanism of action and functional effects will be examined as potential treatments to attenuate the neurological symptoms associated with loss or downregulation of GLT-1.

Numerous neurodegenerative diseases including prion, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are characterized by accumulation of protein aggregates in brain. Prion disease is unique in that the natively folded prion protein forms diverse misfolded aggregates with distinct molecular conformations (strains), which underlie different disease phenotypes. In addition, the conformational strains are able to self-propagate their unique conformations by recruiting normal protein monomers and converting their conformations to misfolded conformers. There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests other aggregation-prone proteins including tau and alpha-synuclein associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, respectively, also behave like a prion that has conformational strains with self-propagation (seeding) property. Moreover, misfolded protein aggregates can promote misfolding and aggregation of different proteins through cross-seeding, which might be associated with co-occurrence of multiple neurodegenerative diseases in the same patient. Elucidation of diverse conformational strains with self-propagation capability and of molecular basis for the cross-talk between misfolded proteins is essential to the development of effective therapeutic intervention.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00022">A Path From Childhood Sensory Processing Disorder to Anxiety Disorders: The Mediating Role of Emotion Dysregulation and Adult Sensory Processing Disorder Symptoms</a></h4>

Although maladaptive sensory processing has been observed among individuals with persistent heightened anxiety, it is unclear if difficulties processing sensory input early in life lead to anxiety disorders in adulthood and what mechanisms would drive this progression. In a transdiagnostic clinical sample of 231 adults characterized by heightened difficulties with emotion regulation, the present study sought to examine whether (a) childhood sensory processing disorder (SPD) symptoms predict an increased probability of an anxiety disorder diagnosis in adulthood and (b) difficulties with emotion regulation and adult SPD symptoms mediate this relationship. Participants were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis-I disorders and self-reported symptoms of SPD experienced in childhood and adulthood. Results from suggested that childhood SPD symptoms were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of a lifetime anxiety disorder diagnosis. Difficulties with emotion regulation fully mediated the relationship between childhood SPD and (a) any anxiety disorder in adulthood and, specifically (b) current generalized anxiety disorder. Further, we found evidence for a candidate model accounting for the relationship among childhood SPD, adulthood SPD, difficulties with emotion regulation, and anxiety disorders in adulthood. Specifically, our data indicated that high symptoms of SPD in childhood may lead to high SPD symptoms in adulthood, which then lead to high emotion dysregulation, ultimately conferring vulnerability for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Taken together, these findings provide preliminary evidence for how sensory processing impairments in childhood may relate to anxiety through difficulties regulating emotion regulation.

Objectives: Trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia (TPHN) often presents with moderate to severe pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia. Conventional analgesic treatments are poorly effective, which seriously affects the quality of life. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) for the treatment of TPHN. 
Methods: A total of 90 TPHN patients were selected between January 2014 and December 2016 in the Department of Pain Management, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups according to the order of enrollment (n=45 per group): group A, peripheral nerve (supraorbital nerve, infraorbital nerve and mental nerve) PRF; group B, gasserian ganglion PRF. Follow-up assessments of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain assessment, SF-36 health status questionnaire, total efficiency rate, and drug dosage of anticonvulsants and opioid analgesics were performed at time points of 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. 
Results: At each postsurgery time point, the VAS decreased, SF-36 (physical and mental components) increased, and drug dosage of anticonvulsants and opioids analgesics decreased in both treatment groups; values at each time point were significantly different from presurgery values (P&lt;0.05). Compared with group A, VAS decreased, SF-36 increased, and dosage of anticonvulsants and opioids analgesics decreased significantly in group B (P&lt;0.05). The total efficiency rates one year after surgery in group A and group B were 68.9% and 86.7%, respectively. The total efficiency rate of group B was statistically higher than that of group A (P&lt;0.05).
Conclusion: PRF relieved TPHN, and gasserian ganglion PRF was more effective than peripheral nerve PRF. The method was effective and improved the quality of life of the patients. PRF is recommended as a treatment for TPHN.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00703">The Effects of Stimulator, Waveform, and Current Direction on Intracortical Inhibition and Facilitation: A TMS Comparison Study</a></h4>

Background: Cortical function is dependent on the balance between excitatory and inhibitory influences. In the human motor cortex, surrogates of these interactions can be measured in-vivo, non-invasively with double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To compare results from data acquired with different available setups and bring data together, it is inevitable to determine whether different TMS setups lead to comparable or differential results.
Objective: We assessed and compared short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) testing four different experimental conditions.
Methods: SICI and ICF were studied with different stimulators (Magstim BiStim² or MagVenture MagPro X100), waveforms (monophasic or biphasic), current directions (anterior-posterior or posterior-anterior) at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1, 3, 10, 15 ms.
Results: We were not able to detect differences for SICI and ICF, when comparing the tested conditions, except for 3 ms SICI in which the anterior-posterior current direction led to stronger modulation. Correlation analysis suggested comparability for 3 ms SICI for the Magstim monophasic posterior-anterior condition with both tested MagVenture conditions. 
Conclusions: 3 ms SICI data sets obtained with two different, commonly used stimulators (Magstim BiStim² or MagVenture MagPro X100) with conventionally used stimulation parameters are largely comparable.  This may allow the combination of data sets in an open science view.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00699">Fingolimod for Irradiation-Induced Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

Background:
Cranial irradiation is a common therapy for the treatment of brain tumors, but unfortunately patients suffer from side effects, particularly cognitive impairment, caused by neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory mechanisms. Finding a therapeutic agent protecting hippocampal neurons would be beneficial. Fingolimod (FTY720), a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator approved for multiple sclerosis, is an immunosuppressant and known to enhance proliferation and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs). 
Objectives:
To investigate whether pre-treatment with FTY720 protects NPCs in vitro and in vivo from irradiation-induced damage. 
Methods:
NPCs were isolated from E13 C57BL/6 wildtype mice, treated at day 0 of differentiation with FTY720 and irradiated on day 6 with 1 Gy. NPCs were analyzed for markers of cell death (PI, Caspase 3), proliferation (Ki67), and differentiation (DCX, βIII-tubulin). Adult C57BL/6 wildtype mice were treated with FTY720 (1 mg/kg) and received a single dose of 6 Gy cranial irradiation at day 7. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed DCX and BrdU as markers of neurogenesis and Iba1, GFAP, and CD3 to visualize inflammation in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone. B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J DCX-luc reporter mice were used for bioluminescence imaging to evaluate the effect of FTY720 on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and the spinal cord of naïve mice. 
Results:
FTY720 protected NPCs against irradiation induced cell death in vitro. Treatment with FTY720 dose-dependently reduced the number of PI+ cells 24 and 96 h after irradiation without effecting proliferation or neuronal differentiation. In vivo treatment resulted in a significant survival of DCX+ neurons in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone 4 weeks after irradiation as well as a slight increase of proliferating cells. FTY720 inhibited microglia activation 24 h after X-ray exposure in the dentate gyrus, while astrocyte activation was unaffected and no lymphocyte infiltrations were found. In naïve mice, FTY720 treatment for 4 weeks had no effect on neurogenesis. 
Conclusions:
FTY720 treatment of NPCs prior to X-ray exposure and of mice prior to cranial irradiation is neuroprotective. No effects on neurogenesis were found.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00685">Tracking the Main States of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Resting State</a></h4>

Dynamical changes have been recently tracked in functional connectivity (FC) calculated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI), when a person is conscious but not carrying out a directed task during scanning. Diverse dynamical FC states (dFC) are believed to represent different internal states of brain, in terms of brain-regional interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol, the signed community clustering with the optimized modularity by two-step procedures, to track dynamical whole brain functional connectivity (dWFC) states. This protocol is assumption free without a priori threshold for the number of clusters. By applying our method on sliding window based dWFC’s with automated anatomical labeling 2 (AAL2), three main dWFC states were extracted from R-fMRI datasets in Human Connectome Project, that are independent on window size. Through extracting the FC features of these states, we found the functional links in state 1 (WFC-C1) mainly involved visual, somatomotor, attention and cerebellar (posterior lobe) modules. State 2 (WFC-C2) was similar to WFC-C1, but more FC’s linking limbic, default mode and frontoparietal modules and less linking the cerebellum, sensory and attention modules. State 3 had more FC’s linking default mode, limbic, and cerebellum, compared to WFC-C1 and WFC-C2. With test of robustness and stability, our work provides a solid, hypothesis-free tool to detect dWFC states for the possibility of tracking rapid dynamical change in FCs among large data set.

Background and Purpose: Cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) are the leading cause of death in the first week following stroke. Despite this, current treatments are limited and fail to address the underlying mechanisms of swelling, highlighting the need for targeted treatments. When screening promising novel agents, it is essential to use clinically-relevant large animal models to increase the likelihood of successful clinical translation.  As such, we sought to develop a survival model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in the sheep and subsequently characterize the temporal profile of cerebral edema and elevated ICP following stroke in this novel, clinically-relevant model. 

Methods: Merino-sheep (27M;31F) were anesthetized and subject to 2 hours tMCAO with reperfusion or sham surgery. Following surgery, animals were allowed to recover and returned to their home pens. At preselected times points ranging from 1 to 7 days post-stroke, animals were re-anesthetized, ICP measured for 4 hours, followed by imaging with MRI to determine cerebral edema, midline shift and infarct volume (T2, FLAIR, DWI). Animals were subsequently euthanized and their brain removed for immunohistochemical analysis. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were also collected and analyzed for substance P (SP) using ELISA.

Results: ICP and MRI scans were normal in sham animals. Following stroke, ICP rose gradually over time and by 5 days was significantly (p&lt;0.0001) elevated above sham levels. Profound cerebral edema was observed as early as 2 days post-stroke and continued to evolve out to 6 days, resulting in significant midline shift which was most prominent at 5 days post-stroke (p&lt;0.01), in keeping with increasing ICP. Serum SP levels were significantly elevated (p&lt;0.01) by 7 days post tMCAO.

Conclusion: We have successfully developed a survival model of ovine tMCAO and characterized the temporal profile of ICP. Peak ICP elevation, cerebral edema and midline shift occurred at day 5-6 following stroke, accompanied by an elevation in serum SP. Our findings suggest that novel therapeutic agents screened in this model targeting cerebral edema and elevated ICP would most likely be effective when administered prior to 5 days, or as early as possible following stroke onset.

Studying and understanding human brain structures and functions have become one of the most challenging issues in neuroscience today. However, the mammalian nervous system is made up of hundreds of millions of neurons and billions of synapses.
This complexity made it impossible to reconstruct such a huge nervous system in the laboratory. So, most researchers focus on C.elegans neural network. The C.elegans neural network is the only biological neural network that is fully mapped. This nervous system is the simplest neural network that exists. However, many fundamental behaviors like movement emerge from this basic network. These features made C.elegans a convenient case to study the nervous systems. Many studies try to propose a network formation model for C.elegans neural network. However, these studies could not meet all characteristics of C.elegans neural network such as significant factors that play a role in the formation of C.elegans neural network. Thus, new models are needed to be proposed in order to explain all aspects of C.elegans neural network.

In this paper, a new model based on game theory is proposed in order to understand the factors affecting the formation of nervous systems, which meet the C.elegans frontal neural network characteristics. In this model, neurons are considered to be agents. The strategy for each neuron includes either making or removing links to other neurons.
 After choosing the basic network, the utility function is built using structural and functional factors. In order to find the coefficients for each of these factors, linear programming is used. Finally, the output network is compared with C.elegans frontal neural network and previous models. The results implicate that the game-theoretical model proposed in this paper can better predict the influencing factors in the formation of C.elegans neural network compared to previous models.

Hibernation is a natural phenomenon in many species which helps them to survive under extreme ambient conditions, such as cold temperatures and reduced availability of food in the winter months. It is characterized by a dramatic and regulated drop of body temperature, which in some cases can be near 0°C. Additionally, neural control of hibernation is maintained over all phases of a hibernation bout, including entrance into, during and arousal from torpor, despite a marked decrease in overall neural activity in torpor. In the present review we provide an overview on what we know about neuronal activity in the hibernating brain focusing on cold-induced adaptations. We discuss pioneer and more recent in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological data and molecular analyses of activity markers which strikingly contributed to our understanding of the brain’s sensitivity to dramatic changes in temperature across the hibernation cycle. Neuronal activity is markedly reduced with decreasing body temperature, and many neurons may fire infrequently in torpor at low brain temperatures. Still, there is convincing evidence that specific regions maintain their ability to generate action potentials in deep torpor, at least in response to adequate stimuli. Those regions include the peripheral system and primary central regions. However, further experiments on neuronal activity are needed to more precisely determine temperature effects on neuronal activity in specific cell types and specific brain nuclei.

Neurodevelopmental disorders, including those involving intellectual disability, are characterized by abnormalities in formation and functions of synaptic circuits. Traditionally, research on synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission in health and disease focused on neurons, however, a growing number of studies have highlighted the role of astrocytes in this context. Tight structural and functional interactions of astrocytes and synapses indeed play important roles in brain functions, and the repertoire of astroglial regulations of synaptic circuits is large and complex.
