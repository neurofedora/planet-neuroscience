              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-130/v1?src=rss">Assessment of Dental Caries among Adolescents in Private Educational Institutions of Kabul City [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective Dental caries continues to be a significant public health concern, particularly prevalent during adolescence. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of dental caries among adolescents aged 10 to 18 years attending two different types of private schools in Kabul City. Materials and Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study included 381 school-going adolescents. Data were collected through pre-structured questionnaires and face-to-face interviews, while oral examinations were conducted by experienced dentists. Both primary and permanent dentitions were assessed for decayed, missing, and filled teeth. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.0, with p < 0.005 considered statistically significant. Results The mean age of participants was 14.6 ± 12.13 years, predominantly boys, as girls above grade six are not permitted to attend school in Afghanistan. The prevalence of dental caries was high (70.1%) and decreased with increasing age (p = 0.004), number of siblings (p < 0.001), and better tooth-brushing habits (p = 0.025). The mean DMFT score was 2.40 ± 2.45. Overall, 45.4% of students had good oral hygiene, 11.3% had poor oral hygiene, and 46.7% presented with dental calculus. Both dental calculus and oral hygiene were significantly associated with tooth-brushing habits and use of dental cleansing agents (p < 0.001). Conclusion This study highlights a high prevalence of dental caries among students aged 10–18 years at private schools in Kabul, varying by school type. Factors such as age and tooth brushing habits significantly influence dental health, emphasizing the urgent need for targeted oral health education and interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-129/v1?src=rss">From Quality Control to Visualization: scToolkit for Reproducible Single-Cell RNA-Seq [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides high-resolution insights into cellular states, yet its analytical workflows are often fragmented and inconsistently documented. Challenges such as technical noise, dropout events, batch effects, and insufficient reporting of method parameters can hinder reproducibility and the interpretation of biological signals. Methods We developed scToolkit, a workflow built on the Scanpy framework to streamline core steps in scRNA-seq analysis. The toolkit implements quality control, preprocessing, clustering, and multiple downstream analytical modules within a unified Python interface. It also incorporates external resources, including curated cell-marker databases and pathway collections, and employs vectorization, just-in-time compilation, parallelization, and optional GPU acceleration to enhance performance. Comprehensive visualization tools support exploratory and comparative analyses. Results We applied scToolkit to a dataset of immune cells from blood and tonsil tissues to illustrate its functionality. The workflow produced interpretable clustering results, informative differential expression analyses, and clear visual comparisons across tissues and conditions. Enhanced plotting modules facilitated the examination of transcriptional differences across clusters and within individual clusters under matched experimental conditions. Conclusions scToolkit provides an accessible and scalable solution for scRNA-seq data analysis, helping users perform rigorous and reproducible workflows with reduced technical burden. Its integration of curated external resources and high-performance computation improves analytical consistency and usability. The workflow is openly available on GitHub, accompanied by documentation and tutorials to support broad adoption.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-128/v1?src=rss">Enhancing Solar Power Forecasting Accuracy Using HMPCS and Machine Learning Techniques: An Applied Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Solar irradiance is a nonlinear and intermittent function, which makes accurate forecasting of solar power generation a challenge. The high variability of meteorological conditions is not well represented by conventional atmospheric models, thus hampering forecasting skill and model robustness. In this work, an advanced hybridization of multi-population cuckoo search (HMPCS) algorithm with machine learning (ML) methods is developed to enhance the prediction performance of photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting with more reliability. Methods In this study, a hybrid modeling framework is proposed, called HMPCS–ML framework which captures the global search capacity of HMPCS and predictive power of sophisticated ML models (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)). Optimizing hyperparameters by balancing exploration and exploitation, the algorithm runs on multi-populations through Lévy flight randomization. Interpolation, normalization, and temporal windowing were utilized to preprocess synthetic meteorological and irradiance datasets. We evaluated the framework by comparing commonly used statistical measures (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R2). Results Moreover, experimental analyses showed that HMPCS–ML models significantly outperformed baseline approaches (Grid Search and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)). Results showed that the optimized LSTM+HMPCS model outperformed other models in terms of lowest RMSE (0.139) and highest R2 (0.93), reflecting the LSTM model’s good fit with practical observations and generalization ability. The optimal LightGBM + HMPCS variant also proved to be consistently better, with reduced error (23% lower than unoptimized models). Conclusions In this regard, the HMPCS–ML framework is a powerful and efficient solution for the optimization of solar power forecasting, improving the predictive performance and calculation efficiency. This research shows the potential of hybrid metaheuristic–ML integration for renewable energy prediction and smart-grid applications in general and indicates further extensions to multi-objective and Transformer-based architectures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-127/v1?src=rss">What Drive Indonesian People to Purchase Modest Fashion? The Moderating Role of Religiosity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aims to examine how religiosity moderates the influence of attitude and electronic word of mouth (E-WOM) on purchase decisions in Indonesia’s modest fashion market. It seeks to provide empirical evidence on how cognitive, social, and spiritual factors interact in shaping Muslim consumers’ purchasing behavior. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach was employed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with data collected from 320 Muslim consumers in Jakarta and surrounding areas. The constructs (attitude, E-WOM, religiosity, and purchase decision) were measured using validated multi-item scales adapted from previous studies. Findings The results indicate that both attitude and E-WOM have significant positive effects on purchase decisions, with E-WOM being the most dominant factor. Religiosity exerts a direct positive influence and strengthens the relationship between attitude and purchase decision, but does not moderate the effect of E-WOM. These findings highlight that while religiosity enhances value-driven behavior, digital influence transcends religious intensity. Practical implications The study suggests that modest fashion marketers should integrate syariah-compliant values with credible digital engagement strategies to foster consumer trust and loyalty. Balancing faith-based authenticity with modern digital communication can enhance brand relevance in the halal fashion market. Originality/value This study extends the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by incorporating religiosity as a moderating factor within the context of Islamic consumer behavior. It contributes to the growing body of Islamic marketing literature by revealing how faith and digital interaction jointly shape purchase decisions in the modest fashion industry.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18946">Schema-based active inference supports rapid generalization of experience and frontal cortical coding of abstract structure</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schemas -- abstract relational structures that capture the commonalities across experiences -- are thought to underlie humans' and animals' ability to rapidly generalize knowledge, rebind new experiences to existing structures, and flexibly adapt behavior across contexts. Despite their central role in cognition, the computational principles and neural mechanisms supporting schema formation and use remain elusive. Here, we introduce schema-based hierarchical active inference (S-HAI), a novel computational framework that combines predictive processing and active inference with schema-based mechanisms. In S-HAI, a higher-level generative model encodes abstract task structure, while a lower-level model encodes spatial navigation, with the two levels linked by a grounding likelihood that maps abstract goals to physical locations. Through a series of simulations, we show that S-HAI reproduces key behavioral signatures of rapid schema-based generalization in spatial navigation tasks, including the ability to flexibly remap abstract schemas onto novel contexts, resolve goal ambiguity, and balance reuse versus accommodation of novel mappings. Crucially, S-HAI also reproduces prominent neural codes reported in rodent medial prefrontal cortex during a schema-dependent navigation and decision task, including task-invariant goal-progress cells, goal-identity cells, and goal-and-spatially conjunctive cells, as well as place-like codes at the lower level. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic account of schema-based learning and inference that bridges behavior, neural data, and theory. More broadly, our findings suggest that schema formation and generalization may arise from predictive processing principles implemented hierarchically across cortical and hippocampal circuits, enabling the generalization of experience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19019">Smooth embeddings in contracting recurrent networks driven by regular dynamics: A synthesis for neural representation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.19019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks trained for time-series prediction often develop latent trajectories that preserve qualitative structure of the dynamical systems generating their inputs. Recent empirical work has documented topology-preserving latent organization in trained recurrent models, and recent theoretical results in reservoir computing establish conditions under which the synchronization map is an embedding. Here we synthesize these threads into a unified account of when contracting recurrent networks yield smooth, topology-preserving internal representations for a broad and biologically relevant class of inputs: regular dynamics on invariant circles and tori.
  Our contribution is an integrated framework that assembles (i) generalized synchronization and embedding guarantees for contracting reservoirs, (ii) regularity mechanisms ensuring differentiability of the synchronization map under mild constraints, and (iii) a base-system viewpoint in which the invariant manifold generating the input stream is treated as the driving system. In this regular setting, the conditions commonly viewed as restrictive in chaotic-attractor analyses become mild and readily satisfied by standard contractive architectures. The framework clarifies how representational content in recurrent circuits is inherently historical: the network state encodes finite windows of input history rather than instantaneous stimuli.
  By consolidating disparate empirical and theoretical results under common assumptions, the synthesis yields concrete, testable expectations about when prediction-trained recurrent circuits should (or should not) form smooth latent embeddings and how required state dimension scales with the intrinsic dimension of the driving dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19125">Stroboscopic motion reversals in delay-coupled neural fields</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.19125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual illusions provide a window into the mechanisms underlying visual processing, and dynamical neural circuit models offer a natural framework for proposing and testing theories of their emergence. We propose and analyze a delay-coupled neural field model that explains stroboscopic percepts arising from the subsampling of a moving, often rotating, stimulus, such as the wagon-wheel illusion. Motivated by the role of activity propagation delays in shaping visual percepts, we study neural fields with both uniform and spatially dependent delays, representing the finite time required for signals to travel along axonal projections. Each module is organized as a ring of neurons encoding angular preference, with instantaneous local coupling and delayed long-range coupling strongest between neurons with similar preference. We show that delays generate a family of coexisting traveling bump solutions with distinct, quantized propagation speeds. Using interface-based asymptotic methods, we reduce the neural field dynamics to a low-dimensional system of coupled delay differential equations, enabling a detailed analysis of speed selection, stability, entrainment, and state transitions. Regularly pulsed inputs induce transitions between distinct speed states, including motion opposite to the forcing direction, capturing key features of visual aliasing and stroboscopic motion reversal. These results demonstrate how delayed neural interactions organize perception into discrete dynamical states and provide a mechanistic explanation for stroboscopic visual illusions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00008">The Copernican Argument for Alien Consciousness; The Mimicry Argument Against Robot Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.00008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On broadly Copernican grounds, we are entitled to assume that apparently behaviorally sophisticated extraterrestrial entities ("aliens") would be conscious. Otherwise, we humans would be inexplicably, implausibly lucky to have consciousness, while similarly behaviorally sophisticated entities elsewhere would be mere shells, devoid of consciousness. However, this Copernican default assumption is canceled in the case of behaviorally sophisticated entities designed to mimic superficial features associated with consciousness ("consciousness mimics"), and in particular a broad class of current, near-future, and hypothetical robots. These considerations, which we formulate, respectively, as the Copernican and Mimicry Arguments, jointly defeat an otherwise potentially attractive parity principle, according to which we should apply the same types of behavioral or cognitive tests to aliens and robots, attributing or denying consciousness similarly to the extent they perform similarly. Our approach is unusual in the following respect: Instead of grounding speculations about alien and robot consciousness in a particular metaphysical or scientific theory about the physical or functional bases of consciousness, we appeal directly to the epistemic principles of Copernican mediocrity and inference to the best explanation.

                arXiv:2601.11018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exposure to psychoactive substances during pregnancy, such as cannabis, can disrupt neurodevelopment and alter large-scale brain networks, yet identifying their neural signatures remains challenging. We introduced KOCOBrain: KuramotO COupled Brain Graph Network; a unified graph neural network framework that integrates structural and functional connectomes via Kuramoto-based phase dynamics and cognition-aware attention. The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario. Applied to the ABCD cohort, KOCOBrain improved prenatal drug exposure prediction over relevant baselines and revealed interpretable structure-function patterns that reflect disrupted brain network coordination associated with early exposure.

                arXiv:2507.14056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the stability gap -- a temporary performance drop on previously learned tasks when new ones are introduced. This phenomenon reflects a mismatch between rapid adaptation and strong retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need for optimization mechanisms that balance plasticity and stability over abrupt distribution changes. While optimizers such as momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit multi-timescale behavior, they still exhibit pronounced stability gaps. Importantly, these gaps persist even under ideal joint training, making it crucial to study them in this setting to isolate their causes from other sources of forgetting. Motivated by how noradrenergic (neuromodulatory) bursts transiently increase neuronal gain under uncertainty, we introduce a dynamic gain scaling mechanism as a two-timescale optimization technique that balances adaptation and retention by modulating effective learning rates and flattening the local landscape through an effective reparameterization. Across domain- and class-incremental MNIST, CIFAR, and mini-ImageNet benchmarks under task-agnostic joint training, dynamic gain scaling effectively attenuates stability gaps while maintaining competitive accuracy, improving robustness at task transitions.

                arXiv:2506.11062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial neural networks.

                arXiv:2601.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heatmap-based non-autoregressive solvers for large-scale Travelling Salesman Problems output dense edge-probability scores, yet final performance largely hinges on the decoder that must satisfy degree-2 constraints and form a single Hamiltonian tour. Greedy commitment can cascade into irreparable mistakes at large $N$, whereas MCTS-guided local search is accurate but compute-heavy and highly engineered. We instead treat the heatmap as a soft edge prior and cast decoding as probabilistic tour construction under feasibility constraints, where the key is to correct local mis-rankings via inexpensive global coordination. Based on this view, we introduce HeatACO, a plug-and-play Max-Min Ant System decoder whose transition policy is softly biased by the heatmap while pheromone updates provide lightweight, instance-specific feedback to resolve global conflicts; optional 2-opt/3-opt post-processing further improves tour quality. On TSP500/1K/10K, using heatmaps produced by four pretrained predictors, HeatACO+2opt achieves gaps down to 0.11%/0.23%/1.15% with seconds-to-minutes CPU decoding for fixed heatmaps, offering a better quality--time trade-off than greedy decoding and published MCTS-based decoders. Finally, we find the gains track heatmap reliability: under distribution shift, miscalibration and confidence collapse bound decoding improvements, suggesting heatmap generalisation is a primary lever for further progress.

                arXiv:2601.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informed down-sampling (IDS) is known to improve performance in symbolic regression when combined with various selection strategies, especially tournament selection. However, recent work found that IDS's gains are not consistent across all problems. Our analysis reveals that IDS performance is worse for problems containing outliers. IDS systematically favors including outliers in subsets which pushes GP towards finding solutions that overfit to outliers. To address this, we introduce ROIDS (Robust Outlier-Aware Informed Down-Sampling), which excludes potential outliers from the sampling process of IDS. With ROIDS it is possible to keep the advantages of IDS without overfitting to outliers and to compete on a wide range of benchmark problems. This is also reflected in our experiments in which ROIDS shows the desired behavior on all studied benchmark problems. ROIDS consistently outperforms IDS on synthetic problems with added outliers as well as on a wide range of complex real-world problems, surpassing IDS on over 80% of the real-world benchmark problems. Moreover, compared to all studied baseline approaches, ROIDS achieves the best average rank across all tested benchmark problems. This robust behavior makes ROIDS a reliable down-sampling method for selection in symbolic regression, especially when outliers may be included in the data set.

                arXiv:2601.19481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calibration of simulators for complex social systems aims to identify the optimal parameter that drives the output of the simulator best matching the target data observed from the system. As many social systems may change internally over time, calibration naturally becomes an online task, requiring parameters to be updated continuously to maintain the simulator's fidelity. In this work, the online setting is first formulated as a dynamic optimization problem (DOP), requiring the search for a sequence of optimal parameters that fit the simulator to real system changes. However, in contrast to traditional DOP formulations, online calibration explicitly incorporates the observational data as the driver of environmental dynamics. Due to this fundamental difference, existing Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization (EDO) methods, despite being extensively studied for black-box DOPs, are ill-equipped to handle such a scenario. As a result, online calibration problems constitute a new set of challenging DOPs. Here, we propose to explicitly learn the posterior distributions of the parameters and the observational data, thereby facilitating both change detection and environmental adaptation of existing EDOs for this scenario. We thus present a pretrained posterior model for implementation, and fine-tune it during the optimization. Extensive tests on both economic and financial simulators verify that the posterior distribution strongly promotes EDOs in such DOPs widely existed in social science.

                arXiv:2601.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their inception, artificial neural networks have relied on manually designed architectures and inductive biases to better adapt to data and tasks. With the rise of deep learning and the expansion of parameter spaces, they have begun to exhibit brain-like functional behaviors. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks remain fundamentally different from biological neural systems in structural organization, learning mechanisms, and evolutionary pathways.
  From the perspective of neuroscience, we rethink the formation and evolution of intelligence and proposes a new neural network paradigm, Brain-like Neural Network (BNN). We further present the first instantiation of a BNN termed LuminaNet that operates without convolutions or self-attention and is capable of autonomously modifying its architecture. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that LuminaNet can achieve self-evolution through dynamic architectural changes. On the CIFAR-10, LuminaNet achieves top-1 accuracy improvements of 11.19%, 5.46% over LeNet-5 and AlexNet, respectively, outperforming MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and DeiT-Tiny among MLP/ViT architectures. On the TinyStories text generation task, LuminaNet attains a perplexity of 8.4, comparable to a single-layer GPT-2-style Transformer, while reducing computational cost by approximately 25% and peak memory usage by nearly 50%. Code and interactive structures are available at https://github.com/aaroncomo/LuminaNet.

                arXiv:2601.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) is a branch of evolutionary computation that seeks high-quality and behaviorally diverse solutions to a problem. While adversarial problems are common, classical QD cannot be easily applied to them, as both the fitness and the behavior depend on the opposing solutions. Recently, Generational Adversarial MAP-Elites (GAME) has been proposed to coevolve both sides of an adversarial problem by alternating the execution of a multi-task QD algorithm against previous elites, called tasks. The original algorithm selects new tasks based on a behavioral criterion, which may lead to undesired dynamics due to inter-side dependencies. In addition, comparing sets of solutions cannot be done directly using classical QD measures due to side dependencies. In this paper, we (1) use an inter-variants tournament to compare the sets of solutions, ensuring a fair comparison, with 6 measures of quality and diversity, and (2) propose two tournament-informed task selection methods to promote higher quality and diversity at each generation. We evaluate the variants across three adversarial problems: Pong, a Cat-and-mouse game, and a Pursuers-and-evaders game. We show that the tournament-informed task selection method leads to higher adversarial quality and diversity. We hope that this work will help further advance adversarial quality diversity.

                arXiv:2601.18846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.

                arXiv:2601.18446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are increasingly implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs) to leverage parallel processing capabilities for enhanced efficiency. However, existing studies largely emphasize the raw speedup obtained by porting individual algorithms from CPUs to GPUs. Consequently, these studies offer limited insight into when and why GPU parallelism fundamentally benefits EAs. To address this gap, we investigate how GPU parallelism alters the behavior of EAs beyond simple acceleration metrics. We conduct a systematic empirical study of 16 representative EAs on 30 benchmark problems. Specifically, we compare CPU and GPU executions across a wide range of problem dimensionalities and population sizes. Our results reveal that the impact of GPU acceleration is highly heterogeneous and depends strongly on algorithmic structure. We further demonstrate that conventional fixed-budget evaluation based on the number of function evaluations (FEs) is inadequate for GPU execution. In contrast, fixed-time evaluation uncovers performance characteristics that are unobservable under small or practically constrained FE budgets, particularly for adaptive and exploration-oriented algorithms. Moreover, we identify distinct scaling regimes in which GPU parallelism is beneficial, saturates, or degrades as problem dimensionality and population size increase. Crucially, we show that large populations enabled by GPUs not only improve hardware utilization but also reveal algorithm-specific convergence and diversity dynamics that are difficult to observe under CPU-constrained settings. Consequently, our findings indicate that GPU parallelism is not strictly an implementation detail, but a pivotal factor that influences how EAs should be evaluated, compared, and designed for modern computing platforms.

Abstract: Energy-based learning algorithms are alternatives to backpropagation and are well-suited to distributed implementations in analog electronic devices. However, a rigorous theory of convergence is lacking. We make a first step in this direction by analysing a particular energybased learning algorithm, Contrastive Learning, applied to a network of linear adjustable resistors. It is shown that, in this setup, Contrastive Learning is equivalent to projected gradient descent on a convex function with Lipschitz continuous gradient, giving a guarantee of convergence of the algorithm for a range of stepsizes. This convergence result is then extended to a stochastic variant of Contrastive Learning.

                Background South Africa continues to underperform in primary mathematics, with persistent foundational gaps across content and cognitive domains. This study examines domain-specific patterns of mathematics achievement using data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2023, benchmarking South African Grade 5 learners against Singaporean Grade 4 learners. Methods A quantitative secondary analysis was conducted using nationally representative TIMSS 2023 datasets comprising 10,424 South African learners from 285 schools and 6,530 Singaporean learners from 181 schools. In TIMSS 2023, South Africa assessed learners in Grade 5 using the internationally standardised TIMSS Grade 4 mathematics assessment framework, a practice adopted within TIMSS where curriculum exposure aligns more closely with this level. Singapore assessed learners at Grade 4 using the same instruments. Mathematics achievement was analysed across content domains (number, measurement and geometry, and data) and cognitive domains (knowing, applying, and reasoning). Weighted estimates, mean differences, and effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were computed in line with IEA guidelines. Results South African learners performed well below the international centre point across all domains. The largest content-level gap relative to Singapore occurred in measurement and geometry, indicating persistent weaknesses in spatial reasoning. At the cognitive level, the most pronounced deficit was in the knowing domain, reflecting fragile mastery of basic facts and procedural fluency. Although performance in applying was comparatively stronger, limitations in foundational knowledge constrained progression to reasoning, particularly in non-routine problem-solving. Conclusions Weak foundations, underdeveloped spatial reasoning, and limited opportunities for higher-order thinking characterise early mathematics learning in South Africa. Targeted support for number fluency and geometry instruction, alongside pedagogical approaches that leverage application to scaffold reasoning, is required. Improved alignment between curriculum design, teacher development, and assessment practices is essential for advancing equitable foundational learning outcomes.

                <p>Investigations into the neural basis of behavior frequently employ calcium imaging to measure neuronal activity. Across studies, however, seemingly reasonable but highly diverse methodological choices are typically made to assess the selectivity of individual neurons to task states. Here, we examine systematically the effect of parameter choices, along the pipeline from data acquisition through statistical testing, on the inferred encoding preferences of individual neurons. We use, as an experimental testbed, calcium imaging in the medial prefrontal cortex of freely behaving mice engaged in a classic exploration-avoidance task with animal-controlled state transitions, namely, navigation in the elevated zero maze. We report that most of the key parameters in the pipeline substantially impact the inferred selectivity of neurons and do so in distinct ways. Using novel accuracy and robustness metrics, we directly compare the quality of inference across combinations of parameter levels and discover an optimal combination. We validate its optimality using resampling methods and demonstrate its generality across the two common analytical approaches used to assess neuronal selectivity&mdash;average response rate-dependent selectivity indices and continuous time-dependent regression coefficients. Together, our results not only identify an optimal parameter setting for reliably assessing encoding preferences of cortical excitatory neurons using GCaMP6f calcium imaging but also establish a general data-driven procedure for identifying such optimal settings for other cell types, brain areas, and tasks.</p>

                <p>The life cycle of the model nematode <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> involves a choice between two alternative developmental trajectories. Hermaphroditic larvae can either become reproductive adults or, under conditions of crowding or low food availability, enter a long-term, stress-resistant diapause known as the dauer stage. Chemical signals from a secreted larval pheromone promote the dauer trajectory in a concentration-dependent manner, and their influence can be antagonized by increased availability of a microbial food source. The decision is known to be under neuronal control, involving both sensory and interneurons. However, little is known about the dynamics of the underlying circuit, and the circuit mechanisms by which short-term fluctuations in the ratio of food and pheromone experienced by individual larvae are remembered and averaged over several hours. To investigate this, we quantitatively characterized the neuronal responses to food and pheromone inputs by measuring calcium traces from ASI and AIA neurons, each of which has previously been implicated in regulation of dauer entry. We found that calcium in ASI increases linearly in response to food and similarly decreases in response to pheromone. Notably, the ASI response persists well beyond removal of the food stimulus, thus encoding a memory of recent food exposure. In contrast, AIA reports instantaneous food availability and is unaffected by pheromone. We discuss how these findings may inform our understanding of this long-term decision-making process.</p>

                Abstract* Critical thinking is an essential skill in education as it enables students to develop problem-solving and analytical abilities. This study aims to analyze elementary school students’ critical thinking skills in understanding Serat Centhini texts from a gender difference perspective. A descriptive quantitative approach was employed to examine differences in critical thinking skills between male and female students in their understanding of Serat Centhini texts. The participants consisted of 186 fifth-grade elementary school students in Surakarta, which selected through stratified cluster random sampling, comprising 100 male students and 86 female students. The instrument used was Critical Thinking on Texts, developed based on Ennis’s critical thinking indicators, including focus, reasoning, inference, situation, and clarity. Data were collected through Indonesian language-learning activities incorporating cultural texts and analyzed using SPSS version 25 with descriptive statistics, crosstabulation, and odds ratio analysis. The finding reveals a clear difference between male and female students in critical skills toward Serat Centhini texts, where 66.3% of female students were categorized as having high critical thinking skills, whereas only 45% of male students reached the same level. The odds ratios indicate that female students are more likely than male students to achieve a high level of critical thinking. The most prominent differences were found in the indicators of inference and situation, which relate to the ability to understand implicit meanings and the text’s moral context. These findings confirm that reading experiences and gender-based cognitive-affective factors may influence children’s depth of critical thinking when engaging with traditional literary texts. This study recommends the integration of cultural texts such as Serat Centhini into Indonesian language learning to enhance students’ critical literacy and promote cognitive equity across genders from the elementary school level.

                Following a recent keynote on life cycle engineering, a vibrant debate arose regarding the significance of maintenance for environmental footprints. It has become clear to us that this aspect is currently overlooked in broader sustainability discussions. Evidence, for example from aviation, demonstrates that maintenance activities can materially shape the environmental performance of products. In some cases, they are a significant environmental burden; in others, a powerful lever for impact reduction. Therefore, ecologically informed maintenance concepts offer opportunities to optimize the use stage. We advocate for integrating maintenance systematically into life cycle assessments and engineering decision-making to achieve more sustainable products and processes.

                Background Student-staff partnership (SSP) in higher education (HE) is rooted in democratic education and critical pedagogy, advocating for active student engagement. While widely recognised for fostering student success, SSP initiatives vary in definition, implementation, and impact. In Ireland, national policy has positioned SSP as central to student engagement, yet there is limited synthesis of the contextual factors and mechanisms influencing its success. Existing literature highlights benefits such as increased engagement and enhanced learning but often overlooks challenges, including power dynamics, resistance to change, and inconsistent institutional commitment. Aim This protocol outlines the methodology for a realist review, forming the first stage of a broader realist inquiry into SSP initiatives. The review will synthesise existing evidence to understand how, why, and in what contexts SSP initiatives succeed or face challenges in HE. Specifically, it will identify the contextual factors, mindsets, and engagement strategies that enable meaningful partnerships, as well as mechanisms for overcoming barriers. The review will generate initial programme theories (IPTs) to inform a subsequent realist evaluation within University College Dublin (UCD). Method A realist review methodology will be used to explore the interactions between context, mechanisms, and outcomes in SSP initiatives. The study will follow a five-stage realist review process: scoping the literature, developing IPTs, systematically reviewing evidence, synthesising findings, and refining theories with expert input. The Context-Mechanism-Outcome Configuration (CMOC) framework will guide the analysis. Conclusion This protocol sets out the approach for developing evidence-informed programme theories on SSP. These theories will underpin a subsequent realist evaluation within UCD to refine SSP implementation strategies. Findings will inform institutional strategies, policy development, and academic practice, with dissemination through academic and practitioner-focused outputs.

                Abstract* Background Technological progress requires educational programs to employ tools that foster creativity and develop educational skills. In Ecuador, the Ministry of Education’s curriculum has not yet incorporated this approach; however, many institutions have introduced mechanisms by implementing STEAM in the classroom. Methods A qualitative, cross-sectional exploratory study examined STEAM skill levels in children aged 5 to 8 attending public schools in Ibarra. Six public institutions were selected through convenience sampling. Classroom observation was used to assess STEAM skills, and systematic observation of pedagogical workshops documented the cognitive and attitudinal skills associated with STEAM learning. Results STEAM proficiency peaks at age 7 (80%), declines at age 6 (59%), and recovers modestly at age 8 (62%), revealing a non-linear developmental curve. Gender gaps are small overall but widen sharply at age 7, where girls outperform boys by 24 percentage points (86% vs. 62%), marking a critical tipping point for targeted support. Institutional clusters emerge: EI-01 stands out (79% high compliance, 4% non-compliance); EI-04/05/06 occupy an intermediate level (53–57%); EI-02/03 fall below 50%, with EI-02 showing the largest deficit (37%). Conclusions Inductive analysis reveals classroom knowledge and practice gaps; the results, disaggregated by sex, age, institution, and competency domain, provide a robust baseline for planning interventions that strengthen early STEAM skills and transform teaching praxis. This diagnosis will guide the design of strategies aimed at developing STEAM during the first years of basic education in the local context.

Solving partial or ordinary differential equation models in cardiac electrophysiology is a computationally demanding task, particularly when high-resolution meshes are required to capture the complex dynamics of the heart. Moreover, in clinical applications, it is essential to employ computational tools that provide only relevant information, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation. In this work, we exploit two recently proposed operator learning approaches, namely Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and Kernel Operator Learning (KOL), to learn the operator mapping the applied stimulus in the physical domain into the activation and repolarization time distributions. These data-driven methods are evaluated on synthetic 2D and 3D domains, as well as on a physiologically realistic left ventricle geometry. Notably, while the learned map between the applied current and activation time has its modeling counterpart in the Eikonal model, no equivalent partial differential equation (PDE) model is known for the map between the applied current and repolarization time. Our results demonstrate that both FNO and KOL approaches are robust to hyperparameter choices and computationally efficient compared to traditional PDE-based Monodomain models. These findings highlight the potential use of these surrogate operators to accelerate cardiac simulations and facilitate their clinical integration.

Osteocytes, the most abundant and mechanosensitive cells in bone tissue, play a pivotal role in bone homeostasis and mechano-responsiveness, orchestrating the delicate balance between bone formation and resorption under daily activity. Studying osteocyte connectivity and understanding their intricate arrangement within the lacunar canalicular network is essential for unravelling bone physiology, which is significantly disrupted during ageing. Much work has been carried out to investigate this relationship, often involving high resolution microscopy of discrete fragments of this network, alongside advanced computational modelling of individual cells. However, traditional methods of segmenting and measuring osteocyte connectomics are time-consuming and labour-intensive, often hindered by human subjectivity and limited throughput. In this study, we explored the application of deep learning and computer vision techniques to automate the segmentation and measurement of osteocyte connectomics, enabling more efficient and accurate analysis. For this specific application, once trained, the analysis was completed within 10 seconds, compared to manual segmentation time of 130 hours. We compared a number of state-of-the-art computer vision models (U-Nets and Vision Transformers) to successfully segment the osteocyte network, finding that an Attention U-Net model can accurately segment and measure 81.8% of osteocytes and 42.1% of dendritic processes, when compared to manual labelling. While further development is required, we demonstrated that this degree of accuracy is already sufficient to distinguish between bones of young (2-month-old) and aged (36-month-old) mice, as well as partially capturing the degeneration induced by genetic modification of osteocytes. Comparison of the model predictions with manual measurements showed no significant difference, indicating that, with additional training, such deep learning algorithms could be trained to human-level accuracy when measuring the osteocyte network. By harnessing the power of these advanced technologies, further developments will likely shed light on the complexities of osteocyte networks with ever-increasing efficiency.

                <p>by Manu Aggarwal, Vipul Periwal</p>

Protease inhibitors (PIs) target the protease (PR) enzyme to suppress viral replication. Their efficacy in human immunodeficiency virus treatment is compromised by the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Therefore, forecasting drug-resistance during viral evolution would help in the design of effective treatment strategies. To this end, we develop a framework that bridges two distinct data sets. First, we train probabilistic models to learn coevolutionary information in observed PR genotypes in different PI treatment regimens. We use these models to infer transition probabilities of point-mutations conditioned on the genotype and the treatment regimen. Second, we train another set of models to infer drug resistance of PR genotypes to different PIs using data of clinically measured drug resistance. We use these models together to simulate evolutionary trajectories and predict drug resistance. Importantly, we use these simulations to forecast the emergence of persistent drug resistant genotypes. Our analysis shows that the dual therapy of Atazanavir (ATV) and Ritonavir (RTV) is the multi-PI treatment regimen least likely to induce drug resistance. We also conduct an exhaustive ablation study of all possible mutations and predict seven point-mutations as critical for drug resistance. Interestingly, our results highlight the necessity of the amino-acid polymorphism of L63P by predicting that it is critical in developing resistance to Nelfinavir (NFV). The results validate that our framework effectively extracts and combines biological information from the distinct data sets of observed genotypes and drug resistance, while also tackling the challenge of sparsity of available sequence data compared to the large combinatorial complexity of protein evolution and changing functionality in dynamic environments.

                <p>by Dharmik R. Rathod, Justin D. Silverman</p>

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a critical step in amplicon-based microbial community profiling, allowing the selective amplification of marker genes such as 16S rRNA from environmental or host-associated samples. Despite its widespread use, PCR is known to introduce amplification bias, where some DNA sequences are preferentially amplified over others due to factors such as primer-template mismatches, sequence GC content, and secondary structures. Although these biases are known to affect transcript abundance, their implications for ecological metrics remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of how PCR-bias influences both within-samples (<i>α</i>-diversity) and between-sample (<i>β</i>-diversity) analyses. We show that perturbation-invariant diversity measures remain unaffected by PCR bias, but widely used metrics such as Shannon diversity and Weighted-Unifrac are sensitive. To address this, we provide theoretical and empirical insight into how PCR-induced bias varies across ecological analyses and community structures, and we offer practical guidance on when bias-correction methods should be applied. Our findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate diversity metrics for PCR-based microbial ecology workflows and offer guidance for improving the reliability of diversity analyses.

                <p>by Ryota Masuki, Donn Liew, Ee Hou Yong</p>

Predicting RNA structures containing pseudoknots remains computationally challenging due to high processing costs and complexity. While standard methods for pseudoknot prediction require <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>6</sup>) time complexity, we present a hierarchical approach that significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining prediction accuracy. Our method analyzes RNA structures by dividing them into contiguous regions of unpaired bases (“sections”) derived from known secondary structures. We examine pseudoknot interactions between sections using a nearest-neighbor energy model with dynamic programming. Our algorithm scales as O(n2ℓ4), offering substantial computational advantages over existing global prediction methods. Analysis of 726 transfer messenger RNA and 454 Ribonuclease P RNA sequences reveals that biologically relevant pseudoknots are highly concentrated among section pairs with large minimum free energy (MFE) gain. Over 90% of connected section pairs appear within just the top 3% of section pairs ranked by MFE gain. For 2-clusters, our method achieves high prediction accuracy with sensitivity exceeding 0.9 and positive predictive value above 0.8. For 3-clusters, we discovered asymmetric behavior where “former” section pairs (formed early in the sequence) are predicted accurately, while “latter” section pairs do not follow local energy predictions. This asymmetry suggests that complex pseudoknot formation follows sequential co-transcriptional folding rather than global energy minimization, providing insights into RNA folding dynamics.

                <p>by Gesse Roure, Vishal S. Sivasankar, Roseanna N. Zia</p>

Nucleoid compaction in bacteria is commonly attributed to cytoplasmic crowding, DNA supercoiling, and nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). In most bacterial species, including <i>E. coli</i>, these effects condense the chromosome into a subcellular region and largely exclude ribosomes to the surrounding cytoplasm. In contrast, many <i>Mycoplasma</i>—including the <i>Mycoplasma</i>-derived synthetic cell JCVI-Syn3A—exhibit a cell-spanning nucleoid with ribosomes distributed throughout. Because <i>Mycoplasma</i> are evolutionarily distant from model bacteria like <i>E. coli</i> and have undergone extensive genome reduction, Syn3A is a natural testbed for genotype-to-‘physiotype’-to-phenotype, in which genome-encoded composition reshapes cell-scale organization. Here we show that this organization can arise from Syn3A’s unusually high abundance of positively charged proteins. We develop a coarse-grained model that explicitly and physically represents a sequence-accurate chromosome together with ribosomes and cytoplasmic proteins at physiological size, charge, and abundance. With DNA and ribosomes alone, the cell-spanning nucleoid relaxes toward a compacted state that sterically excludes ribosomes, indicating missing physics beyond polymer mechanics and excluded volume. When we include electrostatic interactions by assigning effective charges to each biomolecule, positively charged proteins dynamically enrich around ribosomes and DNA, partially screening ribosome–DNA repulsion. This charge shielding enables ribosomes to penetrate the nucleoid mesh and stabilizes a cell-spanning nucleoid consistent with experiment. This behavior is robust across parameter sweeps: DNA stiffness, heterogeneous mesh size, and crowding favor compaction, whereas electrostatics and size polydispersity promote expansion, with consequences for migration pathways within the nucleoid and thus transcription–translation dynamics. The framework is parameterized directly from genomic and proteomic composition and is transferable to other bacteria.

                <p>by Adelisa Avezzú, Stefano Longobardi, Anita Alvarez-Laviada, Francisca Schultz, Julia Gorelik, Catherine Williamson, Steven A. Niederer</p>

Fetal cardiac arrhythmias can lead to stillbirth, but direct studies on the human fetal heart are challenging. To address this, we developed a computational model of human fetal ventricular myocyte (hfVM) electrophysiology, focusing on early gestation (10 weeks). This model incorporates major ionic currents, including fetal-specific T-type calcium and funny currents, and is calibrated using mRNA expression data and experimental measurements. The hfVM model replicates key electrophysiological features, such as a shorter action potential duration and a more positive resting membrane potential compared to adult cells. Global sensitivity analysis reveals that the resting membrane potential is primarily influenced by the funny current and I<sub>K1</sub>, while action potential repolarisation depends mainly on I<sub>Kr</sub>. Additionally, the sarcoplasmic reticulum contributes to calcium release, but less so than in adults; instead, the T-type calcium current and the sodium-calcium exchanger are more prominent in initiating calcium transients. This is the first human fetal ventricular myocyte model available for studying fetal cardiac physiology, pathology, and potential pharmacological interventions. It provides novel insights into the dominant ion channels governing fetal electrophysiology and calcium dynamics, offering a foundation for understanding arrhythmias and guiding therapeutic strategies.

The high prevalence of cancer immunotherapy resistance, coupled with substantial tumor heterogeneity, underscores the urgent need for innovative therapeutic targets. A deeper understanding of immunoregulatory mechanisms would provide new targets and combination therapeutic strategies for tumor therapy. In this study, we demonstrate that HSD17B12 enhances anti-tumor immunity and represents a promising therapeutic target. Mechanistically, HSD17B12 promotes lysosome-dependent degradation of PD-L1 via the VAC14 and ESCRT complexes across various malignancies, regardless of its 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase activity. HSD17B12-deficient cells displayed PD-L1 accumulation in both tumor cells and exosomes, reducing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Notably, we found a significant negative correlation between HSD17B12 and PD-L1 expression in colorectal cancer tissues. Furthermore, high HSD17B12 expression in CRC correlated with increased infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. Based on these findings, we designed a peptide, HSD-CC1-NPGY, which effectively reduces PD-L1 expression in cells and suppresses tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, our results establish HSD17B12 as an important regulator of anti-tumor immunity and a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

Retinal organoids have become important models for studying development and disease, yet stochastic heterogeneity in the formation of cell types, tissues, and phenotypes remains a major challenge. This limits our ability to precisely experimentally address the early developmental trajectories towards these outcomes. Here, we utilize deep learning to predict the differentiation path and resulting tissues in retinal organoids well before they become visually discernible. Our approach effectively bypasses the challenge of organoid-related heterogeneity in tissue formation. For this, we acquired a high-resolution time-lapse imaging dataset comprising about 1,000 organoids and over 100,000 images enabling precise temporal tracking of organoid development. By combining expert annotations with advanced image analysis of organoid morphology, we characterized the heterogeneity of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and lens tissues, as well as global organoid morphologies over time. Using this training set, our deep learning approach accurately predicts the emergence and size of RPE and lens tissue formation as well as similarities in overall organoid morphology on an organoid-by-organoid basis at early developmental stages, refining our understanding of when early lineage decisions are made. This approach advances knowledge of tissue and phenotype decision-making in organoid development and can inform the design of similar predictive platforms for other organoid systems, paving the way for more standardized and reproducible organoid research. Finally, it provides a direct focus on early developmental time points for in-depth molecular analyses, alleviated from confounding effects of heterogeneity.

                Background Class imbalance is a frequent and severe problem in medical datasets, where instances from the minority class are usually high risk or disease positive. Most traditional classifiers suffer from a biasness towards the majority class, resulting in a poor detection rate of the minority class and, therefore, decreased confidence in prediction systems in medical applications. Methods In this paper, we present an optimized ensemble by differential evolution (OEDE), a novel ensemble learning framework, to address this problem. OEDE harmonizes three dissimilar base learners (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) and trains each using class-balancing techniques. Next, the model utilized Differential Evolution (DE) to discover the most appropriate ensemble weights to maximize the area under the ROC curve (AUC) on a validation dataset. Result We conducted experiments on four real-world medical datasets, whose imbalance ratios vary from 1.89 to 14.6, using OEDE in the original, SMOTE, and ADASYN balanced conditions. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gain of OEDE on the challenging Thoracic dataset, achieving a 70.08% AUC, outperforming the standard Random Forest (50.82%) and AdaBoost (47.15%) baselines by over 19%. Additionally, on the Cervical Cancer dataset, the model achieved a peak AUC of 97.89%. The results indicate that the proposed OEDE consistently outperforms or is competitive with traditional ensemble models in terms of AUC, F1-score, and Recall. ROC curve analysis also approved the OEDE’s superior discriminative capabilities. Conclusion The proposed OEDE framework effectively improves minority class detection in imbalance medical datasets. Its robust and flexible design makes it a promising tool for healthcare risk prediction tasks where minority class groups need to be well identified.

                Background Assurance of Learning is a process focused on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of education. It involves implementing practices, policies, and procedures intended to ensure the development of skills, competencies, and knowledge expected in a specific educational program or course. In the subjects Chemistry and General Chemistry I at the Universidad de La Sabana, persistent issues with low academic performance have resulted in rising course repetition rates, lack of motivation, and student dropout. Methods The present study examines targeted didactic strategies for students at risk of academic failure in these subjects, representing an innovation in the field of education and contributing to the domain of learning assurance in Chemistry. It was conducted under a mixed-methods approach with a quasi-experimental and cross-sectional design. A predictive trend analysis was carried out, and strategies were identified, selected, and implemented with consideration for students’ perceptions and assessments. Two samples were analyzed: a characterization sample of 411 students who took the subjects between the second semester of 2020 and the first semester of 2023, and an experimental sample comprising students from the second semester of 2023 and the first semester of 2024. Results The results revealed that participation in the implemented strategies led to improved academic performance, particularly for students with lower Saber 11 scores. Strategy 1 (leveling course) showed the greatest positive impact, with statistically significant differences in performance. Moreover, students reported high satisfaction with the strategies, especially regarding their usefulness, engagement, and relevance. Conclusions These findings suggest that personalized and contextualized didactic strategies are effective in supporting students at risk of academic failure in general chemistry courses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1161/v2?src=rss">GBWOEM: A Gradient-Based Weight Optimization Model for Improved Predictive Accuracy in Healthcare [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The use of ensemble learning has been crucial for improving predictive accuracy in healthcare, especially with regard to critical diagnostic and classification problems. Ensemble models combine the strengths of multiple ML models and reduce the risk of misclassification, which is important in healthcare, where accurate predictions impact patient outcomes. Methods This study introduces the Gradient-Based Weight Optimized Ensemble Model (GBWOEM), an advanced ensemble technique that optimizes the weights of five base models: Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Logistic Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), through optimizing the weights. Two variants, GBWOEM-R (random weight initialization) and GBWOEM-U (uniform weight initialization), were proposed and tested on five healthcare-related datasets: breast cancer, Pima Indians Diabetes Database, diabetic retinopathy debrecen, obesity level estimation based on physical condition and eating habits, and thyroid diseases. Results The test accuracy of the proposed models increased to 0.48-8.26% over the traditional ensemble models, such as Adaboost, Catboost, GradientBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Performance metrics, including ROC-AUC analyses, confirmed the model’s efficacy in handling imbalanced data, highlighting its potential for advancing predictive consistency in healthcare applications. Conclusion The GBWOEM model improves the predictive accuracy and offers a reliable solution for healthcare applications even when dealing with the imbalance data. This strategy has the potential to ensure patient outcomes and diagnostic consistency in healthcare settings.

<p>This study underscores mitochondrial dysfunction as a central driver of ruptured intracranial aneurysms (RIAs) pathogenesis, offering novel diagnostic targets and treatment strategies.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are pathological dilatations of cerebral blood vessels, and their rupture can lead to severe mortality and disability. Therefore, identifying those at risk of rupture is of considerable clinical significance. We screened 3740 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ruptured IA (RIA) versus unruptured IA (UIA) from the GSE13353 dataset. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify RIA-related module genes. After the intersection of DEGs and module genes with mitochondria-related genes (MRGs), MTX1, BCL2A1, BID, UCP2, ME2, VAV1, CYBA, and CYBB were identified as mitochondria-associated signatures of RIA. MTX1 was identified as the key diagnostic biomarker using three machine learning methods. While the diagnostic potential of this eight-gene signature was supported by an independent dataset (GSE122897), experimental validation in clinical and animal models confirmed significant dysregulation of ME2, UCP2, BCL2A1, and CYBA in RIA. Notably, MTX1 showed a consistent but non-significant trend of downregulation in these experimental assays. Immune infiltration analysis revealed a pro-inflammatory and stromal-enriched microenvironment in RIA, characterized by significantly elevated abundances of fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages, and showing distinct correlation patterns between key mitochondrial genes and specific immune and stromal cell populations. The construction of transcription factors and endogenous RNA networks was used to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. Finally, potential therapeutic drugs such as rosiglitazone were identified by drug prediction, and the molecular docking of ME2 with cryptotanshinone suggested a new therapeutic approach. This study may provide a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of RIA targeting mitochondria.</p>

                Background SARS-CoV-2 infection manifests as a multi-system disease with substantial extrapulmonary involvement. Hepatic dysfunction represents a critical prognostic determinant, particularly among patients presenting with gastrointestinal manifestations—a distinct clinical phenotype requiring comprehensive investigation of liver injury predictors. Methods This prospective cross-sectional study enrolled 347 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms across three tertiary medical centers in Al-Anbar, Iraq (March 2021–July 2025). Hepatic involvement was defined biochemically as aminotransferase elevation exceeding twice the upper limit of normal, without imaging or histopathological confirmation. Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses identified associations with liver enzyme elevation, though causality cannot be established. Results Hepatic involvement occurred in 168 patients (48.4%). Variables associated with biochemical hepatic dysfunction included age ≥61 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62–4.43, P<0.001), male sex (aOR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.12–2.96, P=0.016), diabetes mellitus (aOR=2.94, 95% CI: 1.74–4.97, P<0.001), hypertension (aOR=2.12, 95% CI: 1.28–3.51, P=0.004), and severe COVID-19 disease (aOR=10.42, 95% CI: 5.48–19.81, P<0.001). Alanine aminotransferase >80 U/L demonstrated optimal predictive performance (area under the curve [AUC]=0.896; sensitivity 78.6%, specificity 82.1%). An internally validated clinical scoring system achieved 82.1% sensitivity and 78.8% specificity; external validation remains pending. Conclusions Biochemical hepatic abnormalities correlate strongly with COVID-19 severity, though distinguishing direct viral hepatotoxicity from systemic illness effects, medication-induced injury, or hypoxic hepatitis remains challenging without structural assessment. The proposed risk stratification model requires external validation before clinical implementation.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aims to examine the impact of applying green accounting on the quality of sustainability reports at the Central Bank of Iraq within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, It examined the moderating effect of environmental awareness on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach A structured questionnaire was used to survey 320 senior officials and accountants regarding green accounting practices, environmental awareness, and reporting quality. Quantitative models using structural equation modeling (SEM) employed to analyze direct and indirect relationships between variables. Findings The results showed that green accounting practices had a direct negative impact on the quality of sustainability reports, indicating a discrepancy between objectives and implementation. However, the presence of environmental awareness among leaders reduced the organizational confusion resulting from the new systems represented by green accounting. The results also indicate factors, such as the legal framework and technological maturity, enhancing the effectiveness of green accounting initiatives. Practical implications Adopting green accounting without the necessary infrastructure weakens the quality of sustainability reports. A key factor in this is environmental awareness among officials, which promotes transparency and sustainability. Therefore, organizations must understand that the successful implementation of green accounting begins with raising environmental awareness among leaders and employees, training and developing human resources to use these systems, and improving existing technological systems and regulations to align with them and enhance the chances of successful green accounting implementation. Originality/value This study makes a pivotal contribution to the academic literature, adding to the limited body of research on the dynamic links between green accounting, sustainability reporting and environmental awareness in banks.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-121/v1?src=rss">Reimagining Storytelling for the Sustainable Quality Education via VR and Digital Narratives: A Study on Ernest Cline's Ready Player One [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study investigates how digital technology, particularly virtual reality (VR), is transforming narrative patterns in modern English literature. It explores the shift from linear storytelling to immersive, participatory forms. Methods The research employs a literary analysis of Ernest Cline’s novel Ready Player One, using Mikhail Bakhtin’s “chronotope” theory as a framework. This approach examines the alteration of time-space dynamics within narrative construction. Results The analysis demonstrates that VR facilitates a move from chronological plots to exploratory spatial narratives, where users gather scattered story elements. In texts like Ready Player One, the virtual OASIS platform enables audience transformation into active characters, blurring the lines between reality and fiction, consumer and creator. This narrative agency aligns with broader pedagogical benefits, supporting immersive learning in relation to Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education). Conclusions The study concludes that VR fundamentally reshapes narrative development, structure, and purpose, accelerating a shift toward interactive, participant-driven storytelling. The integration of VR with traditional narrative is not merely a technical advance but a significant reinterpretation of storytelling with substantial implications for education, culture, and society.

                The functional characterization of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) has been disproportionately shaped by the paradigm of cytoplasmic miRNA sponging, a model that, while valid for many transcripts, has overshadowed a more fundamental and impactful role. This opinion article argues for a critical conceptual shift, positing that the most potent role of many lncRNAs is not as competitive sponges, but as primary architects and scaffolds of the epigenetic landscape. The prevailing focus on the cytoplasm has created diagnostic and therapeutic blind spots. We contend that deliberately recentering the narrative around lncRNAs as nuclear scaffolds and specificity factors for chromatin-modifying complexes is essential for identifying precise disease biomarkers and developing the next generation of targeted epigenetic therapies.

                Díaz-Pinés Cort et al. identify a 100-gene inflammation signature and a broader 2,000-gene inflammatome, consistently upregulated across inflammatory diseases and tissues. They show that these resources can detect inflammation in transcriptomic and proteomic datasets, distinguish disease-specific signals from general inflammation, and generate sample-wise inflammation scores correlated with disease activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100340">Directed differentiation of functional corticospinal-like neurons from endogenous SOX6+/NG2+ cortical progenitors</a></h4>

              
                Corticospinal neurons (CSN) centrally degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), along with spinal motor neurons, and loss of voluntary motor function in spinal cord injury (SCI) results from damage to CSN axons. For functional regeneration of specifically affected neuronal circuitry <i>in vivo</i>, or for optimally informative disease modeling and/or therapeutic screening <i>in vitro</i>, it is important to reproduce the type or subtype of neurons involved. No such appropriate <i>in vitro</i> models exist with which to investigate CSN selective vulnerability and degeneration in ALS, or to investigate routes to regeneration of CSN circuitry for ALS or SCI, critically limiting the relevance of much research. Here, we identify that the HMG-domain transcription factor <i>Sox6</i> is expressed by a subset of NG2+ endogenous cortical progenitors in postnatal and adult cortex, and that <i>Sox6</i> suppresses a latent neurogenic program by repressing proneural <i>Neurog2</i> expression by progenitors. We FACS-purify these progenitors from postnatal mouse cortex and establish a culture system to investigate their potential for directed differentiation into CSN. We then employ a multi-component construct with complementary and differentiation-sharpening transcriptional controls (activating <i>Neurog2</i>, <i>Fezf2</i>, while antagonizing <i>Olig2</i> with <i>VP16:Olig2</i>). We generate corticospinal-like neurons from SOX6+/NG2+ cortical progenitors and find that these neurons differentiate with remarkable fidelity compared with corticospinal neurons in vivo. They possess appropriate morphological, molecular, transcriptomic, and electrophysiological characteristics, without characteristics of the alternate intracortical or other neuronal subtypes. We identify that these critical specifics of differentiation are not reproduced by commonly employed <i>Neurog2</i>-driven differentiation. Neurons induced by <i>Neurog2</i> instead exhibit aberrant multi-axon morphology and express molecular hallmarks of alternate cortical projection subtypes, often in mixed form. Together, this developmentally-based directed differentiation from cortical progenitors sets a precedent and foundation for <i>in vitro</i> mechanistic and therapeutic disease modeling, and toward regenerative neuronal repopulation and circuit repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102412">TRPV3 channel activity helps cortical neurons stay active during fever</a></h4>

              
                Fever raises body temperature (T<sub>b</sub>) from ~37°C to beyond 38.4°C to combat pathogens. While generally well tolerated below 40°C, in rare cases, fever can abnormally elevate neural activity and induce seizures in neurotypical children aged 2–5 years. This study investigates the mechanisms by which neuronal activity is maintained and stabilized during exposure to fever-range temperatures. Recordings of layer (L)4-evoked spiking in L2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) of mouse somatosensory cortex revealed four outcomes as temperature increased from 30°C to 36°C and 39°C (fever-range): neurons remained inactive, stayed active, ceased activity, or initiated activity. Roughly equal proportions of neurons ceased or initiated spiking, making the subset of ‘STAY’ PNs, those that remain active across temperatures, crucial for maintaining stable cortical output. STAY PNs were more prevalent at younger postnatal ages. Their firing stability was supported by a distinct ion channel composition, including the thermosensitive channel TRPV3, which enables continued spiking by adjusting depolarization to meet spike threshold. Intracellular blockade of TRPV3, but not TRPV4, significantly reduced the proportion of STAY PNs and suppressed spiking at 39°C. Moreover, in <i>Trpv3<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, temperature increases to 39°C reduced both spiking and post-synaptic potential amplitude, and these mice exhibited a delayed seizure onset. Together, these findings suggest that TRPV3 contributes to the preservation of cortical activity during fever.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106446">Inhibitory circuits control leg movements during Drosophila grooming</a></h4>

              
                Limbs execute diverse actions coordinated by the nervous system through multiple motor programs. The basic architecture of motor neurons that activate muscles which articulate joints for antagonistic flexion and extension movements is conserved from flies to vertebrates. While excitatory premotor circuits are expected to establish sets of leg motor neurons that work together, our study uncovered an instructive role for inhibitory circuits — including their ability to generate rhythmic leg movements. Using electron microscopy data in the <i>Drosophila</i> nerve cord, we categorized ~120 GABAergic inhibitory neurons from the 13 A and 13B hemilineages into classes based on similarities in morphology and connectivity. By mapping their connections, we uncovered pathways for inhibiting specific groups of motor neurons, disinhibiting antagonistic counterparts, and inducing alternation between flexion and extension. We tested the function of specific inhibitory neurons through optogenetic activation and silencing, using high-resolution quantitative analysis of leg movements during grooming. We combined findings from anatomical and behavioral analyses to construct a computational model that can reproduce major aspects of the observed behavior, demonstrating that these premotor inhibitory circuits can generate rhythmic leg movements.

In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging has demonstrated that spatially overlapping ensembles of direct and indirect pathway SPNs (dSPNs, iSPNs) are co-active during spontaneous movement. This co-activity is statistically greater among nearby neurons, correlates with behavioral state, and changes in an SPN-type-specific manner under pathological conditions. How this co-activity arises and whether it is important for movement are not well understood. Co-activity likely arises from shared excitatory inputs, the strength of which are scaled by well-characterized mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we show that the Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which regulates the strength of corticostriatal synapses, is a key mediator of behaviorally relevant SPN co-activity. Pharmacological modulation of mGluR5 signaling bidirectionally altered movement and co-activity, but not the absolute level of activity in dSPNs. Targeted deletion of mGluR5 in dSPNs recapitulated the effects on spatiotemporal neural dynamics and movement, consistent with a striatum-specific effect of mGluR5 modulation. Targeted deletion of mGluR5 also produced changes in the synaptic properties of dSPNs. Separate from any effects on overall activity, our results show that excitatory synaptic modulation influences motor function by coordinating the spatial co-activation of dSPNs in vivo.

                Microglia, the brain’s resident macrophages, can be reconstituted by surrogate cells – a process termed ‘microglia replacement’. To expand the microglia replacement toolkit, we here introduce estrogen-regulated (ER) homeobox B8 (Hoxb8) conditionally immortalized macrophages, a cell model for generation of immune cells from murine bone marrow, as a versatile model for microglia replacement. We find that ER-Hoxb8 macrophages are highly comparable to primary bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro, and, when transplanted into a microglia-free brain, engraft the parenchyma and differentiate into microglia-like cells. Furthermore, ER-Hoxb8 progenitors are readily transducible by virus and easily stored as stable, genetically manipulated cell lines. As a demonstration of this system’s power for studying the effects of disease mutations on microglia in vivo, we created stable, Adar1-mutated ER-Hoxb8 lines using CRISPR-Cas9 to study the intrinsic contribution of macrophages to Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS), an inherited interferonopathy that primarily affects the brain and immune system. We find that Adar1 knockout elicited interferon secretion and impaired macrophage production in vitro, while preventing brain macrophage engraftment in vivo – phenotypes that can be rescued with concurrent mutation of Ifih1 (MDA5) in vitro, but not in vivo. Lastly, we extended these findings by generating ER-Hoxb8 progenitors from mice harboring a patient-specific Adar1 mutation (D1113H). We demonstrated the ability of microglia-specific D1113H mutation to drive interferon production in vivo, suggesting microglia drive AGS neuropathology. In sum, we introduce the ER-Hoxb8 approach to model microglia replacement and use it to clarify macrophage contributions to AGS.

">The cortical contribution to the speech-FFR is not modulated by visual information</a></h4>

              
                Seeing a speaker's face can significantly aid understanding, particularly in challenging acoustic environments. An early neural response implicated in audiovisual speech processing is the frequency-following response (speech-FFR), which occurs at the fundamental frequency of the speech signal. This response arises from both subcortical areas and the auditory cortex. Previous studies have shown that subcortical responses are reduced when bimodal stimulation includes visual input from the talker's face. Here, we examined the cortical contribution to the speech-FFR and its potential modulation by visual information. We recorded MEG responses to four types of audiovisual signals: a still image, an artificially generated avatar, a degraded video, and a natural video. The audio stimuli were presented in a substantial level of background noise to make behavioral audiovisual effects stand out. Speech-in-noise comprehension increased significantly from the audio-only condition to the avatar and the degraded video, and further to the natural video. Moreover, we found that all types of audiovisual stimuli yielded robust speech-FFRs in the auditory cortex at an early latency of around 30ms. However, the magnitude of this neural response was neither enhanced nor attenuated by the videos, nor could the cortical contribution of the speech-FFR explain a significant portion of the variance in the behavioral comprehension scores. Our results suggest that visual modulation of the speech-FFR in the auditory cortex is, if existent, too small to be measurable in scenarios where speech occurs in considerable background noise.

">A brain dynamic model based on graph neural network reflect the inter-region interaction of cortical areas</a></h4>

              
                A central objective in neuroscience is to elucidate how the brain generates complex dynamic activity through the interactions of brain areas. In this study, we utilized Interaction Network, a graph neural network model, to develop a computational framework for predicting whole-brain cortical blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals. We derived an Inter-Regional Interaction (IRI) metric to quantify information exchange among brain areas probing the underlying dynamical mechanisms. In addition, the total IRI emitted from each brain region was calculated and defined as the IRI sent by region (RS-IRI). Our model predicted the following 10 time points BOLD activity from initial BOLD signals, and achieved a mean absolute error of 0.04. The predicted functional connectivity (FC) achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.97 compared to the empirical FC. The fluctuation amplitude of the IRI increases with the length of the connection and the largest RS-IRI oscillation amplitude is observed in visual areas. The RS-IRI demonstrates a hierarchical organization, characterized by more concentrated distributions in association regions and larger fluctuation amplitudes in unimodal regions. Applying our approach to Alzheimers disease (AD), we demonstrate that the frequency-specific amplitudes of IRI oscillations discriminate AD patients from healthy controls and correlate with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Together, this work presents a deep learning-based framework for modeling brain dynamics as well a quantitative index of inter-areal interactions, and offers a new perspective for disease characterization.

">Data-Driven Retrieval of Effective Point Spread Functions for Super-Resolution Optoacoustic Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Localization-based super-resolution techniques have revolutionized biomedical imaging by surpassing classical diffraction limits. However, their performance is fundamentally constrained by distortions of the point spread function (PSF) induced by the system and the sample, which are particularly prominent in the case of spatially under-sampling. Here we introduce a data-driven effective point spread function retrieval (DEPR) method that directly learns continuous, field-dependent system responses from experimental point source datasets. Through statistical aggregation of thousands of targets and iterative self-supervised refinement, DEPR captures spatially variant imaging characteristics in situ without prior assumptions or external calibrations.When integrated into the localization optoacoustic tomography (LOT) pipeline, DEPR achieves accurate sub-pixel localization despite under-sampled conditions, thus enhancing resolution while reducing computational burden. We demonstrate its efficacy by in vivo imaging of the murine brain microvasculature using microparticle contrast agents in the first (NIR-I) and second (NIR-II) near-infrared windows, achieving significant improvement in data utilization efficiency and substantial reduction of gridded artifacts compared to conventional approaches. The method resolves vascular structures with ~41 m separation across a ~3 mm imaging depth range. This framework addresses fundamental challenges shared across diverse localization-based imaging modalities, offering a robust and generalizable strategy for high-precision imaging in complex biological systems.

">Precision in Motion: Reactive and Anticipatory Control of Mouse Tongue Movement for Interception</a></h4>

              
                The ability to perform high precision motor actions to intercept moving objects is fundamental to animal motor behavior, whereby organisms must constantly adapt to a dynamic environment. Such interception tasks rely on tightly integrating predictive internal models and moment-to-moment sensory feedback, a hallmark of complex sensorimotor transformations. Studying interception behavior thus offers a unique window into how the brain flexibly coordinates perception and action in real time. However, traditional behavioral paradigms to study sensorimotor control in head fixed mice, often rooted in classical conditioning, simplify these complex processes into predictable, rigid stimulus response routines. Consequently, these paradigms fail to capture key ethological features of interception, such as the continuous dynamic nature of sensory input and direct physical interaction with moving objects. Our task bridges this gap by integrating naturalistic elements of interceptive behavior with precise experimental control. We introduce a behavioral task in which head fixed mice use their tongue to intercept a food pellet moving at constant speeds, randomly changing from trial to trial. We describe details of the 3D kinematics of discrete tongue reaching movements, their distinctive motor phases, and their learning dependent changes in onset and kinematics. We show that mice adjust their tongue kinematics and movement onset relative to varying pellet speeds, using distinctive reactive and anticipatory strategies. We demonstrate that the anticipatory strategy depends partially on vision and on intact lateral cerebellar circuits. Our novel behavioral paradigm is a valuable tool for exploring the neural basis of sensory motor transformation during object interception in head-fixed mice.

">Ca2+-mediated protein citrullination regulates proliferation in the regenerating and malignant CNS</a></h4>

              
                Unlike most adult mammals, regenerative vertebrates can awaken dormant neural stem cells in response to injury. Understanding how this process is regulated could guide strategies to activate stem cells for tissue repair and limit aberrant proliferation in cancers of the CNS. Here, using zebrafish injury models and high-speed live imaging, we identify hydrodynamically-activated Ca2+; signalling as a key driver of neural stem cell activation. Local injury-associated changes in CSF flow activate mechanoreceptors at the site of spinal cord lesions, triggering pulsatile Ca2+ activity and progenitor proliferation. We identify Ca2+-regulated peptidylarginine deiminase enzymes (PADs) as key downstream effectors that citrullinate intracellular targets in a Ca2+-dependent manner to drive progenitor activation. Finally, we show that PAD inhibitors suppress the growth of aggressive medulloblastoma cells in preclinical laboratory models. Together, these findings uncover a novel mechanism of proliferation control in the vertebrate CNS and highlight the value of regenerative studies for identifying therapeutic targets.

">Translational regulation of GAD1 identified by circadian and light-responsive ribosome-bound transcriptome analysis in the mouse hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus</a></h4>

              
                The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the master circadian pacemaker, integrating photic information to synchronize daily rhythms throughout the body. While transcriptional regulation of clock genes in the SCN has been extensively studied, whether gene expression in the SCN is regulated at the level of mRNA translation has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the first ribosome-profiling (Ribo-seq) dataset generated from the mouse SCN, enabling a genome-wide assessment of translational regulation in this central circadian clock. Combined time-series Ribo-seq and RNA-seq analyses identified 385 genes that exhibit rhythmic ribosome binding without corresponding oscillations in mRNA abundance, revealing widespread translational regulation in the SCN. Among these, light stimulation induced an approximately twofold increase in ribosome binding of Gad1, which encodes the major GABA-synthetic enzyme Gad67, despite only marginal changes in Gad1 mRNA levels. Importantly, immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated light-dependent accumulation of Gad67 protein selectively in light-activated SCN neurons, establishing that translational regulation of Gad1 gives rise to overt protein-level changes. In contrast, canonical clock genes were regulated predominantly at the transcriptional level and showed little evidence of translational modulation. Our data allow a systematic comparison between transcriptionally and translationally regulated genes, including their relative rhythm-amplitudes and phases, and thereby revealed translational control as a distinct modulatory layer shaping time-of-day-dependent and light-dependent gene expression in the SCN.

">Electro-Calcium uncoupling precedes neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is categorized as a neurodegenerative disease, but there is a growing recognition of the vascular components in AD pathophysiology. Reduction in cerebral perfusion is routinely observed in AD patients and preclinical models prior to overt clinical symptoms. However, there is a limited mechanistic understanding of the early neurovascular deficits in AD, and how these may ultimately contribute to pathology. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of early neurovascular dysfunction in AD by using 3-month-old 5xFAD mice, a familial mouse model of AD. Functional hyperemia-the increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to neuronal activity-is driven by inward rectifier K+ (Kir2.1)-mediated hyperpolarizing (electrical) signals and Ca2+-dependent nitric oxide production within the capillary endothelial cells (cECs). Electrical and Ca2+ signals are tightly coupled through cECs membrane potential, referred to as Electro-Calcium (E- Ca) coupling. We hypothesize that E-Ca uncoupling contributes to impaired functional hyperemia in 5xFAD mice and that these neurovascular deficits precede the neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. At three months of age, 5xFAD mice did not exhibit any impairment in spatial learning and memory, or neuronal density. However, whisker stimulation-induced functional hyperemia was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice compared to controls. Functional hyperemia exhibited a bimodal response in controls-consisting of fast and slow phases-with the slow phase being significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice. To identify mechanisms underlying these deficits, we measured cortical neuronal and endothelial Ca2+ activity using in-vivo imaging. Neuronal Ca2+ activity was comparable between controls and 5xFAD mice, while cECs Ca2+ activity was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, Kir2.1 channel blocker, barium (100 M) significantly suppressed cECs Ca2+ activity in controls, but not in 5xFAD mice, consistent with crippled E-Ca coupling. Despite these vascular functional impairments, capillary density was preserved in 5xFAD mice. TRPV4 channels are one of the major Ca2+ entry pathways in cECs and potentiate E-Ca coupling. cECs TRPV4 current density was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice while Kir2.1 current density was unchanged, indicating that impaired TRPV4 function underlies the E-Ca uncoupling. In summary, early E-Ca uncoupling leads to impaired functional hyperemia in 5xFAD mice and may contribute to later neuronal and cognitive decline.

">Cerebellar Gray Matter Volume Changes Across Development: Posterolateral and Vermal Transient Increases during Adolescence</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum undergoes substantial maturation with regionally distinct developmental trajectories. This study examined cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) in healthy children, adolescents, and adults, using voxel-based morphometry, the ACAPULCO algorithm, and the SUIT toolbox for cerebellum-optimized analyses. A total of 104 typically developing children (n=31, 6-9 years), adolescents (n=35, 13-17 years), and adults (n=38, 30-40 years) were included. We hypothesized age group differences in cerebellar GMV, with adolescents showing the greatest volume, specifically in posterolateral regions. Results revealed significant group differences in GMV. We observed region-specific volumetric patterns, with some areas (e.g., Crus II, lobule X) increasing from childhood to adolescence followed by stabilization, whereas other areas (e.g., lobules I-IV and VI, Crus I, vermis VI and VIIb) exhibited peak GMV during adolescence, with lower volumes in both children and adults. These patterns were partly consistent with our hypothesis. Notably, no regions had greater GMV in adults than adolescents, suggesting that cerebellar growth peaks in adolescence before stabilizing. Our findings indicate differential developmental patterns both between and within lobules of the cerebellum, and highlight adolescence as a peak period of cerebellar growth, with potential implications for the development of cerebellar-supported cognitive and emotional functions that undergo significant changes during this period.

">Pathological TDP-43 filaments accumulate at synapses and cause synaptic dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                The assembly of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) into amyloid filaments within neurons is a hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including motor neuron diseases (MND), frontotemporal dementias (FTD) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). These diseases result from the deterioration and loss of neurons, with synaptic dysfunction and neuronal hyperexcitability being prominent early events. Pathogenic mutations in the TDP-43 gene, TARDBP, that promote filament formation have established a causal role for TDP-43 assembly in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying filament accumulation and their contribution to neurodegeneration are poorly understood. TDP-43 filaments can propagate between neurons in a prion-like manner, which may underlie the progressive spread and accumulation of TDP-43 pathology in disease. Here, we studied early stages of TDP-43 filament accumulation following internalisation of patient-derived TDP-43 filaments by mouse and human cortical neurons. Using proximity labelling, we identified molecular environments and putative interactions of TDP-43 filaments. We found that TDP-43 filaments accumulated at synapses, particularly in proximity to the presynaptic active zone, which we confirmed in FTD patient brain sections. Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) directly visualised abundant TDP-43 filaments spanning the presynaptic cytoplasm in situ, which contacted synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane. Functional measurements revealed that the accumulation of TDP-43 filaments led to presynaptic dysfunction and subsequent neuronal hyperexcitability. These findings suggest that synapses are a major early site of TDP-43 filament accumulation, relevant to their propagation, and directly link TDP-43 filament gain of function to synaptic dysfunction.

">Preventing Data Leakage in Neural Decoding</a></h4>

              
                Neural decoding is a widely-used machine learning technique for investigating how behavior, perception and cognition are represented in neural activity. However without careful application data leakage can occur, where information from the test set contaminates the training set, leading to biased estimates of decoding performance and potentially invalidating biological conclusions. Here we use simulated and biological datasets to demonstrate how both supervised and unsupervised data preprocessing, including dimensionality reduction, can introduce leakage in neural decoding studies. We reveal that in some cases leakage can paradoxically decrease decoding performance relative to unbiased estimates, and we provide theoretical analyses explaining how this occurs. We demonstrate that, for autocorrelated neural time series, standard k-fold cross-validation can dramatically overstate performance. Finally we provide detailed recommendations for avoiding data leakage in neural decoding.

">An integrated platform for simultaneous wide-field voltage/calcium imaging and fMRI (EPI & ZTE) reveals neuronal infraslow dynamics underlying functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Wide-field optical imaging acquired simultaneously with functional MRI has the ability to provide unprecedented insight into the neural origins of time-varying whole-brain activity. Simultaneously linking cellular-scale activity to whole-brain fMRI remains challenging due to optical access, RF coil placement, and transmission constraints in the MRI environment. We present an integrated platform that combines a long-distance tube lens optical path (>98% transmission), a chronically stable optically-fused cranial window, and a subject-conformal RF surface coil compatible with both EPI and zero-echo-time (ZTE) fMRI. The system supports concurrent wide-field imaging of genetically encoded voltage or calcium indicators concurrently with intrinsic hemoglobin signals. In individual mice, wide-field optical and fMRI measures yield concordant functional connectivity, and cross-modal timing analyses demonstrate that neuronal infraslow dynamics (<0.1 Hz) underlie the majority of fMRI connectivity, after removing hemodynamic crosstalk. The platform's sensitivity, chronic stability, and sequence flexibility broaden access to cellular-to-whole-brain investigations across basic and translational neuroimaging.

">Population decoding of sound source location by receptive field neurons in the mouse superior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the location of a sound source in a complex environment and assessing its importance can be crucial for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure involved in sensorimotor functions, contributes to sound localization and contains auditory responsive neurons that have spatially restricted receptive fields (RFs) that are organized into a topographic map along the azimuth. However, individual auditory SC neurons have large spatial RFs, are noisy, and do not respond to the same stimulus at each trial. Therefore, when an animal is presented with a single trial sound, and it needs to rely on a single neuron to locate the sound source direction, the location measurement may be erroneous, missing, or have poor spatial resolution. It is expected that a more reliable and accurate determination of the sound source location will come from a population of neurons. We therefore built a population pattern Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) decoder to build a model that can accurately predict the location of a stimulus given the population response. We compared three models that use either strict firing rate (FR), weighting based on equal (EW) or mutual information (MIW) and show that the MIW model works best, needing only 92 neurons to localize a stimulus with behaviorally relevant precision. Furthermore, by comparing the model fit using the responses from non-RF and RF auditory neurons, we show that only RF neurons contain the information needed to localize a sound source. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the SC uses a population of RF neurons to determine sound source location.

">Graph-Based EEG Symmetry Features from the Temporal Lobe as Markers of Antidepressant Treatment Response</a></h4>

              
                Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder that affects millions globally and has highly individualized responses to antidepressant treatment. Identifying objective early markers that can distinguish responders from non-responders remains a critical challenge in personalized psychiatry. In this study, we investigate the role of brain symmetry in EEG-derived functional connectivity as a potential early marker of treatment response. Using resting-state EEG recordings from 176 patients diagnosed with MDD at baseline (Visit~1) and after one week of treatment (Visit~2), we construct graph-based representations of functional connectivity and define region-wise and electrode-wise temporal-lobe symmetry features. We focus on symmetry emph{change scores} (Visit~2$-$Visit~1) across typical EEG frequency bands in both weighted and binary forms. Statistical analyses reveal a consistent group-level pattern in the $alpha$ and $beta$ bands: responders show negative symmetry change scores, whereas non-responders show relative stability or weakly positive change scores. The contrast is strongest in the $beta_1$ band and is more pronounced for binary symmetry metrics, while the $alpha$ band shows the same direction with slightly weaker significance. Physiologically, these opposite trajectories are emph{consistent with} a treatment-related shift toward more lateralized temporal-lobe network organization in responders and a more bilateral coupling pattern in non-responders; however, these neurophysiological interpretations remain hypothesis-generating given the resting-state design and the absence of direct behavioral or task-based validation. To quantify whether temporal symmetry change scores contain reproducible discriminative signal under strict validation, we benchmark the proposed features in a supervised classification pipeline using repeated nested cross-validation. The best-performing configuration achieved a median out-of-sample AUC of 0.690 with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval of [0.611, 0.711], indicating modest but reproducible separability. Overall, temporal-lobe symmetry change features provide interpretable candidate markers of early antidepressant-related neurophysiological change that may complement existing EEG predictors in future multi-marker models, but they are not yet sufficient for standalone clinical decision support and require external validation in independent cohorts.

">Electrophysiological Correlates of Reinforcement Learning in the Human Ventral Tegmental Area</a></h4>

              
                The ventral tegmental area is the primary source of dopaminergic input to the human prefrontal cortex and plays a central role in reinforcement learning. Although animal studies have established that dopaminergic neurons encode reward prediction error signals, direct electrophysiological evidence in humans is scarce. Understanding these mechanisms is clinically relevant because of their involvement in disorders of motivation and reward processing. In this cross-sectional study, we recorded local field potentials from the ventral tegmental area in fourteen patients (nine male; mean age 46 years, range 30-62) undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery for chronic cluster headache. During temporary electrode externalisation, participants performed a probabilistic instrumental learning task comprising reward, loss and neutral trials. Behaviour was modelled using a hierarchical Rescorla-Wagner framework with separate learning rates for rewards and losses. Electrophysiological responses were analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping and linear mixed-effects models testing sensitivity to outcome, expected value and reward prediction error. Clear evoked responses were observed for stimulus and outcome events in thirteen subjects. Responses reflecting the contrast between outcomes that delivered a gain, a loss or a neutral signal and those delivering no outcome were significantly larger for gains than for losses or neutral signals (paired t-tests: gain versus loss, t(12)=2.60, p=0.023, Cohen's d=0.72; gain versus neutral, t(12)=4.49, p<0.001, d=1.25), while loss and neutral contrasts did not differ (p=0.218). Nine of fourteen subjects developed a clear preference for the high-reward option; two exhibited gradual learning, while others adopted a win-stay strategy. In eight subjects with clear evoked responses, activity around the button press correlated with the expected value of the chosen option (peak at 0.02s, p=0.013, corrected). In a further subset of two subjects who explored the low-value option, single-trial responses peaked closer to the button press during low-value choices. No compelling evidence was found for a distinct reward prediction error signal beyond outcome and value. Clinical covariates and smoking status did not significantly modulate electrophysiological responses. Human ventral tegmental area activity is selectively tuned to rewarding outcomes and, under conditions of effective learning, reflects the expected value of chosen options during decision-making. These findings align with reinforcement learning principles established in animal models and suggest that local field potentials primarily represent inputs to reward prediction error computation rather than its output. This work provides the first direct electrophysiological evidence of reward-related signalling in the human ventral tegmental area, supporting its translational relevance for understanding motivation and guiding neuromodulatory interventions.

">Traumatic Brain Injury Associated with Altered Corpus Callosum Microstructure in Females: Exploring the Roles of Menopause Timing and Hormone Therapy in UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has lasting effects on white matter, yet sex-specific factors such as menopause timing and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may modulate these outcomes in females. Objectives To investigate how TBI, menopause timing, HRT use, and reproductive history relate to corpus callosum white matter microstructure in female UK Biobank participants. Design Cross-sectional analysis of UK Biobank diffusion MRI data using propensity score matching to compare females with TBI to controls. Methods We analyzed diffusion MRI data from females with and without TBI. Corpus callosum fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF) were assessed. TBI effects were examined across pre- and post-menopausal groups, accounting for HRT use, duration, and reproductive factors. Results Females with TBI (n=363) exhibited widespread corpus callosum alterations compared to propensity-matched controls (n=10,128), with reduced FA across all regions (genu: B=-0.006, FDR p=0.027; body: B =-0.006, FDR p=0.002; splenium: B;=-0.004, FDR p=0.009) and elevated MD in anterior regions (genu: FDR p=0.001; body: FDR p=0.002). TBI sustained before menopause was associated with significantly lower splenium FA (B=-0.010, p=0.031) and higher body MD (B=0.000019, p=0.021) compared with TBI sustained after menopause and controls. HRT use did not modify TBI-related alterations in primary analyses. However, among HRT users (n=3,108), a significant TBIxduration interaction emerged for genu MD (B=2.00 x 10-6; p=0.0295), indicating that the effect of HRT duration on white matter microstructure differed between TBI cases and healthy females. Reproductive factors (parity, reproductive lifespan) independently predicted some white matter measures but did not confound TBI, menopause timing, or HRT associations. Conclusions TBI-related white matter changes in females are influenced by menopause timing and hormonal exposure, with HRT effects dependent on duration and injury context. These findings highlight the importance of sex- and hormone-specific approaches in TBI research and the need for longitudinal studies to clarify mechanisms and potential interventions.

">Dynamic conformational ensembles of soluble Tau encode neuronal toxicity prior to aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Tau aggregation is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies, yet the conformational states of Tau in neurons prior to aggregation remain poorly understood. Existing structural models are derived largely from fibrillar assemblies and provide limited insight into the dynamic, soluble Tau species that initiate pathology. Here, we combine hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry with super-resolution imaging and neuronal models to define the conformational ensemble of soluble Tau under physiological and disease-relevant conditions. We show that soluble Tau populates distinct, dynamic conformations characterized by regional stabilization and long-range intramolecular interactions that are invisible to fibril-based structures. Disease-associated perturbations selectively remodel these conformational ensembles, exposing aggregation-prone regions and altering Tau subcellular organization in neurons. Notably, these Tau species inhibit axonal transport, which is essential for neuronal health, linking specific ensemble states to neuronal toxicity. These findings establish soluble Tau conformation as a dynamic, regulatable state that precedes aggregation and encodes disease relevance. By defining the structural logic of Tau before fibril formation, this work provides a framework for understanding early tauopathy mechanisms and for targeting Tau pathology at its earliest stages.

">The mood stabilizer lithium alters behaviour and physiology via the gut brain axis.</a></h4>

              
                Lithium, introduced 75 years ago by John Cade1, remains the most effective mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder2. Lithium is proposed to modulate an array of cellular pathways, many ubiquitous to all cells, with pleiotropic roles unlinked to bipolar disorder or lithium responsiveness in genome wide association studies3,4. These mechanisms cannot explain lithium's specific effects on mood and behaviour. We demonstrate that lithium's primary action is in the periphery, not in the brain itself. Lithium acts in the gut to trigger behavioural and physiological changes, akin to those associated with a torpor-like state, that protect individuals from ingested toxins. Lithium activates gastrointestinal enterochromaffin (EC) cells via their Trpm2 cation channels to modulate afferent vagal and area postrema inputs to the brain. Eliminating these inputs by focal brain lesions eliminates lithium's effects, as does ablation of EC cells or their Trpm2 expression. Lithium's Trpm2-dependent activation of EC cells also occurs in human gut tissue, providing translational relevance for our discovery. These findings challenge the prevailing perception that lithium acts directly on the brain. Via a previously unsuspected gut-brain pathway, lithium engages brain circuitry that reduces arousal and interaction with the external world, therapeutic goals in the manic phase of bipolar disorder.

">Sample size dependence of Occam's razor in human decision-making</a></h4>

              
                To make sense of a noisy world, living beings constantly face decisions between competing interpretations for ambiguous sensory data. This process parallels statistical model selection, where most frameworks, like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), are based on a trade-off between a model's goodness-of-fit and its complexity. The same tradeoff has been observed in humans. However, a core tenet of normative frameworks is that the trade-off should depend on the sample size (N); as more data becomes available, the goodness-of-fit grows faster than the complexity penalty, weakening the overall bias towards simplicity. It is unknown whether humans also conform to this scaling principle, and if so, whether it arises from an optimal computation or a simpler heuristic. Here, we investigate this question using a preregistered visual task where subjects inferred the number of latent Gaussian sources generating clusters of data-points, and where the number of points (N) presented on each trial is varied systematically. We use three kinds of model to describe their behavior: a model with linear scaling of evidence in N (as in BIC and AIC), a model with no scaling, and a model with sub-linear scaling inspired by known biases in numerosity perception. Our results demonstrate that the normative, linear scaling model provides the worst account of human behavior. Instead, we find strong evidence for a sub-linear scaling of sample size. By inferring the shape of this scaling with Gaussian Processes, we reveal a distinct logarithmic trend for smaller N, and a flattening for higher values, both consistent with numerosity perception biases. This finding suggests that, when selecting for competing explanations for sensory data, humans do not perform a principled computation but rather employ a more efficient heuristic that repurposes lower perceptual mechanisms to dynamically weight evidence against model complexity.

">A low-variance subspace underlies individual differences in resting state fMRI</a></h4>

              
                People differ remarkably from one another, yet isolating individual differences in their brain activity remains challenging. Non-invasive whole-brain recordings of human brain activity, such as those from resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), are complex and noisy, making it difficult to isolate stable dimensions of individual differences. Ideally, we want to find a few core dimensions that vary across people but have high test-retest reliability, giving the same value each time they are measured in the same person. However, it is still unknown whether any such reliable dimensions exist, and if they do, what could drive this reliability. Here, we show that there is a low-dimensional linear subspace of highly-reliable rs-fMRI activity. These dimensions form personal fingerprints, allowing participants to be identified with high accuracy despite fingerprints explaining only a fraction of the total variance. Many of these dimensions inherit their reliability from a single morphological, demographic, or behavioral property, and most dimensions can be predicted from the anatomical layout of cortical regions. These dimensions were identified using reliability component analysis (RCA), a new dimensionality reduction technique similar to principal component analysis (PCA) but which maximizes reliability instead of explained variance. Together, our findings suggest that stable individual signatures can be isolated from rs-fMRI. These signatures reflect persistent anatomical and physiological differences, and provide a principled low-dimensional basis for biomarker discovery.

">Is torpor a quiescent state? Periodic motility and transient brain activation during daily torpor in Djungarian hamsters</a></h4>

              
                Torpor is a hypometabolic state employed by many mammalian and non-mammalian species to cope with harsh environments. When exposed to a short photoperiod, Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) enter daily torpor with body temperatures dropping as low as 15 degrees Celcius. Despite the widely-held notion that torpor is a form of deep sleep, torpid animals are not completely inactive but exhibit occasional movements reflected in an increase in EMG tone. Little is known about these EMG events during torpor and whether they have a functional role during the torpid state. We here analysed EEG, EMG, and brain temperature data from Djungarian hamsters, and used an automatic detection algorithm to identify periods of EMG activation during spontaneous daily torpor. The hamsters exhibited regular periods of motility that were invariably initiated during a decline in brain temperature and were followed by a brain temperature increase. The frequency of EMG events exhibited a negative correlation with brain temperature, such that lower brain temperature was associated with a higher frequency of EMG events. In addition, EMG events were associated with a pronounced increase in EEG power, especially between 9.5-15.5 Hz, which often started with an EEG pattern similar to an evoked potential preceding the increase in the EMG activity. On the contrary, micro-arousals during normothermic NREM sleep were associated with a decrease in EEG power, a decrease in brain temperature and were of shorter duration than torpor EMG events, indicating that the two phenomena may serve different purposes. We speculate that periodic motility associated with increased brain activity during torpor may play a role in thermoregulation, and help retain vigilance to potentially mitigate predation risk during this hypometabolic state.

">Chronic acoustic degradation via cochlear implants alters predictive processing of audiovisual speech</a></h4>

              
                This study provides the first neurophysiological evidence of how cochlear implant (CI) input affects predictive processing during audiovisual language comprehension in deaf individuals. Using EEG, we compared 18 CI users with 18 normal-hearing (NH) controls during sentence comprehension where final word predictability was determined by high or low semantic constraint (HC vs. LC) of the preceding sentence frame. Between sentence frame and final word, a 800 ms silent gap was introduced. Mouth visibility was manipulated during sentence frames (visible or digitally occluded; V+ vs. V-), while the final words were always presented with the mouth visible. In NH participants, lower-beta power (12-15 Hz) in left frontal and central sensors decreased for HC vs. LC contexts during the pre-target silent gap, but only when the mouths was visible, suggesting active prediction generation. In CI users, this lower beta power decrease was absent. After final word presentation, both groups showed N400 predictability effects, indicating preserved prediction evaluation. However, CI users exhibited extended N400 effects in the V+ condition, suggesting additional processing demands. Across all participants, pre-target beta modulations correlated with language production abilities, supporting prediction-by-production frameworks. Within CI users, poorer audiometric thresholds correlated with larger N400 constraint effects, possibly indicating greater reliance on contextual prediction to compensate for degraded sensory input. These findings demonstrate that CI-mediated perception alters the neural mechanisms of prediction generation. The link between production skills and predictive mechanisms suggests that strengthening expressive language abilities may enhance predictive processing in CI users.

">Astrocyte diversity and aging in the mouse lemur primate brain</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes play key roles in maintaining brain homeostasis, metabolism, and neurovascular integrity, yet their diversity and age-related modulation remain insufficiently understood, particularly across primate lineages. While rodent studies have generated extensive knowledge, notable species differences highlight the need for comparative analyses in non-human primates. The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a small primate widely used in aging research, offers a valuable but underexplored model for studying astroglial aging. In this study, we characterized astrocyte distribution, morphology, and reactivity in 17 mouse lemurs aged 1.0 to 11.5 years using GFAP and vimentin immunohistochemistry. We identified marked regional and morphological heterogeneity, with dense astrocytic labeling in white matter, hippocampus, and sparse but diverse cortical populations. Distinct astrocyte subtypes (including fibrous, protoplasmic, projection, pial and subpial interlaminar, radial glia-like cells, tanycytes) were documented. Varicosity-bearing processes were common across multiple astroglial subtypes and may indicate altered physiological states. Quantitative analyses revealed pronounced age-related increases in astrocytic reactivity, particularly in white matter and interlaminar astrocytes. Cortical and hippocampal changes were comparatively modest. These findings indicate region-specific astrocytic vulnerability during aging and support the translational value of the mouse lemur for investigating glial aging in primates.

">Functional recruitment of astrocyte-derived neurons into the mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Inducing neurogenesis from glia could permit circuit remodeling and neuron replacement in the brain. Indirect evidence suggests that glia-to-neuron reprogramming is feasible, but the dynamics of conversion have not been directly observed, and it remains unclear whether glia-derived cortical neurons can functionally integrate into brain circuits. Here, we use two-photon imaging to visualize the reprogramming of astroglia into induced neurons in the mouse cortex in vivo. We track the emergence of spontaneous neuron-like calcium transients in astrocyte-derived induced neurons, demonstrating their functional activity in vivo. Importantly, these induced neurons exhibit orientation tuned, visually evoked calcium responses, demonstrating their functional integration into cortical circuitry - a prerequisite for their utility in circuit repair. Thus, astrocytes can be recruited to generate functional neurons in the postnatal cortex, enabling circuit remodeling in perinatal injury or neurodevelopmental disorders without relying on external cellular sources.

">Parallel control of conjunctive and compositional representations supports dynamic task preparation</a></h4>

              
                People can dynamically and adaptively update task goals in the face of task uncertainty. In this fMRI study, we aimed to investigate the modulation of neural task representations that subserve such flexible task control. On each trial, we asked people to perform one of nine image categorization tasks. During task preparation, participants had to actively infer varying levels of task uncertainty and dynamically modulate their task preparation accordingly. Multivariate pattern analyses demonstrated dissociable uncertainty-driven modulations of conjunctive and compositional task representations in the right frontoparietal network. Specifically, different sub-regions showed diminished conjunctive task representations when task uncertainty increased during task preparation. At the same time, we observed an active maintenance of compositional task representations, suggesting an adaptive cognitive strategy in facilitating compositional task reconfiguration. These findings suggest a mechanism of parallel control on conjunctive and compositional representations that allows for maximizing the advantages of both representational formats, offering new insights into the neural mechanisms underpinning human flexible task preparation.

">Driving theta-gamma oscillations modulates extrasynaptic GABAergic tone: a tACS-TMS study</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupled ({theta}{gamma}-PAC) oscillations in primary motor cortex (M1) have been shown to support motor skill acquisition. Past research has shown that driving gamma activity at the theta peak (TGP), but not the theta trough (TGT) using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) enhances motor learning (Akkad et al., 2021). However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this phase-specific effect remain unclear. METHODS: In a double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over study, twenty-two healthy participants received 20 minutes of 75Hz/6Hz TGP-tACS, TGT-tACS, or sham stimulation over M1. We used paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess GABAergic and NMDAR-mediated activity before, during, and after tACS. Outcome measures included short-interval intracortical inhibition at 1ms (SICI1ms; extrasynaptic GABAergic tone) and 2.5ms (SICI2.5ms; synaptic GABAA activity), intracortical facilitation at 12ms (ICF12ms; NMDAR activity), and motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude (corticospinal excitability). RESULTS: TGP-tACS selectively decreased SICI1ms, a putative marker of extrasynaptic GABAergic tone (main effect of Stimulation: p=.021), with significant differences between TGP and TGT during late stimulation (p=.047). No significant effects were observed on corticospinal excitability, synaptic GABAergic activity (SICI2.5ms), or NMDAR signalling (ICF12ms). CONCLUSIONS: Driving theta-gamma oscillations at the theta peak using tACS specifically modulates extrasynaptic GABAergic tone in M1 without affecting corticospinal excitability or synaptic inhibition. Given that reductions in GABAergic signalling supports motor learning, these findings provide a neurophysiological mechanism for the phase-specific behavioural effects of {theta}{gamma}-PAC tACS and suggest a potential therapeutic approach for facilitating motor recovery after stroke.

">Pre-myelinating oligodendrocyte ADGRG1 is required for axon ensheathment and CNS myelin formation</a></h4>

              
                Myelin is essential for axonal health and rapid propagation of action potentials. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelination is initiated with axon ensheathment by pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes (preOLs), followed by iterative membrane wrapping and longitudinal extension along the axon. The molecular mechanisms that govern preOL development remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1 (also called GPR56) as a key, evolutionarily conserved regulator of this process. We show that ADGRG1 is highly expressed in preOLs and that its conditional deletion in mouse preOLs leads to simplified preOL morphology and defective axon ensheathment, resulting in CNS hypomyelination. Live imaging in zebrafish demonstrated conserved function of Adgrg1 in axon ensheathment. Mechanistically, we show that ADGRG1 promotes preOL maturation by RhoA activation. Collectively, these findings reveal an ADGRG1-mediated RhoA signaling pathway that governs axon ensheathment and myelin formation.

">Wing mechanosensory modulation of optic flow-sensitive descending neurons in butterflies</a></h4>

              
                Visual motion processing in flying insects is strongly modulated by behavioural state, yet the mechanisms by which mechanosensory feedback contributes to this modulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that wing mechanosensation alone is sufficient to modulate a subset of optic flow-sensitive descending neurons (WFDNs) in butterflies. Airflow stimulation of the wings, mimicking flight conditions, increased baseline firing rates and reduced response latencies in WFDNs, without altering response gain or temporal frequency tuning. These effects indicate that mechanosensory modulation acts through mechanisms distinct from those governing other state-dependent changes in visual processing. Consistent with this interpretation, previous work has shown that baseline firing and response latency can be rapidly modulated, whereas gain changes arise through slower neuromodulatory pathways. Mechanosensory modulation was cell-type specific: the horizontally tuned WFDNL neuron was consistently affected across individuals, whereas other WFDN types were largely insensitive, likely reflecting the unilateral airflow stimuli used here. Interestingly, WFDNL modulation arose exclusively from mechanosensory input from the proximal area of the wing, not from distal wing deformation. This suggests that descending visual pathways require only coarse gain or excitability modulation rather than detailed information about wing shape or strain, leaving fast reflexive control of distal wing deformation to local ganglionic circuits. Together, our results demonstrate that wing mechanosensation selectively modulates visual descending pathways by altering excitability and timing rather than visual feature encoding, supporting the existence of multiple, parallel mechanisms for state-dependent visual modulation during flight.

">Novel devaluation methods to explore habits in humans</a></h4>

              
                Habits in humans are commonly studied through outcome devaluation paradigms, but most existing tasks fail to capture the robustness of habitual behavior seen in animal models. I introduce two novel behavioral tasks designed to overcome these limitations. In the first task, ("shooting aliens task", n = 45), I simplified an existing instrumental learning task and implemented a novel intra-block reversal method in which stimulus positions changed unexpectedly within blocks while maintaining the same stimulus-action mappings. Participants also completed a classical devaluation phase with explicit reward changes. In the second task ("hands-attack task", n = 44), which relied on real-life avoidance behavior, devaluation was achieved by reversing reward contingencies and allowing participants to inhibit the dominant avoidance response in favor of a more effortful counterattack. Across both tasks, overtrained conditions led to more errors and longer response times after devaluation, confirming increased insensitivity to outcome change. Intra-block reversals in the shooting aliens task produced stronger habitual signatures than standard whole-block devaluation, revealing a greater cost of overriding automatic responses. In the hands-attack task, even without prior training, participants showed clear markers of habitual behavior, suggesting that real-world action patterns can replicate key features of laboratory habits. Interestingly, participants were more accurate in overriding overtrained responses when attacks were highly familiar, possibly due to enhanced perceptual processing, although this came at the cost of longer response times. These findings introduce two complementary tools that address key limitations in current paradigms: the intra-block reversal increases habit sensitivity without inflating working memory demands, while the hands-attack task captures naturalistic habit expression without artificial training, using a single, ecologically valid session. Both are suited for clinical applications, particularly where time constraints or cognitive load limit the feasibility of traditional approaches.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Psychological pain showed stronger predictive power for suicide attempts (SAs) than depression, even in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to elucidate the compositional architecture of the pain network and quantify the explanatory power of this network versus the reward network in modeling suicide risk mechanisms. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from MDD patients with SA, MDD patients without SA, and healthy controls (HCs) were analyzed using graph theoretical analysis. Partial least squares regression was used to assess suicide-related neural alterations in relation to depression and psychological pain. Compared with HCs, MDD patients exhibited reduced nodal centrality in both the reward and pain networks. Within MDD, individuals with SA exhibited changes primarily in the pain network, including a decrease in the betweenness centrality of the right anterior insula. Suicide-related alterations overlapped more with pain avoidance than with depression. Centrality in the right opercular inferior frontal gyrus, left medial superior temporal gyrus, and right anterior insula was associated with pain arousal, feelings, and avoidance, broadening the current understanding of the pain network. These findings extended the conceptualization of the pain network and highlight its pivotal role in suicide risk.</span>

This negativity is posed to be enhanced when expecting highly emotional stimuli; however, the specific role attention plays in its generation is unclear, as emotional content is more salient and arousing, and thus recruits higher attentional resources. Here, affective anticipation signals were recorded in 35 participants with EEG, and their brain sources elucidated using multiple sparse priors algorithm. Using a cued-paradigm, the category of a sound being negatively valenced or neutral could be predicted with a 68.2% accuracy. To shift attentional resources away from the emotional content, participants were instructed to listen and respond to a burst of white noise that occurred on 9.1% of trials. Results showed slower reaction times following the aversive cue, yet no difference in EEG amplitude between aversive and neutral anticipation. Response times positively correlated with EEG amplitude—participants with stronger negativity were faster to respond. EEG source reconstruction demonstrated no differences between conditions, and showed activation of areas within the salience network including insula, somatosensory cortex, and thalamus. The current results suggest that anticipatory EEG negativity is an index of attentional resource-allocation during the anticipation period and does not reflect the emotional content of upcoming stimuli.</span>

A novel probabilistic sequence with a partially overlapping structure was introduced that allowed us to distinguish between the retention of old sequences and the acquisition of new ones. Following comparable statistical learning in both groups during the stimulation session, our results showed that frontal midline theta synchronization enhances the adaptation of predictive processes shown by the reduction of erroneous anticipations of previously learned regularities and more flexible anticipation of novel regularities.

                <p>Daughterless (Da), the <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> homolog of mammalian E-protein transcription factor 4 (TCF4), is well studied in fruit fly embryonic development but its functions in adult nervous system are poorly understood. Mutations in human <I>TCF4</I> gene lead to intellectual disabilities such as Pitt&ndash;Hopkins syndrome and <I>TCF4</I> has also been linked to schizophrenia. Here, to explore the roles of Da in the <I>Drosophila</I> mature brain, we map Da DNA binding sites and study the transcriptomics of the brains where Da function is inhibited by pan-neuronal Extramacrohaete (Emc) overexpression, in both male and female <I>Drosophila</I>. Our transcriptome analyses reveal that in the adult brain Da regulates the expression of genes involved in behavior, memory, synaptic signaling, protein translation, and metabolic processes. Moreover, combining the RNA sequencing data with Da ChIP sequencing results indicates that genes associated with neuronal projection guidance, metabolism, and translation are direct targets of Da. In addition, we validate the involvement of Da in memory formation. Overall, our results provide valuable information about the functions of Da in the adult brain and aid in better understanding the mechanisms of TCF4-related disorders.</p>

Interferons (IFNs) are potent antiviral cytokines that are rapidly activated when infected cells sense a virus, but continued IFN production following acute infection is linked to impaired recovery. IFNs protect against infection by inducing a suite of antiviral effectors in IFN receptor-expressing cells via JAK/STAT signaling. However, how IFNs curtail tissue repair is not fully understood. Here, we studied the effects of Type III IFNs (IFNλ1 and IFNλ2) and Type I IFN (IFNβ) on tissue repair functions of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). We show that both Type III IFNs and IFNβ reduce bronchial epithelial cell migration and proliferation through a common upstream mechanism: activation of LATS1, a kinase best known for limiting organ growth as part of the Hippo signaling pathway. Mechanistically, Type III IFN or IFNβ curtailed wound healing by triggering phosphorylation of LATS1 via JAK activity, bypassing activation of MST1/2, the canonical activator of LATS1 in the Hippo pathway. Further experiments showed that distinct signaling pathways lead to LATS1 and STAT1 phosphorylation downstream of IFN receptor signaling. STAT1 was dispensable for IFN-mediated LATS1 phosphorylation and suppression of tissue repair, although as expected STAT1 was required for IFN-mediated protection from rhinovirus or influenza infection. Dose–response curve experiments revealed that higher concentrations of IFN were required to trigger LATS1 phosphorylation compared to STAT1 phosphorylation. Consistently, during rhinovirus or influenza virus infection of organotypic HBEC cultures, we observed phosphorylation of both LATS1 and STAT1, but with different kinetics, with LATS1 activation showing earlier resolution compared to STAT1 activation. These results provide a conceptual framework for understanding how IFN receptor signaling differentially controls epithelial functions required for tissue repair and antiviral defense, and inform efforts to target pathological effects of IFNs following viral infection and in other high IFN states.

                Background Accurate serological screening is fundamental to transfusion safety. The VDRL test remains extensively used for syphilis screening despite documented limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Objectives This study validated VDRL results through PCR, determined true Treponema pallidum prevalence among VDRL-positive blood donors, established diagnostic accuracy of ELISA and rapid tests, and enhanced blood safety protocols. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study was conducted at the Al-Ramadi regional blood transfusion facility between February and August 2024. Among 5,579 male blood donors aged 18-65 years who underwent screening, 50 demonstrated VDRL reactivity (0.90%). Confirmatory testing protocols included treponemal-specific ELISA, rapid immunochromatographic assays, and real-time PCR targeting the *T. pallidum polA* gene. Diagnostic performance parameters were calculated using PCR (reported sensitivity 99%, specificity 98%) as the reference standard. Results VDRL reactivity was detected in 0.90% (50/5,579) of male blood donors. All VDRL-reactive specimens demonstrated concordant positive results on both ELISA and rapid immunochromatographic platforms. However, PCR analysis detected *T. pallidum* DNA in only 29 specimens (58%), revealing that 21 specimens (42%) represented false-positive serological reactions. Diagnostic accuracy analysis comparing serological assays against PCR demonstrated limited discriminatory performance: ELISA exhibited 100% concordance with VDRL among reactive specimens but failed to distinguish true infections from false-positive reactions (positive predictive value 58%). The rapid diagnostic test demonstrated comparable limitations. High VDRL titers (≥1:8) demonstrated strong correlation with PCR positivity (87.5%), whereas low titers (1:1-1:4) exhibited poor correlation (41.0%). False-positive rates were highest among donors aged 35-44 years. The disposal of blood units based on false-positive serological results represents substantial wastage of valuable blood resources. Conclusion Molecular confirmation of reactive specimens enhances transfusion safety and conserves blood resources. The high false-positive rate (42%) necessitates urgent revision of screening algorithms and implementation of PCR confirmation strategies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Quaking-induced conversion (QuIC) tests, which detect prion-seeding activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), have markedly advanced the antemortem diagnosis of prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). These tests provide high diagnostic accuracy and enable timely differentiation from other rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorders. However, a key limitation of current QuIC tests are the reduced sensitivity in detecting inherited prion diseases and rare sporadic subtypes, including variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr). To address this gap, we evaluated a simplified QuIC test, end-point QuIC (EP-QuIC), incorporating a novel recombinant prion protein substrate derived from the North American deer mouse (<i>Peromyscus maniculatus</i>).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The diagnostic performance of the modified QuIC test was evaluated using CSF samples from 61 sporadic CJD, 50 inherited prion disease, and 5 VPSPr cases.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EP-QuIC with the deer mouse substrate achieved 96.6% sensitivity (111/116) and 100% specificity (35/35), outperforming both standard EP-QuIC (87.1%) and next-generation (IQ-CSF) real-time-QuIC (72.4%) across the same cohort. Notably, this enhanced assay detected inherited mutations, such as D178N, that were previously undetectable with existing diagnostic tests.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings demonstrate that adapting EP-QuIC with an optimized substrate, termed enhanced sensitivity QuIC (ES-QuIC), significantly improves diagnostic performance for inherited and atypical prion diseases. By expanding the diagnostic reach of QuIC tests, this study strengthens antemortem surveillance, reduces reliance on postmortem confirmation, and improves opportunities for early intervention and clinical trial enrollment, particularly for genetic cases most likely to benefit from emerging therapeutic strategies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spin refers to reporting strategies that highlight the benefits of an experimental treatment or divert attention from nonsignificant primary outcomes. To assess spin in randomized clinic trials (RCTs) on pharmaceutical efficacy in multiple sclerosis (MS) and explore associated factors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A systematic literature search was conducted in MedLine (PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane using database-specific thesauri (“Multiple Sclerosis” and “Drug Therapy”) to identify relevant studies. We included multiple sclerosis phase 3 and 4 randomized controlled trials with parallel, superiority designs that were published between 2013 and 2024 reporting nonsignificant primary outcomes. Spin was assessed in title, abstract conclusion, results, discussion, and conclusions. A descriptive analysis was followed by exploratory bivariate logistic regression. Independent variables included trial phase, sample size, drug type, comparison, follow-up time, registration, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) mention, risk of bias (RoB2), journal quartile, first author affiliation, and conflict of interest.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>

     alt="Revisiting Incomplete Tissue-Level Reperfusion Following Successful Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<p>Among patients with acute ischemic stroke achieving successful large vessel recanalization (defined as expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [eTICI ≥2b]), incomplete tissue-level reperfusion, distinct from visually identifiable distal occlusion on digital-subtraction angiography, remains a significant challenge. Persistent tissue-level hypoperfusion, identified on post-thrombectomy perfusion imaging, involves complex pathophysiology comprising 2 primary mechanisms: territorial hypoperfusion, stemming from distal emboli that often manifest after eTICI 2b to 2c or a posteriori with eTICI 3 recanalization, obstructing small distal arterial branches and forming wedge-shaped patterns; and hypoperfusion within the ischemic core, potentially representing capillary no-reflow, a phenomenon of microvascular perfusion failure despite successful macrovascular recanalization well described in the preclinical literature. Such pathophysiological differences have driven inconsistent designations, causing reported incomplete tissue-level reperfusion rate to vary widely (0–42.5%) even in angiographically complete (eTICI 3) recanalization. Further clouding the scene, territorial hypoperfusion may spontaneously reverse within 24 hours (termed “delayed reperfusion”), yet a distinct delayed hypoperfusion can affect necrotic tissue regardless of no-reflow. Whereas persistent hypoperfusion is significantly associated with functional outcomes, the functional impact of true no-reflow remains unclear. Recent positive randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intra-arterial thrombolysis after successful recanalization offer a promising therapeutic strategy. However, these trials lacked perfusion imaging, whereas the larger functional benefit in patients achieving eTICI 2b suggests intra-arterial thrombolysis likely acted on distal emboli rather than true microvascular dysfunction. Regarding microvascular dysfunction, preclinical findings highlight potential therapeutic strategies such as targeting pericyte constriction or inflammatory responses, that warrant clinical translation. This review synthesizes current evidence on the mechanisms, assessment methods, and therapeutic strategies for addressing incomplete tissue-level reperfusion following thrombectomy. Further research is warranted to establish standardized definitions, develop targeted therapies for both territorial hypoperfusion and true no-reflow, and translate promising preclinical findings into effective clinical interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78163?af=R">When Does Alzheimer's Disease Start? Plasma Aβ42/40 Assays Show Steep Changes at Aβ‐PET Centiloid 15, Mean Age of 66 Years</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a long pre-clinical phase where amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau begin to accumulate in the brain. The primary objective was to determine the age at which AD starts by finding the average population age when both positron emission tomography (PET) Aβ (Aβ-PET) and plasma Aβ42/40 become abnormal.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two high performance immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays (WashU/C2N and Shimadzu) were tested on samples from 1,450 participants who were diagnosed as cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD-dementia across 4 international cohorts. Natural history modeling and trajectory analyses of the combined Aβ-PET and plasma Aβ42/40 data were analyzed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Data from both assays demonstrated Aβ42/40 undergoes a rapid change at approximately 15 Centiloid (CL), at an average population disease age at 66 years. On average, plasma Aβ42/40 becomes abnormal approximately 2 years before Aβ-PET, whereby it falls sharply to a stable level at the onset of preclinical AD. Average disease age where Aβ42/40 becomes abnormal, and the corresponding Centiloid level are lower for <i>APOE</i> allele carriers compared with non-carriers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Plasma Aβ42/40 ratio presents a step-like function of peripheral change shortly before the detection of plaques by Aβ-PET. Results are consistent with plasma Aβ42/40 falling to a steady-state level in participants with Aβ-PET levels greater than approximately 14CL for both assays. The age at which this occurs is dependent on <i>APOE ε</i>4 carriership, consistent with the approximate 7-year age difference in Centiloid abnormality between carriers and non-carriers.

                Halstead-Nussloch et al. quantify genome-wide purifying selection on deleterious variants using high-quality annotation of 10 genomes of bread wheat. Strong purifying selection is observed in the category of genes that are highly expressed in root tissues and are in the D subgenome, suggesting a target of breeding to mitigate deleterious variants.

The findings extend the concept of coherent perfect absorption to the temporal domain and may enable coherent manipulation of light in Floquet-engineered complex photonic systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95576">Axonal distribution of mitochondria maintains neuronal autophagy during aging via eIF2β</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal aging and neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by proteostasis collapse, while the cellular factors that trigger it have not been identified. Impaired mitochondrial transport in the axon is another feature of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we found that genetic depletion of axonal mitochondria causes dysregulation of protein degradation. Axons with mitochondrial depletion showed abnormal protein accumulation and autophagic defects. Lowering neuronal ATP levels by blocking glycolysis did not reduce autophagy, suggesting that autophagic defects are associated with mitochondrial distribution. We found that eIF2β was increased by the depletion of axonal mitochondria via proteome analysis. Phosphorylation of eIF2α, another subunit of eIF2, was lowered, and global translation was suppressed. Neuronal overexpression of <i>eIF2β</i> phenocopied the autophagic defects and neuronal dysfunctions, and lowering <i>eIF2β</i> expression rescued those perturbations caused by depletion of axonal mitochondria. These results indicate the mitochondria-eIF2β axis maintains proteostasis in the axon, of which disruption may underlie the onset and progression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107000">Phenylhydrazone-based endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis regulator compounds with enhanced biological activity</a></h4>

              
                Pharmacological enhancement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis is an attractive strategy to mitigate pathology linked to etiologically diverse protein misfolding diseases. However, despite this promise, few compounds have been identified that enhance ER proteostasis through defined mechanisms of action. We previously identified the phenylhydrazone-based compound AA263 as a molecule that promotes adaptive ER proteostasis remodeling through mechanisms including preferential activation of the ATF6 signaling arm of the unfolded protein response (Plate et al., 2016). However, the protein target(s) of AA263 and the potential for further development of this class of ER proteostasis regulators had not been previously explored. Here, we employ chemical proteomics to demonstrate that AA263 covalently targets a subset of ER protein disulfide isomerases, revealing a potential molecular mechanism for the activation of ATF6 afforded by this compound. We then use medicinal chemistry to establish next-generation AA263 analogs showing improved potency and efficacy for ATF6 activation, as compared to the parent compound. Finally, we show that treatment with these AA263 analogs enhances secretory pathway proteostasis to correct the pathologic protein misfolding and trafficking of both a destabilized, disease-associated α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) variant and an epilepsy-associated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variant. These results establish AA263 analogs with enhanced potential for correcting imbalanced ER proteostasis associated with etiologically diverse protein misfolding disorders.

">Persistent cerebellar molecular layer interneuron activity facilitates anticipatory control of tongue movements</a></h4>

              
                Precise, anticipatory movements depend on the brain ability to generate motor commands in advance of immediate sensory input. Although the cerebellar cortex receives abundant sensory input via the mossy fiber pathway, the mechanisms by which continuous sensory signals are transformed or gated remain poorly understood. Here we show that molecular layer interneurons acquire persistent sensory-related activity in mice that develop anticipatory behavior. Employing a targeted lick interception task, we found that interneurons in lobule Crus I exhibit enhanced activity up to five seconds before movement onset locked to the spatial position of a continuously moving target independent of body movement. In more anticipatory mice, movement onset becomes linked to the dynamics of this persistent activity, whereas less anticipatory mice adjust their movements based on immediate sensory related input. Moreover, chemogenetic inhibition of Crus I, but not Crus II, impairs behavioral performance and delays lick onset without altering overall lick parameters. Our results indicate that anticipation in dynamic sensorimotor tasks relies on sensory representations encoded by interneurons.

">Comprehensive 3D mapping reveals distinct spatial gradients of SST, PV, and TH interneurons across the mouse caudoputamen</a></h4>

              
                In addition to spatially organized excitatory forebrain inputs along its mediolateral, dorsoventral, and anteroposterior axes, the striatum relies on cellular diversity to subserve its myriad processing functions. Distinct striatal GABAergic interneuron subtypes, including somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) interneurons likely subserve complementary computational roles. However, a detailed understanding of how these microcircuit components are distributed across striatal territories remains lacking. To address this gap, we generated a comprehensive three-dimensional atlas of SST, PV, and TH interneurons across the mouse caudoputamen using genetic labeling, brain-wide imaging, and voxel-wise quantification. We found that SST and TH interneurons were relatively enriched in the ventral caudoputamen, whereas PV interneurons were enriched dorsally. In addition, PV and TH interneurons exhibited opposing anteroposterior distribution patterns, with PV interneurons enriched posteriorly and TH interneurons showing a marked decline in density towards the striatal tail. Consequently, while the three interneuron subtypes displayed comparable densities in the functionally defined lateral striatum and anterior ventromedial striatum, PV interneurons predominated in the dorsomedial striatum and tail of striatum. We did not observe major sex differences. Together, these findings reinforce the view that the striatum is not a monolithic structure: in addition to structured excitatory inputs, inhibitory microcircuits themselves are differentially distributed across striatal territories, providing region-specific constraints on circuit computation. By integrating interneuron organization into existing anatomical frameworks, this atlas provides a foundation for linking striatal anatomy to function across behavioral domains.

                The developed ISNAG-spectrofluorometric method of Etoricoxib determination is a novel approach, based on quenching of fluorescein fluorescence under interaction with the analyzed compound. In order to stabilize the emitted signal, low-pressure mercury lamp (LPML) as an excitation source and eight solar cells arranged at a 90° interval were used. As a result, the correlated signal is more sensitive and stable. The linear nature of the method in the 0.08-12 mmol/L range reflects a correlation coefficient of 0.9905 & R2 %= 98.10 which is a perfect linearity. The limit of detection was calculated as 0.61 μg/170μL while the limit of quantification as 1.83 μg/sample ensuring excellent trace detection of etoricoxib. The precision on RSD (relative percent standard deviation) scale was determined to be less than 0.5 % which reflects a high level of repeatability and reproducibility of the method. The proposed method was applied to commercial pharmaceutical formulation. In the following statistical experiment, both paired two-sided t-tests were employed. The strength of the proposed method in relation to the official references was an object for one test whereas the speed of the routine one as well as its decrease in reagents usage proportions was an object for another test. There was no significant difference in those tests which proves the applicability of the proposed method. Moreover, the precision of the novel method utilized less reagents, and a significant variation, forming a confidence level utilization was observed. In conclusion, the developed ISNAG-spectrofluorometric method of Etoricoxib determination proved to be a rapid, stable, accurate, and validated method suitable for routine investigation of commercial pharmaceutical formulations.

                Hyperspectral band selection has become a key focus in hyperspectral image processing as it reduces the spectral redundancy and computational overhead, thereby improving classification performance. However, optimal band selection remains challenging due to its combinatorial nature. Although numerous metaheuristic algorithms have been introduced in recent years to address this problem, achieving an effective balance between exploration and exploitation continues to pose a major challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines a parameter-free binary Jaya algorithm with a mutation operator to enhance exploration and maintain solution diversity within the search space. We employ Opposition-based Learning (OBL) for population initialization and Quasi-Reflection reinitialization strategy to add diversity whenever fitness stagnation occurs. To simultaneously improve classification performance and band reduction we adopt weighted sum multi-objective fitness function that minimizes redundancy and enhances model generalization. Our proposed method is evaluated using three benchmark datasets, namely Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas. Experimental results demonstrate that the pro-posed method outperforms recent metaheuristic-based band selection techniques. Its superior performance makes it well suited for various HSI applications.

                This study analyzed international research on systems thinking in science education from 2014 to 2025. Systems thinking, as it points out the links between parts of complex systems, is being seen as an important skill for managing issues such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and sustainability. Despite its importance, genetics is introduced differently in education around the world. Using Scopus data, we study the main contributors to this field, emerging research themes, and how different institutions are teaming up, with sustainability, STEM education, and interdisciplinary learning being areas that are gaining importance. This information highlights the need for international research partnerships and support for teachers to teach systems thinking and improve students’ skills to face real-life problems. The results can help improve how policymakers, educators, and researchers introduce systems thinking into classrooms.

                Background Precision medicine is an emerging approach that tailors treatments based on an individual’s genetic profile. The UAE has made significant strides in this field through initiatives like the National Genomics Strategy and the Emirati Genome Program. However, public awareness and engagement remain key challenges. Purpose This study assesses awareness, acceptance, and utilization of precision medicine among UAE residents. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a snowball sampling method. The survey collected demographic data, health status, knowledge, and experiences with precision medicine. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to analyze associations. Results Most participants (94.3%) were under 50 years old, 62.5% were female, and 60.0% held a bachelor’s degree. Awareness of precision medicine was moderate (55.3%), with higher familiarity among females and students. While 40% believed its main benefit was optimizing drug effectiveness, 38.5% viewed it as crucial for preventing adverse drug reactions. Family and friends (29.5%) were the primary sources of information, yet 25.5% had never heard of precision medicine. Awareness of insurance coverage was low, with 59.0% uncertain about their policy. Genetic testing participation was associated with education level (p < 0.05). Acceptance of precision medicine was higher among individuals with chronic illnesses (p = 0.004). Familiarity scores varied significantly by occupation (p < 0.001) and income (p = 0.004), with higher-income individuals showing greater awareness. Males had a broader range of practice scores (p = 0.003), and individuals with chronic conditions were more aware of precision medicine (p = 0.023). Conclusion Despite advancements, public engagement with precision medicine remains limited. Targeted educational initiatives, improved accessibility, and increased awareness of insurance coverage may enhance adoption and utilization.

                Background Since the building sector contributes significantly to carbon emissions, using sustainable materials is more crucial than ever. Mycelium is investigated in this study as a natural substitute for conventional insulation materials like rock wool and XPS. Its thermal performance has been evaluated in a residential building in New Cairo, Egypt, using Design-Builder simulations, paying particular attention to U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. The results demonstrate that mycelium is environmentally safe, biodegradable, and provides insulation that is comparable to XPS. This demonstrates its promise as a sustainable option for building in the future. Methods This research uses Design-Builder software version 7.3.0.046 integrated with Energy-Plus to simulate the thermal conductivity of mycelium compared to two of the most frequently utilized traditional materials for insulation in Egypt, in Janna Compound, New Cairo. The analysis examines energy consumption, thermal comfort, Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfaction (PPD%). The study provides a comparative evaluation of mycelium insulation compared to traditional materials like XPS and Rockwool. Results According to the simulation results, mycelium insulation performs comparably to XPS regarding U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. Specifically, mycelium achieved a 0.323 U-value, reduced discomfort hours percentage to 16.9%, and achieved a ratio of energy reduction of 15.8% compared to the base case. These results demonstrate how mycelium has the potential to compete with traditional insulation materials while offering significant sustainability advantages, such as biodegradability and a lower carbon footprint. Conclusion In Janna Compound, New Cairo, the research shows how mycelium insulation can improve thermal comfort and save energy usage. It performs similarly to XPS but has more positive environmental effects. These results support the integration of mycelium into Egypt’s sustainable housing practices, providing key insights for architects, developers, and policymakers focused on energy-efficient and sustainable urban development.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Though it is widely known that tau deposition affects brain structure, the precise localization of these effects is poorly understood, especially in relation to gyral and sulcal anatomy. We investigated whether tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) preferentially affects sulci, and particularly sulcal depths.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 675 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data to investigate relationships between neocortical tau PET signal and cortical thickness. We then examined an advanced AD case with postmortem MRI and coregistered whole-brain phospho-tau staining for evidence of sulcal tau distribution in AD. Finally, in a sample of 187 cognitively unimpaired young and older adults with resting-state functional MRI, we examined connectivity strength between tau-vulnerable regions and the hippocampus across adulthood, prior to disease-related cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our findings revealed that tau-related cortical thinning predominantly occurs in sulcal regions, especially the deepest parts. Postmortem histology confirmed preferential tau accumulation in sulcal depths. Additionally, connectivity analyses revealed that, across adulthood, these primarily sulcal regions most susceptible to tau-related thinning also have stronger connectivity to the hippocampus, suggesting a role for network connectivity in the vulnerability of sulci to the effects of tau pathology later in life.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings support the hypothesis that sulci, and particularly their depths, represent structurally and functionally vulnerable regions for tau deposition in AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this sulcal vulnerability provides insight into general principles driving regional susceptibility to pathology, and sheds light on the detrimental functional and cognitive effects of tau pathology.

                Background The burden of visual impairment and avoidable blindness has been attributed to the shortage and poor distribution of adequately trained eye care personnel. In the district health system, primary health care (PHC) nurses are the first point of contact for eye care patients. To provide adequate eye care, the nurses in PHC clinics apply their knowledge on basic eye health to ensure best practices and management for patients that present at their clinics. Anecdotal evidence regarding the knowledge and practices of these PHC professionals is scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PHC nurses’ knowledge and practices on eye health. Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural district of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. Stratified random sampling was used to select 28 from the 74 PHC clinics in the district. A researcher-administered questionnaire using a 5-point likert scale with options strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree and strongly agree, was developed, piloted and finalised for this study. The tool had four sections: demographic information, knowledge of eye health, practices on evaluating visual function and identification and management of presenting eye conditions. Data were collected, captured onto MSXcel, cleaned, coded and analysed descriptively, and for Chi-squared significance at 95%, using R statistical software. Results From 200 responses, 86.4% (n=172) were females of the African race. Most (93.5%, n=187) had never undergone formal training in eye care. Only 28% (n=56) correctly identified a mature cataract while 28% (n=56) correctly identified signs of glaucoma; the global leading causes of preventable blindness. A total of 94% (n=188) failed to accurately measure visual acuity on a patient. Conclusions PHC nurses showed poor knowledge and practices of common eye conditions. There is an urgent need for eye health training for PHC nurses, and the clear management protocols on eye care.

                Background Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is one of the microvascular complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) which tended not to be detected early, necessitating more effective biomarkers for its detection. HbA1c showed a negative correlation with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and was significantly associated with an increased urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), thereby influencing the progression of DKD. Objective This study was an untargeted metabolomics study and aimed to compare the urinary metabolites of low DKD risk T2DM patients with controlled and uncontrolled HbA1c in patients taking metformin-glimepiride. Materials and Methods This study conducted as a cross-sectional study using non-probability sampling at Pasar Minggu District Health Center, 32 samples were divided into controlled (n=16) and uncontrolled HbA1c groups (n=16). Blood samples were collected for HbA1c and eGFR measurements, while urine samples were analyzed for UACR and metabolites. Analysis was performed using LC/MS-QTOF and the data was processed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0 and various databases. The discrimination results of the two groups were visualized through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). The significance of metabolites between groups was selected with the parameters VIP>1, log2(FC)>1.2, and p-value<0.05. Results Fifteen selected metabolites underwent metabolic pathway analysis and were evaluated for their potential as biomarkers. Three of these metabolites showed potential as biomarkers (AUC>0.65): oxaloacetate and 5′-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamidine, which decreased in the uncontrolled HbA1c group, and (S)-dihydroorotate, which increased in the uncontrolled HbA1c group. The involved metabolic pathways included (1) alanine, aspartate, and glutamate, (2) citric acid (Krebs cycle), (3) gluconeogenesis, (4) pyruvate, (5) pyrimidine, and (6) purine. Conclusion Based on these results, there’s a significant difference in urine metabolites of the two groups that potentially be the biomarkers for DKD progression with controlled and uncontrolled HbA1c.

                Background Plectranthus amboinicus is an aromatic herb known for its medicinal properties and is increasingly explored for cosmetic applications. Its bioactive compounds possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a promising candidate for multifunctional skincare formulations. Methods This study investigated the extraction of bioactive compounds from P. amboinicus leaves using microwave-assisted ethanol extraction. Two drying techniques—tray drying and freeze-drying—were compared to evaluate their impact on the extraction efficiency. The optimal extract (PF15), prepared using 15-minute microwave extraction and freeze-drying, was selected for further analysis. Bioactive content was assessed through quantification of caffeic acid, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity via the DPPH assay. The antimicrobial activity of PF15 was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Cutibacterium acnes. Anti-inflammatory potential of PF15 was evaluated in LPS-stimulated human THP-1 macrophages by measuring cytokine production. Results The PF15 extract yielded the highest levels of bioactive compounds and demonstrated strong antioxidant activity. It exhibited significant antimicrobial effects against all tested skin pathogens. In the anti-inflammatory assay, PF15 significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) while upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The extract was formulated into a topical cream, which underwent accelerated stability testing over six heat-cool cycles. The cream remained stable with no signs of phase separation, discoloration, odor change, or microbial contamination, and maintained a pH of 5.5. Conclusions The PF15 extract of P. amboinicus demonstrates potent antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its successful incorporation into a stable cream formulation supports its potential as a multifunctional active ingredient in skincare products. These findings highlight P. amboinicus as a valuable natural source for the development of cosmetic formulations targeting oxidative stress, microbial infection, and inflammation.

                Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was isolated from the marine sponge Melophlus sarasinorum collected in Indonesia. The crude extracts of this strain displayed antibacterial and cytotoxic activity, and therefore, to further investigate the bioactive potential of the strain, whole genome sequencing was performed in this study. The whole genome sequencing of Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was conducted using both Illumina NextSeq and Oxford Nanopore platforms with a de novo hybrid assembly approach. The high-quality genome obtained is 10.23 Mbp with a GC content of 71.57%. It is organised into a single chromosomal contig, two linear plasmids, and one circular plasmid. Interestingly, a long-terminal inverted repeat (L-TIR) sequence of 1.5 Mbp has been confirmed in the strain genome. Phylogenomic analysis suggested that the strain BTA 1-131 likely represents a new species within the genus Streptomyces. To the best of our knowledge, the genome data described here would be the first report on the hybrid genome sequence of Streptomyces associated with the rarely reported sponge Melophlus sarasinorum from Indonesia, with a unique feature of L-TIR. The complete genome data generated here will provide compelling information for further analysis of the biosynthetic potential of the strain BTA 1-131 to produce new bioactive compounds.

                Background The current study attempts to fill a significant and crucial deficiency in knowing how to trigger the digital footprints for enhancing service quality from the customers’ point of view among Internet service providers as well, especially under the Iraqi environment, Mosul city, Nineveh Governorate. The sector is in a unique competitive situation, and although this strategic function of digital data is extremely critical for personalization initiatives as well as for competitive advantage, very little practical use has been made in such an environment. Indeed, metrics such as (data governance maturity and customer trust) emerged as challenges impacting the use of data analytics and their integration into the improvement of customer experience. As such, this study seeks to understand how local Internet service providers (ISPs) can be empowered by individual customers’ digital footprints, evaluate what influences their most effective use in order to enhance customer experience, and discover best explorations for guidance on appropriate and ethical strategies. Methodology The method data were collected from (ISPs) using a structured questionnaire, issued to a representative sample of ISP and overall number of (319). Results However, the results obtained using statistical analysis indicate that while digital footprints significantly enhance service personalization and support efficiency, there is a substantial implementation gap between data collection and its application to design value-adding interactions. This, in turn, suggests a need to strengthen the analysis capacity of service providers. Conclusion This paper ends with an insight; for Internet service providers to facilitate customer digital footprints and the digital data left by customers to enhance the quality of services, they must adopt a balanced, evidence-based strategy as well as transparent consideration of privacy concerns that sustain user trust.

                Background Recently, health professional education uses visual art observation to promote various observation-related technical skills. This article maps the studies on such interventions, scrutinizes what they measured as observational skills, and discusses their effectiveness. Methods Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, a scoping review was conducted. Publications from 2001 on were identified by searching four databases and by hand searching. The author screened each publication using the pre-designed eligibility criteria: participants were novice healthcare learners enrolled in visual art observation training; the study aimed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on technical skills related to observation; the skills were objectively measured. The author extracted relevant information from the included papers without additional inquiry into the study authors. The extracted information was illustrated in both a tabular and descriptive format. Results 3,157 publications were identified, of which 18 articles were included. Few studies had valid and reliable experiments. The relatively valid evidence is that the participants listed more elements or signs for artistic or medical images. Conclusions Sound evidence is lacking for all the technical skills intended to be fostered. Observation skills for artistic images have not been demonstrated to transfer to technical skills. Nor do the studies show that they promoted accurate diagnoses and reduced misdiagnoses. Additionally, the evidence on verbalizing skills is not isolated from the impact of discussions and is unclear regarding its transfer to actual communication. For the others, there are not enough valid studies on technical skills. This is true for studies that directly examine promoting accurate diagnosis or reducing misdiagnosis. Moreover, there may be promising alternatives to visual art observations for cultivating such technical skills, but no comparative studies were conducted.

                Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving differential equations, yet their efficiency is often hindered by the need for intricate and computationally costly loss-balancing techniques to address residual term imbalance. This paper introduces a direct differential equation term scaling framework that removes the loss-balancing bottleneck entirely. By scaling each term in the governing equations using characteristic physical dimensions, the proposed method ensures numerical consistency across all contributions, eliminating the need for adaptive weighting during training. This not only simplifies the PINN formulation but also improves stability and convergence. The approach is validated on challenging nonlinear one-dimensional elasticity problems, demonstrating that high-accuracy solutions can be obtained with compact neural network architectures and reducing floating-point operations by at least two orders of magnitude. A reverse scaling step restores the solution to the original physical domain, preserving physical interpretability. Unlike existing approaches that modify the loss function during training, the proposed framework operates directly at the level of the governing equations, prior to loss construction. The results demonstrate that direct term scaling transforms PINN training into an efficient, and easily deployable process, paving the way for broader adoption in computational mechanics and other physics-driven domains.

                Background Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), such as methandienone, are synthetic testosterone derivatives that are widely used for the enhancement of physical performance and the growth of muscles. This study looked at the effect of methandienone on ovarian CYP19A1 gene expression and oxidative status in rabbits. The work also examined whether supplementation with selenium could reduce the adverse effects caused by methandienone. Methods Twenty healthy adult female rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups and maintained under uniform management for 30 days. The groups included a control, a methandienone-treated group (T1), a selenium group (T2), and a combined methandienone plus selenium group (T3). Serum oestrogens concentrations were measured using standard biochemical techniques. CYP19A1 mRNA expression in ovarian tissue and markers were quantified by established molecular and biochemical protocols. Results Rabbits receiving methandienone alone (T1) showed a significant decline (P≤0.05) in CYP19A1 mRNA expression and serum oestrogens when compared with the control and other treatment groups. Selenium supplementation (T2) produced marked increases in both parameters relative to G1 and G3, indicating a robust corrective effect. Oxidative stress analysis revealed elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl content (PCC) in the T1 group, consistent with increased oxidative stress. Intermediate oxidative stress values were observed in the T3 group, exceeding those in the T1 group but remaining below those in the T2 group. Conclusion Methandienone appears to impair ovarian function by suppressing CYP19A1gene expression and promoting oxidative stress, leading to reduced steroidogenic activity. Selenium administration mitigates these disturbances by enhancing antioxidant defense and partially restoring gene expression and oestrogens levels. These findings highlight the potential of selenium as a supportive intervention against methandienone -induced oxidative and hormonal disruptions in rabbits.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 infection is novel and widespread globally, causing a range of illness severity. The impacts on the liver from SARS-CoV-2 are variable and appear unpredictable. Objective In the weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection, liver-related blood tests are abnormal in patterns different than in matched controls without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods This was a retrospective study of health administrative data of individuals in Ontario, Canada between January 2020 and September 2022. Cases were individuals with their first positive COVID-19 test with at least one liver-related blood test (AST, ALT, albumin, INR, bilirubin) available in the following 28 days. Two control individuals (with a negative COVID-19 test) were age/sex matched to each case. Any patients with a diagnostic code indicting pre-existing liver disease, or a positive COVID-19 test in the preceding six months were excluded. Machine learning analysis approaches included logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), and neutral network models. Results 100,574 cases and 200,709 matched controls were included. 49% (49,299) had at least one abnormal liver test in 28 days following positive COVID-19 test. Of the controls, 41% (82,495) had at least one abnormal liver test in the 28 days following negative COVID-19 test. The optimal machine learning model used XGBoost for adult cases, with an area under the curve of 0.74. Conclusions Further studies could use this approach to create monitoring systems to use abnormalities like liver enzyme changes, at a population level, as a bellwether for not only COVID-19 outbreaks, but also other hepatotropic illness epidemics, and pandemics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-113/v1?src=rss">Experiences of Indonesian Christian Religious Education Teachers in Implementing the Independent Curriculum in Sen-ior High Schools: A Phenomenological Approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study explores the experiences of Christian religious education teachers in implementing the independent curriculum. The independent curriculum in Indonesia was developed as a more adaptive curriculum framework as part of the learning reform initiative, focusing on essential materials and the development of students’ character and skills. The government explains that the main characteristics of this curriculum that support learning recovery are project-based learning, which develops soft skills and character. Methods This study employs a qualitative phenomenological approach to examine how Christian religious education teachers engage with the independent curriculum. Given that the research questions focused on the subjective experiences of Christian religious education teachers, data were collected through semi-structured and in-depth interviews with four selected participants, chosen based on the study’s objectives and a purposive sampling approach in North Tapanuli Regency, Indonesia. Results The study revealed that teachers encountered several challenges, including IT skills gaps, differences in understanding the concept of independent curriculum, and the scarcity of relevant materials for Christian education. Teachers need help adapting to the limitations of old learning methods and the special training and mentoring required to implement the new technology system of the independent curriculum. However, there are initiatives from teachers to collaborate, add materials, and learn from the teacher community to improve their competence. Therefore, this study ultimately offers a new perspective on understanding a phenomenon, namely, the experiences of Christian religious education teachers in implementing the independent curriculum. Conclusion This study emphasizes the importance of more comprehensive support from the government and schools to enhance the effectiveness of implementing the independent curriculum, especially in Christian religious education. This study offers valuable insights for policymakers and education practitioners to support the effective and sustainable implementation of the independent curriculum.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-112/v1?src=rss">Experimental study For improving sandy soil against uplift capacity by Emulsion Asphalt for Anchor plate [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The use of anchors fixed in sandy soil is currently pioneering, especially in fixing the sides of excavations or marine structures, and even in engineering structures exposed to lateral loads. Therefore, there is a need to use improvements to develop the bearing capacity of anchors, whether single or group, or even if their burial depth is shallow or deep, as is the case with other engineering structures. Method A physical model was used in this experimental research to study the behavior of anchors individually and collectively in sandy soil and how to change the critical depth of burial from shallow depth to deep depth individually and collectively with anchors in addition to the upward bearing capacity in the soil without improvement and also using electronic measuring devices to measure the vertical displacement, and then using bituminous emulsion and recording the values of the uplift bearing capacity of the anchors and comparing them with natural soil. Results In this paper model tests were carried out by using single and line groups square anchor plates (1x2), (1x3), (1x4) & (1x5) in sandy soil with (30) different embedded ratio (H/D) test to understand the behavior of the anchor plate in sandy soils depending upon on the transition from shallow to deep anchor, also to obtain the transitional depth by which the anchor acts as a shallow or deep while in loading state. Depending on the tests the critical depth in the line group ranges from (5D) to (6D), while using a single anchor the critical depth is approximately more than (5D). The other (10) tests were carried out for improving the soil around the anchor by emulsion asphalt at depth (2D) & (6D) shallow and deep respectively. The optimum ratio of the emulsion asphalt was from (4-6)% by direct shear and unconfined pressure tests. The ultimate capacity was improved at high ratio for shallow single anchor than deep single anchor. The use of asphalt emulsion with a 21-day curing period resulted in an increase in the uplift capacity of both the individual anchors and the group. On the other hand, the uplift capacity of the anchor was increased with the use of asphalt emulsion with a 21-day curing period. Furthermore, the uplift capacity of the individual anchor was lower than that of the group of anchors, while the improvement in the shallow anchors resulted in a higher increase in uplift capacity than the deep anchors. Conclusions After conducting laboratory experiments on sandy soil with anchors installed in it and at different depths, it was found that there is a critical depth for the anchors at which the depth moves from shallow to deep. Also, the improvement with bituminous emulsion led to an increase in the load-bearing capacity of the anchors when lifting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-111/v1?src=rss">Exploring the Relationship Between Decreased Sound Tolerance and Neural Attention Processing: An ERP Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Decreased sound tolerance (DST) is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study examined how attentional control resources influence DST. Previous studies have shown that increasing cognitive load enhances the brain activity component (N100) to task-irrelevant noise. We hypothesized that individuals with DST would be more sensitive to cognitive load, showing a greater increase in their neural responses to noise as cognitive load increases. Because DST comprises multiple subjective symptoms, we analyzed the associations with specific symptoms. Methods Thirteen adults with ASD and twenty-two adults without ASD participated in the study. Participants who self-reported auditory hypersensitivity were classified as the DST group. All participants completed a DST questionnaire with six subscales: excessive loudness, ear pain, fear, annoyance, attention control, and attention to detail. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by task-irrelevant noise were analyzed during an auditory n-back task. The n-back task included a low (1-back) and a high (2-back) cognitive load condition. Results The prevalence of self-reported DST was significantly higher in the ASD group than in controls. Individuals who reported DST also tended to experience other types of sensory hypersensitivity. Attentional functions were associated with fear, annoyance, and loudness perception of sounds, and ear pain appeared to function independently of other DST symptoms. Scores for attentional control difficulties related to DST did not correlate with performance on the n-back task, which reflects susceptibility to noise interference. Contrary to previous findings, N100 amplitude did not differ between task-load conditions and did not vary according to the presence of DST. P200 amplitude was larger in the 1-back than in the 2-back condition but did not differ by ASD diagnosis or DST status. Conclusions The presence of DST or ASD was not associated with cognitive capacity or with the auditory processing of task-irrelevant noise.

                Zhang et al. reveal that ZDHHC12-mediated palmitoylation negatively regulates PARP1-DNA binding and suppresses PARP1 trapping by PARP inhibitors. Blocking PARP1 palmitoylation enhances PARP inhibitor sensitivity in ovarian cancer models and overcomes resistance conferred by patient-derived PARP1 mutations (R138C/R591C), revealing a targetable therapeutic vulnerability.

                <p>Episodic timing refers to the one-shot, automatic encoding of temporal information in the brain, in the absence of attention to time. A previous magnetoencephalography (MEG) study showed that the relative burst time of spontaneous alpha oscillations (&alpha;) during quiet wakefulness was a selective predictor of retrospective duration estimation. This observation was interpreted as &alpha; embodying the "ticks" of an internal contextual clock. Herein, we replicate and extend these findings using electroencephalography (EEG), assess robustness to time-on-task effects, and test the generalizability in virtual reality (VR) environments. In three EEG experiments, 128 participants of either sex underwent 4&nbsp;min eyes-open resting-state recordings followed by an unexpected retrospective duration estimation task. Experiment 1 tested participants before any tasks, Experiment 2 after 90&nbsp;min of timing tasks, and Experiment 3 in VR environments of different sizes. We successfully replicated the original MEG findings in Experiment 1 but did not in Experiment 2. We explain the lack of replication through time-on-task effects (changes in &alpha; power and topography) and contextual changes yielding a cognitive strategy based on temporal expectation (supported by a fast passage of time). In Experiment 3, we did not find the expected duration underestimation in VR and did not replicate the correlation between &alpha; bursts and retrospective time estimates. Overall, while EEG captures the &alpha; burst marker of episodic timing, its reliability depends critically on experimental context. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling experimental context when using &alpha; bursts as a neural marker of episodic timing.</p>

                With increasing concern about the environmental and social impacts of the food industry, sustainability has become a central focus of scientific research. To better understand how this field has evolved, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify publication trends, key themes, and emerging topics. The analysis was based on data from Scopus and Web of Science and examined the evolution of scientific output related to sustainability in the food industry. Methods included keyword co-occurrence analysis, assessments of country and author productivity, and thematic evolution analysis. In addition, a Cartesian framework was used to classify key terms according to their relevance and recency. The results show an exponential growth in scientific output, with notable increases in 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023, reaching a statistical significance of 99.65%. Three main country clusters were identified, with the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy standing out for their productivity and impact. At the author level, Mangla and Luthra were the most productive, while Land, Beske, and Van Der Vorst had the greatest impact on the field. Thematic evolution analysis revealed a transition from early research focused on “soil erosion” to more recent themes such as “circular economy,” “supply chain management,” “food safety,” and “wastewater treatment.” The keyword co-occurrence network identified seven thematic clusters, with the most prominent cluster centered on “sustainability,” “waste management,” and “short supply chain.” Emerging topics included “Covid-19,” “blockchain,” and the “agri-food sector.” Overall, the study demonstrates a clear evolution and diversification of sustainability research in the food industry, underscoring the importance of emerging topics and international collaboration. It also proposes a multidisciplinary research agenda that prioritizes food security, sustainable agriculture, and supply chain management, and emphasizes the integration of innovative technologies to address current environmental, economic, and social challenges.

                Background Ruminal impaction is a serious digestive disorder in sheep, leading to systemic metabolic acidosis and, as a consequence, widespread physiological disturbances. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate biochemical, electrolyte and oxidative parameters in a local Iraqi sheep that was suffering from ruminal impaction. Methods A case control study was performed in 20 adult female sheep (Awassi sheep breeder) (10 ruminal impaction and 10 control) diagnosed with in Fallujah, Iraq, based on clinical signs and confirmed by laboratory findings of hyperkalaemia. The control group consisted of sheep of age, sex and weight consistent with clinically normal sheep. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected, and serum was analyzed for electrolytes, biochemical and oxidative markers using established laboratory methods. Results The impacted animals showed significant increases (P≤0.05) in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), glucose, urea, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate and significant decreases (P≤0.05) in albumin, cholesterol, sodium, chloride, and calcium levels, where serum level of magnesium did not show any significant difference between the groups. In addition, oxidative stress was present as there was a significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Background These findings indicate a pathogenesis cascade whereby ingestion of poorly digested food causes ruminal stasis, systemic acidosis, liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, electrolyte disturbances, oxidative stress and oxidative stress. Using a single biomarker may underestimate the true severity of the disease, while combining biochemical, electrolyte and oxidative measurements provides a more complete picture.

                Microalgae are increasingly recognized as sustainable green cell factories capable of producing a various high-value bioactive compounds. Among them, the red microalga Porphyridium purpureum stands out for its unique ability to secrete sulfated exopolysaccharides (sEPS)—complex macromolecules enriched with sulfate and uronic acid groups that exhibit potent biological activities. These compounds function as natural antioxidants, immunomodulators, and antimicrobial agents, attracting substantial interest from the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and functional food industries. A targeted literature search was conducted across the Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases to identify studies focusing on the extraction, structural characterization, and applications of sulfated exopolysaccharides from Porphyridium purpureum between 2015 and 2025. Recent research has demonstrated rapid advancements in environmentally friendly extraction technologies, including membrane filtration, three-phase partitioning (TPP), ultrasound-assisted TPP (UATPP), and deep eutectic solvents (DES), which collectively enhance the yield, purity, and preserve the biological functionality of sEPS. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in structural and mechanistic elucidation through advanced analytical and imaging techniques such as two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, FTIR, methylation analysis, and transcriptomic profiling. These approaches have clarified how cultivation parameters and environmental stressors influence EPS biosynthesis, sulfation patterns, and biological activity. Overall, this review provides an integrated and forward-looking perspective on the scientific advances and technological challenges surrounding P. purpureum sEPS, outlining future directions toward sustainable bioprocessing and industrial valorization of these high-value biomacromolecules.

                <p>by Tengfei Ji, Bo Yang, Meng Wang, Hong Ji, Huazhe Yang, Yizhuo Liu</p>

Spatial transcriptomics enables the measurement of gene expression in intact tissues. Despite this, reconstructing anatomically accurate spatial domains remains challenging, primarily due to expression sparsity, complex tissue architecture that is characterized by sharp boundaries and long-range continuity, and weak spatial signals. Traditional pipelines typically rely on expression-driven clustering and spatial smoothing, which underperform at boundaries and in sparse regions while neglecting morphological information. To address these challenges, AugGCL is proposed, an augmented graph-convolutional learning framework that enhances spatial structure decoding and gene expression reconstruction through targeted augmentation of both gene and image data. A key component of AugGCL is neighborhood information aggregation mechanism, which integrates expression similarity and spatial proximity to construct a weighted graph and an enhanced expression matrix, addressing sparsity without sacrificing boundary clarity. Additionally, a two stream weighted graph convolutional network jointly models refined gene features and image-derived morphological information, with image-aware auxiliary reconstructions enhancing weak spatial signals and sharpening boundaries. On datasets from the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, breast cancer, and mouse embryo, AugGCL outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics, showing robustness and generalization across a range of datasets. Downstream analysis validated the reliability of the method, confirming its effectiveness in cell annotation, functional enrichment, and mechanistic studies. AugGCL generates clearer spatial domains and significantly advances the application of spatial transcriptomics in tissue structure and disease research.

                <p>by Haneol Cho, Junho Lee, Sean Lawler, Yangjin Kim</p>

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer with the very poor survival and high recurrence rate. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play a pivotal role in regulation of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we developed a new mathematical model of the critical GBM-TAN interaction in the heterogeneous brain tissue. The model reveals that the dual and complex role of TANs (either anti-tumorigenic N1 and the pro-tumorigenic N2 type) regulates the phenotypic trajectory of the evolution of tumor growth and the invasive patterns in white and gray matter via mediators such as IFN-<i>β</i> and TGF-<i>β</i>. We investigated the effect of normalizing the immune environment on glioma growth by applying a therapeutic antibody and developed several strategies for eradication of tumor cells by neutrophil-mediated transport of nanoparticles. We also developed a strategy of combination therapy (surgery + Trojan neutrophils) for effective control of the infiltration of the glioma cells in one hemisphere before crossing the corpus callosum (CC) in order to prevent recurrence in the other hemisphere. This alternative approach compared to the extended resection of the glioma including CC or butterfly GBM may provide the greater anti-tumor efficacy and reduce side effects such as cognitive impairment.

                <p>by Daniel Shani, Peter Dayan</p>

Egocentric representations of the environment have historically been relegated to being used only for simple forms of spatial behaviour such as stimulus-response learning. However, in the many cases that critical aspects of policies are best defined relative to the self, egocentric representations can be advantageous. Furthermore, there is evidence that forms of egocentric representation might exist in the wider hippocampal formation. Nevertheless, egocentric representations have yet to be fully incorporated as a component of modern navigational methods. Here we investigate egocentric successor representations (SRs) and their combination with allocentric representations. We build a reinforcement learning agent that combines an egocentric SR with a conventional allocentric SR to navigate complex 2D environments. We demonstrate that the agent learns generalisable egocentric and allocentric value functions which, even when only additively composed, allow it to learn policies efficiently and to adapt to new environments quickly. Our work shows the benefit for egocentric relational structure to be captured, as well as allocentric. We offer a new perspective on how cognitive maps could usefully be composed from multiple simple maps representing associations between state features defined in different reference frames.

                <p>by Lucas J. Restrepo, Jasmine K. Graslie, Tina M. Fortier, Eric H. Baehrecke</p>

The clearance of mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy) is important for cell health. Mutations in genes that are required for mitophagy, including <i>Vps13D</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, and <i>Parkin</i>, are associated with movement disorders, but gaps exist in our understanding of how Vps13D regulates mitophagy. Here, we identify Mtch (MTCH2 in humans) as a regulator of mitophagy based on a relationship with Vps13D during developmentally programmed mitophagy in <i>Drosophila</i> intestine enterocyte cells. Similar to <i>Vps13D</i> mutant cells, <i>Mtch</i> mutant cells fail to clear mitochondria and possess elevated markers of autophagy. Genetic and molecular experiments reveal that Mtch and Vps13D function in a mitophagy pathway with PINK1, Parkin, and the mitophagy receptor BNIP3. Unlike <i>Vps13D</i> and <i>Parkin</i> mutant cells, <i>Mtch</i> is required for proper expression of the tail-anchored protein BNIP3. Thus, the tail-anchored protein insertase function of Mtch/MTCH2 likely explains how these proteins possess multiple cell context-specific functions.

                <p>by Yanhua Zhao, Meiting Zhang, Yan You, Jinrong Zhang, Yuning Ji, Lei Lei</p>

Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a valuable tool in regenerative medicine, yet its efficiency remains limited by epigenetic reprogramming barriers that have been partially corrected by global regulation of epigenetic enzymes. However, these approaches lack gene locus specificity and may disrupt normal gene regulation. Therefore, new strategies capable of broadly enhancing reprogramming fidelity are needed. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the pioneer transcription factor Nr5a2 in mouse SCNT embryos improves both zygotic genome activation and the morula-to-blastocyst transition, two major developmental barriers in SCNT, and enhances birth rates. Mechanistically, Nr5a2 recruits P300 to increase H3K27ac at genes with low expression, restoring transcriptional activity and promoting SCNT embryo development.

                <p>by Dinh Nhan Lai, Xi Yang, Chong Xie, Ting Li, An Yan, Xing Liu, Yun Zhou</p>

Land plants alternate between generations of asexual sporophytes and sexual gametophytes. Unlike seed plants, ferns produce free-living gametophytes that grow independently from their sporophytes. Gametophytes of the model fern <i>Ceratopteris</i> exist in two sex types: hermaphrodites and males. Hermaphrodites maintain meristems and secrete the pheromone antheridiogen, inducing undecided gametophytes to become males. In the absence of antheridiogen, males exhibit developmental plasticity and dynamic cell fate specification by initiating de novo meristems to convert into hermaphrodites. Despite its essential role, the molecular signals governing this process remain unclear. Here, we show that local auxin biosynthesis, dynamically regulated during sex-type conversion, establishes new auxin maxima that are critical for specifying and promoting the proliferation of the meristem progenitor cell (MPC) lineage, ultimately enabling the de novo formation of a multicellular meristem from a single MPC. Time-lapse imaging revealed that upon antheridiogen removal, auxin signaling is specifically activated at the initial site of proliferation in <i>Ceratopteris</i> males, triggering new meristem formation. This auxin signaling subsequently becomes concentrated at the center of the proliferating meristem, aligning with localized auxin biosynthesis and the emergence of the meristem notch. Computationally reconstrued lineage maps further showed that chemical inhibition of CrTAA1 abolishes these dynamic auxin patterns, blocking MPC lineage initiation and its subsequent proliferation. Furthermore, genetic knockout of <i>CrTAA1</i> via CRISPR-Cas9 phenocopies the effects of chemical inhibition, preventing new meristem formation and disrupting male-to-hermaphrodite conversion. Together, these findings uncover a molecular mechanism underlying sex-type conversion in land plants and highlight the pivotal role of de novo auxin biosynthesis in orchestrating cell fate and proliferation during meristem formation.

                <p>Cladribine tablets are approved for relapsing multiple sclerosis, mediating their clinical effect by moderately depleting lymphocytes. In a prospective, monocentric study including 22 patients completing 2 annual cycles of cladribine, B- and T-cell receptor repertoires and relapse activity were assessed at baseline and after 24 months. T-cell clonality increased, driven by loss of low-frequency, naive clonotypes, and re-expansion of dominant CD8 memory clonotypes, particularly in clinically stable patients. In contrast, B-cell receptor richness increased because of reconstruction by transitional and naive B cells with higher clonotype numbers observed in relapsing patients. Therefore, competing immune reconstitution following cladribine therapy could result in differential clinical responses. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-109/v1?src=rss">Evaluating Business Intelligence Success in the Public Sector: Extending the DeLone and McLean Model with Perceived Organizational Support [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The effectiveness of information systems in enhancing user performance is influenced by various factors, including system quality, service quality, and user satisfaction. Perceived Organizational Support (POS) has been proposed as a moderator in this relationship, though its impact remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the moderating role of POS on the relationship between system quality, service quality, and user performance, specifically in the context of Approweb, an information system used by account representatives at the Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) in Jakarta. Methods A quantitative research approach with an explanatory design was adopted to examine causal relationships among the variables. The theoretical framework was based on the DeLone and McLean Information System Success Model (2003), with POS incorporated from the socio-technical perspective. Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey from 329 Account Representatives (ARs) using a probability sampling method Results The study found that both system quality and service quality significantly influence user satisfaction and user performance. Moreover, POS was found to significantly moderate the relationship between system quality, service quality, and user performance, enhancing the positive effects of both quality dimensions on performance. These results suggest that organizational support is a key factor in maximizing the benefits of information systems. Conclusions The findings confirm the critical role of system quality, service quality, and POS in improving user performance. POS was shown to amplify the positive effects of both system and service quality, indicating that users are more likely to perform effectively when they perceive strong organizational support. The study contributes to the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model by incorporating POS as a moderating factor and emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to system success that integrates both technical and social dimensions.
