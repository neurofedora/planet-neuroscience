              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fast protein structure comparison through effective representation learning with contrastive graph neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chunqiu Xia, Shi-Hao Feng, Ying Xia, Xiaoyong Pan, Hong-Bin Shen</p>

Protein structure alignment algorithms are often time-consuming, resulting in challenges for large-scale protein structure similarity-based retrieval. There is an urgent need for more efficient structure comparison approaches as the number of protein structures increases rapidly. In this paper, we propose an effective graph-based protein structure representation learning method, GraSR, for fast and accurate structure comparison. In GraSR, a graph is constructed based on the intra-residue distance derived from the tertiary structure. Then, deep graph neural networks (GNNs) with a short-cut connection learn graph representations of the tertiary structures under a contrastive learning framework. To further improve GraSR, a novel dynamic training data partition strategy and length-scaling cosine distance are introduced. We objectively evaluate our method GraSR on SCOPe v2.07 and a new released independent test set from PDB database with a designed comprehensive performance metric. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, GraSR achieves about 7%-10% improvement on two benchmark datasets. GraSR is also much faster than alignment-based methods. We dig into the model and observe that the superiority of GraSR is mainly brought by the learned discriminative residue-level and global descriptors. The web-server and source code of GraSR are freely available at www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/GraSR/ for academic use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Oscillator decomposition of infant fNIRS data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takeru Matsuda, Fumitaka Homae, Hama Watanabe, Gentaro Taga, Fumiyasu Komaki</p>

The functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can detect hemodynamic responses in the brain and the data consist of bivariate time series of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) on each channel. In this study, we investigate oscillatory changes in infant fNIRS signals by using the oscillator decompisition method (OSC-DECOMP), which is a statistical method for extracting oscillators from time series data based on Gaussian linear state space models. OSC-DECOMP provides a natural decomposition of fNIRS data into oscillation components in a data-driven manner and does not require the arbitrary selection of band-pass filters. We analyzed 18-ch fNIRS data (3 minutes) acquired from 21 sleeping 3-month-old infants. Five to seven oscillators were extracted on most channels, and their frequency distribution had three peaks in the vicinity of 0.01-0.1 Hz, 1.6-2.4 Hz and 3.6-4.4 Hz. The first peak was considered to reflect hemodynamic changes in response to the brain activity, and the phase difference between oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb for the associated oscillators was at approximately 230 degrees. The second peak was attributed to cardiac pulse waves and mirroring noise. Although these oscillators have close frequencies, OSC-DECOMP can separate them through estimating their different projection patterns on oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb. The third peak was regarded as the harmonic of the second peak. By comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of two state space models, we determined that the time series of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb on each channel originate from common oscillatory activity. We also utilized the result of OSC-DECOMP to investigate the frequency-specific functional connectivity. Whereas the brain oscillator exhibited functional connectivity, the pulse waves and mirroring noise oscillators showed spatially homogeneous and independent changes. OSC-DECOMP is a promising tool for data-driven extraction of oscillation components from biological time series data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcriptome diversity is a systematic source of variation in RNA-sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pablo E. García-Nieto, Ban Wang, Hunter B. Fraser</p>

RNA sequencing has been widely used as an essential tool to probe gene expression. While standard practices have been established to analyze RNA-seq data, it is still challenging to interpret and remove artifactual signals. Several biological and technical factors such as sex, age, batches, and sequencing technology have been found to bias these estimates. Probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER), which infers broad variance components in gene expression measurements, has been used to account for some systematic effects, but it has remained challenging to interpret these PEER factors. Here we show that transcriptome diversity–a simple metric based on Shannon entropy–explains a large portion of variability in gene expression and is the strongest known factor encoded in PEER factors. We then show that transcriptome diversity has significant associations with multiple technical and biological variables across diverse organisms and datasets. In sum, transcriptome diversity provides a simple explanation for a major source of variation in both gene expression estimates and PEER covariates.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for finding and selecting R packages</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Caroline J. Wendt, G. Brooke Anderson</p>

R is an increasingly preferred software environment for data analytics and statistical computing among scientists and practitioners. Packages markedly extend R’s utility and ameliorate inefficient solutions to data science problems. We outline 10 simple rules for finding relevant packages and determining which package is best for your desired use. We begin in Rule 1 with tips on how to consider your purpose, which will guide your search to follow, where, in Rule 2, you’ll learn best practices for finding and collecting options. Rules 3 and 4 will help you navigate packages’ profiles and explore the extent of their online resources, so that you can be confident in the quality of the package you choose and assured that you’ll be able to access support. In Rules 5 and 6, you’ll become familiar with how the R Community evaluates packages and learn how to assess the popularity and utility of packages for yourself. Rules 7 and 8 will teach you how to investigate and track package development processes, so you can further evaluate their merit. We end in Rules 9 and 10 with more hands-on approaches, which involve digging into package code.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Isotope-assisted metabolic flux analysis as an equality-constrained nonlinear program for improved scalability and robustness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel J. Lugar, Ganesh Sriram</p>

Stable isotope-assisted metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a powerful method to estimate carbon flow and partitioning in metabolic networks. At its core, MFA is a parameter estimation problem wherein the fluxes and metabolite pool sizes are model parameters that are estimated, via optimization, to account for measurements of steady-state or isotopically-nonstationary isotope labeling patterns. As MFA problems advance in scale, they require efficient computational methods for fast and robust convergence. The structure of the MFA problem enables it to be cast as an equality-constrained nonlinear program (NLP), where the equality constraints are constructed from the MFA model equations, and the objective function is defined as the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the model predictions and a set of labeling measurements. This NLP can be solved by using an algebraic modeling language (AML) that offers state-of-the-art optimization solvers for robust parameter estimation and superior scalability to large networks. When implemented in this manner, the optimization is performed with no distinction between state variables and model parameters. During each iteration of such an optimization, the system state is updated instead of being calculated explicitly from scratch, and this occurs concurrently with improvement in the model parameter estimates. This optimization approach starkly contrasts with traditional “shooting” methods where the state variables and model parameters are kept distinct and the system state is computed afresh during each iteration of a stepwise optimization. Our NLP formulation uses the MFA modeling framework of Wiechert et al. [1], which is amenable to incorporation of the model equations into an NLP. The NLP constraints consist of balances on either elementary metabolite units (EMUs) or cumomers. In this formulation, both the steady-state and isotopically-nonstationary MFA (inst-MFA) problems may be solved as an NLP. For the inst-MFA case, the ordinary differential equation (ODE) system describing the labeling dynamics is transcribed into a system of algebraic constraints for the NLP using collocation. This large-scale NLP may be solved efficiently using an NLP solver implemented on an AML. In our implementation, we used the reduced gradient solver CONOPT, implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The NLP framework is particularly advantageous for inst-MFA, scaling well to large networks with many free parameters, and having more robust convergence properties compared to the shooting methods that compute the system state and sensitivities at each iteration. Additionally, this NLP approach supports the use of tandem-MS data for both steady-state and inst-MFA when the cumomer framework is used. We assembled a software, eiFlux, written in Python and GAMS that uses the NLP approach and supports both steady-state and inst-MFA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the NLP formulation on several examples, including a genome-scale inst-MFA model, to highlight the scalability and robustness of this approach. In addition to typical inst-MFA applications, we expect that this framework and our associated software, eiFlux, will be particularly useful for applying inst-MFA to complex MFA models, such as those developed for eukaryotes (e.g. algae) and co-cultures with multiple cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cortical oscillations support sampling-based computations in spiking neural networks</a></h4>

Being permanently confronted with an uncertain world, brains have faced evolutionary pressure to represent this uncertainty in order to respond appropriately. Often, this requires visiting multiple interpretations of the available information or multiple solutions to an encountered problem. This gives rise to the so-called mixing problem: since all of these “valid” states represent powerful attractors, but between themselves can be very dissimilar, switching between such states can be difficult. We propose that cortical oscillations can be effectively used to overcome this challenge. By acting as an effective temperature, background spiking activity modulates exploration. Rhythmic changes induced by cortical oscillations can then be interpreted as a form of simulated tempering. We provide a rigorous mathematical discussion of this link and study some of its phenomenological implications in computer simulations. This identifies a new computational role of cortical oscillations and connects them to various phenomena in the brain, such as sampling-based probabilistic inference, memory replay, multisensory cue combination, and place cell flickering.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cortical softening elicits zygotic contractility during mouse preimplantation development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Özge Özgüç, Ludmilla de Plater, Varun Kapoor, Anna Francesca Tortorelli, Andrew G. Clark, Jean-Léon Maître</p>

Actomyosin contractility is a major engine of preimplantation morphogenesis, which starts at the 8-cell stage during mouse embryonic development. Contractility becomes first visible with the appearance of periodic cortical waves of contraction (PeCoWaCo), which travel around blastomeres in an oscillatory fashion. How contractility of the mouse embryo becomes active remains unknown. We have taken advantage of PeCoWaCo to study the awakening of contractility during preimplantation development. We find that PeCoWaCo become detectable in most embryos only after the second cleavage and gradually increase their oscillation frequency with each successive cleavage. To test the influence of cell size reduction during cleavage divisions, we use cell fusion and fragmentation to manipulate cell size across a 20- to 60-μm range. We find that the stepwise reduction in cell size caused by cleavage divisions does not explain the presence of PeCoWaCo or their accelerating rhythm. Instead, we discover that blastomeres gradually decrease their surface tensions until the 8-cell stage and that artificially softening cells enhances PeCoWaCo prematurely. We further identify the programmed down-regulation of the formin Fmnl3 as a required event to soften the cortex and expose PeCoWaCo. Therefore, during cleavage stages, cortical softening, mediated by Fmnl3 down-regulation, awakens zygotic contractility before preimplantation morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Structural dynamics of receptor recognition and pH-induced dissociation of full-length Clostridioides difficile Toxin B</a></h4>

<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> secretes Toxin B (TcdB) as one of its major virulence factors, which binds to intestinal epithelial and subepithelial receptors, including frizzled proteins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4). Here, we present cryo-EM structures of full-length TcdB in complex with the CSPG4 domain 1 fragment (D1<sub>401-560</sub>) at cytosolic pH and the cysteine-rich domain of frizzled-2 (CRD2) at both cytosolic and acidic pHs. CSPG4 specifically binds to the autoprocessing and delivery domains of TcdB via networks of salt bridges, hydrophobic and aromatic/proline interactions, which are disrupted upon acidification eventually leading to CSPG4 drastically dissociating from TcdB. In contrast, FZD2 moderately dissociates from TcdB under acidic pH, most likely due to its partial unfolding. These results reveal structural dynamics of TcdB during its preentry step upon endosomal acidification, which provide a basis for developing therapeutics against <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> infections.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Foundations of circadian medicine</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Achim Kramer, Tanja Lange, Claudia Spies, Anna-Marie Finger, Daniela Berg, Henrik Oster</p>

The circadian clock is an evolutionarily highly conserved endogenous timing program that structures physiology and behavior according to the time of day. Disruption of circadian rhythms is associated with many common pathologies. The emerging field of circadian medicine aims to exploit the mechanisms of circadian physiology and clock–disease interaction for clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. In this Essay, we outline the principle approaches of circadian medicine, highlight the development of the field in selected areas, and point out open questions and challenges. Circadian medicine has unambiguous health benefits over standard care but is rarely utilized. It is time for clock biology to become an integrated part of translational research.

                <p>The introduction of a third-dose vaccination along with new variants of concern raises questions regarding serology and T-cell responses in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) treated with B-cell depletion who develop attenuated humoral response to vaccines. The aim of this study was to longitudinally evaluate humoral and cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in ocrelizumab-treated pwMS before and following a third vaccine dose. Following the third vaccine dose, patients who are low or nonresponders following initial vaccination did not increase antibody titers. In healthy controls and ocrelizumab-treated pwMS, cellular response decreased 6 months after initial vaccination and increased significantly after the third dose. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>Expression and significance of secretagogin (scgn) in the brain of catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i>. Three scgn transcript variants were found in the brain of <i>C. batrachus</i>. Two of these transcript variants predicted to encode a putative 272 aa protein, comparable to that found in teleosts and fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Cells expressing scgn showed wide distribution in the brain and pituitary. None of the hypophysiotropic dopamine neurons but a great majority of the isotocin and vasotocin neurons coexpressed scgn. Distinct scgn neurons/fibers were observed in the entopeduncular nucleus (EN, arrow) in the ventral telencephalon. Intracranial insulin enhanced scgn expression in EN neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secretagogin (scgn), is a novel hexa EF-hand, phylogenetically conserved calcium-binding protein. It serves as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and participates in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling and neuroendocrine regulation in mammals. However, its relevance in the brain of non-mammalian vertebrates has largely remained unexplored. To address this issue, we studied the cDNA encoding scgn, <i>scgn</i> mRNA expression, and distribution of scgn-equipped elements in the brain and pituitary of a teleost, <i>Clarias batrachus</i> (<i>cb</i>). The <i>cbscgn</i> cDNA consists of three transcripts (T) variants: T1 (2185 bp), T2 (2151 bp) and T3 (2060 bp). While 816 bp ORF in T1 and T2 encodes highly conserved six EF-hand 272 aa protein fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding, 726-bp ORF in T3 encodes 242 aa protein. The T1 showed &gt;90% and &gt;70% identity with scgn of catfishes, and other teleosts and mammals, respectively. The T1-mRNA was widely expressed in the brain and pituitary, while the expression of T3 was restricted to the telencephalon. Application of the anti-scgn antiserum revealed a ∼32 kDa scgn-immunoreactive (scgn-i) band (known molecular weight of scgn) in the forebrain tissue, and immunohistochemically labeled neurons in the olfactory epithelium and bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, hypothalamus, thalamus, and hindbrain. In the pituitary, scgn-i cells were seen in the pars distalis and intermedia. Insulin is reported to regulate <i>scgn</i> mRNA in the mammalian hippocampus, and feeding-related neuropeptides in the telencephalon of teleost. Intracranial injection of insulin significantly increased T1-mRNA expression and scgn-immunoreactivity in the telencephalon. We suggest that scgn may be an important player in the regulation of olfactory, neuroendocrine system, and energy balance functions in <i>C. batrachus</i>.</p>

                Logistic regressions are the primary method to analyze choice behavior in decision neuroscience studies. In this primer, Padoa-Schioppa describes how logistic analysis can quantify a variety of behavioral traits. He also discusses the assumptions and interpretations of different logistic models.

                Knowledge about the impact of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection of the elderly on mRNA vaccination response is needed to appropriately address the demand for additional vaccinations in this vulnerable population. Here we show that octogenarians, a high-risk population, mount a sustained SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG antibody response for 15 months following infection. This response boosts antibody levels 35-fold upon receiving a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine 15 months after recovery from COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The enteric nervous system of the C. elegans pharynx is specified by the Sine oculis-like homeobox gene ceh-34</a></h4>

              
                Overarching themes in the terminal differentiation of the enteric nervous system, an autonomously acting unit of animal nervous systems, have so far eluded discovery. We describe here the overall regulatory logic of enteric nervous system differentiation of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> that resides within the foregut (pharynx) of the worm. A <i>C. elegans</i> homolog of the <i>Drosophila</i> Sine oculis homeobox gene, <i>ceh-34</i>, is expressed in all 14 classes of interconnected pharyngeal neurons from their birth throughout their life time, but in no other neuron type of the entire animal. Constitutive and temporally controlled <i>ceh-34</i> removal shows that <i>ceh-34</i> is required to initiate and maintain the neuron type-specific terminal differentiation program of all pharyngeal neuron classes, including their circuit assembly. Through additional genetic loss of function analysis, we show that within each pharyngeal neuron class, <i>ceh-34</i> cooperates with different homeodomain transcription factors to individuate distinct pharyngeal neuron classes. Our analysis underscores the critical role of homeobox genes in neuronal identity specification and links them to the control of neuronal circuit assembly of the enteric nervous system. Together with the pharyngeal nervous system simplicity as well as its specification by a Sine oculis homolog, our findings invite speculations about the early evolution of nervous systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conformational dynamics and allosteric modulation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This interaction is mediated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein. Structural and dynamic data have shown that S can adopt multiple conformations, which controls the exposure of the ACE2-binding site in the RBD. Here, using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging we report the effects of ACE2 and antibody binding on the conformational dynamics of S from the Wuhan-1 strain and in the presence of the D614G mutation. We find that D614G modulates the energetics of the RBD position in a manner similar to ACE2 binding. We also find that antibodies that target diverse epitopes, including those distal to the RBD, stabilize the RBD in a position competent for ACE2 binding. Parallel solution-based binding experiments using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) indicate antibody-mediated enhancement of ACE2 binding. These findings inform on novel strategies for therapeutic antibody cocktails.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Remodeling of dermal adipose tissue alleviates cutaneous toxicity induced by anti-EGFR therapy</a></h4>

              
                Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy–associated cutaneous toxicity is a syndrome characterized by papulopustular rash, local inflammation, folliculitis, and microbial infection, resulting in a decrease in quality of life and dose interruption. However, no effective clinical intervention is available for this adverse effect. Here, we report the atrophy of dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT), a highly plastic adipose tissue with various skin-specific functions, correlates with rash occurrence and exacerbation in a murine model of EGFR inhibitor-induced rash. The reduction in dWAT is due to the inhibition of adipogenic differentiation by defects in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling, and increased lipolysis by the induced expression of the lipolytic cytokine IL6. The activation of PPARγ by rosiglitazone maintains adipogenic differentiation and represses the transcription of IL6, eventually improving skin functions and ameliorating the severity of rash without altering the antitumor effects. Thus, activation of PPARγ represents a promising approach to ameliorate cutaneous toxicity in patients with cancer who receive anti-EGFR therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Beneficial impacts of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle structure and function in the zebrafish model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy</a></h4>

              
                Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) allows activation of muscle fibers in the absence of voluntary force generation. NMES could have the potential to promote muscle homeostasis in the context of muscle disease, but the impacts of NMES on diseased muscle are not well understood. We used the zebrafish Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<i>dmd</i>) mutant and a longitudinal design to elucidate the consequences of NMES on muscle health. We designed four neuromuscular stimulation paradigms loosely based on weightlifting regimens. Each paradigm differentially affected neuromuscular structure, function, and survival. Only endurance neuromuscular stimulation (eNMES) improved all outcome measures. We found that eNMES improves muscle and neuromuscular junction morphology, swimming, and survival. Heme oxygenase and integrin alpha7 are required for eNMES-mediated improvement. Our data indicate that neuromuscular stimulation can be beneficial, suggesting that the right type of activity may benefit patients with muscle disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sulforaphane reduces obesity by reversing leptin resistance</a></h4>

              
                The ascending prevalence of obesity in recent decades is commonly associated with soaring morbidity and mortality rates, resulting in increased health-care costs and decreased quality of life. A systemic state of stress characterized by low-grade inflammation and pathological formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) usually manifests in obesity. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2) is the master regulator of the redox homeostasis and plays a critical role in the resolution of inflammation. Here, we show that the natural isothiocyanate and potent NRF2 activator sulforaphane reverses diet-induced obesity through a predominantly, but not exclusively, NRF2-dependent mechanism that requires a functional leptin receptor signaling and hyperleptinemia. Sulforaphane does not reduce the body weight or food intake of lean mice but induces an anorectic response when coadministered with exogenous leptin. Leptin-deficient <i>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></i> mice and leptin receptor mutant <i>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></i> mice display resistance to the weight-reducing effect of sulforaphane, supporting the conclusion that the antiobesity effect of sulforaphane requires functional leptin receptor signaling. Furthermore, our results suggest the skeletal muscle as the most notable site of action of sulforaphane whose peripheral NRF2 action signals to alleviate leptin resistance. Transcriptional profiling of six major metabolically relevant tissues highlights that sulforaphane suppresses fatty acid synthesis while promoting ribosome biogenesis, reducing ROS accumulation, and resolving inflammation, therefore representing a unique transcriptional program that leads to protection from obesity. Our findings argue for clinical evaluation of sulforaphane for weight loss and obesity-associated metabolic disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The inherent flexibility of receptor binding domains in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein</a></h4>

              
                Spike (S) protein is the primary antigenic target for neutralization and vaccine development for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It decorates the virus surface and undergoes large motions of its receptor binding domains (RBDs) to enter the host cell. Here, we observe Down, one-Up, one-Open, and two-Up-like structures in enhanced molecular dynamics simulations, and characterize the transition pathways via inter-domain interactions. Transient salt-bridges between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>C</sub> and the interaction with glycan at N343<sub>B</sub> support RBD<sub>A</sub> motions from Down to one-Up. Reduced interactions between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>B</sub> in one-Up induce RBD<sub>B</sub> motions toward two-Up. The simulations overall agree with cryo-EM structure distributions and FRET experiments and provide hidden functional structures, namely, intermediates along Down to one-Up transition with druggable cryptic pockets as well as one-Open with a maximum exposed RBD. The inherent flexibility of S-protein thus provides essential information for antiviral drug rational design or vaccine development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lack of Tgfbr1 and Acvr1b synergistically stimulates myofibre hypertrophy and accelerates muscle regeneration</a></h4>

              
                In skeletal muscle, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family growth factors, TGF-β1 and myostatin, are involved in atrophy and muscle wasting disorders. Simultaneous interference with their signalling pathways may improve muscle function, however little is known about their individual and combined receptor signalling. Here we show that inhibition of TGF-β signalling by simultaneous muscle-specific knockout of TGF-β type I receptors <i>Tgfbr1</i> and <i>Acvr1b</i> in mice, induces substantial hypertrophy, while such effect does not occur by single receptor knockout. Hypertrophy is induced by increased phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K and reduced E3 ligases expression, while myonuclear number remains unaltered. Combined knockout of both TGF-β type I receptors increases the number of satellite cells, macrophages and improves regeneration post cardiotoxin-induced injury by stimulating myogenic differentiation. Extra cellular matrix gene expression is exclusively elevated in muscle with combined receptor knockout. <i>Tgfbr1</i> and <i>Acvr1b</i> are synergistically involved in regulation of myofibre size, regeneration and collagen deposition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drug targeting Nsp1-ribosomal complex shows antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                The SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) contains an N-terminal domain and C-terminal helices connected by a short linker region. The C-terminal helices of Nsp1 (Nsp1-C-ter) from SARS-CoV-2 bind in the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosomal subunit and blocks mRNA entry, thereby shutting down host protein synthesis. Nsp1 suppresses host immune function and is vital for viral replication. Hence, Nsp1 appears to be an attractive target for therapeutics. In this study, we have <i>in silico</i> screened Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs against Nsp1-C-ter. Among the top hits obtained, montelukast sodium hydrate binds to Nsp1 with a binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10.8±0.2 µM <i>in vitro</i>. It forms a stable complex with Nsp1-C-ter in simulation runs with -95.8±13.3 kJ/mol binding energy. Montelukast sodium hydrate also rescues the inhibitory effect of Nsp1 in host protein synthesis, as demonstrated by the expression of firefly luciferase reporter gene in cells. Importantly, it shows antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with reduced viral replication in HEK cells expressing ACE2 and Vero-E6 cells. We, therefore, propose montelukast sodium hydrate can be used as a lead molecule to design potent inhibitors to help combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct Neurexin-Cerebellin Complexes Control AMPA-and NMDA-Receptor Responses in a Circuit-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                At mature CA1[-&gt;]subiculum synapses, alternatively spliced SS4+ variants of neurexin-1 (Nrxn1SS4+) and neurexin-3 (Nrxn3SS4+) enhance NMDA- and suppress AMPA-receptors, respectively. Both Nrxn1SS4+ and Nrxn3SS4+ act by binding to secreted cerebellin-2 (Cbln2) that in turn activates postsynaptic GluD1, which is homologous to AMPA- and NMDA-receptors. Whether neurexin-Cbln2-GluD1 signaling complexes have additional functions in synapse formation besides regulating NMDA- and AMPA-receptors, and whether they perform similar roles at other synapses, remains unknown. Using constitutive Cbln2 deletions, we here demonstrate that at CA1[-&gt;]subiculum synapses, Cbln2 performs no additional developmental functions besides regulating AMPA- and NMDA-receptors. Moreover, we show that low-level expression of Cbln1, which is functionally redundant with Cbln2, does not compensate for a synapse-formation function of Cbln2 at CA1[-&gt;]subiculum synapses. In exploring the generality of these findings, we found that in prefrontal cortex, Nrxn1SS4+-Cbln2 signaling selectively regulates NMDA-receptors, whereas Nrxn3SS4+-Cbln2 signaling has no apparent role. In contrast, in the cerebellum Nrxn3SS4+-Cbln1 signaling regulates AMPA-receptors, whereas now Nrxn1SS4+-Cbln1 signaling has no manifest effect. Thus, Nrxn1SS4+- and Nrxn3SS4+-Cbln1/2 signaling complexes generally control NMDA- and AMPA-receptors in different synapses without regulating synapse formation, but these signaling complexes are differentially active in diverse neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic firing patterns of ventral hippocampal neurons govern anxiety-dependent behaviour and predict the extent of exploration of an anxiogenic location</a></h4>

              
                The ventral hippocampus (vH) plays a key role for anxiety-related behaviour and vH neurons increase their firing when animals explore anxiogenic environments. However, if and how such neuronal activity induces or restricts the exploration of an anxiogenic location remains unexplained. Here, we developed a novel behavioural paradigm to motivate rats to explore an anxiogenic location. Rats ran along an elevated linear maze with protective sidewalls, which were temporarily removed in parts of the track to introduce a novel anxiogenic location. We recorded neuronal action potentials during task performance and found that vH neurons exhibited remapping of activity, overrepresenting novel anxiogenic locations. Direction-dependent firing was homogenised by the anxiogenic experience. We further showed that the activity of vH neurons predicted the extent of exploration of the anxiogenic location. Our data suggest that anxiety-related firing does not solely depend on the exploration of anxiogenic environments, but also on intentions to explore them.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural and cognitive correlates of performance in dynamic multi-modal settings</a></h4>

              
                The endeavour to understand human cognition has largely relied upon investigation of task-related brain activity. However, resting-state brain activity can also offer insights into individual information processing and performance capabilities. Previous research has identified electroencephalographic resting-state characteristics (most prominently: the individual alpha frequency; IAF) that predict cognitive function. However, it has largely overlooked a second component of electrophysiological signals: aperiodic 1/f activity. The current study examined how both oscillatory and aperiodic resting-state EEG measures, alongside traditional cognitive tests, can predict performance in a dynamic and complex, semi-naturalistic cognitive task. Participants' resting-state EEG was recorded prior to engaging in a Target Motion Analysis (TMA) task in a simulated submarine control room environment (CRUSE), which required participants to integrate dynamically changing information over time. We demonstrated that the relationship between IAF and cognitive performance extends from simple cognitive tasks (e.g., digit span) to complex, dynamic measures of information processing. Further, our results showed that individual 1/f parameters (slope and intercept) differentially predicted performance across practice and testing sessions, whereby flatter slopes were associated with improved performance during learning, while higher intercepts were linked to better performance during testing. In addition to the EEG predictors, we demonstrate a link between cognitive skills most closely related to the TMA task (i.e., spatial imagery) and subsequent performance. Overall, the current study highlights (1) how resting-state metrics -- both oscillatory and aperiodic -- have the potential to index higher-order cognitive capacity, while (2) emphasising the importance of examining these electrophysiological components within more dynamic settings and over time.

	<p>Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) over the prefrontal cortex can improve signs of consciousness in patients in a minimally conscious state. Transcranial pulsed-current stimulation (tPCS) over the mastoids can modulate brain activity and connectivity in healthy controls. This study investigated the feasibility of tPCS as a therapeutic tool in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) and compared its neurophysiological and behavioral effects with prefrontal tDCS. This pilot study was a randomized, double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial with three sessions: bi-mastoid tPCS, prefrontal tDCS, and sham. Electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral assessments were collected before and after each stimulation session. Post minus pre differences were compared using Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Twelve patients with DoC were included in the study (eight females, four traumatic brain injury, 50.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14 y.o., 8.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.5 months post-injury). We did not observe any side-effects following tPCS, nor tDCS, and confirmed their feasibility and safety. We did not find a significant effect of the stimulation on EEG nor behavioral outcomes for tPCS. However, consistent with prior findings, our exploratory analyses suggest that tDCS induces behavioral improvements and an increase in theta frontal functional connectivity.</p>

	<p>Cardiorespiratory or aerobic exercise immediately after practice of an upper-extremity motor skill task can facilitate skill consolidation, as demonstrated by enhanced performances at 24 h and 7-day retention tests. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of acute cardiorespiratory exercise on motor skill consolidation when skill practice involved low and high levels of contextual interference introduced through repetitive and interleaved practice schedules, respectively. Forty-eight young healthy adults were allocated to one of four groups who performed either repetitive or interleaved practice of a pinch grip motor sequence task, followed by either a period of seated rest or a bout of high-intensity interval cycling. At pre- and post-practice and 24 h and 7-day retention tests, we assessed motor skill performance and &amp;amp;beta;-band (15&amp;amp;ndash;35 Hz) intermuscular coherence using surface electromyography (EMG) collected from the abductor pollicis brevis and first dorsal interosseous. At the 7-day retention test, off-line consolidation was enhanced in the cardiorespiratory exercise relative to the rest group, but only among individuals who performed interleaved motor skill practice (p = 0.02). Similarly, at the 7-day retention test, &amp;amp;beta;-band intermuscular coherence increased to a greater extent in the exercise group than in the rest group for those who performed interleaved practice (p = 0.02). Under the present experimental conditions, cardiorespiratory exercise preferentially supported motor skill consolidation and change in intermuscular coherence when motor skill practice involved higher rather than lower levels of contextual interference.</p>

	<p>Myelin in humans is composed of about 80% lipids and 20% protein. Initially, myelin protein composition was considered low, but various recent proteome analyses have identified additional myelin proteins. Although, the myelin proteome is qualitatively and quantitatively identified through complementary proteomic approaches, the corresponding Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) network of myelin is not yet available. In the present work, the PPI network was constructed based on available experimentally supported protein interactions of myelin in PPI databases. The network comprised 2017 PPIs between 567 myelin proteins. Interestingly, structure-based in silico analysis revealed that 20% of the myelin proteins that are interconnected in the proposed PPI network are metal-binding proteins/enzymes that construct the main sub-PPI network of myelin proteome. Finally, the PPI networks of the myelin proteome and sub-metalloproteome were analyzed ontologically to identify the biochemical processes of the myelin proteins and the interconnectivity of myelin-associated diseases in the interactomes. The presented PPI dataset could provide a useful resource to the scientific community to further our understanding of human myelin biology and serve as a basis for future studies of myelin-related neurological diseases and particular autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis where myelin epitopes are implicated.</p>

	<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in the capacity for neuroplastic change. A single nucleotide polymorphism of the BDNF gene is well known to alter the activity-dependent release of the protein and may impact the capacity for neuroplastic change. Numerous studies have shown altered sensorimotor beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) responses in youth with cerebral palsy (CP), which is thought to be directly related to motor planning. The objective of the current investigation was to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to evaluate whether the BDNF genotype affects the strength of the sensorimotor beta ERD seen in youth with CP while youth with CP performed a leg isometric target matching task. In addition, we collected saliva samples and used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to determine the status of the amino acid fragment containing codon 66 of the BDNF gene. Our genotyping results identified that 25% of the youth with CP had a Val66Met or Met66Met polymorphism at codon 66 of the BDNF gene. Furthermore, we identified that the beta ERD was stronger in youth with CP who had the Val66Met or Met66Met polymorphism in comparison to those without the polymorphism (p = 0.042). Overall, these novel findings suggest that a polymorphism at the BDNF gene may alter sensorimotor cortical oscillations in youth with CP.</p>

	<p>Previous research suggests that predictive mechanisms are essential in perceiving social interactions. However, these studies did not isolate action prediction (a priori expectations about how partners in an interaction react to one another) from action integration (a posteriori processing of both partner&amp;amp;rsquo;s actions). This study investigated action prediction during social interactions while controlling for integration confounds. Twenty participants viewed 3D animations depicting an action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction interaction between two actors. At the start of each action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction interaction, one actor performs a social action. Immediately after, instead of presenting the other actor&amp;amp;rsquo;s reaction, a black screen covers the animation for a short time (occlusion duration) until a still frame depicting a precise moment of the reaction is shown (reaction frame). The moment shown in the reaction frame is either temporally aligned with the occlusion duration or deviates by 150 ms or 300 ms. Fifty percent of the action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction trials were semantically congruent, and the remaining were incongruent, e.g., one actor offers to shake hands, and the other reciprocally shakes their hand (congruent action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction) versus one actor offers to shake hands, and the other leans down (incongruent action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction). Participants made fast congruency judgments. We hypothesized that judging the congruency of action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction sequences is aided by temporal predictions. The findings supported this hypothesis; linear speed-accuracy scores showed that congruency judgments were facilitated by a temporally aligned occlusion duration, and reaction frames compared to 300 ms deviations, thus suggesting that observers internally simulate the temporal unfolding of an observed social interction. Furthermore, we explored the link between participants with higher autistic traits and their sensitivity to temporal deviations.

	<p>Quality of life (QoL) for people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD) is diminished by speech and communication changes. The impact of PD Check-In, an intervention for supported self-managed maintenance of speech following LSVT LOUD&amp;amp;reg;, on QoL of people with PD was investigated. Sixteen people with PD and dysarthria completed LSVT LOUD followed by PD Check-Ins up until 24 months post-treatment. Self-rated QoL and voice handicap scales were used to determine the psychosocial and perceived impact of PD Check-In on the speech and voice of people with PD. The perceived impact of PD Check-In on speech and voice was also sought from 15 communication partners (CPs). A significant treatment effect for time was identified for the Dysarthria Impact Profile (DIP), Voice Handicap Index (VHI), and Voice Handicap Index-Partner (VHI-P) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). There was no significant effect for time for the Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Planned comparisons of timepoints for DIP, VHI, and VHI-P showed no significant differences (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.01). Comparison of perceived voice handicap by people with PD and CPs revealed no significant differences (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.01). The impact of PD Check-In on QoL of people with PD and CPs for 24 months post-LSVT-LOUD is unclear. Self-reported outcome measures alone do not fully capture changes in QoL in PD.</p>

	<p>Food intake regulation in humans is a complex process controlled by the dynamic interaction of homeostatic and hedonic systems. Homeostatic regulation is controlled by appetitive signals from the gut, adipose tissue, and the vagus nerve, while conscious and unconscious reward processes orchestrate hedonic regulation. On the one hand, sight, smell, taste, and texture perception deliver potent food-related feedback to the central nervous system (CNS) and influence brain areas related to food reward. On the other hand, macronutrient composition stimulates the release of appetite signals from the gut, which are translated in the CNS into unconscious reward processes. This multi-level regulation process of food intake shapes and regulates human ingestive behavior. Identifying the interface between hormones, neurotransmitters, and brain areas is critical to advance our understanding of conditions like obesity and develop better therapeutical interventions. Neuroimaging studies allow us to take a glance into the central nervous system (CNS) while these processes take place. This review focuses on the available neuroimaging evidence to describe this interaction between the homeostatic and hedonic components in human food intake regulation.</p>

	<p>An altered sense of smell and taste was recognized as one of the most characteristic symptoms of coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19). Despite most patients experiencing a complete functional resolution, there is a 21.3% prevalence of persistent alteration at 12 months after infection. To date, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in these patients have been variable and not clearly defined. We aimed to clarify radiological alterations of olfactory pathways in patients with long COVID-19 characterized by olfactory dysfunction. A comprehensive review of the English literature was performed by analyzing relevant papers about this topic. A case series was presented: all patients underwent complete otorhinolaryngology evaluation including the Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks battery test. A previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by positive swabs. The MRIs were acquired using a 3.0T MR scanner with a standardized protocol for olfactory tract analysis. Images were first analysed by a dedicated neuroradiologist and subsequently reviewed and compared with the previous available MRIs. The review of the literature retrieved 25 studies; most cases of olfactory dysfunction more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection showed olfactory bulb (OB) reduction. Patients in the personal case series had asymmetry and a reduction in the volume of the OB. This evidence was strengthened by the comparison with a previous MRI, where the OBs were normal. The results preliminarily confirmed OB reduction in cases of long COVID-19 with an altered sense of smell. Further studies are needed to clarify the epidemiology, pathophysiology and prognosis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Agmatine Alleviates Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity by Activating PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity can be partially attributed to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and agmatine is well-known for the activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway to inhibit ROS production. Whether agmatine could be used to alleviate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is investigated. Cisplatin-exposed House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) cells and cochlear explants showed increased ROS production detected by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining and decreased cell viability detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) or Myosin 7a staining, which could be reversed by the agmatine pretreatment. Cisplatin intraperitoneally injected C57BL/6 mice demonstrated damaged auditory function as indicated by distortion products otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) assays, and trans-tympanically administrated agmatine in the left ears could partly prevent the auditory function loss. Mechanistically, downregulated B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression, upregulated Bcl2-associated x (Bax) expression, and diminished p-PI3K and p-AKT expression were detected in cisplatin-exposed HEI-OC1 cells and cochlear explants, which could be prevented by the pretreatment with agmatine. Our investigation demonstrates that agmatine pretreatment could alleviate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity with the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Single Calcium Channel Nanodomains Drive Presynaptic Calcium Entry at Lamprey Reticulospinal Presynaptic Terminals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Efficient and reliable neurotransmission requires precise coupling between action potentials (APs), Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and neurotransmitter release. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirements for release, including the number of channels required, their subtypes, and their location with respect to primed vesicles, remains to be precisely defined for central synapses. Indeed, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry may occur through small numbers or even single open Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, but these questions remain largely unexplored in simple active zone (AZ) synapses common in the nervous system, and key to addressing Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and synaptic dysfunction underlying numerous neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we present single channel analysis of evoked AZ Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, using cell-attached patch clamp and lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), resolving small channel numbers evoking Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry following depolarization, at single AZs in individual central lamprey reticulospinal presynaptic terminals from male and females. We show a small pool (mean of 23) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at each terminal, comprising N-(CaV2.2), P/Q-(CaV2.1), and R-(CaV2.3) subtypes, available to gate neurotransmitter release. Significantly, of this pool only one to seven channels (mean of 4) open on depolarization. High temporal fidelity lattice light-sheet imaging reveals AP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients exhibiting quantal amplitude variations of 0&ndash;6 event sizes between individual APs and stochastic variation of precise locations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry within the AZ. Further, total Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel numbers at each AZ correlate to the number of presynaptic primed synaptic vesicles. Dispersion of channel openings across the AZ and the similar number of primed vesicles and channels indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via as few as one channel may trigger neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) causes neurotransmitter release. To understand neurotransmission, its modulation, and plasticity, we must quantify Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and its relationship to vesicle fusion. This requires direct recordings from active zones (AZs), previously possible only at calyceal terminals containing many AZs, where few channels open following action potentials (APs; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B56">Sheng et al., 2012</cross-ref>), and even single channel openings may trigger release (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B58">Stanley, 1991</cross-ref>, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">1993</cross-ref>). However, recording from more conventional terminals with single AZs commonly found centrally has thus far been impossible. We addressed this by cell-attached recordings from acutely dissociated single lamprey giant axon AZs, and by lattice light sheet microscopy of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. We demonstrate nanodomains of presynaptic VGCCs coupling with primed vesicles with 1:1 stoichiometry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mu Opioid Receptors Acutely Regulate Adenosine Signaling in Striatal Glutamate Afferents</a></h4>

              
                <p>Endogenous adenosine plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis, and adenosine levels are tightly regulated across neural circuits. In the dorsal medial striatum (DMS), adenosine inhibits neurotransmitter release, but the source and mechanism underlying its accumulation are largely unknown. Opioids also inhibit neurotransmitter release in the DMS and influence adenosine accumulation after prolonged exposure. However, how these two neurotransmitter systems interact acutely is also largely unknown. This study demonstrates that activation of &micro; opioid receptors, but not  opioid receptors or  opioid receptors, inhibits tonic activation of adenosine A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs via a cAMP-dependent mechanism in both male and female mice. Further, selectively knocking out &micro; opioid receptors from thalamic presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) revealed that activation of &micro; opioid receptors on D<SUB>1</SUB>R-positive MSNs, but not D<SUB>2</SUB>R-positive MSNs, is necessary to inhibit tonic adenosine signaling on presynaptic terminals. Given the role of D<SUB>1</SUB>R-positive MSNs in movement and motivated behaviors, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which these neurons regulate their own synaptic inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding interactions between neuromodulatory systems within brain circuits is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The present work uncovers a novel role of opioids in acutely inhibiting adenosine accumulation and subsequent adenosine receptor signaling in the striatum by inhibiting the production of cAMP. Adenosine receptor signaling regulates striatal neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and acetylcholine. Furthermore, interactions between adenosine<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors and numerous other GPCRs, including D<SUB>2</SUB> dopamine and CB<SUB>1</SUB> cannabinoid receptors, suggest that endogenous adenosine broadly modulates striatal GPCR signaling. Additionally, this work discovered that the source of resting endogenous extracellular adenosine is likely D<SUB>1</SUB>, but not D<SUB>2</SUB> receptor-positive medium spiny neurons, suggesting that opioid signaling and manipulation of D<SUB>1</SUB>R-expressing medium spiny neuron cAMP activity can broadly affect striatal function and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Repetitive Mild Closed Head Injury in Adolescent Mice Is Associated with Impaired Proteostasis, Neuroinflammation, and Tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in children and adolescents leads to acute and chronic neurologic sequelae and is linked to later life neurodegenerative disease. However, the biological mechanisms connecting early life mTBI to neurodegeneration remain unknown. Using an adolescent mouse repetitive closed head injury model that induces progressive cognitive impairment in males and anxiety in females in the absence of overt histopathology, we examined transcriptional and translational changes in neurons isolated from sham and injured brain in the chronic phase after injury. At 14 months, single-nuclei RNA sequencing of cortical brain tissue identified disruption of genes associated with neuronal proteostasis and evidence for disrupted ligand-receptor signaling networks in injured mice. Western blot analysis of isolated neurons showed evidence of inflammasome activation and downstream IL-1&beta; processing, as previously demonstrated in acute CNS injury models, and accumulation of misfolded, hyperphosphorylated tau, and changes in expression of proteins suggestive of impaired translation in males but not in females. At 6 months, injured IL-1 receptor 1 (<I>IL-1R1</I>) KO mice, which are protected from postinjury cognitive deficits, had decreased accumulation of pro-IL-1&beta; and misfolded tau in cortex and cerebellum, suggesting that IL-1R1 is upstream of inflammasome priming (defined as increase in pro-IL-1&beta;) and abnormal tau phosphorylation. Together, our findings provide evidence for neuronal inflammasome activation and impaired proteostasis as key mechanisms linking repetitive mTBI in adolescence to later life neurologic dysfunction and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Repetitive mild closed head injury in adolescent male mice leads to impaired proteostasis, tau phosphorylation, and inflammasome activation in neurons later in adulthood through mechanisms involving IL-1 receptor 1. The data are the first to link repetitive mild traumatic brain injury in adolescence to neurodegeneration and suggest molecular targets and pathways to prevent neurologic sequelae in the chronic period after injuries.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">ADAM17 Regulates p75NTR-Mediated Fibrinolysis and Nerve Remyelination</a></h4>

              
                <p>We previously reported that a-disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17 is a key protease regulating myelin formation. We now describe a role for ADAM17 during the Wallerian degeneration (WD) process. Unexpectedly, we observed that glial ADAM17, by regulating p75<sup>NTR</sup> processing, cell autonomously promotes remyelination, while neuronal ADAM17 is dispensable. Accordingly, p75<sup>NTR</sup> abnormally accumulates specifically when ADAM17 is maximally expressed leading to a downregulation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) expression, excessive fibrin accumulation over time, and delayed remyelination. Mutant mice also present impaired macrophage recruitment and defective nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Thus, ADAM17 expressed in Schwann cells, controls the whole WD process, and its absence hampers effective nerve repair. Collectively, we describe a previously uncharacterized role for glial ADAM17 during nerve regeneration. Based on the results of our study, we posit that, unlike development, glial ADAM17 promotes remyelination through the regulation of p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated fibrinolysis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The &alpha;-secretase a-disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17, although relevant for developmental PNS myelination, has never been investigated in Wallerian degeneration (WD). We now unravel a new mechanism of action for this protease and show that ADAM17 cleaves p75<sup>NTR</sup>, regulates fibrin clearance, and eventually fine-tunes remyelination. The results presented in this study provide important insights into the complex regulation of remyelination following nerve injury, identifying in ADAM17 and p75<sup>NTR</sup> a new signaling axis implicated in these events. Modulation of this pathway could have important implications in promoting nerve remyelination, an often-inefficient process, with the aim of restoring a functional axo-glial unit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">SIPA1L1/SPAR1 Interacts with the Neurabin Family of Proteins and is Involved in GPCR Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1)-like 1 (SIPA1L1; also known as SPAR1) has been proposed to regulate synaptic functions that are important in maintaining normal neuronal activities, such as regulating spine growth and synaptic scaling, as a component of the PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex. However, its physiological role remains poorly understood. Here, we performed expression analyses using super-resolution microscopy (SRM) in mouse brain and demonstrated that SIPA1L1 is mainly localized to general submembranous regions in neurons, but surprisingly, not to PSD. Our screening for physiological interactors of SIPA1L1 in mouse brain identified spinophilin and neurabin-1, regulators of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, but rejected PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex components. Furthermore, <I>Sipa1l1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed normal spine size distribution and NMDA-R-dependent synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, <I>Sipa1l1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed aberrant responses to &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic receptor (a spinophilin target) or adenosine A1 receptor (a neurabin-1 target) agonist stimulation, and striking behavioral anomalies, such as hyperactivity, enhanced anxiety, learning impairments, social interaction deficits, and enhanced epileptic seizure susceptibility. Male mice were used for all experiments. Our findings revealed unexpected properties of SIPA1L1, suggesting a possible association of SIPA1L1 deficiency with neuropsychiatric disorders related to dysregulated GPCR signaling, such as epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, or fragile X syndrome (FXS).</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1)-like 1 (SIPA1L1) is thought to regulate essential synaptic functions as a component of the PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex. In our screening for physiological SIPA1L1-interactors, we identified G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-signaling regulators. Moreover, SIPA1L1 knock-out (KO) mice showed striking behavioral anomalies, which may be relevant to GPCR signaling. Our findings revealed an unexpected role of SIPA1L1, which may open new avenues for research on neuropsychiatric disorders that involve dysregulated GPCR signaling. Another important aspect of this paper is that we showed effective methods for checking PSD association and identifying native protein interactors that are difficult to solubilize. These results may serve as a caution for future claims about interacting proteins and PSD proteins, which could eventually save time and resources for researchers and avoid confusion in the field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Motoneuron-Specific PTEN Deletion in Mice Induces Neuronal Hypertrophy and Also Regeneration after Facial Nerve Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>In postmitotic neurons, several tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including p53, Rb, and PTEN, modulate the axon regeneration success after injury. Particularly, PTEN inhibition is a key driver of successful CNS axon regeneration after optic nerve or spinal cord injury. In contrast, in peripheral neurons, TSG influence in neuronal morphology, physiology, and pathology has not been investigated to the same depth. In this study, we conditionally deleted PTEN from mouse facial motoneurons (<I>Chat-Cre/Pten<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></I>) and analyzed neuronal responses <I>in vivo</I> with or without peripheral facial nerve injury in male and female mice. In uninjured motoneurons, PTEN loss induced somatic, axonal, and nerve hypertrophy, synaptic terminal enlargement and reduction in physiological whisker movement. Despite these morphologic and physiological changes, PTEN deletion positively regulated facial nerve regeneration and recovery of whisker movement after nerve injury. Regenerating PTEN-deficient motoneurons upregulated P-CREB and a signaling pathway involving P-Akt, P-PRAS40, P-mTOR, and P-4EBP1. In aged mice (12 months), PTEN deletion induced hair loss and facial hyperplasia of the epidermis. This suggests a time window in younger mice with PTEN loss stimulating axon growth after injury, however, at the risk of hyperplasia formation at later time points in the old animal. Overall, our data highlight a dual TSG function with PTEN loss impairing physiological neuron function but furthermore underscoring the positive effects of PTEN ablation in axon regeneration also for the PNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) restrict cell proliferation and growth. TSG inhibition, including p53 and PTEN, stimulates axon regeneration after CNS injury. In contrast, in PNS axon regeneration, TSGs have not been analyzed in great depth. Herein we show enhanced peripheral axon regeneration after PTEN deletion from facial motoneurons. This invokes a signaling cascade with novel PTEN partners, including CREB and PRAS40. In adult mice, PTEN loss induces hyperplasia of the skin epidermis, suggesting detrimental consequences when reaching adulthood in contrast to a beneficial TSG role for regeneration in young adult mice. Thus, our data highlight the double-edged sword nature of interfering with TSG function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Time Course of Activity-Dependent Changes in Auditory Nerve Synapses Reveals Multiple Underlying Cellular Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abnormal levels of acoustic activity can result in hearing problems such as tinnitus and language processing disorders, but the underlying cellular and synaptic changes triggered by abnormal activity are not well understood. To address this issue, we studied the time course of activity-dependent changes that occur at auditory nerve synapses in mice of both sexes after noise exposure and conductive hearing loss. We found that EPSC amplitude and synaptic depression decreased within 2 d of noise exposure through a decrease in the probability of vesicle release (<I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>). This was followed by a gradual increase in EPSC amplitude through a larger pool of releasable vesicles (<I>N</I>). Occlusion of the ear canal led to a rapid decrease in EPSC amplitude through a decrease in <I>N</I>, which was followed by an increase in EPSC amplitude and synaptic depression through an increase in <I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>. After returning to normal sound levels, synaptic depression recovered to control levels within 1&ndash;2 d. However, repeated exposure to noise for as little as 8 h/d caused synaptic changes after 7 d, suggesting recovery did not fully offset changes. Thus, there appear to be three activity-dependent mechanisms in auditory nerve synapses&mdash;bidirectional changes in <I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB> in 1&ndash;2 d, slower bidirectional changes in <I>N</I> through synaptic growth or retraction, and rapid downregulation of <I>N</I> with low activity. The dynamic changes indicate that multiple mechanisms are present to fine-tune synaptic fidelity across different acoustic conditions in a simple relay.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hearing impairments can arise from exposure to noise or conductive hearing loss. This appears to result from changes in the brain, but the mechanisms are not well understood. We study this issue by studying the synapses made by auditory nerve fibers called endbulbs of Held. These synapses undergo bidirectional changes in size and release probability of neurotransmitter in response to increased or decreased activity. Here, we made a close examination of how quickly these synaptic characteristics change, which indicates there are at least three cellular mechanisms underlying changes. Furthermore, repeated exposure to brief periods of noise can produce cumulative effects. These changes could significantly affect hearing, especially because they occur at the start of the central auditory pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human NREM Sleep Promotes Brain-Wide Vasomotor and Respiratory Pulsations</a></h4>

              
                <p>The physiological underpinnings of the necessity of sleep remain uncertain. Recent evidence suggests that sleep increases the convection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and promotes the export of interstitial solutes, thus providing a framework to explain why all vertebrate species require sleep. Cardiovascular, respiratory and vasomotor brain pulsations have each been shown to drive CSF flow along perivascular spaces, yet it is unknown how such pulsations may change during sleep in humans. To investigate these pulsation phenomena in relation to sleep, we simultaneously recorded fast fMRI, magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG), and electroencephalography (EEG) signals in a group of healthy volunteers. We quantified sleep-related changes in the signal frequency distributions by spectral entropy analysis and calculated the strength of the physiological (vasomotor, respiratory, and cardiac) brain pulsations by power sum analysis in 15 subjects (age 26.5 &plusmn; 4.2 years, 6 females). Finally, we identified spatial similarities between EEG slow oscillation (0.2&ndash;2 Hz) power and MREG pulsations. Compared with wakefulness, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was characterized by reduced spectral entropy and increased brain pulsation intensity. These effects were most pronounced in posterior brain areas for very low-frequency (&le;0.1 Hz) vasomotor pulsations but were also evident brain-wide for respiratory pulsations, and to a lesser extent for cardiac brain pulsations. There was increased EEG slow oscillation power in brain regions spatially overlapping with those showing sleep-related MREG pulsation changes. We suggest that reduced spectral entropy and enhanced pulsation intensity are characteristic of NREM sleep. With our findings of increased power of slow oscillation, the present results support the proposition that sleep promotes fluid transport in human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We report that the spectral power of physiological brain pulsation mechanisms driven by vasomotor, respiration, and cardiac rhythms in human brain increase during sleep, extending previous observations of their association with glymphatic brain clearance during sleep in rodents. The magnitudes of increased pulsations follow the rank order of vasomotor greater than respiratory greater than cardiac pulsations, with correspondingly declining spatial extents. Spectral entropy, previously known as vigilance and as an anesthesia metric, decreased during NREM sleep compared with the awake state in very low and respiratory frequencies, indicating reduced signal complexity. An EEG slow oscillation power increase occurring in the early sleep phase (NREM 1&ndash;2) spatially overlapped with pulsation changes, indicating reciprocal mechanisms between those measures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Spatiotemporal Link of Temporal Expectations: Contextual Temporal Expectation Is Independent of Spatial Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal expectation is the ability to construct predictions regarding the timing of events, based on previously experienced temporal regularities of different types. For example, cue-based expectations are constructed when a cue validly indicates when a target is expected to occur. However, in the absence of such cues, expectations can be constructed based on contextual temporal information, including the onset distribution of the event and recent prior experiences, both providing implicit probabilistic information regarding the timing of the event. It was previously suggested that cue-based temporal expectation is exerted via synchronization of spatially specific neural activity at a predictable time of a target, within receptive fields corresponding to the expected location of the target. Here, we tested whether the same theoretical model holds for contextual temporal effects. Participants (<I>n</I> = 40, 25 females) performed a speeded spatial-cuing detection task with two-thirds valid spatial cues. The hazard-rate function of the target was modulated by varying the foreperiod&mdash;the interval between the spatial cue and the target&mdash;among trials and was manipulated between groups by changing the interval distribution. Reaction times were analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, accounting for hazard and sequential effects. Results showed that the effects of contextual temporal structures on reaction times were independent of spatial attention. This suggests that the spatiotemporal mechanisms, thought to account for cue-based expectation, cannot explain other sources of temporal expectations. We conclude that expectations based on contextual structures have different characteristics than cue-based temporal expectation, suggesting reliance on distinct neural mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Temporal expectation is the ability to predict an event onset based on temporal regularities. A neurophysiological model suggested that temporal expectation relies on the synchronization of spatially specific neurons whose receptive fields represent the attended location. This model predicts that temporal expectation would be evident solely within the locus of spatial attention. Existing evidence supported this model for expectation based on associations between a temporal cue and a target, but here we show that it cannot account for temporal expectation that is based on contextual information, that is, the distribution of intervals and recent priors. These findings reveal the existence of different predictive mechanisms for cued and contextual temporal predictions, with the former depending on spatial attention and the latter nonspatially specific.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adaptive Learning through Temporal Dynamics of State Representation</a></h4>

              
                <p>People adjust their learning rate rationally according to local environmental statistics and calibrate such adjustments based on the broader statistical context. To date, no theory has captured the observed range of adaptive learning behaviors or the complexity of its neural correlates. Here, we attempt to do so using a neural network model that learns to map an internal context representation onto a behavioral response via supervised learning. The network shifts its internal context on receiving supervised signals that are mismatched to its output, thereby changing the "state" to which feedback is associated. A key feature of the model is that such state transitions can either increase learning or decrease learning depending on the duration over which the new state is maintained. Sustained state transitions that occur after changepoints facilitate faster learning and mimic network reset phenomena observed in the brain during rapid learning. In contrast, state transitions after one-off outlier events are short lived, thereby limiting the impact of outlying observations on future behavior. State transitions in our model provide the first mechanistic interpretation for bidirectional learning signals, such as the P300, that relate to learning differentially according to the source of surprising events and may also shed light on discrepant observations regarding the relationship between transient pupil dilations and learning. Together, our results demonstrate that dynamic latent state representations can afford normative inference and provide a coherent framework for understanding neural signatures of adaptive learning across different statistical environments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How humans adjust their sensitivity to new information in a changing world has remained largely an open question. Bridging insights from normative accounts of adaptive learning and theories of latent state representation, here we propose a feedforward neural network model that adjusts its learning rate online by controlling the speed of transitioning its internal state representations. Our model proposes a mechanistic framework for explaining learning under different statistical contexts, explains previously observed behavior and brain signals, and makes testable predictions for future experimental studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurons in the Monkey's Subthalamic Nucleus Differentially Encode Motivation and Effort</a></h4>

              
                <p>The understanding of the electrophysiological properties of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons is crucial since it represents the main target of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and obsessive-compulsive disorders. The study of its nonmotor properties could shed light on the cognitive and motivational alterations possibly encountered after stimulation. In this study, we recorded the activity of STN neurons in two male behaving monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) while they performed a visuomotor motivational task in which visual cues indicated which amount of force was required to obtain which amount of reward. Our results evidenced force- and reward-modulated neurons. After the occurrence of the visual stimuli, the force-modulated neurons mainly fired when a high effort was required. Differently, the activity of the population of reward-modulated neurons encoded the motivational value of the stimuli. This population consisted of neurons increasing or decreasing their activity according to the motivational ranking of the task conditions. Both populations could play complementary roles, one in the implementation of the difficulty of the action and the other in enhancing or slowing its execution based on the subjective value of each condition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An increasing number of studies confers a role to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in motivational and reward-related processes. However, the electrophysiological bases of such properties at the neuronal level remain unclear. The present study investigated the modulation of STN neuronal activity in monkeys performing a motivational task in which the force to produce and the reward obtained were manipulated. We found two main populations of neurons, one modulated by the effort required and the other integrating the motivational subjective value of the stimuli. This last population could help at improving decision-making to act or not, depending on the subjective value set by the motivational context. This highlights the pivotal role of STN in the valuation of cost/benefit for decision-making processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Behavioral Manipulation via Orally Delivered Chemogenetic Actuator in Macaques</a></h4>

              
                <p>The chemogenetic technology referred to as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) offers reversible means to control neuronal activity for investigating its functional correlation with behavioral action. Deschloroclozapine (DCZ), a recently developed highly potent and selective DREADD actuator, displays a capacity to expand the utility of DREADDs for chronic manipulation without side effects in nonhuman primates, which has not yet been validated. Here we investigated the pharmacokinetics and behavioral effects of orally administered DCZ in female and male macaque monkeys. Pharmacokinetic analysis and PET occupancy examination demonstrated that oral administration of DCZ yielded slower and prolonged kinetics, and that its bioavailability was 10%-20% of that in the case of systemic injection. Oral DCZ (300-1000 &mu;g/kg) induced significant working memory impairments for at least 4 h in monkeys with hM4Di expressed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 46). Repeated daily oral doses of DCZ consistently caused similar impairments over two weeks without discernible desensitization. Our results indicate that orally delivered DCZ affords a less invasive strategy for chronic but reversible chemogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity in nonhuman primates, and this has potential for clinical application.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The use of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) for chronic manipulation of neuronal activity for days to weeks may be feasible for investigating brain functions and behavior on a long time-scale, and thereby for developing therapeutics for brain disorders, such as epilepsy. Here we performed pharmacokinetics and <I>in vivo</I> occupancy study of orally administered deschloroclozapine to determine a dose range suitable for DREADDs studies. In monkeys expressing hM4Di in the prefrontal cortex, single and repeated daily doses significantly induced working-memory impairments for hours and over two weeks, respectively, without discernible desensitization. These results indicate that orally delivered deschloroclozapine produces long-term stable chemogenetic effects, and holds great promise for the translational use of DREADDs technology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociating the Neural Correlates of Subjective Visibility from Those of Decision Confidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>A key goal of consciousness science is identifying neural signatures of being aware versus unaware of simple stimuli. This is often investigated in the context of near-threshold detection, with reports of stimulus awareness being linked to heightened activation in a frontoparietal network. However, because of reports of stimulus presence typically being associated with higher confidence than reports of stimulus absence, these results could be explained by frontoparietal regions encoding stimulus visibility, decision confidence, or both. In an exploratory analysis, we leverage fMRI data from 35 human participants (20 females) to disentangle these possibilities. We first show that, whereas stimulus identity was best decoded from the visual cortex, stimulus visibility (presence vs absence) was best decoded from prefrontal regions. To control for effects of confidence, we then selectively sampled trials before decoding to equalize confidence distributions between absence and presence responses. This analysis revealed striking differences in the neural correlates of subjective visibility in PFC ROIs, depending on whether or not differences in confidence were controlled for. We interpret our findings as highlighting the importance of controlling for metacognitive aspects of the decision process in the search for neural correlates of visual awareness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While much has been learned over the past two decades about the neural basis of visual awareness, the role of the PFC remains a topic of debate. By applying decoding analyses to functional brain imaging data, we show that prefrontal representations of subjective visibility are contaminated by neural correlates of decision confidence. We propose a new analysis method to control for these metacognitive aspects of awareness reports, and use it to reveal confidence-independent correlates of perceptual judgments in a subset of prefrontal areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Behavioral and Neural Dissociation of Social Anxiety and Loneliness</a></h4>

              
                <p>Loneliness is a public health concern with detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being. Given phenotypical overlaps between loneliness and social anxiety (SA), cognitive-behavioral interventions targeting SA might be adopted to reduce loneliness. However, whether SA and loneliness share the same underlying neurocognitive mechanisms is still an elusive question. The current study aimed at investigating to what extent known behavioral and neural correlates of social avoidance in SA are evident in loneliness. We used a prestratified approach involving 42 (21 females) participants with high loneliness (HL) and 40 (20 females) participants with low loneliness (LL) scores. During fMRI, participants completed a social gambling task to measure the subjective value of engaging in social situations and responses to social feedback. Univariate and multivariate analyses of behavioral and neural data replicated known task effects. However, although HL participants showed increased SA, loneliness was associated with a response pattern clearly distinct from SA. Specifically, contrary to expectations based on SA differences, Bayesian analyses revealed moderate evidence for equal subjective values of engaging in social situations and comparable amygdala responses to social decision-making and striatal responses to positive social feedback in both groups. Moreover, while explorative analyses revealed reduced pleasantness ratings, increased striatal activity, and decreased striatal-hippocampal connectivity in response to negative computer feedback in HL participants, these effects were diminished for negative social feedback. Our findings suggest that, unlike SA, loneliness is not associated with withdrawal from social interactions. Thus, established interventions for SA should be adjusted when targeting loneliness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loneliness can cause serious health problems. Adapting well-established cognitive-behavioral therapies targeting social anxiety might be promising to reduce chronic loneliness given a close link between both constructs. However, a better understanding of behavioral and neurobiological factors associated with loneliness is needed to identify which specific mechanisms of social anxiety are shared by lonely individuals. We found that lonely individuals show a consistently distinct pattern of behavioral and neural responsiveness to social decision-making and social feedback compared with previous findings for social anxiety. Our results indicate that loneliness is associated with a biased emotional reactivity to negative events rather than social avoidance. Our findings thus emphasize the distinctiveness of loneliness from social anxiety and the need for adjusted psychotherapeutic protocols.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anastasis Drives Senescence and Non-Cell Autonomous Neurodegeneration in the Astrogliopathy Alexander Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anastasis is a recently described process in which cells recover after late-stage apoptosis activation. The functional consequences of anastasis for cells and tissues are not clearly understood. Using <I>Drosophila</I>, rat and human cells and tissues, including analyses of both males and females, we present evidence that glia undergoing anastasis in the primary astrogliopathy Alexander disease subsequently express hallmarks of senescence. These senescent glia promote non-cell autonomous death of neurons by secreting interleukin family cytokines. Our findings demonstrate that anastasis can be dysfunctional in neurologic disease by inducing a toxic senescent population of astroglia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Under some conditions cells otherwise destined to die can be rescued just before death in a process called anastasis, or "rising from the dead." The fate and function of cells undergoing a near death experience is not well understood. Here, we find that in models and patient cells from Alexander disease, an important brain disorder in which glial cells promote neuronal dysfunction and death, anastasis of astrocytic glia leads to secretion of toxic signaling molecules and neurodegeneration. These studies demonstrate a previously unexpected deleterious consequence of rescuing cells on the brink of death and suggest therapeutic strategies for Alexander disease and related disorders of glia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Farnesyltransferase Inhibitor Restores Cognitive Deficits in Tsc2+/- Mice through Inhibition of Rheb1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in <I>Tsc1</I> or <I>Tsc2</I>, whose gene products inhibit the small G-protein Rheb1. Rheb1 activates mTORC1, which may cause refractory epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism. The mTORC1 inhibitors have been used for TSC patients with intractable epilepsy. However, its effectiveness for cognitive symptoms remains unclear. We found a new signaling pathway for synapse formation through Rheb1 activation, but not mTORC1. Here, we show that treatment with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib increased unfarnesylated (inactive) Rheb1 levels and restored synaptic abnormalities in cultured <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> neurons, whereas rapamycin did not enhance spine synapse formation. Lonafarnib treatment also restored the plasticity-related Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) expression in cultured <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> neurons. Lonafarnib action was partly dependent on the Rheb1 reduction with syntenin. Oral administration of lonafarnib increased unfarnesylated protein levels without affecting mTORC1 and MAP (mitogen-activated protein (MAP)) kinase signaling, and restored dendritic spine morphology in the hippocampi of male <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice. In addition, lonafarnib treatment ameliorated contextual memory impairments and restored memory-related Arc expression in male <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice <I>in vivo</I>. Heterozygous <I>Rheb1</I> knockout in male <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice reproduced the results observed with pharmacological treatment. These results suggest that the Rheb1 activation may be responsible for synaptic abnormalities and memory impairments in <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice, and its inhibition by lonafarnib could provide insight into potential treatment options for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant disease that causes neuropsychiatric symptoms, including intractable epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID) and autism. No pharmacological treatment for ID has been reported so far. To develop a pharmacological treatment for ID, we investigated the mechanism of TSC and found that Rheb1 activation is responsible for synaptic abnormalities in TSC neurons. To inhibit Rheb1 function, we used the farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib, because farnesylation of Rheb1 is required for its activation. Lonafarnib treatment increased inactive Rheb1 and recovered proper synapse formation and plasticity-related Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) expression in TSC neurons. Furthermore, <I>in vivo</I> lonafarnib treatment restored contextual memory and Arc induction in TSC mice. Together, Rheb1 inhibition by lonafarnib could provide insight into potential treatments for TSC-associated ID.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify the rates of neurological events following administration of mRNA (Pfizer, Moderna) or adenovirus vector (Janssen) vaccines in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used publicly available data from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) collected between January 1, 2021 and June 14, 2021. All free text symptoms that were reported within 42 days of vaccine administration were manually reviewed and grouped into 36 individual neurological diagnostic categories. Post-vaccination neurological event rates were compared between vaccine types and to age-matched baseline incidence rates in the U.S. and rates of neurological events following COVID.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 306,907,697 COVID vaccine doses administered during the study timeframe, 314,610 (0.1%) people reported any adverse event and 105,214 (0.03%) reported neurological adverse events in a median of 1 day (IQR0-3) from inoculation. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) occurred in fewer than 1 per 1,000,000 doses. Significantly more neurological adverse events were reported following Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S) vaccination compared to either Pfizer-BioNtech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1,273; 0.15% vs 0.03% vs 0.03% of doses, respectively, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). The observed-to-expected ratios for GBS, CVT and seizure following Janssen vaccination were ≥1.5-fold higher than background rates. However, the rate of neurological events after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was up to 617-fold higher than after COVID vaccination.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Reports of serious neurological events following COVID vaccination are rare. GBS, CVT and seizure may occur at higher than background rates following Janssen vaccination. Despite this, rates of neurological complications following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are up to 617-fold higher than after COVID vaccination. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dissecting mutational allosteric effects in alkaline phosphatases associated with different Hypophosphatasia phenotypes: An integrative computational investigation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fei Xiao, Ziyun Zhou, Xingyu Song, Mi Gan, Jie Long, Gennady Verkhivker, Guang Hu</p>

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by defective bone mineralization and is highly variable in its clinical phenotype. The disease occurs due to various loss-of-function mutations in <i>ALPL</i>, the gene encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). In this work, a data-driven and biophysics-based approach is proposed for the large-scale analysis of <i>ALPL</i> mutations-from nonpathogenic to severe HPPs. By using a pipeline of synergistic approaches including sequence-structure analysis, network modeling, elastic network models and atomistic simulations, we characterized allosteric signatures and effects of the <i>ALPL</i> mutations on protein dynamics and function. Statistical analysis of molecular features computed for the <i>ALPL</i> mutations showed a significant difference between the control, mild and severe HPP phenotypes. Molecular dynamics simulations coupled with protein structure network analysis were employed to analyze the effect of single-residue variation on conformational dynamics of TNSALP dimers, and the developed machine learning model suggested that the topological network parameters could serve as a robust indicator of severe mutations. The results indicated that the severity of disease-associated mutations is often linked with mutation-induced modulation of allosteric communications in the protein. This study suggested that <i>ALPL</i> mutations associated with mild and more severe HPPs can exert markedly distinct effects on the protein stability and long-range network communications. By linking the disease phenotypes with dynamic and allosteric molecular signatures, the proposed integrative computational approach enabled to characterize and quantify the allosteric effects of <i>ALPL</i> mutations and role of allostery in the pathogenesis of HPPs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interactions between sensory prediction error and task error during implicit motor learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan S. Tsay, Adrian M. Haith, Richard B. Ivry, Hyosub E. Kim</p>

Implicit motor recalibration allows us to flexibly move in novel and changing environments. Conventionally, implicit recalibration is thought to be driven by errors in predicting the sensory outcome of movement (i.e., sensory prediction errors). However, recent studies have shown that implicit recalibration is also influenced by errors in achieving the movement goal (i.e., task errors). Exactly how sensory prediction errors and task errors interact to drive implicit recalibration and, in particular, whether task errors alone might be sufficient to drive implicit recalibration remain unknown. To test this, we induced task errors in the absence of sensory prediction errors by displacing the target mid-movement. We found that task errors alone failed to induce implicit recalibration. In additional experiments, we simultaneously varied the size of sensory prediction errors and task errors. We found that implicit recalibration driven by sensory prediction errors could be continuously modulated by task errors, revealing an unappreciated dependency between these two sources of error. Moreover, implicit recalibration was attenuated when the target was simply flickered in its original location, even though this manipulation did not affect task error–an effect likely attributed to attention being directed away from the feedback cursor. Taken as a whole, the results were accounted for by a computational model in which sensory prediction errors and task errors, modulated by attention, interact to determine the extent of implicit recalibration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">COMMIT: Consideration of metabolite leakage and community composition improves microbial community reconstructions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Philipp Wendering, Zoran Nikoloski</p>

Composition and functions of microbial communities affect important traits in diverse hosts, from crops to humans. Yet, mechanistic understanding of how metabolism of individual microbes is affected by the community composition and metabolite leakage is lacking. Here, we first show that the consensus of automatically generated metabolic reconstructions improves the quality of the draft reconstructions, measured by comparison to reference models. We then devise an approach for gap filling, termed COMMIT, that considers metabolites for secretion based on their permeability and the composition of the community. By applying COMMIT with two soil communities from the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> culture collection, we could significantly reduce the gap-filling solution in comparison to filling gaps in individual reconstructions without affecting the genomic support. Inspection of the metabolic interactions in the soil communities allows us to identify microbes with community roles of helpers and beneficiaries. Therefore, COMMIT offers a versatile fully automated solution for large-scale modelling of microbial communities for diverse biotechnological applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Mitochondria transplantation between living cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoph G. Gäbelein, Qian Feng, Edin Sarajlic, Tomaso Zambelli, Orane Guillaume-Gentil, Benoît Kornmann, Julia A. Vorholt</p>

Mitochondria and the complex endomembrane system are hallmarks of eukaryotic cells. To date, it has been difficult to manipulate organelle structures within single live cells. We developed a FluidFM-based approach to extract, inject, and transplant organelles from and into living cells with subcellular spatial resolution. The technology combines atomic force microscopy, optical microscopy, and nanofluidics to achieve force and volume control with real-time inspection. We developed dedicated probes that allow minimally invasive entry into cells and optimized fluid flow to extract specific organelles. When extracting single or a defined number of mitochondria, their morphology transforms into a pearls-on-a-string phenotype due to locally applied fluidic forces. We show that the induced transition is calcium independent and results in isolated, intact mitochondria. Upon cell-to-cell transplantation, the transferred mitochondria fuse to the host cells mitochondrial network. Transplantation of healthy and drug-impaired mitochondria into primary keratinocytes allowed monitoring of mitochondrial subpopulation rescue. Fusion with the mitochondrial network of recipient cells occurred 20 minutes after transplantation and continued for over 16 hours. After transfer of mitochondria and cell propagation over generations, donor mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was replicated in recipient cells without the need for selection pressure. The approach opens new prospects for the study of organelle physiology and homeostasis, but also for therapy, mechanobiology, and synthetic biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortical waves mediate the cellular response to electric fields</a></h4>

              
                Electrotaxis, the directional migration of cells in a constant electric field, is important in regeneration, development, and wound healing. Electrotaxis has a slower response and a smaller dynamic range than guidance by other cues, suggesting that the mechanism of electrotaxis shares both similarities and differences with chemical-gradient-sensing pathways. We examine a mechanism centered on the excitable system consisting of cortical waves of biochemical signals coupled to cytoskeletal reorganization, which has been implicated in random cell motility. We use electro-fused giant <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells to decouple waves from cell motion and employ nanotopographic surfaces to limit wave dimensions and lifetimes. We demonstrate that wave propagation in these cells is guided by electric fields. The wave area and lifetime gradually increase in the first 10 min after an electric field is turned on, leading to more abundant and wider protrusions in the cell region nearest the cathode. The wave directions display ‘U-turn’ behavior upon field reversal, and this switch occurs more quickly on nanotopography. Our results suggest that electric fields guide cells by controlling waves of signal transduction and cytoskeletal activity, which underlie cellular protrusions. Whereas surface receptor occupancy triggers both rapid activation and slower polarization of signaling pathways, electric fields appear to act primarily on polarization, explaining why cells respond to electric fields more slowly than to other guidance cues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dual signaling via interferon and DNA damage response elicits entrapment by giant PML nuclear bodies</a></h4>

              
                PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are dynamic interchromosomal macromolecular complexes implicated in epigenetic regulation as well as antiviral defense. During herpesvirus infection, PML-NBs induce epigenetic silencing of viral genomes, however, this defense is antagonized by viral regulatory proteins such as IE1 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Here, we show that PML-NBs undergo a drastic rearrangement into highly enlarged PML cages upon infection with IE1-deficient HCMV. Importantly, our results demonstrate that dual signaling by interferon and DNA damage response is required to elicit giant PML-NBs. DNA labeling revealed that invading HCMV genomes are entrapped inside PML-NBs and remain stably associated with PML cages in a transcriptionally repressed state. Intriguingly, by correlative light and transmission electron microscopy (EM), we observed that PML cages also entrap newly assembled viral capsids demonstrating a second defense layer in cells with incomplete first line response. Further characterization by 3D EM showed that hundreds of viral capsids are tightly packed into several layers of fibrous PML. Overall, our data indicate that giant PML-NBs arise via combined interferon and DNA damage signaling which triggers entrapment of both nucleic acids and proteinaceous components. This represents a multilayered defense strategy to act in a cytoprotective manner and to combat viral infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary conservation of centriole rotational asymmetry in the human centrosome</a></h4>

              
                Centrioles are formed by microtubule triplets in a nine-fold symmetric arrangement. In flagellated protists and in animal multiciliated cells, accessory structures tethered to specific triplets render the centrioles rotationally asymmetric, a property that is key to cytoskeletal and cellular organization in these contexts. In contrast, centrioles within the centrosome of animal cells display no conspicuous rotational asymmetry. Here, we uncover rotationally asymmetric molecular features in human centrioles. Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we show that LRRCC1, the ortholog of a protein originally characterized in flagellate green algae, associates preferentially to two consecutive triplets in the distal lumen of human centrioles. LRRCC1 partially co-localizes and affects the recruitment of another distal component, C2CD3, which also has an asymmetric localization pattern in the centriole lumen. Together, LRRCC1 and C2CD3 delineate a structure reminiscent of a filamentous density observed by electron microscopy in flagellates, termed the 'acorn'. Functionally, the depletion of LRRCC1 in human cells induced defects in centriole structure, ciliary assembly and ciliary signaling, supporting that LRRCC1 cooperates with C2CD3 to organizing the distal region of centrioles. Since a mutation in the <i>LRRCC1</i> gene has been identified in Joubert syndrome patients, this finding is relevant in the context of human ciliopathies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that rotational asymmetry is an ancient property of centrioles that is broadly conserved in human cells. Our work also reveals that asymmetrically localized proteins are key for primary ciliogenesis and ciliary signaling in human cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19: A metabolic perspective</a></h4>

              
                The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to rage around the world. At the same time, despite strong public health measures and high vaccination rates in some countries, a post-COVID-19 syndrome has emerged which lacks a clear definition, prevalence, or etiology. However, fatigue, dyspnea, brain fog, and lack of smell and/or taste are often characteristic of patients with this syndrome. These are evident more than a month after infection, and are labeled as <i>Post-Acute Sequelae of CoV-2</i> (PASC) or commonly referred to as long-COVID. Metabolic dysfunction (i.e., obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus) is a predisposing risk factor for severe acute COVID-19, and there is emerging evidence that this factor plus a chronic inflammatory state may predispose to PASC. In this article, we explore the potential pathogenic metabolic mechanisms that could underly both severe acute COVID-19 and PASC, and then consider how these might be targeted for future therapeutic approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bayesian machine learning analysis of single-molecule fluorescence colocalization images</a></h4>

              
                Multi-wavelength single-molecule fluorescence colocalization (CoSMoS) methods allow elucidation of complex biochemical reaction mechanisms. However, analysis of CoSMoS data is intrinsically challenging because of low image signal-to-noise ratios, non-specific surface binding of the fluorescent molecules, and analysis methods that require subjective inputs to achieve accurate results. Here, we use Bayesian probabilistic programming to implement Tapqir, an unsupervised machine learning method that incorporates a holistic, physics-based causal model of CoSMoS data. This method accounts for uncertainties in image analysis due to photon and camera noise, optical non-uniformities, non-specific binding, and spot detection. Rather than merely producing a binary 'spot/no spot' classification of unspecified reliability, Tapqir objectively assigns spot classification probabilities that allow accurate downstream analysis of molecular dynamics, thermodynamics, and kinetics. We both quantitatively validate Tapqir performance against simulated CoSMoS image data with known properties and also demonstrate that it implements fully objective, automated analysis of experiment-derived data sets with a wide range of signal, noise, and non-specific binding characteristics.
