              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tau and Î±-synuclein shape microtubule organization and microtubule-dependent transport in neuronal dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Tau and -synuclein are major players in neurodegenerative diseases, but their physiological role, particularly in dendrites, is poorly understood. Here we show that, surprisingly, lack of tau protein induces the development of a more elaborate dendritic arbor of hippocampal pyramidal cells in organotypic tissue. Using high-speed volumetric lattice light-sheet microscopy and single particle tracking, we found a more directional KIF1A-mediated transport in dendrites of Tau KO cells. Increased transport processivity correlated with longer and straighter dendritic microtubules as revealed by three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy of cultured hippocampal neurons. Unbiased mass spectrometric analysis of tissue showed highly increased expression of -synuclein in Tau KO hippocampi. Overexpression of -synuclein mimicked the transport characteristics observed in Tau KO cells. Our data indicate that tau and -synuclein shape microtubule-dependent transport in neuronal dendrites, thereby promoting dendritic arborization during maturation. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that transport efficiency and length and straightness of microtubules are correlated.

	<p>Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) is a protein responsible for causing Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. In the absence of an experimentally designed protein molecule, homology modelling was performed. Through homology modelling, different CALHM1 models were generated and validated through Rampage. To carry out further in silico studies, through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments, various flavonoids and alkaloids from Bauhinia variegata were utilised as inhibitors to target the protein (CALHM1). The sequence of CALHM1 was retrieved from UniProt and the secondary structure prediction of CALHM1 was done through CFSSP, GOR4, and SOPMA methods. The structure was identified through LOMETS, MUSTER, and MODELLER and finally, the structures were validated through Rampage. Bauhinia variegata plant was used to check the interaction of alkaloids and flavonoids against CALHM1. The protein and protein&amp;amp;ndash;ligand complex were also validated through molecular dynamics simulations studies. The model generated through MODELLER software with 6VAM A was used because this model predicted the best results in the Ramachandran plot. Further molecular docking was performed, quercetin was found to be the most appropriate candidate for the protein molecule with the minimum binding energy of &amp;amp;minus;12.45 kcal/mol and their ADME properties were analysed through Molsoft and Molinspiration. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that CALHM1 and CALHM1&amp;amp;ndash;quercetin complex became stable at 2500 ps. It may be seen through the study that quercetin may act as a good inhibitor for treatment. With the help of an in silico study, it was easier to analyse the 3D structure of the protein, which may be scrutinized for the best-predicted model. Quercetin may work as a good inhibitor for treating Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, according to in silico research using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, and future in vitro and in vivo analysis may confirm its effectiveness.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Spinal ascending pathways for somatosensory information processing</a></h4>

              
                The somatosensory system processes diverse types of information including mechanical, thermal, and chemical signals. It has an essential role in sensory perception and body movement and, thus, is crucial for organism survival. The neural network for processing somatosensory information comprises multiple key nodes. Spinal projection neurons represent the key node for transmitting somatosensory information from the periphery to the brain. Although the anatomy of spinal ascending pathways has been characterized, the mechanisms underlying somatosensory information processing by spinal ascending pathways are incompletely understood.

                A dopamine D2 receptor mutation was recently identified in a family with a novel hyperkinetic movement disorder (Mov Disord 36: 729-739, 2021). That allelic variant D2-I212F is a constitutively active and G protein-biased receptor. We now describe mice engineered to carry the D2-I212F variant, Drd2I212F. The mice exhibited gait abnormalities resembling those in other mouse models of chorea and/or dystonia, and had decreased striatal D2 receptor expression. Electrically evoked IPSCs in midbrain dopamine neurons and striatum from Drd2I212F mice exhibited slow onset and decay compared to wild type mice. In the presence of dopamine, current decay initiated by photolytic release of sulpiride from CyHQ-sulpiride was slower in midbrain slices from Drd2I212F mice than Drd2+/+ mice. Furthermore, in contrast to wild type mice in which dopamine is more potent at neurons in the nucleus accumbens than in the dorsal striatum, reflecting activation of Go vs. Gi1, dopamine had similar potencies in those two brain regions of Drd2I212F mice. Repeated cocaine treatment, which decreases dopamine potency in the nucleus accumbens of wild type mice, had no effect on dopamine potency in Drd2I212F mice. The results demonstrate the utility of this mouse model for investigating the role of pathogenic DRD2 variants in early-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders.

	<p>In recent years, the increasing incidence of morbidity of brain stroke has made fast and accurate segmentation of lesion areas from brain MRI images important. With the development of deep learning, segmentation methods based on the computer have become a solution to assist clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Nevertheless, the variety of lesion sizes in brain MRI images and the roughness of the boundary of the lesion pose challenges to the accuracy of the segmentation algorithm. Current mainstream medical segmentation models are not able to solve these challenges due to their insufficient use of image features and context information. This paper proposes a novel feature enhancement and context capture network (FECC-Net), which is mainly composed of an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module and an enhanced encoder. In particular, the ASPP model uses parallel convolution operations with different sampling rates to enrich multi-scale features and fully capture image context information in order to process lesions of different sizes. The enhanced encoder obtains deep semantic features and shallow boundary features in the feature extraction process to achieve image feature enhancement, which is helpful for restoration of the lesion boundaries. We divide the pathological image into three levels according to the number of pixels in the real mask area and evaluate FECC-Net on an open dataset called Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS). The experimental results show that our FECC-Net outperforms mainstream methods, such as DoubleU-Net and TransUNet. Especially in small target tasks, FECC-Net is 4.09% ahead of DoubleU-Net on the main indicator DSC. Therefore, FECC-Net is encouraging and can be relied upon for brain MRI image applications.</p>

	<p>Background: To prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hyperventilation (HV) activation has been avoided in electroencephalograms (EEGs) since April 2020. The influence of omitting HV in EEG on epilepsy diagnosis remains uncertain for patients with epilepsies other than child absence epilepsy. We hypothesized that EEGs with HV would show more interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) than EEGs without HV in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Methods: We reviewed the EEGs of seizure-free patients with JME who underwent EEG, both with and without HV, from January 2019 to October 2021, in our institution, and compared IEDs between EEG with and without HV. Results: This study analyzed 23 JME patients. The IED-positive rate was significantly higher in EEG with HV (65.2%) than in EEG without HV (34.8%, p=0.016). The mean&amp;amp;plusmn;standard deviation number of IEDs per minute was significantly larger during HV (1.61&amp;amp;plusmn;2.25 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;1) than during non-activation of both first EEG (0.57&amp;amp;plusmn;0.93 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;1, p=0.039) and second EEG (0.39&amp;amp;plusmn;0.76 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;1, p=0.009). Conclusions: In JME patients, performing HV during EEG may increase IEDs and appears to facilitate the accurate diagnosis of epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a factor associated with the central regulation of body weight, stress, anxiety, learning, memory consolidation, wakefulness&amp;amp;ndash;sleep cycle, and anti-inflammatory and neuroplastic effects. Its stress-reducing, anti-anxiety, arousal without anxiety, and pro-cognitive effects represent an interesting option for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of the study was to examine the potential associations of NPS levels in the blood with clinical and metabolic parameters during the rehabilitation therapy of patients with schizophrenia. Thirty-three male subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia were randomly divided into two groups. The rehabilitation group (REH, N16) consisted of patients who were subjected to structured, 3-month intensive rehabilitation therapy, and the control group (CON, N17) consisted of patients who were subjected to a standard support mechanism. Both groups continued their pharmacological treatment as usual. The NPS concentration, as well as clinical and metabolic parameters, were compared in both groups. Additionally, a group of healthy (H) males (N15) was tested for NPS reference scores. To look for the specificity and selectivity of the NPS relationship with clinical results, various factor models of the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) were analyzed, including the original PANSS 2/3 model, its modified four-factor version, the male-specific four-factor model, and two five-factorial models validated in large groups in clinical and multi-ethnic studies. Results and conclusions: (1) Structured rehabilitation therapy, compared to unstructured supportive therapy, significantly reduced the level of schizophrenia disorders defined by various factor models derived from PANSS. (2) The clinical improvement within the 3-month rehabilitation therapy course was correlated with a significant decrease in neuropeptide S (NPS) serum level. (3) The excitement/Hostility (E/H) factor, which included schizophrenic symptoms of the psychotic disorganization, was specific and selective for the reduction in serum NPS, which was stable across all analyzed factor models. (4) The long-term relationship between serum NPS and clinical factors was not accompanied by basic metabolic parameters.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most malignant glioma among astrocytomas and is a lethal form of brain cancer. Many RAB genes are involved in different cancers but RAB42 (Ras-associated binding 42) is seldom studied in GBM. Our study aimed to explore the role of RAB42 expression in the development and prognosis of GBM. Methods: All GBM patient data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. The relevance of RAB42 expression to the clinicopathologic characteristics of GBM patients was analyzed. The overall survival (OS) significance was determined using log-rank. Significantly enriched KEGG pathways were screened using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Results: High expression of RAB42 was observed in GBM specimens compared with normal samples, which was also verified in cell lines and tissue samples. Elevated RAB42 expression was correlated with higher GBM histological grade. The prognosis of GBM patients with high RAB42 expression was worse than those with lower RAB42. A total of 35 pathways, such as the P53 pathway, were significantly activated in highly RAB42-expressed GBM samples. Conclusions: High RAB42 expression is related to the development of GBM, and RAB42 is a probable prognostic marker for GBM.</p>

	<p>The deep brain stimulation (DBS) in early-stage Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) pilot trial began more than a decade ago and remains the only investigation of DBS in mildly symptomatic patients. Patients completed therapeutic washouts biannually for two years, outpatient assessments through five years, and a longitudinal washout assessment after 11 years. Here, the patient experience of participating in the early DBS pilot trial is described. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded, analyzed using an iterative inductive-deductive approach, and used to develop a conceptual framework. Ten participants (n = 6 early optimal drug therapy (ODT), n = 4 early DBS + ODT) were interviewed. Motivations for participation included benefit to future PD patients and potential personal benefit, while hesitations included risk of surgical complications. While early ODT patients who received standard-of-care DBS described significant changes in their functional capacities after surgery, early DBS patients described a maintenance of quality of life that made PD less impactful over an extended period. Patients expressed high satisfaction with trial participation and early DBS. This study suggests that the PD experience with early DBS may notably differ from standard-of-care DBS. The FDA has approved a pivotal clinical trial evaluating DBS in early-stage PD (IDEG050016).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Noise Exposure and Aging on Behavioral Tone Detection in Quiet and Noise by Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging leads to degeneration of the peripheral and central auditory systems, hearing loss, and difficulty understanding sounds in noise. Aging is also associated with changes in susceptibility to or recovery from damaging noise exposures, although the effects of the interaction between acute noise exposure and age on the perception of sounds are not well studied. We tested these effects in the CBA/CaJ mouse model of age-related hearing loss using operant conditioning procedures before and after noise exposure and longitudinally measured changes in their sensitivity for detecting tones in quiet or noise backgrounds. Cochleae from a subset of the behaviorally tested mice were immunolabeled to examine organ of Corti damage relative to what is expected based on aging alone. Mice tested in both quiet and noise background conditions experienced worse behavioral sensitivity immediately after noise exposure, but mice exposed at older ages generally showed greater threshold shifts and reduced recovery over time. Surprisingly, day-to-day stability in thresholds was markedly higher for mice detecting signals in the presence of a noise masker compared with detection in quiet conditions. Cochlear analysis revealed decreases in the total number of outer hair cells (OHCs) and the number of ribbons per inner cell in high-frequency regions in aged, noise-exposed mice relative to aging alone. Our findings build on previous work showing interactions between age and noise exposure and add that background noise can increase the stability of behavioral hearing sensitivity after noise damage.</p>

                Background: Managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using available resources is essential to reduce the health burden of disease. The severity of COVID-19 is affected by nutritional status. In this study the effect of natural product use prior to infection with COVID-19 on disease severity and hospitalization was explored. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Between March and July 2021, a self-administered survey was conducted in Jordan. Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and were â¥18 years old were the study population. Study measures included the use of natural products, COVID-19 severity, and hospitalization status. A multivariate regression model was used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age (mean Â± SD) of the study sample (n=2,148) was 40.25 Â± 15.58 years old. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the regular intake of carnation (OR [0.56], CI [0.37â0.85]), onion (OR [0.69], CI [0.52â0.92]), lemon (OR [0.68], CI [0.51â0.90]), and citrus fruits (OR [0.66], CI [0.50â0.89]) before infection were associated with a substantial reduction in COVID-19 severity (P<0.01). Also, the consumption of carnation (OR [0.55], CI [0.34â0.88]), lemon (OR [0.57], CI [0.42â0.78]), and citrus fruits (OR [0.61], CI [0.44â0.84]) were associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of COVID-19-induced hospitalization (P<0.01). Conclusions: Regular consumption of carnation, lemon, and citrus fruits before infection was associated with better outcomes for COVID-19. Studies on other populations are required to confirm these findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for living systematic reviews (LSRs): protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While the PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to guide the reporting of original systematic reviews, updated systematic reviews, and living systematic reviews (LSRs), its explanation and elaboration document notes that additional considerations for updated systematic reviews and LSRs may need to be addressed. This paper reports the protocol for developing an extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for LSRs. Methods: We will follow the EQUATOR Networkâs guidance for developing health research reporting guidelines. We will review the literature to identify possible items of the PRISMA 2020 checklist that need modification, as well as new items that need to be added. Then, we will survey representatives of different stakeholder groups for their views on the proposed modifications of the PRISMA 2020 checklist. We will summarize, present, and discuss the results of the survey in an online meeting, aiming to reach consensus on the content of the LSR extension. We will then draft the checklist, explanation and elaboration for each item, and flow diagram for the PRISMA 2020 extension. Then, we will share these initial documents with stakeholder representatives for final feedback and approval. Discussion: We anticipate that the PRISMA 2020 extension for LSRs will benefit LSR authors, editors, and peer reviewers of LSRs, as well as different users of LSRs, including guideline developers, policy makers, healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SALARECON connects the Atlantic salmon genome to growth and feed efficiency</a></h4>

Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) is the most valuable farmed fish globally and there is much interest in optimizing its genetics and rearing conditions for growth and feed efficiency. Marine feed ingredients must be replaced to meet global demand, with challenges for fish health and sustainability. Metabolic models can address this by connecting genomes to metabolism, which converts nutrients in the feed to energy and biomass, but such models are currently not available for major aquaculture species such as salmon. We present SALARECON, a model focusing on energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism that links the Atlantic salmon genome to metabolic fluxes and growth. It performs well in standardized tests and captures expected metabolic (in)capabilities. We show that it can explain observed hypoxic growth in terms of metabolic fluxes and apply it to aquaculture by simulating growth with commercial feed ingredients. Predicted limiting amino acids and feed efficiencies agree with data, and the model suggests that marine feed efficiency can be achieved by supplementing a few amino acids to plant- and insect-based feeds. SALARECON is a high-quality model that makes it possible to simulate Atlantic salmon metabolism and growth. It can be used to explain Atlantic salmon physiology and address key challenges in aquaculture such as development of sustainable feeds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deriving time-concordant event cascades from gene expression data: A case study for Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anika Liu, Namshik Han, Jordi Munoz-Muriedas, Andreas Bender</p>

Adverse event pathogenesis is often a complex process which compromises multiple events ranging from the molecular to the phenotypic level. In toxicology, Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) aim to formalize this as temporal sequences of events, in which event relationships should be supported by causal evidence according to the tailored Bradford-Hill criteria. One of the criteria is whether events are consistently observed in a certain temporal order and, in this work, we study this time concordance using the concept of âfirst activationâ as data-driven means to generate hypotheses on potentially causal mechanisms. As a case study, we analysed liver data from repeat-dose studies in rats from the TG-GATEs database which comprises measurements across eight timepoints, ranging from 3 hours to 4 weeks post-treatment. We identified time concordant gene expression-derived events preceding adverse histopathology, which serves as surrogate readout for Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). We find known mechanisms in DILI to be time-concordant, and show further that significance, frequency and log fold change (logFC) of differential expression are metrics which can additionally prioritize events although not necessary to be mechanistically relevant. Moreover, we used the temporal order of transcription factor (TF) expression and regulon activity to identify transcriptionally regulated TFs and subsequently combined this with prior knowledge on functional interactions to derive detailed gene-regulatory mechanisms, such as reduced Hnf4a activity leading to decreased expression and activity of Cebpa. At the same time, also potentially novel events are identified such as Sox13 which is highly significantly time-concordant and shows sustained activation over time. Overall, we demonstrate how time-resolved transcriptomics can derive and support mechanistic hypotheses by quantifying time concordance and how this can be combined with prior causal knowledge, with the aim of both understanding mechanisms of toxicity, as well as potential applications to the AOP framework. We make our results available in the form of a Shiny app (https://anikaliu.shinyapps.io/dili_cascades), which allows users to query events of interest in more detail.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Motor response vigour and visual fixation patterns reflect subjective valuation during intertemporal choice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elke Smith, Jan Peters</p>

Value-based decision-making is of central interest in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, as well as in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders characterised by decision-making impairments. Studies examining (neuro-)computational mechanisms underlying choice behaviour typically focus on participantsâ decisions. However, there is increasing evidence that option valuation might also be reflected in motor response vigour and eye movements, implicit measures of subjective utility. To examine motor response vigour and visual fixation correlates of option valuation in intertemporal choice, we set up a task where the participants selected an option by pressing a grip force transducer, simultaneously tracking fixation shifts between options. As outlined in our preregistration (https://osf.io/k6jct), we used hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation to model the choices assuming hyperbolic discounting, compared variants of the softmax and drift diffusion model, and assessed the relationship between response vigour and the estimated model parameters. The behavioural data were best explained by a drift diffusion model specifying a non-linear scaling of the drift rate by the subjective value differences. Replicating previous findings, we found a magnitude effect for temporal discounting, such that higher rewards were discounted less. This magnitude effect was further reflected in motor response vigour, such that stronger forces were exerted in the <i>high</i> vs. the <i>low</i> magnitude condition. Bayesian hierarchical linear regression further revealed higher grip forces, faster response times and a lower number of fixation shifts for trials with higher subjective value differences. An exploratory analysis revealed that subjective value sums across options showed an even more pronounced association with trial-wise grip force amplitudes. Our data suggest that subjective utility or implicit valuation is reflected in motor response vigour and visual fixation patterns during intertemporal choice. Taking into account response vigour might thus provide deeper insight into decision-making, reward valuation and maladaptive changes in these processes, e.g. in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The polyol pathway is an evolutionarily conserved system for sensing glucose uptake</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hiroko Sano, Akira Nakamura, Mariko Yamane, Hitoshi Niwa, Takashi Nishimura, Kimi Araki, Kazumasa Takemoto, Kei-ichiro Ishiguro, Hiroki Aoki, Yuzuru Kato, Masayasu Kojima</p>

Cells must adjust the expression levels of metabolic enzymes in response to fluctuating nutrient supply. For glucose, such metabolic remodeling is highly dependent on a master transcription factor ChREBP/MondoA. However, it remains elusive how glucose fluctuations are sensed by ChREBP/MondoA despite the stability of major glycolytic pathways. Here, we show that in both flies and mice, ChREBP/MondoA activation in response to glucose ingestion involves an evolutionarily conserved glucose-metabolizing pathway: the polyol pathway. The polyol pathway converts glucose to fructose via sorbitol. It has been believed that this pathway is almost silent, and its activation in hyperglycemic conditions has deleterious effects on human health. We show that the polyol pathway regulates the glucose-responsive nuclear translocation of Mondo, a <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of ChREBP/MondoA, which directs gene expression for organismal growth and metabolism. Likewise, inhibition of the polyol pathway in mice impairs ChREBPâs nuclear localization and reduces glucose tolerance. We propose that the polyol pathway is an evolutionarily conserved sensing system for glucose uptake that allows metabolic remodeling.

                <p>by Albert Gidon, Jaan Aru, Matthew Evan Larkum</p>

Rapid advances in neuroscience have provided remarkable breakthroughs in understanding the brain on many fronts. Although promising, the role of these advancements in solving the problem of consciousness is still unclear. Based on technologies conceivably within the grasp of modern neuroscience, we discuss a thought experiment in which neural activity, in the form of action potentials, is initially recorded from all the neurons in a participantâs brain during a conscious experience and then played back into the same neurons. We consider whether this artificial replay can reconstitute a conscious experience. The possible outcomes of this experiment unravel hidden costs and pitfalls in understanding consciousness from the neurosciencesâ perspective and challenge the conventional wisdom that causally links action potentials and consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online academic satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students: role of sleep, emotions, college adjustment, and digital skills [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, led to significant changes in university education, resulting in the new normal standard of virtual teaching in many undergraduate medical schools worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors related to academic satisfaction with virtual teaching in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted on medical students at a private university in Peru, through self-reported questionnaires divided into sociodemographic data and variables of interest that could influence academic satisfaction during the pandemic. To evaluate possible factors related to academic satisfaction, stepwise regression models were performed for both sexes. Results: In total, data from 310 medical students, 117 males and 193 females, were analyzed. Academic satisfaction reached a score of 11.2 Â± 2.9, which was similar in both sexes. The best regression model for males (AIC: 544.32; RMSE: 2.42; R2: 0.30) showed that adaptation to university life (favorable change) and depression (unfavorable change) explained 30% of changes in students' academic satisfaction. While in females (AIC: 907.59; RMSE: 2.49; R 2: 0.22) the model integrated favorable factors such as adjustment to college life and anxiety; while depression and poor sleep quality were unfavorable factors. Conclusion: Factors that contributed to academic satisfaction in medical students were determined in this study, which differed by gender. Thus, it is important to take into account the particularities of male and female medical students in order to improve their academic satisfaction during their university careers.

                Background Knowing the needs of the bioimaging community with respect to research data management (RDM) is essential for identifying measures that enable adoption of the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for microscopy and bioimage analysis data across disciplines. As an initiative within Germany's National Research Data Infrastructure, we conducted this community survey in summer 2021 to assess the state of the art of bioimaging RDM and the community needs. Methods An online survey was conducted with a mixed question-type design. We created a questionnaire tailored to relevant topics of the bioimaging community, including specific questions on bioimaging methods and bioimage analysis, as well as more general questions on RDM principles and tools. 203 survey entries were included in the analysis covering the perspectives from various life and biomedical science disciplines and from participants at different career levels. Results The results highlight the importance and value of bioimaging RDM and data sharing. However, the practical implementation of FAIR practices is impeded by technical hurdles, lack of knowledge, and insecurity about the legal aspects of data sharing. The survey participants request metadata guidelines and annotation tools and endorse the usage of image data management platforms. At present, OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects) is the best known and most widely used platform. Most respondents rely on image processing and analysis, which they regard as the most time-consuming step of the bioimage data workflow. While knowledge about and implementation of electronic lab notebooks and data management plans is limited, respondents acknowledge their potential value for data handling and publication. Conclusions The bioimaging community acknowledges and endorses the value of RDM and data sharing. Still, there is a need for information, guidance, and standardization to foster the adoption of FAIR data handling. This survey may help inspiring targeted measures to close this gap.

                Background: To determine the relationship between pharmaceutical advertising and the consumption of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in users of the SUPERFAR drugstore in Barrios Altos-Cercado de Lima, 2022. Methods: The methodology used was a quantitative approach, non-experimental, cross-sectional, descriptive-correlational design. The sample consisted of 269 users, who were administered a questionnaire with 20 questions; the technique used was the survey. The results were obtained using SPSS Version 22 and Spearman's correlation statistical test with a significance level of 5%. Results: The correlation for the general hypothesis was determined with a P value of 0.000 and a Spearman's Rho value of r=0.729 indicating a strong and direct correlation between Variable 1 pharmaceutical advertising and Variable 2 consumption of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. For the pharmaceutical advertising message dimension, a P value of 0.000 was obtained, Spearman's Rho value of r=0.597 indicating a moderate and direct correlation, for the mass media dimension (P value is 0.000), Spearman's Rho value of r=0.525 indicating a moderate and direct correlation, for the pharmaceutical product promotion dimension (P value 0.000) Spearman's Rho value of r=0.637 showing a moderate and direct correlation and for the dimension of excessive consumption of medicines under the influence and responsibility of the pharmaceutical industry (P value 0.000) was obtained. Spearman's Rho value of r=0.670 indicating a moderate and direct correlation. Conclusion: The conclusion is that there is a significant relationship between the variables pharmaceutical advertising and drug consumption.

<p>This study shows for the first time that itch mediator gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is expressed in both trigeminal ganglion (TG) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is expressed in both the dorsal horn of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and spinal cord of primates, Japanese macaque monkeys, similar to rodents and Eulipotyphla.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor (GRPR) have been identified as itch mediators in the spinal and trigeminal somatosensory systems in rodents. In primates, there are few reports of GRP/GRPR expression or function in the spinal sensory system and virtually nothing is known in the trigeminal system. The aim of the present study was to characterize GRP and GRPR in the trigeminal and spinal somatosensory system of Japanese macaque monkeys (<i>Macaca fuscata</i>). cDNA encoding <i>GRP</i> was isolated from the macaque dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and exhibited an amino acid sequence that was highly conserved among mammals and especially in primates. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that GRP was expressed mainly in the small-sized trigeminal ganglion and DRG in adult macaque monkeys. Densely stained GRP-immunoreactive (ir) fibers were observed in superficial layers of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and the spinal cord. In contrast, GRP-ir fibers were rarely observed in the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus and oral and interpolar divisions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. cDNA cloning, in situ hybridization, and Western blot revealed substantial expression of <i>GRPR</i> mRNA and GRPR protein in the macaque spinal dorsal horn and Sp5C. Our Western ligand blot and ligand derivative stain for GRPR revealed that GRP directly bound in the macaque Sp5C and spinal dorsal horn as reported in rodents. Finally, GRP-ir fibers were also detected in the human spinal dorsal horn. The spinal and trigeminal itch neural circuits labeled with GRP and GRPR appear to function also in primates.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Dynamic causal communication channels between neocortical areas</a></h4>

              
                How do brain regions influence each other? Javadzadeh and Hofer use a causal approach to study cortical interactions. They find that communication subspaces between areasâthe channels by which they interactâare not static over time but re-organize rapidly over timescales as short as tens of milliseconds.

                TRP proteins are a large family of cation-selective channels, surpassed in variety only by voltage-gated potassium channels. Detailed molecular mechanisms governing how membrane voltage, ligand binding, or temperature can induce conformational changes promoting the open state in TRP channels are still a matter of debate. Aiming to unveil distinctive structural features common to the transmembrane domains within the TRP family, we performed phylogenetic reconstruction, sequence statistics, and structural analysis over a large set of TRP channel genes. Here we report an exceptionally conserved set of residues. This fingerprint is composed of twelve residues localized at equivalent three-dimensional positions in TRP channels from the different subtypes. Moreover, these amino acids are arranged in three groups, connected by a set of aromatics located at the core of the transmembrane structure. We hypothesize that differences in the connectivity between these different groups of residues harbors the apparent differences in coupling strategies used by TRP subgroups.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endocytic trafficking promotes vacuolar enlargements for fast cell expansion rates in plants</a></h4>

              
                The vacuole has a space-filling function, allowing a particularly rapid plant cell expansion with very little increase in cytosolic content (LÃ¶fke et al., 2015; Scheuring et al., 2016; DÃ¼nser et al., 2019). Despite its importance for cell size determination in plants, very little is known about the mechanisms that define vacuolar size. Here, we show that the cellular and vacuolar size expansions are coordinated. By developing a pharmacological tool, we enabled the investigation of membrane delivery to the vacuole during cellular expansion. Our data reveal that endocytic membrane sorting from the plasma membrane to the vacuole is enhanced in the course of rapid root cell expansion. While this âcompromiseâ mechanism may theoretically at first decelerate cell surface enlargements, it fuels vacuolar expansion and, thereby, ensures the coordinated augmentation of vacuolar occupancy in dynamically expanding plant cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ancestral reconstruction of duplicated signaling proteins reveals the evolution of signaling specificity</a></h4>

              
                Gene duplication is crucial to generating novel signaling pathways during evolution. However, it remains unclear how the redundant proteins produced by gene duplication ultimately acquire new interaction specificities to establish insulated paralogous signaling pathways. Here, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect and characterize a bacterial two-component signaling system that duplicated in a-proteobacteria. We determined the interaction specificities of the signaling proteins that existed before and immediately after this duplication event and then identified key mutations responsible for establishing specificity in the two systems. Just three mutations, in only two of the four interacting proteins, were sufficient to establish specificity of the extant systems. Some of these mutations weakened interactions between paralogous systems to limit crosstalk. However, others strengthened interactions within a system, indicating that the ancestral interaction, although functional, had the potential to be strengthened. Our work suggests that protein-protein interactions with such latent potential may be highly amenable to duplication and divergence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tyrosine phosphorylation tunes chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2 ion channel</a></h4>

              
                Transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) is a multimodal ion channel implicated in diverse physiopathological processes. Its important involvement in immune responses has been suggested such as in the macrophages' phagocytosis process. However, the endogenous signaling cascades controlling the gating of TRPV2 remain to be understood. Here, we report that enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation remarkably alters the chemical and thermal sensitivities of TRPV2 endogenously expressed in rat bone marrow-derived macrophages. We identify that the protein tyrosine kinase JAK1 mediates TRPV2 phosphorylation at the molecular sites Tyr(335), Tyr(471), and Tyr(525). JAK1 phosphorylation is required for maintaining TRPV2 activity and the phagocytic ability of macrophages. We further show that TRPV2 phosphorylation is dynamically balanced by protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1). PTPN1 inhibition increases TRPV2 phosphorylation, further reducing the activation temperature threshold. Our data thus unveil an intrinsic mechanism where the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation dynamic balance sets the basal chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2. Targeting this pathway will aid therapeutic interventions in physiopathological contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid presynaptic maturation in naturally regenerating axons</a></h4>

              
                Successful neuronal regeneration requires the re-establishment of synaptic connectivity. Crucial to this process is the reconstitution of presynaptic machinery responsible for controlling neurotransmitter release. In the mammalian adult CNS post-injury regeneration is usually only possible after extensive experimental intervention, and it is unknown how presynaptic function is re-established, let alone how it might be optimised to promote functional recovery. Here we addressed these questions by studying presynaptic maturation during a regenerative process that occurs entirely naturally. After toxin-induced injury, olfactory sensory neurons in the adult mouse olfactory epithelium can regenerate fully, sending axons to the brain to re-establish synaptic contact with postsynaptic partners in the olfactory bulb. Using electrophysiological recordings in acute slices, we found that after initial re-contact, functional connectivity in this system was rapidly established. Moreover, re-connecting presynaptic terminals had almost mature functional properties, including high release probability and a strong capacity for presynaptic inhibition. Release probability then matured quickly, rendering re-established terminals functionally indistinguishable from controls just one week after initial contact. These data show that successful synaptic regeneration in the adult mammalian brain is not quite a "plug-and-play" process; instead, almost-mature presynaptic terminals undergo a rapid phase of functional maturation to re-integrate into established target networks.

                Objective: Functional connectivity networks explain the different brain states during diverse motor, cognitive, and sensory functions. Extracting spatial network configurations and their temporal evolution is crucial for understanding the brain function during diverse behavioral tasks. Approach: In this study, we introduce the use of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract the dynamics of brain networks. We compared DMD with principal component analysis (PCA) using real magnetoencephalography (MEG) data during motor and memory tasks. Main Results: The framework generates dominant spatial brain networks and their time dynamics during simple tasks, such as button press and left-hand movement, as well as more complex tasks, such as picture naming and memory tasks. Our findings show that the DMD-based approach provides a better temporal resolution than the PCA-based approach. Significance: We believe that DMD has a very high potential for deciphering the spatiotemporal dynamics of electrophysiological brain network states during tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Updating contextual sensory expectations for adaptive behaviour</a></h4>

              
                The brain has the extraordinary capacity to construct predictive models of the environment by internalizing statistical regularities in the sensory inputs. The resulting sensory expectations shape how we perceive and react to the world; at the neural level, this relates to decreased neural responses to expected than unexpected stimuli (expectation suppression). Crucially, expectations may need revision as context changes. However, existing research has often neglected this issue. Further, it is unclear whether contextual revisions apply selectively to expectations relevant to the task at hand, hence serving adaptive behaviour. The present fMRI study examined how contextual visual expectations spread throughout the cortical hierarchy as participants update their beliefs. We created a volatile environment with two state spaces presented over separate contexts and controlled by an independent contextualizing signal. Participants attended a training session before scanning to learn contextual temporal associations among pairs of object images. The fMRI experiment then tested for the emergence of contextual expectation suppression in two separate tasks, respectively with task-relevant and task-irrelevant expectations. Behavioural and neural effects of contextual expectation emerged progressively across the cortical hierarchy as participants attuned themselves to the context: expectation suppression appeared first in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus and posterior parietal cortex, followed by the ventral visual stream, up to early visual cortex. This applied selectively to task-relevant expectations. Taken together, the present results suggest that an insular and frontoparietal executive control network may guide the flexible deployment of contextual sensory expectations for adaptive behaviour in our complex and dynamic world.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic and chemical disruption of Amyloid Precursor Protein processing impairs zebrafish sleep maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Sleep-wake disturbances are among the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and contribute to disease severity. Since a major driver of AD-- the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) in the brain-- is modulated by sleep, a "vicious" feedforward cycle has been proposed in which A{beta} buildup disrupts sleep, leading to more A{beta} secretion and further worsening of sleep and AD. Consistent with this idea, mouse models of AD develop early sleep phenotypes, and sleep is acutely modulated by exogenous A{beta}. However, these overexpression paradigms leave unclear whether endogenous A{beta} signaling contributes to sleep regulation. To tackle this question, we generated loss of function mutations in the zebrafish orthologs of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and monitored larval sleep behavior. Larvae with mutations in appa had reduced waking activity levels but normal sleep patterns, while larvae that lacked appb had reduced sleep due to an inability to maintain sleep bout durations. In addition, larvae exposed to the {gamma}-secretase inhibitor DAPT, which inhibits A{beta} production from APP, also have shorter sleep bouts at night. Although {gamma}-secretase inhibition impacts the proteolytic cleavage of many proteins, appb mutants were insensitive to the sleep bout shortening effects of DAPT, suggesting that loss of {gamma}-secretase dependent proteolytic cleavage products of Appb are responsible for the reduced sleep maintenance phenotypes. These results are consistent with a model in which endogenous A{beta} directly modulates sleep in zebrafish and supports the idea that sleep disturbances may be a useful early-onset biomarker for AD.

                The human gaze is directed at various locations from moment to moment in acquiring information necessary to recognize the external environment at the fine resolution of foveal vision. Previous studies showed that the human gaze is biased to particular locations in the visual field at a particular timing, but it remains unclear what visual features produce such spatiotemporal bias. In this study, we used a deep convolutional neural network model to extract hierarchical visual features from natural scene images and evaluated how much the human gaze is attracted to the visual features in space and time. Eye movement measurement and visual feature analysis using the deep convolutional neural network model showed that the gaze was strongly attracted to spatial locations containing higher-order visual features than lower-order visual features and conventional saliency. Analysis of the gaze time course revealed that the bias to higher-order visual features was prominent within a short period after the beginning of observation of the natural scene images. These results demonstrate that higher-order visual features are a strong gaze attractor in both space and time, suggesting that the human visual system uses foveal vision resources to extract information from higher-order visual features with higher spatiotemporal priority.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling the Diverse Effects of Divisive Normalization on Noise Correlations</a></h4>

              
                Divisive normalization, a prominent model of interactions between neurons, plays a key role in influential theories of neural coding. Testing the mechanistic basis of those theories requires understanding the relationship between normalization and the statistics of neural activity, particularly noise correlations which provide strong constrains on circuit models. Yet the relation between normalization and correlations remains unclear, because models of covariability typically ignore normalization despite empirical evidence suggesting it contributes to stimulus and state modulations of covariability. We propose a pairwise stochastic divisive normalization model that accounts for the effects of normalization and other factors on covariability, and accurately fits Ca2+ imaging data from mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We show that normalization modulates noise correlations in qualitatively different ways depending on whether normalization is shared between neurons, and we outline the data regime in which the corresponding model parameter is identifiable. Our analysis provides the first quantitative evidence that similarly tuned neurons in mouse V1 share their normalization signals, and explains our observation that stronger normalization decorrelates those pairs, particularly at low stimulus contrast. Our model could enable quantifying the role of normalization on information transmission and representation, and mapping the parameters of normalization onto circuit and cellular mechanisms.

                Recent theories on the neural correlates of face identification stressed the importance of the available identity-specific semantic and affective information. However, whether such information is essential for the emergence of neural signal of familiarity has not yet been studied in detail. Here, we explored the shared representation of face familiarity between perceptually and personally familiarized identities. We applied a cross-experiment multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA), to test if EEG patterns for passive viewing of personally familiar and unfamiliar faces are useful in decoding familiarity in a matching task where familiarity was attained thorough a short perceptual task. Importantly, no additional semantic, contextual, or affective information was provided for the familiarized identities during perceptual familiarization. Although the two datasets originate from different sets of participants who were engaged in two different tasks, familiarity was still decodable in the sorted, same identity matching trials. This finding indicates that the visual processing of the faces of personally familiar and purely perceptually familiarized identities involve similar mechanisms, leading to cross-classifiable neural patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strategies of developmental vestibular plasticity after unilateral embryonic ear removal in Xenopus laevis</a></h4>

              
                Appropriate gaze control mechanisms rely on bilateral mirror-symmetric vestibular endorgans, central circuits, and extraocular motor effectors. Embryonic removal of one inner ear prior to the formation of these structures was used to evaluate the extent to which animals can develop appropriate motor outputs in the presence of only a singular inner ear. Near-congenital one-eared tadpoles subjected to separate or combinatorial visuo-vestibular motion stimulation exhibited vestibular-ocular reflexes, though smaller in gain compared to controls, whereas isolated visuo-motor responses remained largely unaltered. Surprisingly, direction-specific responses in one-eared tadpoles revealed a spectrum of vestibulo-ocular reflex performance, where in many cases rather robust responses were observed during head motion towards the missing ear. Rotation toward the remaining ear elicited eye movements which were often severely attenuated. This suggests that embryonically generated one-eared animals develop bidirectional vestibular signal detection and downstream processing capacities that allow activation of robust compensatory eye movements. However, this capability seems to occur at the expense of performance of vestibular reflexes during motion in the canonical activation direction of the singular ear. Consequently, the development of central vestibulo-motor circuits in one-eared animals likely relies on strategies in which the outcome for gaze stabilization is driven by balanced homeostatic levels and individual temporal tuning of abducens motoneuron activity. Despite the lack of bilateral symmetric vestibular afferent input, the developing central nervous system is capable of creating a framework for symmetric sensorimotor transformations.

                Early adversity can change educational, cognitive, and mental health outcomes. However, the neural processes through which early adversity exerts these effects remain largely unknown. We used generative network modelling of the mouse connectome to test whether unpredictable postnatal stress shifts the constraints that govern the formation of the structural connectome. A model that trades off the wiring cost of long-distance connections with topological homophily (i.e. links between regions with shared neighbours) generated simulations that replicate the organisation of the rodent connectome. The imposition of early life adversity significantly shifted the best-performing parameter combinations toward zero, heightening the stochastic nature of the generative process. Put simply, unpredictable postnatal stress changes the economic constraints that shape network formation, introducing greater randomness into the structural development of the brain. While this change may constrain the development of cognitive abilities, it could also reflect an adaptive mechanism. In other words, neural development could harness heightened stochasticity to make networks more robust to perturbation, thereby facilitating effective responses to future threats and challenges.

                Despite their phylogenetic differences and distinct pallial structures, mammals and birds share many features of sleep structure, most prominently, the existence of distinct stages of rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep (SWS). However, the structure of sleep does not remain constant during lifetime, but undergoes radical changes during development. Our current understanding of these age-related variations in neural signature of sleep is limited to studies in a small number of mammalian species. How does the neural signature of sleep evolve during brain development in an avian brain? To answer this, we recorded multi-channel EEG from developing juvenile and adult zebra finches for several nights. We compared the structure of sleep in adults and juveniles using the ratio of slow oscillations to gamma oscillations ("depth of sleep", DOS). We observed a significantly larger DOS, as well as less-frequent state transitions in juveniles compared to adults. Furthermore, multichannel EEG revealed local slow oscillations, in addition to global (wide-spread) slow waves. The occurrence of these local waves was correlated with DOS and was higher in frontal sites. In addition, we observed that the functional connectivity increased rapidly during development and was significantly higher in adults than in juveniles. Additionally, a graph theory analysis of highly-correlated networks revealed numerous small networks in juveniles compared to adults, underscoring the lower connectivity observed in juveniles. Overall, our results reveal significant changes in the neural signature of sleep during development in an avian brain that are remarkably similar to age-dependent changes that occur in mammals.

                Monosynaptically restricted rabies viruses have been used for more than a decade for synaptic connectivity tracing. However, the verisimilitude of quantitative conclusions drawn from these experiments is largely unknown. The primary reason is the simple metrics commonly used, which generally disregard the effect of starter cell numbers. Here we present an experimental dataset with a broad range of starter cell numbers and explore their relationship with the number of input cells across the brain using descriptive statistics and modelling. We show that starter cell numbers strongly affect input fraction and convergence index measures, making quantitative comparisons unreliable. Furthermore, we suggest a principled way to analyse rabies derived connectivity data by taking advantage of the starter vs input cell relationship that we describe and validate across independent datasets.

                The quality of a child's social and physical environment is a key influence on brain development, educational attainment and mental wellbeing. However, there still remains a mechanistic gap in our understanding of how environmental influences converge on changes in the brain's developmental trajectory. In a sample of 145 children with structural diffusion tensor imaging data, we used generative network modelling to simulate the emergence of whole brain network organisation. We then applied data-driven clustering to stratify the sample according to socio-economic disadvantage, with one of the resulting clusters containing mostly children living below the poverty line. A formal comparison of the simulated networks from the generative model revealed that the computational principles governing network formation were subtly different for children experiencing socio-economic disadvantage, and that this resulted in significantly altered developmental timing of network modularity emergence. Children in the low socio-economic status (SES) group had a significantly slower time to peak modularity, relative to the higher SES group (t(69) = 3.02, P = 3.50 x 10-4, d = 0.491). In a subsequent simulation we showed that the alteration in generative properties increases the variability in wiring probabilities during network formation (KS test: D = 0.012, P < 0.001). One possibility is that multiple environmental influences such as stress, diet and environmental stimulation impact both the systematic coordination of neuronal activity and biological resource constraints, converging on a shift in the economic conditions under which networks form. Alternatively, it is possible that this stochasticity reflects an adaptive mechanism that creates 'resilient' networks better suited to unpredictable environments.

                The regularities of the world render an intricate interplay between past and present. Even across independent trials, current-trial perception can be automatically shifted by preceding trials, namely the 'serial bias'. Meanwhile, the neural implementation of the spontaneous shift of present by past that operates on multiple features remains unknown. In two auditory categorization experiments with human electrophysiology recordings, we demonstrate that serial bias arises from the co-occurrence of past-trial neural reactivation and the neural encoding of current-trial features. The meeting of past and present shifts the neural representation of current-trial features and modulates serial bias behavior. Critically, past-trial features (i.e., pitch, category, motor response) that constitute an 'event-file' keep their respective identities in working memory and are only reactivated by the corresponding features in the current trial, giving rise to dissociated feature-specific serial biases. This 'event-file' reactivation might constitute a fundamental mechanism for adaptive past-to-present generalizations over multiple features.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) aggregates. Central to disease progression is the gradual spread of pathological alpha-syn. alpha-syn aggregation is closely linked to progressive neuron loss. As such, clearance of alpha-syn aggregates may slow the progression of PD and lead to less severe symptoms. Evidence that non-neuronal cells play a role in PD and other synucleinopathies such as Lewy body dementia and multiple system atrophy are increasing. Our previous work has shown that pericytes - vascular mural cells that regulate the blood-brain barrier - contain alpha-syn aggregates in human PD brains. Here, we demonstrate that pericytes efficiently internalise fibrillar alpha-syn irrespective of being in a monoculture or mixed neuronal cell culture. Pericytes efficiently break down alpha-syn aggregates in vitro, with clear differences in the number of alpha-syn aggregates/cell and average aggregate size when comparing five pure alpha-syn strains (Fibrils, Ribbons, fibrils65, fibrils91 and fibrils110). Furthermore, pericytes derived from PD brains have a less uniform response than those derived from control brains. Our results highlight the vital role brain vasculature may play in reducing alpha-syn burden in PD.

                N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays diverse roles in the regulation of mRNA metabolism. In the mammalian brain it has been linked to developmental processes and memory function. However, the precise role of m6A in the context synaptic plasticity and especially during impaired cognition are not fully understood. Here, we describe the mouse and human brain m6A epi-transcriptome in a tissue-specific manner. We furthermore show that m6A levels undergo a massive decrease across mouse brain regions as a consequence of aging. In addition, Alzheimer's disease in humans correlates with decreased N6-methylation in a similar population of transcripts that are linked to synaptic function and localized to synapses, such as the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). We furthermore show that reduced m6A levels impair synaptic protein-synthesis of CAMKII. Our results suggest that m6A-RNA-methylation is an important mechanism to control synaptic protein synthesis which is affected early in cognitive diseases.

                It is known that endocytosis of synaptic vesicles, and docking of these vesicles to their release sites, are regulated in a similar manner, but it has remained unclear whether the two processes are linked together mechanistically. To address this issue, we studied vesicular release during repeated trains of presynaptic action potentials. Synaptic responses decreased when the inter-train interval was shortened, indicating a gradual exhaustion of the recycling pool of vesicles, with a resting capacity of about 180 vesicles per active zone. This effect was partially counteracted by activation of a rapid recycling pathway that depended on the activation of myosin light chain kinase and that had a capacity of 200 vesicles per active zone. Vesicles arising from the rapid recycling route were preferentially docked in comparison with vesicles coming from an upstream pool, demonstrating a differential sorting of vesicles inside the readily releasable pool depending on their origin.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurometabolic timecourse of healthy aging</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The neurometabolic timecourse of healthy aging is not well-established, in part due to diversity of quantification methodology. In this study, a large structured cross-sectional cohort of male and female subjects throughout adulthood was recruited to investigate neurometabolic changes as a function of age, using consensus-recommended magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantification methods. Methods: 102 healthy volunteers, with approximately equal numbers of male and female participants in each decade of age from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, were recruited with IRB approval. MR spectroscopic data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Metabolite spectra were acquired using PRESS localization (TE = 30 ms; 96 transients) in the centrum semiovale (CSO) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Water-suppressed spectra were modeled using the Osprey algorithm, employing a basis set of 18 simulated metabolite basis functions and a cohort-mean measured macromolecular spectrum. Pearson correlations were conducted to assess relationships between metabolite concentrations and age for each voxel; paired t-tests were run to determine whether metabolite concentrations differed between the PCC and CSO. Results: Two datasets were excluded (1 ethanol; 1 unacceptably large lipid signal). Statistically significant age-by-metabolite correlations were seen for tCr (R2=0.36; p<0.001), tCho (R2=0.11; p<0.001), sI (R2=0.11; p=0.004), and mI (R2=0.10; p<0.001) in the CSO, and tCr (R2=0.15; p<0.001), tCho (R2=0.11; p<0.001), and GABA (R2=0.11; p=0.003) in the PCC. No significant correlations were seen between tNAA, NAA, GSH, Glx or Glu and age in either region (all p>0.25). Levels of sI were significantly higher in the PCC in female subjects (p<0.001) than in male subjects. There was a significant positive correlation between linewidth and age. Conclusion: The results indicated age correlations for tCho, tCr, sI, and mI in CSO and for tCr, tCho and GABA in PCC, while no age-related changes were found for NAA, tNAA, GSH, Glu or Glx. Our results provide a normative foundation for future work investigating the neurometabolic time course of healthy aging using MRS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical activity during naturalistic music listening reflects short-range predictions based on long-term experience</a></h4>

              
                Expectations shape our experience of music. However, the internal model upon which listeners form melodic expectations is still debated. Do expectations stem from Gestalt-like principles or statistical learning? If the latter, does long-term experience play an important role, or are short-term regularities sufficient? And finally, what length of context informs contextual expectations? To answer these questions, we presented human listeners with diverse naturalistic compositions from Western classical music, while recording neural activity using MEG. We quantified note-level melodic surprise and uncertainty using various computational models of music, including a state-of-the-art transformer neural network. A time-resolved regression analysis revealed that neural activity over fronto-temporal areas tracked melodic surprise particularly around 200 ms and 300-500 ms after note onset. This neural surprise response was dissociated from sensory-acoustic and adaptation effects. Neural surprise was best predicted by computational models that incorporated long-term statistical learning - rather than by simple, Gestalt-like principles. Yet, intriguingly, the surprise reflected primarily short-range musical contexts of less than ten notes. We present a full replication of our novel MEG results in an openly available EEG dataset. Together, these results elucidate the internal model that shapes melodic predictions during naturalistic music listening.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct patterns of cortical manifold expansion and contraction underlie human sensorimotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor learning is a dynamic, systems-level process that involves the combined action of multiple neural systems distributed across the brain. Although we understand a great deal about the specialized cortical systems that support specific components of action (such as reaching), we know less about how cortical systems function in a coordinated manner to facilitate adaptive behaviour. To address this gap in knowledge, our study measured human brain activity using functional MRI (fMRI) while participants performed a classic sensorimotor adaptation task, and used a manifold learning approach to describe how behavioural changes during adaptation relate to changes in the landscape of cortical activity. During early adaptation, we found that areas in parietal and premotor cortex exhibited significant contraction along the cortical manifold, which was associated with their increased covariance with regions in higher-order association cortex, including both the default mode and fronto-parietal networks. By contrast, during late adaptation, when visuomotor errors had been largely reduced, we observed a significant expansion of visual cortex along the cortical manifold, which was associated with its reduced covariance with association cortex and its increased intraconnectivity. Lastly, we found that individuals who learned more rapidly exhibited greater covariance between regions in the sensorimotor and association cortices during early adaptation. Together, these findings are consistent with a view that sensorimotor adaptation depends on changes in the integration and segregation of neural activity across more specialized regions of unimodal cortex with regions in association cortex implicated in higher-order processes. More generally, they lend support to an emerging line of evidence implicating regions of the default mode network in task-based performance.

	<p>Background: Vessel perforation during stent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a rare and disastrous complication. A routine rescue strategy includes balloon occlusion for tamponade, procedure suspension, and lowering or normalizing blood pressure. However, this complication is still associated with poor outcome and high mortality. Objective: We present our experience with intra-arterial injection of thrombin in the treatment of vessel perforation secondary to microcatheter/microwire perforation, which prevents further deterioration in clinical outcomes. Methods: Cases with intraprocedural vessel perforation during mechanical thrombectomy were included in the final analysis. Clinical data, procedural details, and radiographic and clinical outcomes were collected. Results: Four patients with intraprocedural vessel perforation were included. Intraprocedural perforations occurred at the distal middle cerebral artery in two cases: the A2 segment in one case and the internal carotid artery terminus in one case. The etiology of four cases was intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). The ruptured vessels were effectively occluded in all cases. Endovascular therapy was continued in three cases, and mTICI &amp;amp;ge; 2b recanalization was achieved in all cases. The culprit artery was kept patent on CTA for 72 h post-operation. No active bleeding was detected on follow-up CT post-operation. During the 90-day follow-up period, one patient died, modified Rankle Scare (mRS) 3 was observed in two patients, and mRS 4 was observed in one patient. Conclusions: The key benefit of this method is occluding the ruptured vessel without affecting the following MT. We propose that intra-arterial injection of prothrombin may be simple yet effective in managing vessel perforation complications during MT.</p>

	<p>Pain neuroscience education (PNE), a modern educational therapy, has been reported to be effective in pain control by reducing fear of movement. This study investigated the effects of additional PNE on a physical therapy rehabilitation protocol (PTRP) following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). In this single-blind, randomized controlled trial, 34 patients who had undergone ARCR were randomly allocated (1:1) into two groups: PNE (PTRP plus PNE) and PTRP. PTRP was performed five times a week, for four weeks, 115 min per session (physical agents, manual therapy, and exercises), and PNE was performed twice at the beginning (face-to-face PNE) and end (non-face-to-face) of the PTRP. The outcome measures were measured four times for pain intensity, pain cognition, and shoulder function; two times for a range of motion; and once for satisfaction. No significant difference in pain intensity was observed between the groups. However, in pain cognition, the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia avoidance showed a significant interaction between time and group, and PNE showed a higher effect size than PTRP in the post-test and follow-up in several variables. In conclusion, the significant improvement in avoidance in postoperative rehabilitation suggests that there is a partially positive benefit in terms of pain, range of motion, and shoulder function in ARCR patients.</p>

	<p>This paper aims to collect a compendium of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the effects of cognitively engaging physical activity (PA) interventions (basketball and floorball) on various domain-specific executive functions (EFs) in children aged 4 to 12. Following the PRISMA principle, 11 articles (total sample size: 2053) were analyzed for effect size and moderating impact with Stata 13.0 software. Overall EFs (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.32, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), updating (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and shifting (SMD=0.32, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.61, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) were enhanced by cognitively engaging PA interventions. Age and BMI were found to have no effect on overall EFs performance in Meta regression. Overall EFs performance was improved by interventions with a session length (&amp;amp;ge;35 min) (SMD = 0.30, 95 % CI 0.10 to 0.49, p = 0.033).The review suggests that despite the moderate effect sizes, cognitively engaging PA may be an effective approach to improving EFs in children aged 4 to 12, especially updating and shifting.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioma is one of the most common malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Immune infiltration of tumor microenvironment was associated with overall survival in low grade glioma (LGG). However, effects of Tyrosine phosphatase receptor type N (PTPRN) on the progress of LGG and its correlation with tumor infiltration are unclear. Methods: Here, datasets of LGG were from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and normal samples were from GTEx dataset. Gepia website and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) Database were used to analyze the mRNA and protein expression of PTPRN. We evaluated the influence of PTPRN on survival of LGG patients. MethSurv was used to explore the expression and prognostic patterns of single CpG methylation of PTPRN gene in LGG. The correlations between the clinical information and PTPRN expression were analyzed using logistic regression and Multivariate Cox regression. We also explored the correlation between PTPRN expression and cancer immune infiltration by TIMER. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was formed using TCGA RNA-seq datasets. Results: PTPRN mRNA and protein expression decreased in LGG compared to normal brain tissue in TCGA and HPA database. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression level of PTPRN correlated with a good overall survival (OS) of patients with LGG. The Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that PTPRN expression and other clinical-pathological factors (age, WHO grade, IDH status, and primary therapy outcome) significantly correlated with OS of LGG patients. The DNA methylation pattern of PTPRN with significant prognostic value were confirmed, including cg00672332, cg06971096, cg01382864, cg03970036, cg10140638, cg16166796, cg03545227, and cg25569248. Interestingly, PTPRN expression level significantly negatively correlated with infiltrating level of B cell, CD4+ T cells, Macrophages, Neutrophils, and DCs in LGG. Finally, GSEA showed that signaling pathways, mainly associated with tumor microenvironment and immune cells, were significantly enriched in PTPRN high expression. Conclusion: PTPRN is a potential biomarker and correlates with tumor immune infiltration in LGG.</p>

	<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a novel technique to stimulate the human brain through the scalp. Over the years, identifying the optimal brain region and stimulation parameters has been a subject of debate in the literature on therapeutic uses of repetitive TMS (rTMS). Nevertheless, the primary motor cortex (M1) has been a conventional target for rTMS to treat motor symptoms, such as hemiplegia and spasticity, as it controls the voluntary movement of the body. However, with an expanding knowledge base of the M1 cortical and subcortical connections, M1-rTMS has shown a therapeutic efficacy that goes beyond the conventional motor rehabilitation to involve pain, headache, fatigue, dysphagia, speech and voice impairments, sleep disorders, cognitive dysfunction, disorders of consciousness, anxiety, depression, and bladder dysfunction. In this review, we summarize the latest evidence on using M1-rTMS to treat non-motor symptoms of diverse etiologies and discuss the potential mechanistic rationale behind the management of each of these symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Comparing Surrogates to Evaluate Precisely Timed Higher-Order Spike Correlations</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The generation of surrogate data, i.e., the modification of data to destroy a certain feature, can be considered as the implementation of a null-hypothesis whenever an analytical approach is not feasible. Thus, surrogate data generation has been extensively used to assess the significance of spike correlations in parallel spike trains. In this context, one of the main challenges is to properly construct the desired null-hypothesis distribution and to avoid altering the single spike train statistics. A classical surrogate technique is uniform dithering (UD), which displaces spikes locally and uniformly distributed, to destroy temporal properties on a fine timescale while keeping them on a coarser one. Here, we compare UD against five similar surrogate techniques in the context of the detection of significant spatiotemporal spike patterns. We evaluate the surrogates for their performance, first on spike trains based on point process models with constant firing rate, and second on modeled nonstationary artificial data to assess the potential detection of false positive (FP) patterns in a more complex and realistic setting. We determine which statistical features of the spike trains are modified and to which extent. Moreover, we find that UD fails as an appropriate surrogate because it leads to a loss of spikes in the context of binning and clipping, and thus to a large number of FP patterns. The other surrogates achieve a better performance in detecting precisely timed higher-order correlations. Based on these insights, we analyze experimental data from the pre-/motor cortex of macaque monkeys during a reaching-and-grasping task.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysis of emergent patterns in crossing flows of pedestrians reveals an invariant of âstripeâ formation in human data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pratik Mullick, Sylvain Fontaine, CÃ©cile Appert-Rolland, Anne-HÃ©lÃ¨ne Olivier, William H. Warren, Julien PettrÃ©</p>

When two streams of pedestrians cross at an angle, striped patterns spontaneously emerge as a result of local pedestrian interactions. This clear case of self-organized pattern formation remains to be elucidated. In counterflows, with a crossing angle of 180Â°, alternating <i>lanes</i> of traffic are commonly observed moving in opposite directions, whereas in crossing flows at an angle of 90Â°, diagonal <i>stripes</i> have been reported. Naka (1977) hypothesized that stripe orientation is perpendicular to the bisector of the crossing angle. However, studies of crossing flows at acute and obtuse angles remain underdeveloped. We tested the bisector hypothesis in experiments on small groups (18-19 participants each) crossing at seven angles (30Â° intervals), and analyzed the geometric properties of stripes. We present two novel computational methods for analyzing striped patterns in pedestrian data: (i) an edge-cutting algorithm, which detects the dynamic formation of stripes and allows us to measure local properties of individual stripes; and (ii) a pattern-matching technique, based on the Gabor function, which allows us to estimate global properties (orientation and wavelength) of the striped pattern at a time <i>T</i>. We find an invariant property: stripes in the two groups are parallel and perpendicular to the bisector at all crossing angles. In contrast, other properties depend on the crossing angle: stripe spacing (wavelength), stripe size (number of pedestrians per stripe), and crossing time all decrease as the crossing angle increases from 30Â° to 180Â°, whereas the number of stripes increases with crossing angle. We also observe that the width of individual stripes is dynamically squeezed as the two groups cross each other. The findings thus support the bisector hypothesis at a wide range of crossing angles, although the theoretical reasons for this invariant remain unclear. The present results provide empirical constraints on theoretical studies and computational models of crossing flows.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Contextual cues are not unique for motor learning: Task-dependant switching of feedback controllers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justinas Äesonis, David W. Franklin</p>

The separation of distinct motor memories by contextual cues is a well known and well studied phenomenon of feedforward human motor control. However, there is no clear evidence of such context-induced separation in feedback control. Here we test both experimentally and computationally if context-dependent switching of feedback controllers is possible in the human motor system. Specifically, we probe visuomotor feedback responses of our human participants in two different tasksâstop and hitâand under two different schedules. The first, blocked schedule, is used to measure the behaviour of stop and hit controllers in isolation, showing that it can only be described by two independent controllers with two different sets of control gains. The second, mixed schedule, is then used to compare how such behaviour evolves when participants regularly switch from one task to the other. Our results support our hypothesis that there is contextual switching of feedback controllers, further extending the accumulating evidence of shared features between feedforward and feedback control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inference and dynamic simulation of malaria using a simple climate-driven entomological model of malaria transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Israel Ukawuba, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Given the crucial role of climate in malaria transmission, many mechanistic models of malaria represent vector biology and the parasite lifecycle as functions of climate variables in order to accurately capture malaria transmission dynamics. Lower dimension mechanistic models that utilize implicit vector dynamics have relied on indirect climate modulation of transmission processes, which compromises investigation of the ecological role played by climate in malaria transmission. In this study, we develop an implicit process-based malaria model with direct climate-mediated modulation of transmission pressure borne through the Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR). The EIR, a measure of the number of infectious bites per person per unit time, includes the effects of vector dynamics, resulting from mosquito development, survivorship, feeding activity and parasite development, all of which are moderated by climate. We combine this EIR-model framework, which is driven by rainfall and temperature, with Bayesian inference methods, and evaluate the modelâs ability to simulate local transmission across 42 regions in Rwanda over four years. Our findings indicate that the biologically-motivated, EIR-model framework is capable of accurately simulating seasonal malaria dynamics and capturing of some of the inter-annual variation in malaria incidence. However, the model unsurprisingly failed to reproduce large declines in malaria transmission during 2018 and 2019 due to elevated anti-malaria measures, which were not accounted for in the model structure. The climate-driven transmission model also captured regional variation in malaria incidence across Rwandaâs diverse climate, while identifying key entomological and epidemiological parameters important to seasonal malaria dynamics. In general, this new model construct advances the capabilities of implicitly-forced lower dimension dynamical malaria models by leveraging climate drivers of malaria ecology and transmission.

                <p>by Melanie Duc Bo Massey, Suchinta Arif, Shanukie Embuldeniya, Karma Nanglu, Joseph Bielawski</p>

Undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds (e.g., Black, Indigenous, and people of color [BIPOC], members of the Deaf community, people with disabilities, members of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community, from low-income backgrounds, or underrepresented genders) continue to face exclusion and marginalization in higher education. In this piece, authored and edited by a diverse group of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) scholars, we present 10 simple rules for succeeding as an underrepresented STEM undergraduate student, illuminating the âhidden curriculumâ of STEM specifically as it relates to the underrepresented undergraduate experience. Our rules begin by encouraging students to embrace their own distinct identities and scientific voices and explain how students can overcome challenges unique to underrepresented students throughout their undergraduate degrees. These rules are derived from a combination of our own experiences navigating our undergraduate STEM degrees and the growing body of literature on improving success for underrepresented students.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The lexical categorization model: A computational model of left ventral occipito-temporal cortex activation in visual word recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benjamin Gagl, Fabio Richlan, Philipp Ludersdorfer, Jona Sassenhagen, Susanne Eisenhauer, Klara Gregorova, Christian J. Fiebach</p>

To characterize the functional role of the left-ventral occipito-temporal cortex (lvOT) during reading in a quantitatively explicit and testable manner, we propose the <i>lexical categorization model</i> (LCM). The LCM assumes that lvOT optimizes linguistic processing by allowing fast meaning access when words are familiar and filtering out orthographic strings without meaning. The LCM successfully simulates benchmark results from functional brain imaging described in the literature. In a second evaluation, we empirically demonstrate that quantitative LCM simulations predict lvOT activation better than alternative models across three functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. We found that word-likeness, assumed as input into a lexical categorization process, is represented posteriorly to lvOT, whereas a dichotomous word/non-word output of the LCM could be localized to the downstream frontal brain regions. Finally, training the process of lexical categorization resulted in more efficient reading. In sum, we propose that word recognition in the ventral visual stream involves word-likeness extraction followed by lexical categorization before one can access word meaning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Aedes aegypti siRNA pathway mediates broad-spectrum defense against human pathogenic viruses and modulates antibacterial and antifungal defenses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuemei Dong, Shengzhang Dong, Nahid Borhani Dizaji, Natalie Rutkowski, Tyler Pohlenz, Kevin Myles, George Dimopoulos</p>

The mosquitoâs innate immune system defends against a variety of pathogens, and the conserved siRNA pathway plays a central role in the control of viral infections. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of Dicer2 (<i>Dcr2</i>) or <i>R2d2</i> resulted in an accumulation of 21-nucleotide viral sequences that was accompanied by a significant suppression of dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication, thus indicating the broad-spectrum antiviral response mediated by the siRNA pathway that can be applied for the development of novel arbovirus control strategies. Interestingly, overexpression of <i>Dcr2</i> or <i>R2d2</i> regulated the mRNA abundance of a variety of antimicrobial immune genes, pointing to additional functions of DCR2 and R2D2 as well as cross-talk between the siRNA pathway and other immune pathways. Accordingly, transgenic overexpression of <i>Dcr2</i> or <i>R2d2</i> resulted in a lesser proliferation of the midgut microbiota and increased resistance to bacterial and fungal infections.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A lifecourse mendelian randomization study highlights the long-term influence of childhood body size on later life heart structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katie OâNunain, Chloe Park, Helena Urquijo, Genevieve M. Leyden, Alun D. Hughes, George Davey Smith, Tom G. Richardson</p>

Children with obesity typically have larger left ventricular heart dimensions during adulthood. However, whether this is due to a persistent effect of adiposity extending into adulthood is challenging to disentangle due to confounding factors throughout the lifecourse. We conducted a multivariable mendelian randomization (MR) study to separate the independent effects of childhood and adult body size on 4 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of heart structure and function in the UK Biobank (UKB) study. Strong evidence of a genetically predicted effect of childhood body size on all measures of adulthood heart structure was identified, which remained robust upon accounting for adult body size using a multivariable MR framework (e.g., left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), Beta = 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23 to 0.43, <i>P</i> = 4.6 Ã 10<sup>â10</sup>). Sensitivity analyses did not suggest that other lifecourse measures of body composition were responsible for these effects. Conversely, evidence of a genetically predicted effect of childhood body size on various other MRI-based measures, such as fat percentage in the liver (Beta = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.23, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and pancreas (Beta = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.33, <i>P</i> = 3.9 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup>), attenuated upon accounting for adult body size. Our findings suggest that childhood body size has a long-term (and potentially immutable) influence on heart structure in later life. In contrast, effects of childhood body size on other measures of adulthood organ size and fat percentage evaluated in this study are likely explained by the long-term consequence of remaining overweight throughout the lifecourse.

                Hyperoside, also known as quercetin-3-O-Î²-D-galactopyranoside, belongs to the class of flavonol glycosides. Its aglycon is quercetin, and the sugar base is galactopyranoside. It is made of quercetin. The O atom at the 3rd position of the element is connected to the sugar group by a Î²-glycosidic bond. Hyperoside, which is widely present in the planted objects, such as the fruits and whole plants of Hypericaceae, Rosaceae, Campanulaceae, Lamiaceae, and Berberis spp., has received extensive attention due to its anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor, and other disease activities, as well as its protective effects on the cardiovascular system, nervous system, digestive system and immune system. While glycosides are a commonly researched topic, there are very few studies on the metabolic pathways, and its overuse and adverse reactions are rarely reported. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pharmacological research results of hyperoside, and a new perspective on the limitations of the existing research on metabolic pathways and toxicology. It provides new ideas for further research and clinical application of hyperoside.

                Background:Â eHealth makes use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve health. In the digital age, the use of eHealth applications and other health-related applications has gained popularity,Â particularlyÂ during theÂ COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, many uncertainties haveÂ arisen, causing stress andÂ affecting the mental health of many skilled workers in the digital industry, particularly in the ICT, computing, and creative media industries.Â eHealthÂ applicationsÂ haveÂ the potential to benefit people's health. As a prerequisite for effective implementation of eHealth for mental wellness (EHMW), this paper examines the acceptance of EHMW amongÂ digital workersÂ in Malaysia.Â  The objectives of this research are two-fold:Â 1) To explore the acceptance of EHMW amongÂ digital workersÂ in a localÂ Premier Digital Tech InstitutionÂ (PDTI), and 2)Â To explore how these talents' demographic profiles, mental health literacy and workplace wellness influence their acceptance of EHMW.Â Â  Methods:Â This research surveyedÂ 41Â digital workersÂ who played vital roles in providing digital skills at a tertiary education level.Â Â Â  Results:Â MostÂ respondentsÂ agreed that eHealthÂ was appropriate for managing mental wellness. Among the three eHealth domainsÂ for managing mental wellness, the acceptance level is the highest for the application domain of "interacting for health",Â with maleÂ respondentsÂ more likely to accept the use ofÂ EHMW.Â  Conclusions:Â This small-scale survey could not fully examine theÂ acceptance ofÂ eHealth andÂ itsÂ usage patterns for mental wellness amongÂ digital workersÂ in Malaysia. Future research will target moreÂ digital workersÂ in Malaysia.Â This research addresses the research gap onÂ theÂ eHealth perspectives ofÂ digital workersÂ on their acceptance,Â and the potential influence of demographic profiles, mental health literacy, and workplace wellness on EHMW's acceptance of digital health tools/platforms to promote their mental wellness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Hyperemesis gravidarum, high transaminases level and prolonged prothrombin time: is it an acute liver injury? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in the first trimester of pregnancy. It is considered a benign condition, but severe complications, fortunately rare, have been reported. Frequently, this condition is associated with a perturbed liver function tests, which remains without severe consequences. The clinical presentation may be suggestive of an acute liver injury (ALI), especially as the end of the first trimester approaches, pregnancy specific and non-specific liver diseases should be considered. Case: A 28-year-old primigravida, 14-week pregnant woman affected by hyperemesis gravidarum, developed high transaminases level and spontaneously low prothrombin time (PT) ratio. An ALI was suspected as transaminases were very high and our patient was at the end of the first trimester. An exhaustive etiological work-up was negative. In the second line, the factor V assay was conducted, which showed a normal activity, and the vitamin K level was low. We therefore concluded that it was hyperhemesis gravidarum complicated by fluid and electrolyte disorders and vitamin K deficiency. She had parenteral rehydration and a proton pump inhibitor. She received intravenous vitamin K 10 mg daily for three days. The outcome was excellent without any maternal or fetal impact. Conclusion: Hyperhemesis gravidarum is a common condition in the first trimester of pregnancy that usually has a favourable outcome. However, it is important to be attentive to possible complications, including vitamin K deficiency with its maternal and fetal consequences.Â  On the other hand, in case of major disturbance of the liver function tests, we should not overlook acute liver injury and should not hesitate to initiate an adequate etilogical investigation.

                Gene symbols are recognizable identifiers for gene names but are unstable and error-prone due to aliasing, manual entry, and unintentional conversion by spreadsheets to date format. Official gene symbol resources such as HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for human genes and the Mouse Genome Informatics project (MGI) for mouse genes provide authoritative sources of valid, aliased, and outdated symbols, but lack a programmatic interface and correction of symbols converted by spreadsheets. We present HGNChelper, an R package that identifies known aliases and outdated gene symbols based on the HGNC human and MGI mouse gene symbol databases, in addition to common mislabeling introduced by spreadsheets, and provides corrections where possible. HGNChelper identified invalid gene symbols in the most recent Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB 7.0) and in platform annotation files of the Gene Expression Omnibus, with prevalence ranging from ~3% in recent platforms to 30-40% in the earliest platforms from 2002-03. HGNChelper is installable from CRAN.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Space environment provides many challenges to pilots, astronauts, and space scientists, which are constantly subjected to unique conditions, including microgravity, radiations, hypoxic condition, absence of the day and night cycle, etc. These stressful stimuli have the potential to affect many human physiological systems, triggering physical and biological adaptive changes to re-establish the homeostatic state. A particular concern regards the risks for the effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system (CNS), as several lines of evidence reported a great impact on neuroplasticity, cognitive functions, neurovestibular system, short-term memory, cephalic fluid shift, reduction in motor function, and psychological disturbances, especially during long-term missions. Aside these potential detrimental effects, the other side of the coin reflects the potential benefit of applicating space-related conditions on Earth-based life sciences, as cancer research. Here, we focused on examining the effect of real and simulated microgravity on CNS functions, both in humans and in cellular models, browsing the different techniques to experience or mime microgravity on-ground. Increasing evidence demonstrate that cancer cells, and brain cancer cells in particular, are negatively affected by microgravity, in terms of alteration in cell morphology, proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis, representing an advancing novel side of space-based investigations. Overall, deeper understandings about the mechanisms by which space environment influences CNS and tumor biology may be promisingly translated into many clinical fields, ranging from aerospace medicine to neuroscience and oncology, representing an enormous pool of knowledge for the implementation of countermeasures and therapeutic applications.</p>

     alt="Effects of 4-month running exercise on the spatial learning ability and white matter volume and microvessels of middle-aged female and male rats"/>
<p>A comprehensive analysis of the effects of 4 months treadmill running on spatial learning ability, white matter volume and the microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged rats revealed actual benefits of exercise at the brain aging of middle-aged female and male rats. This report showed that there were sex differences in the protective effects of the 4-month exercise protocol on spatial learning and white matter volume. 4 months of exercise can protect the microvessels in the white matter of middle-aged rats.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Age-related degeneration of microvessels is known to occur in white matter, and exercise training can enhance brain function and promote cerebral blood flow. However, the effects of exercise training on microvessels in aged white matter are unknown. Forty-one middle-aged male and female SpragueâDawley rats were randomly divided into a sedentary group and an exercised group. The rats in the exercised group were made to run on treadmills for 4 months. The spatial learning capacities of all groups were then assessed with the Morris water maze. White matter and its microvessels were investigated using immunohistological techniques and stereological methods. In the exercised group, females but not males, showed improved performance over time in the Morris water maze. In females but not males, the exercised rats showed significantly increased white matter volume compared with that of sedentary rats. The total length of microvessels in the white matter in the exercised group was significantly increased compared with that in the sedentary group in both males and females, but the total volume and total surface area of microvessels in the white matter did not differ significantly between the sedentary and exercised rats. Regular treadmill exercise had protective effects on spatial learning capacity, white matter volume, and the total length of microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged female rats and on the total length of microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged male rats. The results obtained might increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise delays brain aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neural consequences of chronic sleep disruption</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies in both humans and animal models call into question the completeness of recovery after chronic sleep disruption. Studies in humans have identified cognitive domains particularly vulnerable to delayed or incomplete recovery after chronic sleep disruption, including sustained vigilance and episodic memory. These findings, in turn, provide a focus for animal model studies to critically test the lasting impact of sleep loss on the brain. Here, we summarize the human response to sleep disruption and then discuss recent findings in animal models examining recovery responses in circuits pertinent to vigilance and memory.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Heavy isotope labeling and mass spectrometry reveal unexpected remodeling of bacterial cell wall expansion in response to drugs</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotics of the Î²-lactam (penicillin) family inactivate target enzymes called D,D-transpeptidases or penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that catalyze the last cross-linking step of peptidoglycan synthesis. The resulting net-like macromolecule is the essential component of bacterial cell walls that sustains the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, bypass of PBPs by the YcbB L,D-transpeptidase leads to resistance to these drugs. We developed a new method based on heavy isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to elucidate PBP- and YcbB-mediated peptidoglycan polymerization. PBPs and YcbB similarly participated in single-strand insertion of glycan chains into the expanding bacterial side wall. This absence of any transpeptidase-specific signature suggests that the peptidoglycan expansion mode is determined by other components of polymerization complexes. YcbB did mediate Î²-lactam resistance by insertion of multiple strands that were exclusively cross-linked to existing tripeptide-containing acceptors. We propose that this undocumented mode of polymerization depends upon accumulation of linear glycan chains due to PBP inactivation,  formation of tripeptides due to cleavage of existing cross-links by a Î²-lactam-insensitive endopeptidase, and concerted cross-linking by YcbB.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hypoxia controls plasma membrane targeting of polarity proteins by dynamic turnover of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2</a></h4>

              
                Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) are key phosphoinositides that determine the identity of the plasma membrane (PM) and regulate numerous key biological events there. To date, mechanisms regulating the homeostasis and dynamic turnover of PM PI4P and PIP2 in response to various physiological conditions and stresses remain to be fully elucidated. Here we report that hypoxia in <i>Drosophila</i> induces acute and reversible depletion of PM PI4P and PIP2 that severely disrupts the electrostatic PM targeting of multiple polybasic polarity proteins. Genetically encoded ATP sensors confirmed that hypoxia induces acute and reversible reduction of cellular ATP levels which showed a strong real-time correlation with the levels of PM PI4P and PIP2 in cultured cells. By combining genetic manipulations with quantitative imaging assays we showed that PI4KIIIÎ±, as well as Rbo/EFR3 and TTC7 that are essential for targeting PI4KIIIÎ± to PM, are required for maintaining the homeostasis and dynamic turnover of PM PI4P and PIP2 under normoxia and hypoxia. Our results revealed that in cells challenged by energetic stresses triggered by hypoxia, ATP inhibition and possibly ischemia, dramatic turnover of PM PI4P and PIP2 could have profound impact on many cellular processes including electrostatic PM targeting of numerous polybasic proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Towards a unified model of naive T cell dynamics across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Naive CD4 and CD8 T cells are cornerstones of adaptive immunity, but the dynamics of their establishment early in life and how their kinetics change as they mature following release from the thymus are poorly understood. Further, due to the diverse signals implicated in naive T cell survival, it has been a long-held and conceptually attractive view that they are sustained by active homeostatic control as thymic activity wanes. Here we employ multiple experimental systems to identify a unified model of naive CD4 and CD8 T cell population dynamics in mice, across their lifespan. We infer that both subsets divide rarely and progressively increase their survival capacity with cell age. Strikingly, this simple model is able to describe naive CD4 T cell dynamics throughout life. In contrast, we find that newly generated naive CD8 T cells are lost more rapidly during the first 3-4 weeks of life, likely due to increased recruitment into memory. We find no evidence for elevated division rates in neonates, or for feedback regulation of naive T cell numbers at any age. We show how confronting mathematical models with diverse datasets can reveal a quantitative and remarkably simple picture of naive T cell dynamics in mice from birth into old age.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamic spreading of chromatin-mediated gene silencing and reactivation between neighboring genes in single cells</a></h4>

              
                In mammalian cells genes that are in close proximity can be transcriptionally coupled: silencing or activating one gene can affect its neighbors. Understanding these dynamics is important for natural processes, such as heterochromatin spreading during development and aging, and when designing synthetic gene regulation circuits. Here, we systematically dissect this process in single cells by recruiting and releasing repressive chromatin regulators at dual-gene synthetic reporters, and measuring how fast gene silencing and reactivation spread as a function of intergenic distance and configuration of insulator elements. We find that silencing by KRAB, associated with histone methylation, spreads between two genes within hours, with a time delay that increases with distance. This fast KRAB-mediated spreading is not blocked by the classical cHS4 insulators. Silencing by histone deacetylase HDAC4 of the upstream gene can also facilitate background silencing of the downstream gene by PRC2, but with a days-long delay that does not change with distance. This slower silencing can sometimes be stopped by insulators. Gene reactivation of neighboring genes is also coupled, with strong promoters and insulators determining the order of reactivation. Our data can be described by a model of multi-gene regulation that builds upon previous knowledge of heterochromatin spreading, where both gene silencing and gene reactivation can act at a distance, allowing for coordinated dynamics via chromatin regulator recruitment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Serine Racemase mediates Subventricular Zone Neurogenesis via Fatty acid Metabolism.</a></h4>

              
                The adult subventricular zone is one of the two neurogenic niches that continuously produce newborn neurons. Here we show that serine racemase (SR), an enzyme that catalyzes the racemization of L-serine to D-serine and vice versa, affects neurogenesis in the adult SVZ by controlling de novo fatty acid synthesis. Complete and conditional deletion of SR in nestin precursor cells lead to diminished neurogenesis in the SVZ. Nestin-cre+ mice showed reduced expression of fatty acid synthase and its substrate malonyl CoA, which are involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis. Global lipidomic analyses revealed significant alterations in lipid subclasses in nestin-cre+ mice. Decrease in fatty acid synthesis was mediated by phospho acetyl CoA carboxylase that was AMPK independent. Both L and D serine treatment rescued defects in SVZ neurogenesis, proliferation and levels of malonyl CoA in vitro. Our work shows that SR affects adult neurogenesis in the SVZ via lipid metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multi-level account of hippocampal function from behaviour to neurons</a></h4>

              
                A complete neuroscience requires multi-level theories that address phenomena ranging from higher-level cognitive behaviors to activities within a cell. A levels-of-mechanism approach that decomposes a higher-level model of cognition and behavior into component mechanisms provides a coherent and richer understanding of the system than any level alone. Toward this end, we decomposed a cognitive model into neuron-like units using a neural flocking approach that parallels recurrent hippocampal activity. Neural flocking coordinates units that collectively form higher-level mental constructs. The decomposed model suggested how brain-scale neural populations coordinate to form assemblies encoding concept and spatial representations, and why so many neurons are needed for robust performance at the cognitive level. This multilevel explanation provides a way to understand how cognition and symbol-like representations are supported by coordinated neural populations (assemblies) formed through learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related learning and working memory impairment in the common marmoset</a></h4>

              
                Aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, yet we still do not understand how the aging process leads to pathological vulnerability. The research community has relied heavily on mouse models, but the considerable anatomical, physiological, and cognitive differences between mice and humans limit their translational relevance. Ultimately, these barriers necessitate the development of novel aging models. As a non-human primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) shares many features in common with humans and yet has a significantly shorter lifespan (10 years) than other primates, making it ideally suited to longitudinal studies of aging. Our objective was to evaluate the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment. To do this, we utilized the Delayed Recognition Span Task (DRST) to characterize age-related changes in working memory capacity in a cohort of sixteen marmosets varying in age from young adult to geriatric. These monkeys performed thousands of trials over periods of time ranging up to 50 percent of their adult lifespan. To our knowledge, this represents the most thorough cognitive profiling of any marmoset aging study conducted to-date. By analyzing individual learning curves, we found that aged animals exhibited delayed onset of learning, slowed learning rate after onset, and decreased asymptotic working memory performance. These findings are not accounted for by age-related impairments in motor speed and motivation. This work firmly establishes the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment.

Significance StatementUnderstanding the normal aging process is fundamental to identifying therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases for which aging is the biggest risk factor. Historically, the aging field has relied on animal models that differ markedly from humans, constraining translatability. Here, we firmly establish a short-lived non-human primate, the common marmoset, as a key model of age-related cognitive impairment. We demonstrate, through continuous testing over a substantial portion of the adult marmoset lifespan, that aging is associated with both impaired learning and working memory capacity, unaccounted for by age-related changes in motor speed and motivation. Characterizing individual cognitive aging trajectories reveals inherent heterogeneity, which could lead to earlier identification of the onset of impairment, and extended timelines during which therapeutics are effective.

                Empirical and computational methods were combined to examine whether individual or dual-drug treatments can restore the deficit in long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse observed in a molecular model of Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS). The model was produced by pharmacological inhibition of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) activity. Simultaneous treatment with an activator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform ERK and an activator of protein kinase A (PKA) resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of RSK and LTF to a greater extent than either drug alone and greater than their additive effects. Indeed, the combined drugs exerted synergistic effects on both RSK activation and LTF, fully restoring RSK phosphorylation and LTF. The extent of synergism appeared to depend on another MAPK isoform, p38 MAPK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK facilitated serotonin (5-HT)-induced RSK phosphorylation, indicating that p38 MAPK inhibits activation of RSK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK combined with activation of PKA synergistically activated RSK.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uncovering features of synapses in primary visual cortex through contrastive representation learning</a></h4>

              
                3D EM connectomics image volumes are now surpassing sizes of 1 mm3, and are therefore beginning to contain multiple meaningful spatial scales of brain circuitry simultaneously. However, the sheer density of information in such datasets makes the development of unbiased, scalable machine learning techniques a necessity for extracting novel insights without extremely time-consuming, intensive labor. In this paper, we present SynapseCLR, a self-supervised contrastive representation learning method for 3D electron microscopy (EM) data, and use the method to extract feature representations of synapses from a 3D EM dataset from mouse visual cortex. We show that our representations separate synapses according to both their overall physical appearance and structural annotations of known functional importance. We further demonstrate the utility of our methodology for several valuable downstream tasks for the growing field of 3D EM connectomics. These include one-shot identification of defective synapse segmentations, dataset-wide similarity-based querying, and accurate imputation of annotations for unlabeled synapses, using only manual annotation of 0.2% of synapses in the dataset. In particular, we show that excitatory vs. inhibitory neuronal cell types can be assigned to individual synapses and highly truncated neurites with accuracy exceeding 99.8%, making this population accessible to connectomics analysis. Finally, we present a data-driven and unsupervised study of the manifold of synaptic structural variation, revealing its intrinsic axes of variation and showing that synapse structure is also strongly correlated with inhibitory neuronal subtypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Measures of Implicit and Explicit Adaptation Do Not Linearly Add</a></h4>

              
                Both implicit (unconscious, automatic) and explicit (effortful, strategic) processes contribute to various kinds of learning1, including visuomotor adaptation2-4. Implicit adaptation may be capped at some level5, regardless of the level of explicit adaptation, or implicit and explicit adaptation could be linearly added in total adaptation6,7. Both appear well accepted, but ironically contradict each other. In the latter case, the equation used is simple: O_FD O_INLINEFIG[Formula 1]C_INLINEFIGM_FD(1)C_FD

Which is used to "predict" that implicit adaptation is perfectly anti-correlated with explicit adaptation: O_FD O_INLINEFIG[Formula 2]C_INLINEFIGM_FD(2)C_FD

This derived implicit adaptation is sometimes further analyzed8-10. But the underlying additivity assumption is not always replicated11 and is considered the "least robust" assumption in motor adaptation12. Here we directly test the additivity assumption, particularly how well it predicts implicit adaptation. We find that the relationship between explicit and implicit adaptation is not additive but more complicated and very noisy, which means that future studies should measure both implicit and explicit adaptation directly. It also highlights a challenge to the field to disentangle how various motor adaptation processes combine when producing movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Poor decision-makers motivation, working memory performance, and repartition across two rat inbred strains</a></h4>

              
                A minority of healthy individuals exhibit a combination of behavioral traits reminiscent, at least in part, of addiction and predicting poor decision-making (DM), namely motor impulsivity, inflexibility, risk-taking, and higher motivation in Wistar Han rats. Two behavioral features, motivation and working memory, play a role in DM capacities although the precise relationship is not entirely known. Additionally, we previously reported that neurotransmitters e.g., dopamine -modulation was tightly linked to poor DM. The goal of the study was to investigate the detailed motivational functions involved in poor DM including saccharin intake and reward-seeking/incentive behaviors under different internal states i.e., ad libitum or food-deprived. Maze-based spatial working memory was also evaluated. Moreover, two rat inbred strains, Lewis and Fisher 344 (F344) rats, known for modeling vulnerability to drug addiction and affected by substantial variations in the mesolimbic dopaminergic route, were run in the decision-making task (Rat Gambling Task, RGT). We found that Wistar Han poor decision-makers (NPERF) display higher saccharin intake levels and a drastic increased reward-seeking behavior on a fixed schedule. NPERF were not more sensitive to the internal state in responding to saccharin delivery in fixed and progressive schedules. A few relationships were found within motivation functions, and with DM, that is a positive correlation between saccharin intake and reward-seeking behavior, and two negative correlations between saccharin intake; reward-seeking, and DM. NPERF were significantly not impaired in working memory. Lewis and F344 rats performed fewer nose-pokes visits during the RGT compared to Wistar Han rats, and improved performance early in the task. A higher proportion of NPERF was observed in Lewis as compared to F344 rats. Altogether, these findings complete the preclinical panel of behavioral functions that relate to poor decision-making and extend a presumed role of dopamine in such processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conscientiousness associated with efficiency of the salience/ventral attention network: Replication in three samples using individualized parcellation</a></h4>

              
                Previous research in the field of personality neuroscience has identified associations of conscientiousness and related constructs like impulsivity and self-control with structural and functional properties of particular regions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula. Network- based conceptions of brain function suggest that these regions probably belong to a single large- scale network, labeled the salience/ventral attention network (SVAN). The current study tested associations between conscientiousness and resting-state functional connectivity in this network using two community samples (N = 244 and 239) and data from the Human Connectome Project (N = 1000). Individualized parcellation was used to improve the accuracy of functional localization and to facilitate replication. Functional connectivity was measured using an index of network efficiency, a graph theoretical measure quantifying the capacity for parallel information transfer within a network. Efficiency of a set of parcels in the SVAN was significantly associated with conscientiousness in all samples. Findings are consistent with a theory of conscientiousness as a function of variation in neural networks underlying effective prioritization of goals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Discovery of synapse-specific RNA N6-methyladenosine readers associated with the consolidation of fear extinction memory</a></h4>

              
                The RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is critically involved in the regulation of gene activity underlying experience-dependent plasticity, and is necessary for the functional interplay between RNA and RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in the nucleus. However, the complete repertoire of m6A-modified RNA interacting RBPs in the synaptic compartment, and whether they are involved in fear extinction, have yet to be revealed. Using RNA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, we discovered 12 novel, synapsespecific, learning-induced m6A readers in the medial prefrontal cortex of male C57/B6 mice. m6A RNA-sequencing also revealed a unique population of learning-related m6A-modified RNAs at the synapse, which includes a variant of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1). m6A-modified Malat1 binds to a subset of novel m6A readers, including cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) and dihydropyrimidase-related protein 2 (DPYSL2) and a cell-type-specific, state-dependent, and synapse-specific reduction in m6A-modified Malat1 disrupts the interaction between Malat1 and DPYSL2 and impairs fear extinction. The consolidation of fear-extinction memory therefore relies on an interaction between m6A-modified Malat1 and select RBPs in the synaptic compartment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust enhancement of motor sequence learning with 4mA transcranial electric stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: Motor learning experiments with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at 2mA have produced mixed results. We hypothesize that tDCS will boost motor learning provided sufficiently high field intensity on the motor cortex. Methods: In a single-blinded, between-subject design, 72 healthy right-handed participants received either anodal or cathodal tDCS at 4mA while they learned to perform a sequence of key presses using their non-dominant hand for about 12 minutes. Cathodal stimulation served as an active control for sensation. A separate sham-stimulation group established baseline performance. Gains during practice and rest periods were analyzed (called micro-online and -offline learning). The target for stimulation was identified on the motor cortex using fMRI. After optimization with individual current flow models, we selected a single montage for all 108 participants with 4 frontal and 4 parietal electrodes each drawing 1mA. Results: We found significant gains in performance with anodal stimulation (Cohen's d=0.7). The boost in performance persisted for at least one hour. Subsequent learning for a new sequence and the opposite hand also improved. Concurrent tDCS enhanced micro-offline learning, while subsequent learning relied on micro-online gains. Sensation ratings were comparable in the active groups and did not exceed moderate levels. The new electrode montage achieved a better tradeoff between stimulation intensity and sensations on the scalp as compared to alternative montages. Conclusion: The present paradigm shows reliable behavioral effects at 4mA and is well-tolerated. It may serve as a go-to experiment for future studies on motor learning and tDCS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An ecological investigation of the capacity to follow simultaneous speech and preferential detection of ones' own name</a></h4>

              
                Many situations require focusing attention on one speaker, while monitoring the environment for potentially important information. Some have proposed that dividing attention among two speakers involves behavioral tradeoffs, due to limited cognitive resources. However the severity of these tradeoffs, particularly under ecologically-valid circumstances, is not well understood. We investigated the capacity to process simultaneous speech using a dual-task paradigm simulating task demands and stimuli encountered in real-life. Participants listened to conversational narratives (Narrative Stream) and monitored a stream of announcements (Barista Stream), to detect when their order was called. We measured participants' performance, neural activity and skin conductance as they engaged in this dual-task. Participants achieved extremely high dual-task accuracy, with no apparent behavioral tradeoffs. Moreover, robust neural and physiological responses were observed for target-stimuli in the Barista Stream, alongside significant neural speech-tracking of the Narrative Stream. These results suggest that humans have substantial capacity to process simultaneous speech and do not suffer from insufficient processing resources, at least for this highly ecological task-combination and level of perceptual load. Results also confirmed the ecological validity of the advantage for detecting ones' own name at the behavioral, neural and physiological level, highlighting the contribution of personal relevance when processing simultaneous speech.

                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with progressive cognitive deficits and mood disorders (Knopman et al., 2021). Recent studies have associated AD pathology with the impairment of adult neurogenesis, as indicated by impaired neural stem cell (NSCs) homeostasis (Bond et al., 2015). Recent work has further associated AD progression with a decline in the number and maturation of adult-born neurons in the SGZ, distinct from typical age-related decline (Moreno-Jimenez et al., 2019). In 3xTG-AD mice, a well-established mouse model of AD, our and other groups have demonstrated impairments to NSC pool and neural progenitor proliferation, as well as adult-born neurons, before the onset of A{beta} plaques and NFTs (Hamilton et al., 2010, 2015; Rodr[l]guez; et al., 2008, 2009). However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the functional impairment of adult NSCs remain to be resolved. Here, we employ single-cell RNA-Seq to establish population-specific defects in the 3xTG-AD mouse model during adult SGZ neurogenesis. Relative to control mice, we observe a dramatic AD-induced decrease in the primed and activated NSC population, which results in a progressive loss of cells committed to neurogenesis. Transcriptome measurements suggest that 3xTG-AD NSCs and their progeny represent enhanced ribosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis, and disturbed Notch signaling pathway. RNA velocity analysis reveals reduced NSC activation as evidenced by a large fraction of Ascl1-postive cells, instead of entering cell cycle, returning to the primed and quiescent state. This is further supported by reduced numbers of Lpar1-expressing cells, a marker of neural progenitor cells, in the SGZ. Our work explores, at a stage-specific resolution, changes in the regulatory networks guiding adult neurogenesis, and identifies niche disturbances in the regulation of NSC quiescence and activation. These NSC deficits underlying impaired neurogenesis identified in AD mice, may be key contributors underlying the compromised hippocampal function in AD.

                hnRNP R (Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins R) is one member of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in hnRNP family, it plays important role in nucleic acid metabolism including alternative splicing, mRNA stabilization, transcriptional and translational regulation, and mRNA transport. Mostly hnRNP R is localized in nuclear and extensively binds with RNA and chromatin, but still some part of it exports to cytosol. We found that long and short isoform hnRNP R can located in stress granules, depletion hnRNP R can facilitate the stress granule formation and accelerate mRNA in the stress granules. Meanwhile we found that depletion hnRNP R can alter the stress granule phenotype and impair stress granule resolving. Additionally, we also found that depletion hnRNP R also induce TDP43 granules formation. Furthermore, depletion hnRNP R can impair TDP43 binding with ribosome. Altogether, hnRNP R plays important role in the stress granule formation.

                Iron deficiency during the fetal-neonatal period results in long-term neurodevelopmental impairments associated with pervasive and widespread hippocampal gene dysregulation. Globally, fetal-neonatal iron deficiency produces both long-term activation and repression of hundreds of loci in the adult rat hippocampus. Prenatal choline (a methyl donor) supplementation can partially reverse these effects, suggesting an interaction between iron and choline in regulating the hippocampal transcriptome. To gain insights into the underlying epigenetic signatures, we integrate hippocampal transcriptomes and epigenetic marks of active (transposase accessible chromatin/ATAC) and repressed (H3K9me3 enrichment) genes in adult rats that had been exposed to fetal-neonatal iron deficiency with or without prenatal choline supplementation. Rats were made iron-deficient during fetal and neonatal period by limiting maternal iron intake from gestational day (G) 2 through postnatal day (P) 7. Choline (5.5 g/kg) was given to half of the pregnant dams during G11-18. This paradigm produced four comparison groups (Iron-sufficient [IS], Iron-deficient [ID], IS+choline [ISch], and ID+choline [IDch]). Hippocampi were collected from P65 males and analyzed for changes in chromatin conformation and histone H3K9me3 enrichment. ATAC-seq results accounted for 22% and 24%, whereas H3K9me3 enrichment accounted for 1.7% and 13% of differences in ID- and IDch-altered gene expression. These epigenetic changes were annotated onto gene networks regulating synaptic structure and plasticity, neuroinflammation, and reward circuits. The low correlation between gene dysregulation and changes in ATAC or H3K9me3 signatures indicate involvements of other epigenetic modifications. This study provides a genome-wide findings of stable epigenetic changes and lays a foundation for further analyses to elucidate more fully iron-dependent epigenetic mechanisms that underlie iron deficiency, choline supplementation, and their interactions in mediating long-term neural gene dysregulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental history modulates adult olfactory behavioral preferences via regulation of chemoreceptor expression in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Developmental experiences play critical roles in shaping adult physiology and behavior. We and others previously showed that adult C. elegans which transiently experienced dauer arrest during development (PD: post-dauer) exhibit distinct gene expression profiles as compared to control adults which bypassed the dauer stage. In particular, the expression patterns of subsets of chemoreceptor genes are markedly altered in PD adults. Whether altered chemoreceptor levels drive behavioral plasticity in PD adults is unknown. Here we show that PD adults exhibit enhanced attraction to a panel of food-related attractive volatile odorants including the bacterially-produced chemical diacetyl. Diacetyl-evoked responses in the AWA olfactory neuron pair are increased in both dauer larvae and PD adults, and we find that these increased responses are correlated with upregulation of the diacetyl receptor ODR-10 in AWA likely via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. We show that transcriptional upregulation of odr-10 expression in dauer larvae is in part mediated by the DAF-16 FOXO transcription factor. Via transcriptional profiling of sorted populations of AWA neurons from control and PD adults, we further show that the expression of a subset of additional chemoreceptor genes in AWA is regulated similarly to odr-10 in PD animals. Our results suggest that developmental experiences may be encoded at the level of olfactory receptor regulation, and provide a simple mechanism by which C. elegans is able to precisely modulate its behavioral preferences as a function of its current and past experiences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating mouse motor coordination using quantitative trait locus analysis to model the genetic underpinnings of developmental coordination disorder</a></h4>

              
                The fundamental skills for motor coordination and motor control emerge through development, from infancy to late childhood years. Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) lead to impaired acquisition of motor skills. This study investigated motor behaviors that reflect the core symptoms of human DCD through the use of BXD recombinant inbred lines of mice that are known to have divergent phenotypes in many behavioral traits, including motor activity. We sought to correlate behavior in basic motor control tasks with the known genotypes of these reference populations of mice using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. We used twelve BXD lines with an average of 16 mice per group to assess the onset of reflexes during the early neonatal stage of life and differences in motor coordination using the open field, rotarod, and gait analyses during the adolescent/young adulthood period. Results indicated significant variability between lines in as to when neonatal reflexes appeared as well as significant line differences for all measures of motor coordination. Five lines (BXD15, BXD27, BXD28, BXD75, and BXD86) struggled with sensorimotor coordination as seen in gait analysis, rotarod, and open field, similar to human presentation of DCD. We identified three significant quantitative trait loci for gait on proximal Chr 3, Chr 4 and distal Chr 6. Based on expression, function, and polymorphism within the mapped QTL intervals, 7 candidate genes (Gpr63, Spata5, Trpc3, Cntn6, Chl1, Grm7 and Ogg1) emerged. This study offers new insights into mouse motor behavior which promises to be a first murine model to explore the genetics and neural correlates of DCD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of data quantity on performance of temporal response function analyses of natural speech processing</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, temporal response function (TRF) analyses of non-invasive recordings of neural activity evoked by continuous naturalistic stimuli have become increasingly popular for characterizing response properties within the auditory hierarchy. However, despite this rise in TRF usage, relatively few educational resources for these tools exist. Here we use a dual-talker continuous speech paradigm to demonstrate how a key parameter of experimental design, the quantity of acquired data, influences TRF analyses fit to either individual data (subject-specific analyses), or group data (generic analyses). We show that although model performance monotonically increases with data quantity, the amount of data required to achieve significant prediction accuracies can vary substantially based on whether the fitted model contains densely (e.g., acoustic envelope) or sparsely (e.g., lexical surprisal) spaced features, especially when the goal of the analyses is to capture the aspect of neural responses that co-vary with the amplitude of the modelled features. Moreover, we demonstrate that generic models can exhibit high performance on small amounts of test data (4-8 min), as long as they are trained on a sufficiently large data set. As such, they may be particularly useful for clinical and multi-task study designs. Finally, we show that the regularization procedure used in fitting TRF models can interact with the quantity of data used to fit the models, with larger training quantities resulting in systematically larger TRF amplitudes. Together, demonstrations in this work should aid the learning process of new users of TRF analyses, and in combination with other tools, such as piloting and power analyses, may serve as a detailed reference for choosing acquisition duration in future studies.

                Little is known about how exposure to limited socioeconomic resources (SER) in childhood gets "under the skin" to shape brain development, especially using rigorous whole-brain multivariate methods in large, adequately powered samples. The present study examined resting state functional connectivity patterns from 5,821 youth in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, employing multivariate methods across three levels: whole-brain, network-wise, and connection-wise. Across all three levels, SER was associated with widespread alterations across the connectome. We found that parental education was the primary driver of neural effects of SER, with notable concentrations in somatosensory and subcortical regions. Moreover, parental education associations with the developing connectome were partially accounted for by home enrichment activities, child's cognitive abilities, and child's grades, indicating interwoven links between parental education, child stimulation, and child cognitive performance. These results add a new data-driven, multivariate perspective on links between household SER and the child's developing functional connectome.

                Astrocytes exhibit regional heterogeneity in morphology, function and molecular composition to support and modulate neuronal function and signaling in a region-specific manner. To characterize regional heterogeneity of astrocytic proteomes of different brain regions we established an Aldh1l1-MetRSL274G mouse line that allows cell-type specific labeling of newly synthesized proteins in vivo and analyzed astrocytic proteins from four different brain regions by mass spectrometry. Identified proteins are specific for astrocytes and show a high overlap with proteins compiled in AstroProt, a newly established database for astrocytic proteins. Gene enrichment analysis reveals high overlap among brain regions, and only subtle changes in abundances of key astrocytic proteins for hippocampus, cortex and striatum. However, the cerebellar proteome stands out with proteins being associated with calcium signaling or bipolar disorder. Subregional differences of translation dynamics in single hippocampal astrocytes indicates distinct subregional heterogeneity and highlights the applicability of our toolbox to study dynamic astrocytic proteomes in vivo.

                While action language and motor imagery both engage the motor system, determining whether these two processes indeed share the same motor representations would contribute to better understanding their underlying mechanisms. We conducted two experiments probing the mutual influence of these two processes. In Exp.1, hand-action verbs were presented subliminally, and participants (n=36) selected the verb they thought they perceived from two alternatives. When congruent actions were imagined prior to this task, accuracy significantly increased, i.e. participants were better able to "see" the subliminal verbs. In Exp.2, participants (n=19) imagined hand flexion or extension, while corticospinal excitability was measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation. Corticospinal excitability was modulated by action verbs subliminally presented prior to imagery. Specifically, the typical increase observed during imagery was suppressed after presentation of incongruent action verbs. This mutual influence of action language and motor imagery, both at behavioral and neurophysiological levels, suggests overlapping motor representations.

                The hippocampal CA3 subregion is a densely connected recurrent circuit that supports memory consolidation and retrieval by generating and storing sequential neuronal activity patterns that reflect recent experience. The encoding of precise temporal firing patterns in CA3 ensembles during awake-behavior is supported by phase precession, in which spike timing shifts with reference to local theta oscillations that are prominent in the hippocampus during active learning. Although phase precession is thought to be critical for generating sequential activity during memory encoding, the circuit mechanisms that support this computation across hippocampal subregions are unknown. By assessing CA3 network activity in the absence of each of its theta modulated excitatory inputs, the dentate gyrus (DG) and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), we show necessary and unique contributions of each region to phase precession. DG inputs to the CA3 circuit are essential for organizing the temporal order of neuronal firing by promoting the expression of prospective "look-ahead" sequential spiking during theta states. In contrast, MEC inputs to CA3 modulate the gain of excitation and increase the precision of phase precession, but are not necessary for generating the temporally ordered activity of CA3 neurons. We propose a simple computational model that accounts for the empirical findings by proposing different effects of each of the feedforward pathways on inhibitory subnetworks. DG inputs affect the phase and MEC inputs affect the amplitude of the inhibitory theta signal. Our results thus describe circuit mechanisms that are required for the generation of sequence coding in the CA3 recurrent circuit.

We show that the neural computation of attentional pop-out is embedded in the earliest cortical sensory response, seemingly void of feedback from higher-level areas. We measured synaptic and spiking activity across cortical columns in mid-level area V4 of monkeys searching for an attention-grabbing stimulus. Indexed by reaction times and behavioral accuracy, attention was captured at variable times. This moment of attentional capture occurred within the earliest feedforward response, both in terms of timing and spatial location. Moreover, the magnitude of the earliest sensory response predicted reaction times. Crucially, errant attentional selection and consequent behavior was associated with errant selection in sensory cortex. Together, these findings demonstrate a dominant role for feedforward activation of sensory cortex for dictating attentional priority and subsequent behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effect of level of autistic traits on motion inspection time performance in centre-surround suppression tasks</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms underlying visual anomalies observed in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), presenting in the form of impaired global visual perception and enhanced local perception have long been debated. Researchers have sought to investigate the phenomenon of surround suppression, the inhibitory mechanism responsible for filtering visual noise in high contrast stimuli of increasing size. Mixed results have shown impaired gain control reduces surround suppression allowing for improved motion inspection in certain conditions, along with the possibility that receptive field size and population varies among the ASD population producing size-specific alteration in motion inspection. The present study aims to investigate whether the level of autistic traits predicts motion inspection time performance in a random dot kinetogram (RDK), a function of stimulus size and contrast. A total of 12 typically developing (TD) participants were screened and grouped by AQ score to indicate level of autistic traits (low, medium and high). Results revealed that the high AQ groups motion inspection time significantly outperformed the mid AQ group for small and large central RDK of low contrast. This result suggests an interaction between temporal and spatial processing may have masked the effects of gain control and impaired surround suppression in higher contrast conditions, often seen in previous studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural conversion of Î±-synuclein at the mitochondria induces neuronal toxicity</a></h4>

              
                Aggregation of -Synuclein (-Syn) drives Parkinson's disease, although the initial stages of self-assembly and structural conversion have not been captured inside neurons. We track the intracellular conformational states of -Syn utilizing a single-molecule FRET biosensor, and show that -Syn converts from its monomeric state to form two distinct oligomeric states in neurons in a concentration dependent, and sequence specific manner. 3D FRET-CLEM reveals the structural organization, and location of aggregation hotspots inside the cell. Notably multiple intracellular seeding events occur preferentially on membrane surfaces, especially mitochondrial membranes. The mitochondrial lipid, cardiolipin triggers rapid oligomerization of A53T -Syn, and cardiolipin is sequestered within aggregating lipid-protein complexes. Mitochondrial aggregates impair complex I activity and increase mitochondrial ROS generation, which accelerates the oligomerization of A53T -Syn, and ultimately causes permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes, and cell death. Patient iPSC derived neurons harboring A53T mutations exhibit accelerated oligomerization that is dependent on mitochondrial ROS, early mitochondrial permeabilization and neuronal death. Our study highlights a mechanism of de novo oligomerization at the mitochondria and its induction of neuronal toxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bidirectional changes in excitability upon loss of both CAMK2A and CAMK2B.</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) family consists of 4 different CAMK2 genes, encoding CAMK2A, CAMK2B, CAMK2D and CAMK2G, which have high structural homology. CAMK2A and CAMK2B are abundantly expressed in the brain; they play a unique role in proper neuronal functioning, since both CAMK2A and CAMK2B knockout mice show several behavioural and cellular phenotypes. However, our recent finding that deletion of both CAMK2A and CAMK2B is lethal indicates that they show redundancy and that the full spectrum of CAMK2 function in neurons remains to be uncovered. For example, it still remains unclear which overlapping functions are present at a single cell level in neuronal transmission and excitability. In order to get more insight into the full spectrum of CAMK2 functions in neurons, we performed whole-cell patch clamp experiments in inducible Camk2a/Camk2b double knockout mice, as well as the CAMK2A and CAMK2B knockout mice. We found that whereas deletion of only CAMK2A or CAMK2B did not change excitability, simultaneous deletion of CAMK2A and CAMK2B resulted in a decrease in excitability 10 days after deletion in CA1 pyramidal neurons, which reversed to increased excitability 21 days after deletion. Additionally, loss of both CAMK2A and CAMK2B resulted in a decreased frequency of both miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC and mIPSC) 21 days after deletion, but not 10 days after deletion, an effect not seen in the single mutants. Our results indicate that CAMK2 is critically important to maintain normal excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, as well as normal inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission. Together, these results lead to new insights in how CAMK2 regulates normal neuronal function and highlight the importance of having both CAMK2A and CAMK2B expressed in high levels in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Redefining and subtyping of major depression based on brain functional connectivity signatures with high generalization: an ensemble hybrid framework</a></h4>

              
                Current clinical diagnosis of major depression is solely based on subjective symptoms and signs rather than the underlying biological mechanisms, which has hindered the improvement in treatment effectiveness and outcomes. Redefining and subtyping MDD based on neural circuits has been an emerging consensus. Here, we developed EH-BrainNN, a novel ensemble hybrid deep-learning framework based on graph neural network for redefining and subtyping of MDD with the brain's "fingerprinting", i.e. nuanced functional connectivity profiles. With a supervised classifier, we comprehensively validated that our classifier showed a high generalization of 75% for leave-one-site-out cross validation with one of the largest MDD dataset which included 2428 participants recruited from 25 independent sites. The graph embedding features obtained from the supervised classifier was then employed for subtyping of MDD with an unsupervised clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFDP) approach. With this framework, we obtained three biologically homogenous MDD subtypes characterized by impairments in subcortical-limbic, DMN-FPN, VN-SMN circuits, respectively. Notably, we demonstrated that subtyping of MDD according to graph embedding features showed high robustness and reproducibility when CFDP was replicated for each site separately. The proposed framework is not only essential for redefining and subtyping of MDD, but also paves the way towards precision medicine of mental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech decoding from a small set of spatially segregated minimally invasive intracranial EEG electrodes with a compact and interpretable neural network</a></h4>

              
                Background: Speech decoding, one of the most intriguing BCI applications, opens up plentiful opportunities from rehabilitation of patients to direct and seamless communication between human species. Typical solutions rely on invasive recordings with a large number of distributed electrodes implanted through craniotomy. Here we explored the possibility of creating speech prosthesis in a minimally invasive setting with a small number of spatially segregated intracranial electrodes. Methods: We collected one hour of data (from two sessions) in two patients implanted with invasive electrodes. We then used only the contacts that pertained to a single sEEG shaft or an ECoG stripe to decode neural activity into 26 words and one silence class. We employed a compact convolutional network-based architecture whose spatial and temporal filter weights allow for a physiologically plausible interpretation. Results: We achieved on average 58% accuracy using only 6 channels of data recorded with a single minimally invasive sEEG electrode in the first patient and 72% accuracy using only 8 channels of data recorded for a single ECoG strip in the second patient in classifying 26+1 overtly pronounced words. Our compact architecture did not require the use of pre-engineered features, learned fast and resulted in a stable, interpretable and physiologically meaningful decision rule successfully operating over a contiguous dataset collected during a different time interval than that used for training. Spatial characteristics of the pivotal neuronal populations corroborate with active and passive speech mapping results and exhibit the inverse space-frequency relationship characteristic of neural activity. Comparison to other architectures our compact solution performed on par or better than those recently featured in neural speech decoding literature. Conclusions: We showcase the possibility of building speech prosthesis with a small number of electrodes and based on a compact feature engineering free decoder derived from a small amount of training data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CaMKIIÎ± promoter-controlled circuit manipulations target both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons in cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                A key assumption in studies of cortical functions is that excitatory principal neurons, but not inhibitory cells express calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II subunit  (CaMKII) resulting in a widespread use of CaMKII promoter-driven protein expression for principal cell manipulation and monitoring their activities. Using neuroanatomical and electrophysiological methods we demonstrate that in addition to pyramidal neurons, multiple types of cortical GABAegic cells are targeted by adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) carrying the CaMKII-Channelrhodopsin 2-mCherry construct. We show that the reporter protein, mCherry can visualize a large fraction of different interneuron types, including parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-containing GABAergic cells, which altogether cover around 50% of the whole inhibitory cell population in cortical structures. Importantly, the expression of the excitatory opsin Channelrhodopsin 2 in the interneurons effectively drive spiking of infected GABAergic cells even if the detectability of reporter proteins is ambiguous. Thus, our results challenge the use of CaMKII promoter-driven protein expression as a selective tool in targeting cortical glutamatergic neurons using viral vectors.
