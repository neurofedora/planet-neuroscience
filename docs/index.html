                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in two distinct niches in the mammalian brain, the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the forebrain lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. They are thought to be molecularly distinct since V-SVZ NSCs produce inhibitory olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons and SGZ NSCs excitatory dentate granule neurons. Here, we have asked whether this is so by directly comparing V-SVZ and SGZ NSCs from embryogenesis to adulthood using single-cell transcriptional data. We show that the embryonic radial glial precursor (RP) parents of these two NSC populations are very similar, but differentially express a small cohort of genes involved in glutamatergic versus GABAergic neurogenesis. These different RPs then undergo a similar gradual transition to a dormant adult NSC state over the first three postnatal weeks. This dormancy state involves transcriptional shutdown of genes that maintain an active, proliferative, prodifferentiation state and induction of genes involved in sensing and regulating their niche environment. Moreover, when reactivated to generate adult-born progeny, both populations reacquire a development-like state and re-express proneurogenic genes. Thus, V-SVZ and SGZ NSCs share a common transcriptional state throughout their lifespans and transition into and out of dormancy via similar trajectories.</p>

                Background: Malaria in pregnancy leading to placental malaria. The main pathogenesis of the complex foetal implications in placental malaria is tissue hypoxia, due to sequestrations of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes in the placenta, but the pathomechanism of placental Plasmodium vivax infection have not been studied in detail.  Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a key transcriptional mediator of the response to hypoxic conditions which interacts with the change and imbalances of many chemical mediators including angiogenic factors, leading to abnormality of foetal growth. Methods: This study was conducted cross sectionally in Maumere, Sikka Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province, that previously known as one of malaria endemic area with high incidence of low birth weight (LBW) cases. In this study the peripheral and umbilical blood samples as well as placental tissues were collected from mother delivered their babies with LBW at the TC Hiller Regional Hospital. All of the blood samples were examined for the presence of parasites by microscopic and PCR technique, while the plasma levels of VEGF, PlGF, and VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1α were determined using ELISA. The sequestration of infected erythrocytes and hemozoin were determined from placental histological slides and the expression of placenta angiogenic factors were observed by immunofluorescent technique.  Results: In this study there were 33 cases had complete data to be analysed. Of them, there were 19 diagnosed as vivax malaria and no one of falciparum malaria. There were significant differences of Δ 10th percentile growth curve of baby’s body weights and also all angiogenic factors in placental tissues {VEGF, PlGF, and VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1α} between those infected and not infected cases (p<0.05), but not for VEGF and VEGFR-2 in the plasma. Conclusion: This study found Plasmodium vivax sequestration may cause LBW through the changes and imbalances of angiogenic factors leaded by HIF-1α.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Elementary vectors and autocatalytic sets for resource allocation in next-generation models of cellular growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stefan Müller, Diana Széliová, Jürgen Zanghellini</p>

Traditional (genome-scale) metabolic models of cellular growth involve an approximate biomass “reaction”, which specifies biomass composition in terms of precursor metabolites (such as amino acids and nucleotides). On the one hand, biomass composition is often not known exactly and may vary drastically between conditions and strains. On the other hand, the predictions of computational models crucially depend on biomass. Also elementary flux modes (EFMs), which generate the flux cone, depend on the biomass reaction. To better understand cellular phenotypes across growth conditions, we introduce and analyze new classes of elementary vectors for comprehensive (next-generation) metabolic models, involving explicit synthesis reactions for all macromolecules. Elementary growth modes (EGMs) are given by stoichiometry and generate the growth cone. Unlike EFMs, they are not support-minimal, in general, but cannot be decomposed “without cancellations”. In models with additional (capacity) constraints, elementary growth vectors (EGVs) generate a growth polyhedron and depend also on growth rate. However, EGMs/EGVs do not depend on the biomass composition. In fact, they cover all possible biomass compositions and can be seen as unbiased versions of elementary flux modes/vectors (EFMs/EFVs) used in traditional models. To relate the new concepts to other branches of theory, we consider autocatalytic sets of reactions. Further, we illustrate our results in a small model of a self-fabricating cell, involving glucose and ammonium uptake, amino acid and lipid synthesis, and the expression of all enzymes and the ribosome itself. In particular, we study the variation of biomass composition as a function of growth rate. In agreement with experimental data, low nitrogen uptake correlates with high carbon (lipid) storage.

Preprints allow researchers to make their findings available to the scientific community before they have undergone peer review. Studies on preprints within bioRxiv have been largely focused on article metadata and how often these preprints are downloaded, cited, published, and discussed online. A missing element that has yet to be examined is the language contained within the bioRxiv preprint repository. We sought to compare and contrast linguistic features within bioRxiv preprints to published biomedical text as a whole as this is an excellent opportunity to examine how peer review changes these documents. The most prevalent features that changed appear to be associated with typesetting and mentions of supporting information sections or additional files. In addition to text comparison, we created document embeddings derived from a preprint-trained word2vec model. We found that these embeddings are able to parse out different scientific approaches and concepts, link unannotated preprint–peer-reviewed article pairs, and identify journals that publish linguistically similar papers to a given preprint. We also used these embeddings to examine factors associated with the time elapsed between the posting of a first preprint and the appearance of a peer-reviewed publication. We found that preprints with more versions posted and more textual changes took longer to publish. Lastly, we constructed a web application (https://greenelab.github.io/preprint-similarity-search/) that allows users to identify which journals and articles that are most linguistically similar to a bioRxiv or medRxiv preprint as well as observe where the preprint would be positioned within a published article landscape.

This phenomenon has sharpened long-standing questions about the reliability of information shared prior to journal peer review. Does the information shared in preprints typically withstand the scrutiny of peer review, or are conclusions likely to change in the version of record? We assessed preprints from bioRxiv and medRxiv that had been posted and subsequently published in a journal through April 30, 2020, representing the initial phase of the pandemic response. We utilised a combination of automatic and manual annotations to quantify how an article changed between the preprinted and published version. We found that the total number of figure panels and tables changed little between preprint and published articles. Moreover, the conclusions of 7.2% of non-COVID-19–related and 17.2% of COVID-19–related abstracts undergo a discrete change by the time of publication, but the majority of these changes do not qualitatively change the conclusions of the paper.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The cocktail infection: anaerobic and aerobic co-Infections in tubercular vertebral osteomyelitis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Anaerobic organisms have been known to have an association with dental infections, bacteremia, endocarditis and soft tissue infections. However, anaerobic isolation from bone and joint infections are relatively rare. Sparse literature has been found on reports of anaerobic osteomyelitis. There is no literature reported on anaerobic osteomyelitis complicating Tuberculosis of spine. Case Report: We report two cases of tuberculosis of spine complicated by aerobic and anerobic infections. The first is a case of a young female who presented with chronic lower backache and fever. Examination revealed a lumbar scoliosis with paraspinal tenderness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed lumbar spondylodiscitis with multiple abscesses. There were air-fluid levels noted in the abscesses. The pus sent for CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test) was positive. Further the cultures also grew Escherichia coli (aerobic) Bacteroids fragilis and Peptoniphilus asachrolyticus (anaerobic) organisms. She improved with a course of intravenous antibiotics and decompression surgery. The second case is a middle aged man who presented with chronic neck pain and fever. Examination revealed kyphosis of the neck with spasm of the neck muscles and midline tenderness. MRI showed C4-5 cervical spondylodiscitis with parapharyngeal collections showing air-fluid levels. The pus culture showed Streptococcus constellatus (aerobic) and  Prevotella sps. (anaerobic). The CBNAAT report was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and cervical decompression. Conclusion: Though tubercular vertebral osteomyelitis (TVO) is usually a diagnosis in itself, it should not hinder us from considering secondary infections (both aerobic and anaerobic) complicating the osteomyelitis. Further, the presence of air-fluid levels on imaging studies and the presence of foul smell during operative exploration of the spine must arouse the suspicion of an anaerobic co-infection. Isolation and treatment of these organisms are crucial as they may hamper the clinical outcome of the primary TVO.

                We report an uncommon clinical presentation of a placental site trophoblastic tumor. The patient presented initially with abdominal pain with, fever, bleeding and pelvic mass on ultrasonography leading to the wrong diagnosis of a pelvic abscess. Dilation and curettage were performed and pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. of placental site trophoblastic tumor. Therefore, she underwent abdominal hysterectomy. Four years after surgery, the patient is still disease free. Gestational trophoblastic diseases should be considered in every patient presenting abnormal uterine bleeding after delivery or pregnancy loss despite the associated symptoms being very unusual.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of asparaginases and L-carnitine on Western-diet-induced hepatosteatosis in mice [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background: Asparaginases are common chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a single or combinational therapy. Accompanying hepatotoxicity makes its use in elderly patients with pre-conditions, as obesity or other hepatopathies, difficult. Various hepatoprotective compounds like, L-carnitine, are discussed to ameliorate the induced hepatotoxicity. Methods: Here we aimed to establish a mouse model to study the effect of asparaginases (L-asparaginase and Oncaspar) and L-carnitine on Western-diet-induced hepatosteatosis in mice. Dose-escalation studies were performed to analyze asparaginases induced hepatotoxicity in C57BL/6 mice with normal or fatty livers. Subsequently, the effect of L-carnitine to improve the induced toxicity was tested. Results: Our results showed mild-to-moderate hepatotoxic effects while the Western-diet induced a higher degree of vacuolization and hepatocyte damage in liver tissue. Testing of L-carnitine in the established models did not show any protective effect on the toxicity or impairment of the efficacy of asparaginases. Conclusion: The here established models were able to demonstrate the asparaginase-induced hepatotoxic effects which were enhanced by the Western-diet. However, to test potential ameliorating drugs, the models might need some improvements.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Accumulation of essential (copper, iron, zinc) and non-essential (lead, cadmium) heavy metals in Caulerpa racemosa, sea water, and marine sediments of Bintan Island, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Heavy metals are materials naturally occurring in nature and increase with a rise in human activity. Ex-mining areas and domestic waste from human settlements are sources of heavy metal contamination that enter and pollute water, which then accumulates in various organisms including the Caulerpa racemosa community. The accumulation of heavy metals in C. racemosa has a wide impact on the food chain in aquatic ecosystems and humans because this alga is a consumptive commodity.   Methods: Sampling of C. racemosa was carried out at seven sites on Bintan Island, Indonesia covering the eastern (Teluk Bakau, Beralas Pasir, Malang Rapat), northern (Berakit and Pengudang), western (Sakera), and southern parts (Tg. Siambang). Sampling was carried out during different monsoons, and heavy metals in water and sediment samples were measured to determine the heavy metal concentration. Heavy metals were analyzed by a spectrophotometric method using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry.   Results: The results showed that heavy metal concentrations fluctuate according to changes in the wind season, which carry currents and spread pollutants into the water. The concentration of metal in the water is also from anthropogenic activities. The heavy metal content of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) in C. racemosa is high in locations close to settlements. Meanwhile, in seawater samples, Fe and Zn metals have the highest concentrations compared to others.  Conclusions: Ex-bauxite mines are a source of Fe and Zn metal contamination in the environment, especially at Tg. Siambang. The levels of these heavy metals in the sediment are also high, as surface particle deposits accumulate at the bottom of the sediment. In general, the levels of heavy metals Cd, Pb, Cu, Fe, and Zn increase in the northern monsoon because the dynamics of the water transport greater heavy metal pollution.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unprecedented early-summer heat stress and forecast of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, 2021-2022 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is predicted to undergo its sixth mass coral bleaching event during the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2021-2022. Coral bleaching-level heat stress over the GBR is forecast to start earlier than any previous year in the satellite record (1985-present). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) near real-time satellite-based heat stress products were used to investigate early-summer sea surface temperature (SST) and heat stress conditions on the GBR during late 2021. As of 14 December 2021, values of instantaneous heat stress (Coral Bleaching HotSpots) and accumulated heat stress over a 12-week running window (Degree Heating Weeks) on the GBR were unprecedented in the satellite record. Further, 89% of GBR satellite reef pixels for this date in 2021 had a positive seven-day SST trend of greater than 0.2 degrees Celsius/week. Background temperatures (the minimum temperature over the previous 29 days) were alarmingly high, with 87% of GBR reef pixels on 14 December 2021 being greater than the maximum SST over that same 29-day period for any year from 1985-2020. The GBR is starting the 2021-2022 summer season with more accumulated heat than ever before, which could have disastrous consequences for the health, recovery, and future of this critical reef system.

                Jovanovic and colleagues report that social signal processing in primate prefrontal cortex during traditional, head-restrained paradigms is not representative of the analogous process in natural communication. These findings suggest that some facets of primate social brain function can only be elucidated in the contexts in which they occur naturally.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Proline synthesis through PYCR1 is required to support cancer cell proliferation and survival in oxygen-limiting conditions</a></h4>

              
                Westbrook et al. show that proline synthesis from glutamine through PYCR1 supports NADH oxidation when oxygen is limited. PYCR1 therefore represents an oxygen-independent means of regenerating NAD+ in hypoxia, supporting continued oxidative TCA cycle activity. Loss of PYCR1 in tumors results in increased hypoxia, reduced cell viability, and necrosis.

                Defining reference models for population variation, and the ability to study individual deviations is essential for understanding inter-individual variability and its relation to the onset and progression of medical conditions. In this work, we assembled a reference cohort of neuroimaging data from 82 sites (N=58,836; ages 2-100) and use normative modeling to characterize lifespan trajectories of cortical thickness and subcortical volume. Models are validated against a manually quality checked subset (N=24,354) and we provide an interface for transferring to new data sources. We showcase the clinical value by applying the models to a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (N=1,985), showing they can be used to quantify variability underlying multiple disorders whilst also refining case-control inferences. These models will be augmented with additional samples and imaging modalities as they become available. This provides a common reference platform to bind results from different studies and ultimately paves the way for personalized clinical decision making.

                Accurate control of the cell cycle is critical for development and tissue homeostasis, and requires precisely timed expression of many genes. Cell cycle gene expression is regulated through transcriptional and translational control, as well as through regulated protein degradation. Here, we show that widespread and temporally controlled mRNA decay acts as an additional mechanism for gene expression regulation during the cell cycle in human cells. We find that two waves of mRNA decay occur sequentially during the mitosis-to-G1 phase transition, and we identify the deadenylase CNOT1 as a factor that contributes to mRNA decay during this cell cycle transition. Collectively, our data show that, akin to protein degradation, scheduled mRNA decay helps to reshape cell cycle gene expression as cells move from mitosis into G1 phase.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Response to comment on 'Unexpected plasticity in the life cycle of Trypanosoma Brucei'</a></h4>

              
                We thank Keith Matthews and Stephen Larcombe for their thoughtful comment, which follows the good tradition of public scientific discourse (Matthews and Larcombe, 2022). While their remarks have prompted us to take another critical look at our data, we think that they neither alter our conclusions nor offer a practical alternative explanation. In essence, we see two possible interpretations of our experiments: either the trypanosome life cycle can accommodate a more flexible role for the slender stage, or the definition of the stumpy stage needs to be radically changed. While the first interpretation – which we favour – would not falsify any published work, the second one – which Matthews and Larcombe are proposing – would contradict the literature. Hence, we favour a model with an unexpected phenotypic plasticity for the slender stage and a certain degree of stochasticity in the trypanosome life cycle.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Eco1-dependent cohesin acetylation anchors chromatin loops and cohesion to define functional meiotic chromosome domains</a></h4>

              
                Cohesin organizes the genome by forming intra-chromosomal loops and inter-sister chromatid linkages. During gamete formation by meiosis, chromosomes are reshaped to support crossover recombination and two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation. Here we show that meiotic chromosomes are organised into functional domains by Eco1 acetyltransferase-dependent positioning of both chromatin loops and sister chromatid cohesion in budding yeast. Eco1 acetylates the Smc3 cohesin subunit in meiotic S phase to establish chromatin boundaries, independently of DNA replication. Boundary formation by Eco1 is critical for prophase exit and for the maintenance of cohesion until meiosis II, but is independent of the ability of Eco1 to antagonize the cohesin-release factor, Wpl1. Conversely, prevention of cohesin release by Wpl1 is essential for centromeric cohesion, kinetochore monoorientation and co-segregation of sister chromatids in meiosis I. Our findings establish Eco1 as a key determinant of chromatin boundaries and cohesion positioning, revealing how local chromosome structuring directs genome transmission into gametes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A single full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain variant purifies broadly neutralizing antibodies against placental malaria isolates</a></h4>

              
                Placental malaria (PM) is a deadly syndrome most frequent and severe in first pregnancies. PM results from accumulation of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>-infected erythrocytes (IE) that express the surface antigen VAR2CSA and bind to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placenta. Women become PM-resistant over successive pregnancies as they develop anti-adhesion and anti-VAR2CSA antibodies, supporting VAR2CSA as the leading PM-vaccine candidate. However, the first VAR2CSA subunit vaccines failed to induce broadly neutralizing antibody and it is known that naturally acquired antibodies target both variant-specific and conserved epitopes. It is crucial to determine whether effective vaccines will require incorporation of many or only a single VAR2CSA variants. Here, IgG from multigravidae was sequentially purified on five full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain variants, thereby depleting IgG reactivity to each. The five VAR2CSA variants purified ~0.7% of total IgG and yielded both strain-transcending and strain-specific reactivity to VAR2CSA and IE-surface antigen. In two independent antibody purification/depletion experiments with permutated order of VAR2CSA variants, IgG purified on the first VAR2CSA antigen displayed broad cross-reactivity to both recombinant and native VAR2CSA variants, and inhibited binding of all isolates to CSA. IgG remaining after depletion on all variants showed significantly reduced binding-inhibition activity compared to initial total IgG. These findings demonstrate that a single VAR2CSA ectodomain variant displays conserved epitopes that are targeted by neutralizing (or binding-inhibitory) antibodies shared by multiple parasite strains, including maternal isolates. This suggests that a broadly effective PM-vaccine can be achieved with a limited number of VAR2CSA variants.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reciprocally inhibitory circuits operating with distinct mechanisms are differently robust to perturbation and modulation</a></h4>

              
                Reciprocal inhibition is a building block in many sensory and motor circuits. We studied the features that underly robustness in reciprocally inhibitory two neuron circuits. We used the dynamic clamp to create reciprocally inhibitory circuits from pharmacologically isolated neurons of the crab stomatogastric ganglion by injecting artificial graded synaptic (I<sub>Syn</sub>) and hyperpolarization-activated inward (I<sub>H</sub>) currents. There is a continuum of mechanisms in circuits that generate antiphase oscillations, with 'release' and 'escape' mechanisms at the extremes, and mixed mode oscillations in between these extremes. In release, the active neuron primarily controls the off/on transitions. In escape, the inhibited neuron controls the transitions. We characterized the robustness of escape and release circuits to alterations in circuit parameters, temperature, and neuromodulation. We found that escape circuits rely on tight correlations between synaptic and H conductances to generate bursting but are resilient to temperature increase. Release circuits are robust to variations in synaptic and H conductances but fragile to temperature increase. The modulatory current (I<sub>MI</sub>) restores oscillations in release circuits but has little effect in escape circuits. Perturbations can alter the balance of escape and release mechanisms and can create mixed mode oscillations. We conclude that the same perturbation can have dramatically different effects depending on the circuits' mechanism of operation that may not be observable from basal circuit activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comment on ‘Unexpected plasticity in the life cycle of Trypanosoma brucei’</a></h4>

              
                Schuster et al. make the important observation that small numbers of trypanosomes can infect tsetse flies, and further argue that this can occur whether the infecting parasites are developmentally ‘slender’ or ‘stumpy’(Schuster et al., 2021). We welcome their careful experiments but disagree that they require a rethink of the trypanosome life-cycle. Instead, the study reveals that stumpy forms are more likely to successfully infect flies, the key limit on parasite transmission, and we predict this advantage would be greatly amplified in tsetse infections in the field. Further, we argue that stumpy forms are defined by a suite of molecular adaptations for life-cycle progression, with morphology being a secondary feature. Finally, their dominance in chronic infections means most natural tsetse infections would involve stumpy forms, even in small numbers. Our interpretation does not require re-evaluation of the obligatory life cycle of the parasite, where stumpy forms are selected to sustain transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ExSTED microscopy reveals contrasting functions of dopamine and somatostatin CSF-c neurons along the lamprey central canal</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid-contacting (CSF-c) neurons line the central canal of the spinal cord and a subtype of CSF-c neurons expressing somatostatin, forms a homeostatic pH regulating system. Despite their importance, their intricate spatial organization is poorly understood. The function of another subtype of CSF-c neurons expressing dopamine is also investigated. Imaging methods with a high spatial resolution (5–10 nm) are used to resolve the synaptic and ciliary compartments of each individual cell in the spinal cord of the lamprey to elucidate their signalling pathways and to dissect the cellular organization. Here, light-sheet and expansion microscopy resolved the persistent ventral and lateral organization of dopamine- and somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neuronal subtypes. The density of somatostatin-containing dense-core vesicles, resolved by stimulated emission depletion microscopy, was shown to be markedly reduced upon each exposure to either alkaline or acidic pH and being part of a homeostatic response inhibiting movements. Their cilia symmetry was unravelled by stimulated emission depletion microscopy in expanded tissues as sensory with 9 + 0 microtubule duplets. The dopaminergic CSF-c neurons on the other hand have a motile cilium with the characteristic 9 + 2 duplets and are insensitive to pH changes. This novel experimental workflow elucidates the functional role of CSF-c neuron subtypes in situ paving the way for further spatial and functional cell-type classification.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is increasingly recognized as a multisystem disorder accompanied by cognitive changes. To date, no effective therapy is available for ALS patients, partly due to disease heterogeneity and an imperfect understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes. Reliable models that can predict cognitive and motor deficits are needed to improve symptomatic treatment and slow down disease progression. This study aimed to identify individualized functional connectivity–based predictors of cognitive and motor function in ALS by using multiple kernel learning (MKL) regression. Resting-state fMRI scanning was performed on 34 riluzole-naive ALS patients. Motor severity and global cognition were separately measured with the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Our results showed that functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) as well as between the DMN and the sensorimotor network (SMN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN) were predictive for MoCA scores. Additionally, the observed connectivity patterns were also predictive for the individual ALSFRS-R scores. Our findings demonstrate that cognitive and motor impairments may share common connectivity fingerprints in ALS patients. Furthermore, the identified brain connectivity signatures may serve as novel targets for effective disease-modifying therapies.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Regression dynamic causal modeling (rDCM) is a novel and computationally highly efficient method for inferring effective connectivity at the whole-brain level. While face and construct validity of rDCM have already been demonstrated, here we assessed its test-retest reliability—a test-theoretical property of particular importance for clinical applications—together with group-level consistency of connection-specific estimates and consistency of whole-brain connectivity patterns over sessions. Using the Human Connectome Project dataset for eight different paradigms (tasks and rest) and two different parcellation schemes, we found that rDCM provided highly consistent connectivity estimates at the group level across sessions. Second, while test-retest reliability was limited when averaging over all connections (range of mean intraclass correlation coefficient 0.24–0.42 over tasks), reliability increased with connection strength, with stronger connections showing good to excellent test-retest reliability. Third, whole-brain connectivity patterns by rDCM allowed for identifying individual participants with high (and in some cases perfect) accuracy. Comparing the test-retest reliability of rDCM connectivity estimates with measures of functional connectivity, rDCM performed favorably—particularly when focusing on strong connections. Generally, for all methods and metrics, task-based connectivity estimates showed greater reliability than those from the resting state.

To achieve this, we propose an innovative regression framework to relate distances (or similarities) between brain network features to functions of absolute differences in continuous covariates and indicators of difference for categorical variables. We explore several similarity metrics for comparing distances (or similarities) between connection matrices, and adapt several standard methods for estimation and inference within our framework: standard <span style="font-style:italic;">F</span> test, <span style="font-style:italic;">F</span> test with individual level effects (ILE), feasible generalized least squares (FGLS), and permutation.

Previous studies utilized network control theory to measure the cost by considering a neural system as a deterministic dynamical system. However, this approach does not capture the stochasticity of neural systems, which is important for accurately quantifying brain state transition cost. Here, we propose a novel framework based on optimal control in stochastic systems. In our framework, we quantify the transition cost as the Kullback-Leibler divergence from an uncontrolled transition path to the optimally controlled path, which is known as Schrödinger Bridge. To test its utility, we applied this framework to functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project and computed the brain state transition cost in cognitive tasks. We demonstrate correspondence between brain state transition cost and the difficulty of tasks. The results suggest that our framework provides a general theoretical tool for investigating cognitive functions from the viewpoint of transition cost.</span>

Our primary goal is to summarize how ML is being applied and critically assess common practices. Our review covers 250 studies published using ML and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to infer various dimensions of the human functional connectome. Results for holdout (“lockbox”) performance was, on average, ∼13% less accurate than performance measured through cross-validation alone, highlighting the importance of lockbox data, which was included in only 16% of the studies. There was also a concerning lack of transparency across the key steps in training and evaluating predictive models. The summary of this literature underscores the importance of the use of a lockbox and highlights several methodological pitfalls that can be addressed by the imaging community. We argue that, ideally, studies are motivated both by the reproducibility and generalizability of findings as well as the potential clinical significance of the insights. We offer recommendations for principled integration of machine learning into the clinical neurosciences with the goal of advancing imaging biomarkers of brain disorders, understanding causative determinants for health risks, and parsing heterogeneous patient outcomes.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Structural plasticity of the brain can be represented in a highly simplified form as adaptive rewiring, the relay of connections according to the spontaneous dynamic synchronization in network activity. Adaptive rewiring, over time, leads from initial random networks to brain-like complex networks, that is, networks with modular small-world structures and a rich-club effect. Adaptive rewiring has only been studied, however, in networks of identical oscillators with uniform or random coupling strengths. To implement information-processing functions (e.g., stimulus selection or memory storage), it is necessary to consider symmetry-breaking perturbations of oscillator amplitudes and coupling strengths. We studied whether nonuniformities in amplitude or connection strength could operate in tandem with adaptive rewiring. Throughout network evolution, either amplitude or connection strength of a subset of oscillators was kept different from the rest. In these extreme conditions, subsets might become isolated from the rest of the network or otherwise interfere with the development of network complexity. However, whereas these subsets form distinctive structural and functional communities, they generally maintain connectivity with the rest of the network and allow the development of network complexity. Pathological development was observed only in a small proportion of the models. These results suggest that adaptive rewiring can robustly operate alongside information processing in biological and artificial neural networks.</span>

However, since stroke is a vascular disorder and fMRI signals remain sensitive to nonneuronal (i.e., vascular) coupling, more direct demonstrations of neural network dysfunction in hemispatial neglect are warranted. Here, we utilize electroencephalogram (EEG) source imaging to uncover differences in resting-state network organization between patients with right hemispheric stroke (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 15) and age-matched, healthy controls (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 27), and determine the relationship between hemineglect symptoms and brain network organization. We estimated <span style="font-style:italic;">intra</span>- and <span style="font-style:italic;">interregional</span> differences in cortical communication by calculating the spectral power and amplitude envelope correlations of narrow-band EEG oscillations. We first observed focal frequency-slowing within the right posterior cortical regions, reflected in relative delta/theta power increases and alpha/beta/gamma decreases. Secondly, nodes within the right temporal and parietal cortex consistently displayed anomalous intra- and interhemispheric coupling, stronger in delta and gamma bands, and weaker in theta, alpha, and beta bands. Finally, a significant association was observed between the severity of left-hemispace search deficits (e.g., cancellation test omissions) and reduced functional connectivity within the alpha and beta bands. In sum, our novel results validate the hypothesis of large-scale cortical network disruption following stroke and reinforce the proposal that abnormal brain oscillations may be intimately involved in the pathophysiology of visuospatial neglect.</span>

              <h4><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/netn">Edges in brain networks: Contributions to models of structure and function</a></h4>

              
                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Network models describe the brain as sets of nodes and edges that represent its distributed organization. So far, most discoveries in network neuroscience have prioritized insights that highlight distinct groupings and specialized functional contributions of network nodes. Importantly, these functional contributions are determined and expressed by the web of their interrelationships, formed by network edges. Here, we underscore the important contributions made by brain network edges for understanding distributed brain organization. Different types of edges represent different types of relationships, including connectivity and similarity among nodes. Adopting a specific definition of edges can fundamentally alter how we analyze and interpret a brain network. Furthermore, edges can associate into collectives and higher order arrangements, describe time series, and form edge communities that provide insights into brain network topology complementary to the traditional node-centric perspective. Focusing on the edges, and the higher order or dynamic information they can provide, discloses previously underappreciated aspects of structural and functional network organization.</span>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Psychedelics and schizophrenia: Distinct alterations to Bayesian inference</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia and states induced by certain psychotomimetic drugs may share some physiological and phenomenological properties, but they differ in fundamental ways: one is a crippling chronic mental disease, while the others are temporary, pharmacologically-induced states presently being explored as treatments for mental illnesses. Building towards a deeper understanding of these different alterations of normal consciousness, here we compare the changes in neural dynamics induced by LSD and ketamine (in healthy volunteers) against those associated with schizophrenia, as observed in resting-state M/EEG recordings. While both conditions exhibit increased neural signal diversity, our findings reveal that this is accompanied by an increased transfer entropy from the front to the back of the brain in schizophrenia, versus an overall reduction under the two drugs. Furthermore, we show that these effects can be reproduced via different alterations of standard Bayesian inference applied on a computational model based on the predictive processing framework. In particular, the effects observed under the drugs are modelled as a reduction of the precision of the priors, while the effects of schizophrenia correspond to an increased precision of sensory information. These findings shed new light on the similarities and differences between schizophrenia and two psychotomimetic drug states, and have potential implications for the study of consciousness and future mental health treatments.

                Ageing is the primary risk factor for AD; however, there is a poor understanding of the biological mechanisms by which the ageing process contributes to the development of AD in some individuals, while others progress to advanced age with relatively little AD neuropathology. To halt the progression of AD, the preclinical stage of neurodegeneration (before the onset of clinical symptoms) is anticipated to be the more effective time point for applying potentially disease-modifying interventions in AD. The main objective of this study was to understand the age and disease related proteomic changes are detectable in plasma, based on retrospective analysis of longitudinal data and cross-sectional analyses of clinically diagnosed cases. We conducted an in-depth plasma proteomics analysis using intensive depletion of high-abundant plasma proteins using the Agilent multiple affinity removal liquid chromatography (LC) column- Human 14 (Hu14) followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) technique. In this study, we have begun to address the following questions; (1) differences in plasma proteomic profiles between normal ageing, vs ageing with progress to cognitive decline (MCI) or disease (dementia, probable AD), (2) cross-sectional analysis of baseline data, when all subjects are clinically identified as cognitively normal, provides insight into the preclinical changes which precede subsequent progression to AD and potentially provide early biomarkers, and (3) comparison of plasma at the point of progression to clinically diagnosed onset of cognitive decline or AD, can provide potential plasma biomarkers to facilitate clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, our findings also identified some proteins previously discovered in AD CSF and brain proteomics signatures that could provide clinically meaningful information. We identified differentially expressed proteins which were associated with several biological and molecular processes that may serve as therapeutic targets and fluid biomarkers for the disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A model of autonomous interactions between hippocampus and neocortex driving sleep-dependent memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                How do we build up our knowledge of the world over time? Many theories of memory formation and consolidation have posited that the hippocampus stores new information, then "teaches" this information to neocortex over time, especially during sleep. But it is unclear, mechanistically, how this actually works -- how are these systems able to interact during periods with virtually no environmental input to accomplish useful learning and shifts in representation? We provide a framework for thinking about this question, with neural network model simulations serving as demonstrations. The model contains hippocampus and neocortical areas, which replay memories and interact with one another completely autonomously during simulated sleep. Oscillations are leveraged to support error-driven learning that leads to useful changes in memory representation and behavior. The model has a non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep stage, where dynamics between hippocampus and neocortex are tightly coupled, with hippocampus helping neocortex to reinstate high-fidelity versions of new attractors, and a REM sleep stage, where neocortex is able to more freely explore existing attractors. We find that alternating between NREM and REM sleep stages, which alternately focuses the models replay on recent and remote information, facilitates graceful continual learning. We thus provide an account of how the hippocampus and neocortex can interact without any external input during sleep to drive useful new cortical learning and to protect old knowledge as new information is integrated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assessing functional connectivity differences and work-related fatigue in surviving COVID-negative patients.</a></h4>

              
                The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected all aspects of life around the world. Neuroimaging evidence suggests the novel coronavirus can attack the central nervous system (CNS), causing cerebro-vascular abnormalities in the brain. This can lead to focal changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolic oxygen consumption rate in the brain. However, the extent and spatial locations of brain alterations in COVID-19 survivors are largely unknown. In this study, we have assessed brain functional connectivity (FC) using resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) in 38 (25 males) COVID patients two weeks after hospital discharge, when PCR negative and 31 (24 males) healthy subjects. FC was estimated using independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression. The COVID group demonstrated significantly enhanced FC in regions from the Occipital and Parietal Lobes, comparing to the HC group. On the other hand, the COVID group exhibited significantly reduced FC in several vermal layers of the cerebellum. More importantly, we noticed negative correlation of FC with self-reported fatigue within regions from the Parietal lobe, which are known to be associated with fatigue.

                Major cell entry factors of SARS-CoV-2 are present in neurons; however, the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and the phenotypes of infected neurons are still unclear. Acute neurological disorders occur in many patients, and one-third of COVID-19 survivors suffer from brain diseases. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 invades the brains of five patients with COVID-19 and Alzheimers, autism, frontotemporal dementia or no underlying condition by infecting neurons and other cells in the cortex. SARS-CoV-2 induces or enhances Alzheimers-like neuropathology with manifestations of beta-amyloid aggregation and plaque formation, tauopathy, neuroinflammation and cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infects mature but not immature neurons derived from inducible pluripotent stem cells from healthy and Alzheimers individuals through its receptor ACE2 and facilitator neuropilin-1. SARS-CoV-2 triggers Alzheimers-like gene programs in healthy neurons and exacerbates Alzheimers neuropathology. A gene signature defined as an Alzheimers infectious etiology is identified through SARS-CoV-2 infection, and silencing the top three downregulated genes in human primary neurons recapitulates the neurodegenerative phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 invades the brain and activates an Alzheimers-like program.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal dissociation of brain network connectivity in salience processing: A simultaneous pupillometry-EEG-fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                The processing of salient stimuli involves a wide range of both bottom-up and top-down processes. Previous neuroimaging studies have identified multiple brain areas and networks for salience processing, including the salience network (SN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) neuromodulatory system. However, interactions among these networks and the cortico-subcortical systems in salience processing remain unclear. Here, we simultaneously recorded pupillometry, electroencephalogram (EEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an auditory oddball paradigm. Using EEG-informed fMRI analysis, we temporally dissociated the target stimulus evoked activation, allowing us to identify the cascades of cortical areas associated with salience processing. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis uncovered spatiotemporal functional network organizations of these salience processing neural correlates. Using pupillometry as a psychophysiological marker of LC-NE activity, we also assessed brain-pupil relationships. With state-space modeling of target modulated effective connectivity, we found that the target evoked pupillary response is associated with the network causal couplings from late to early subsystems, as well as the network switching initiated by the SN. These findings indicate that the SN might cooperate with pupil-indexed brainstem neuromodulatory systems, such as the LC-NE system, in the reorganization and dynamic switching of cortical networks, and shed light on the implications of their integrative framework in various cognitive processes and neurological diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Volumetric development of hippocampal subfields and hippocampal white matter connectivity: Relationship with episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a complex structure composed of several distinct subfields and has been at the center of scientific study examining the neural foundations of episodic memory. To date, there is little consensus regarding the structural development of the hippocampus and its subfields assessed both volumetrically and through anatomical connectivity, nor how the development of the related substructures influences episodic memory. In the current cross-sectional study, using a large sample of 830, 3- to 21-year-olds from a unique and publicly available dataset we examined the following questions: 1) Is there elevated grey matter volume of the hippocampus and its respective subfields in late compared to early development? 2) How does hippocampal volume compare with the rest of the cerebral cortex at different developmental stages? and 3) What is the relation between hippocampal volume, and the connectivity of the hippocampus with cortex as measured by diffusion-weighted imaging, with episodic memory performance? We found hippocampal subfield volumes exhibited a non-linear relation with age. Specifically, hippocampal subfield volumes showed a lag in volumetric change with age when compared to adjacent cortical regions (e.g., entorhinal cortex). We also observed a significant reduction in cortical volume across older cohorts, while hippocampal volume showed the opposite pattern. In addition to age-related differences in grey matter volume, several distinct subfields are significantly related to episodic memory. We did not, however, find any associations with episodic memory performance and connectivity through the uncinate fasciculus, fornix, or cingulum. The results are discussed in the context of current research and theories of hippocampal development and its relation to episodic memory.

                Despite the well described role of dopamine in the striatum for motor learning and movement, its function in encoding actions and their outcomes for goal-directed action is less clear. Here, rats acquired two actions for distinct outcomes while we simultaneously recorded dopamine release in the dorsomedial striatum as these action-outcome associations were incremented and selectively degraded. Goal-directed actions generated a lateralized dopamine signal that reflected the strength of the action-outcome association and tracked increments and decrements in the action-outcome contingency. In addition to this lateralized signal, dopamine signaled reward predictions, which were broadcast bilaterally during the action and updated by a reward prediction error following exposure to the outcome. Therefore, striatal dopamine release directly modulates and updates encoding of the instrumental action-outcome association for goal-directed action.

                Neuron Navigator 1 (Nav1) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein expressed during brain development that is necessary for proper neuritogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that Nav1 is present in elongating axon tracts during mouse brain embryogenesis. We found that depletion of Nav1 in cultured neurons disrupts growth cone morphology and neurotrophin-stimulated neuritogenesis. In addition to regulating both F-actin and microtubule properties, Nav1 promotes actin-rich membrane ruffles in the growth cone, and promotes macropinocytosis at those membrane ruffles, including internalization of the TrkB receptor for the neurotrophin BDNF (brain-derived neurotropic factor). Growth cone macropinocytosis is important for downstream signaling, neurite targeting, and membrane recycling, implicating Nav1 in one or more of these processes. Depletion of Nav1 also induces transient membrane blebbing via disruption of signaling in the Rho GTPase signaling pathway, supporting the novel role of Nav1 in dynamic actin-based membrane regulation at the cell periphery. These data demonstrate that Nav1 works at the interface of microtubules, actin, and plasma membrane to organize the cell periphery and promote uptake of growth and guidance cues to facilitate neural morphogenesis during development.

	<p>This study examined the comprehension of passive sentences in order to investigate whether individuals with dyslexia rely on parsing heuristics in language comprehension to a greater extent than non-dyslexic readers. One hundred adults (50 dyslexics and 50 controls) read active and passive sentences, and we also manipulated semantic plausibility. Eye movements were monitored, while participants read each sentence, and afterwards, participants answered a comprehension question. We also assessed verbal intelligence and working memory in all participants. Results showed dyslexia status interacted with sentence structure and plausibility, such that participants with dyslexia showed significantly more comprehension errors with passive and implausible sentence. With respect to verbal intelligence and working memory, we found that individuals with lower verbal intelligence were overall more likely to make comprehension errors, and individuals with lower working memory showed particular difficulties with passive and implausible sentences. For reading times, we found that individuals with dyslexia were overall slower readers. These findings suggest that (1) individuals with dyslexia do rely on heuristics to a greater extent than do non-dyslexic individuals, and (2) individual differences variables (e.g., verbal intelligence and working memory) are also related to the use of parsing heuristics. For the latter, lower ability individuals tended to be more consistent with heuristic processing (i.e., good-enough representations).</p>

                Early life exposure to environmental lead (Pb) has been linked to decreased IQ, behavior problems, lower lifetime earnings, and increased criminal activity. Beginning in the 1970s, limits on Pb in paint, gasoline, food cans, and regulated water utilities sharply curtailed US environmental Pb exposure. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of US...

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The distribution patterns of a set of conserved brain developmental regulatory transcription factors were analyzed in the forebrain of the basal actinopterygian fish <i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>, consistent with the prosomeric model. In the telencephalon, the pallium was characterized by ventricular expression of <i>Pax6</i>. In the subpallium, the combined expression of <i>Nkx2.1</i>/Islet-1 (<i>Isl1</i>) allowed to propose ventral and dorsal areas, as the septo-pallidal (<i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i>+) and striatal derivatives (<i>Isl1</i>+), respectively, and a dorsal portion of the striatal derivatives, ventricularly rich in <i>Pax6</i> and devoid of <i>Isl1</i> expression. Dispersed Orthopedia (<i>Otp</i>) cells were found in the supracommissural and posterior nuclei of the ventral telencephalon, related to the medial portion of the amygdaloid complex. The preoptic area was identified by the <i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i> expression. In the alar hypothalamus, an <i>Otp</i>-expressing territory, lacking <i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i>, was identified as the paraventricular domain. The adjacent subparaventricular domain (Spa) was subdivided in a rostral territory expressing <i>Nkx2.1</i> and an <i>Isl1</i>+ caudal one. In the basal hypothalamus, the tuberal region was defined by the <i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i> expression and a rostral <i>Otp</i>-expressing domain was identified. Moreover, the <i>Otp</i>/<i>Nkx2.1</i> combination showed an additional zone lacking <i>Isl1</i>, tentatively identified as the mamillary area. In the diencephalon, both <i>Pax6</i> and <i>Isl1</i> defined the prethalamic domain, and within the basal prosomere 3, scattered <i>Pax6</i>- and <i>Isl1</i>-expressing cells were observed in the posterior tubercle. Finally, a small group of <i>Pax6</i> cells was observed in the pretectal area. These results improve the understanding of the forebrain evolution and demonstrate that its basic <i>bauplan</i> is present very early in the vertebrate lineage.</p>

     alt="DARPP-32 distinguishes a subset of adult-born neurons in zebra finch HVC"/>
<p>We have discovered that the phosphoprotein DARPP-32 is expressed in half of all adult-born neurons (HVC NNs) in the songbird premotor brain region HVC (proper name) during their first month post-mitosis. We demonstrate that DARPP-32+ HVC NNs cannot be backfilled from target nucleus RA, receive putative catecholaminergic synaptic contacts, and have transiently larger nuclei than DARPP-32-neg HVC NNs at one month post-mitosis. These data suggest that there are two distinct subtypes of adult-born neurons in songbird HVC.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult male zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) continually incorporate adult-born neurons into HVC, a telencephalic brain region necessary for the production of learned song. These neurons express activity-dependent immediate early genes (e.g., <i>zenk</i> and <i>c-fos</i>) following song production, suggesting that these neurons are active during song production. Half of these adult-born HVC neurons (HVC NNs) can be backfilled from the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and are a part of the vocal motor pathway underlying learned song production, but the other half do not backfill from RA, and they remain to be characterized. Here, we used cell birth-dating, retrograde tract tracing, and immunofluorescence to demonstrate that half of all HVC NNs express the phosphoprotein DARPP-32, a protein associated with dopamine receptor expression. We also demonstrate that DARPP-32+ HVC NNs are contacted by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive fibers, suggesting that they receive catecholaminergic input, have transiently larger nuclei than DARPP-32-neg HVC NNs, and do not backfill from RA. Taken together, these findings help characterize a group of HVC NNs that have no apparent projections to RA and so far have eluded positive identification other than HVC NN status.</p>

     alt="Pretecto- and ponto-cerebellar pathways to the pigeon oculomotor cerebellum follow a zonal organization"/>
<p>Using injections of retrograde tracers, we show that the medial and lateral pontine nucleus (PM and PL, respectively), and the medial and lateral subdivisions of the medial spiriform nucleus (SpMm and SpMl, respectively) project to different parasagittal zones in the oculomotor cerebellum of the pigeon. We discuss how the pathway to zone A1 processes mainly visuo-motor information to spinal premotor areas, whereas the pathways to zone A2/C processes somato-motor and visuo-motor information and may have a feedback/modulatory role.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Both birds and mammals have relatively large forebrains and cerebella. In mammals, there are extensive sensory–motor projections to the cerebellum through the pontine nuclei originating from several parts of the cerebral cortex. Similar forebrain-to-cerebellum pathways exist in birds, but the organization of this circuitry has not been studied extensively. Birds have two nuclei at the base of the brainstem that are thought to be homologous to the pontine nuclei of mammals, the medial and lateral pontine nuclei (PM, PL). Additionally, birds are unique in that they have a pretectal nucleus called the medial spiriform nucleus (SpM) that, like the pontine nuclei, also receives projections from the forebrain and projects to the oculomotor cerebellum (OCb; folia VI to VIII). The OCb also receives input from the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (LM), which analyzes visual optic flow information resulting from self-movement. In this study, we used single or double injections of fluorescent tracers to study the organization of these inputs from PM, PL, SpM and LM to the OCb in pigeons. We found that these inputs follow a zonal organization. The most medial zone in the OCb, zone A1, receives bilateral inputs from the lateral SpM, PL and LM. Zones A2 and C receive a bilateral projection from the medial SpM, and a mostly contralateral projection from PM and LM. We discuss how the pathway to zone A1 processes mainly visuo-motor information to spinal premotor areas, whereas the pathways to zone A2/C processes somato-motor and visuo-motor information and may have a feedback/modulatory role.</p>

     alt="Distribution and daily oscillation of GABA in the circadian system of the cockroach Rhyparobia maderae"/>
<p>GABA is a prominent neurotransmitter in the circadian system of the Madeira cockroach. The GABA-immunoreactive network overlaps with the arborizations of clock networks expressing pigment-dispersing factor. GABA levels show daily fluctuations with maximum concentrations during the inactivity phase of the cockroach during the day, suggesting a sleep promoting role.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter in nervous systems promoting sleep in both mammals and insects. In the Madeira cockroach, sleep-wake cycles are controlled by a circadian clock network in the brain's optic lobes, centered in the accessory medulla (AME) with its innervating pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) expressing clock neurons at the anterior-ventral rim of the medulla. GABA is present in cell clusters that innervate different circuits of the cockroach's AME clock, without colocalizing in PDF clock neurons. Physiological, immunohistochemical, and behavioral assays provided evidence for a role of GABA in light entrainment, possibly via the distal tract that connects the AME's glomeruli to the medulla. Furthermore, GABA was implemented in clock outputs to multiple effector systems in optic lobe and midbrain. Here, GABAergic brain circuits were analyzed further, focusing on the circadian system in search for sleep/wake controlling brain circuits. All GABA-immunoreactive neurons of the cockroach brain were also stained with an antiserum against the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. We found strong overlap of the distribution of GABA-immunoreactive networks with PDF clock networks in optic lobes and midbrain. Neurons in five of the six soma groups that innervate the clock exhibited GABA immunoreactivity. The intensity of GABA immunoreactivity in the distal tract showed daily fluctuations with maximum staining intensity in the middle of the day and weakest staining at the end of the day. Quantification via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, likewise, showed higher GABA levels in the optic lobe during the inactivity phase of the cockroach during the day and lower levels during its activity phase at dusk. Our data further support the hypothesis that light- and PDF-dependently the circadian clock network of the cockroach controls GABA levels and thereby promotes sleep during the day.</p>

<p>We studied the postnatal reorganization of callosal connections linking multiple cortical areas with ferret primary visual cortex during the period from just before eye opening (4 weeks) to 10 weeks of age. Like intrahemispheric circuits there is a significant areal rearrangement of callosal sources, but unlike intrahemispheric circuits there is no laminar reorganization of callosal sources. These results reveal important similarities and differences in the postnatal reorganization of inter- and intrahemispheric projections to primary visual cortex.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corticocortical connections link visual cortical areas in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. We studied the postnatal refinement of callosal connections linking multiple cortical areas with ferret area 17 during the period from just before eye opening (4 weeks) to 10 weeks of age. We aimed to determine (1) whether callosal projections from multiple visual cortical areas to area 17 refine with a similar rate and (2) whether the refinement of callosal projections parallels that of intrahemispheric cortical circuits. We injected the bidirectional tracer CTb into area 17, and mapped the areal and laminar distribution of labeled cells in visual areas of the contralateral hemisphere. Like intrahemispheric projections, callosal inputs to area 17 before eye opening are dominated by Suprasylvian area Ssy (with lesser and comparable input from areas 17, 18, 19, and 21), but within 2 weeks of eye opening are jointly dominated by area 18 and Ssy inputs; however, there are fewer labeled cells in the contralateral hemisphere. Unlike intrahemispheric projections, there is no laminar reorganization of callosal inputs; in all visual areas and at all ages studied, the greatest proportion of callosal projections arises from the infragranular layers. Also, unlike intrahemispheric projections, the peak density of callosal cells in each area projecting to area 17 declines more modestly. These results reveal important similarities and differences in the postnatal reorganization of inter- and intrahemispheric projections to area 17.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The benefits of mindfulness in mental healthcare professionals [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout is a widely reported syndrome consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a lowered sense of accomplishment. Mindfulness practices have been shown to be useful in lowering distress and burnout in clinical and non-clinical cohorts. Our aim was to explore the potential personal and occupational benefits of a structured mindfulness intervention on a cohort of mental health professionals. A mixed-methods approach was utilised in order to enhance the exploratory power of the study. Methods: We conducted a pilot study involving healthcare practitioners employed at a community outpatient mental health clinic. As a pilot, we relied on a single group and implemented a quasi-experimental, simultaneous mixed methods design by incorporating both quantitative pre- and post- testing alongside written qualitative post-test responses. Results: Analysis of the data demonstrated a significant difference between overall mindfulness when comparing post-test (mean=140.8, standard deviation=18.9) with pre-test data (mean=128.3, standard deviation=28.6). Participants also showed a statistically significant difference in three of the subscales: observation, describing, and non-reactivity. A moderate effect size was seen for each of the above differences.  Analysis of the qualitative data revealed a range of potential themes which may be used to explain the differences exhibited across participants’ personal and professional lives, which can be grouped into two thematic overarching groups: emotional reactivity and listening/communicating. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study indicate that a structured, six-week mindfulness program has the potential to benefit clinicians, personally by reducing emotional reactivity and professionally by promoting deep listening and communication.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ngsJulia: population genetic analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing data with Julia language [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                A sound analysis of DNA sequencing data is important to extract meaningful information and infer quantities of interest. Sequencing and mapping errors coupled with low and variable coverage hamper the identification of genotypes and variants and the estimation of population genetic parameters. Methods and implementations to estimate population genetic parameters from sequencing data available nowadays either are suitable for the analysis of genomes from model organisms only, require moderate sequencing coverage, or are not easily adaptable to specific applications. To address these issues, we introduce ngsJulia, a collection of templates and functions in Julia language to process short-read sequencing data for population genetic analysis. We further describe two implementations, ngsPool and ngsPloidy, for the analysis of pooled sequencing data and polyploid genomes, respectively. Through simulations, we illustrate the performance of estimating various population genetic parameters using these implementations, using both established and novel statistical methods. These results inform on optimal experimental design and demonstrate the applicabil- ity of methods in ngsJulia to estimate parameters of interest even from low coverage sequencing data. ngsJulia provide users with a flexible and efficient framework for ad hoc analysis of sequencing data.ngsJulia is available from: https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsJulia

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">TRAIT2D: a Software for Quantitative Analysis of Single Particle Diffusion Data [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Single particle tracking (SPT) is one of the most widely used tools in optical microscopy to evaluate particle mobility in a variety of situations, including cellular and model membrane dynamics. Recent technological developments, such as Interferometric Scattering microscopy, have allowed recording of long, uninterrupted single particle trajectories at kilohertz framerates. The resulting data, where particles are continuously detected and do not displace much between observations, thereby do not require complex linking algorithms. Moreover, while these measurements offer more details into the short-term diffusion behaviour of the tracked particles, they are also subject to the influence of localisation uncertainties, which are often underestimated by conventional analysis pipelines. we thus developed a Python library, under the name of TRAIT2D (Tracking Analysis Toolbox – 2D version), in order to track particle diffusion at high sampling rates, and analyse the resulting trajectories with an innovative approach. The data analysis pipeline introduced is more localisation-uncertainty aware, and also selects the most appropriate diffusion model for the data provided on a statistical basis. A trajectory simulation platform also allows the user to handily generate trajectories and even synthetic time-lapses to test alternative tracking algorithms and data analysis approaches. A high degree of customisation for the analysis pipeline, for example with the introduction of different diffusion modes, is possible from the source code. Finally, the presence of graphical user interfaces lowers the access barrier for users with little to no programming experience.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Roles and Problems of Stroke Caregivers: A Qualitative Study in Yogyakarta, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Caregivers play a central role in post-stroke patients' care. However, the role of and problems managed by caregivers have not been widely studied, particularly in Indonesia. This study aims to explore the roles and problems of caregivers in post- stroke patients’ care. Method: This was a qualitative study. Seven caregivers of post-stroke patients from the homecare clinic of Dr Sardjito General Hospital were purposely selected during January 2017 to June 2018. Focus group discussions were conducted to explore the roles and problems of caregiving. Results: Themes related to caregivers’ roles were: connecting patients with medical personnel and other family members, maintaining patients’ health conditions by fulfilling basic needs and assisting rehabilitation, as well as maintaining patients’ psychological conditions by encouraging conversation, telling jokes, or recreation. On the other hand, themes related to caregivers’ problems were: lack of knowledge caused by education inadequacy, underappreciated and unconcerned family, suboptimal service including limited physiotherapy and pharmacy resource, unthorough administration, lack of communication, physical limitations, and burnout, as well as uncooperative patients. Conclusions: Caregivers play essential roles as communicators and help to maintain patient's health conditions. Common problems are related to a lack of knowledge about strokes and a lack of attention from family. Further research to study the effects of these findings on the quality of life of both patient and their caregiver, as well as how to handle the caregiver issues should be investigated.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The genetic causes of male infertility: a Middle East and North Africa perspective [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Male infertility is attributable to 50% of total infertility cases and about 30% of these cases remain idiopathic. In the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), male infertility affects about 22.6% of men of reproductive age. Male infertility is caused by a variety of factors, including endocrine disruption, exposure to toxins, lifestyle, genetic and epigenetic modifications. Genetic modifications, including chromosomal abnormalities, chromosomal rearrangements, Y chromosome microdeletions and single-gene mutations, explain for about 10-15% of infertility cases. Since genetic aberration is a key player in the pathogenesis of male infertility, it is important to explore the impact in the MENA region due to the high incidence of male infertility. Therefore, the current study aims to systematically analyse the literature regarding the impact and common causes of male infertility in the MENA region. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases. Following the search, a total of 126 articles was retrieved, of which 12 were duplicates and another 69 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria, totaling the exclusion of 81 articles. Studies excluded were those that had patient populations originating outside the MENA region, review articles, non-English written articles, or studies where the patient population was under 18 years of age. Findings showed that the frequent genetic aberration leading to male infertility in these regions include Y chromosome microdeletions, gene polymorphisms or copy number variations, mitochondrial microdeletions and other genetic deletions or mutations. In lieu of this, diverse clinical genetic tests should be made available for the proper diagnosis of male infertility.

                The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program seeks to accelerate the development of therapeutic devices that modulate electrical activity in nerves to improve organ function. SPARC-funded researchers are generating rich datasets from neuromodulation research that are curated and shared according to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) guidelines and are accessible to the public on the SPARC data portal. Keeping track of the utilization of these datasets within the larger research community is a feature that will benefit data-generating researchers in showcasing the impact of their SPARC outcomes. This will also allow the SPARC program to display the impact of the FAIR data curation and sharing practices that have been implemented. This manuscript provides the methods and outcomes of SPARClink, our web tool for visualizing the impact of SPARC, which won the Second prize at the 2021 SPARC FAIR Codeathon. With SPARClink, we built a system that automatically and continuously finds new published SPARC scientific outputs (datasets, publications, protocols) and the external resources referring to them. SPARC datasets and protocols are queried using publicly accessible REST application programming interfaces (APIs, provided by Pennsieve and Protocols.io) and stored in a publicly accessible database. Citation information for these resources is retrieved using the NIH reporter API and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez system. A novel knowledge graph-based structure was created to visualize the results of these queries and showcase the impact that the FAIR data principles can have on the research landscape when they are adopted by a consortium.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A case series of ocular involvement in bullous pemphigoid: clinical features, management, and outcomes [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Ocular involvement in cases of bullous pemphigoid is rare and when present, the signs are usually subtle and in the form of fine tarsal scarring and dry eye disease. The current report aims to describe the clinical features and management protocols in a series of cases with aggressive ocular manifestations at presentation. All cases of bullous pemphigoid seen between 2017 and 2020 were included in this retrospective case series. Data regarding the clinical features, treatment administered, and outcomes was collected. Five cases (n=10 eyes) of bullous pemphigoid disease with ocular involvement were included. All eyes had significant cicatricial conjunctival changes in the form of symblephara, inferior forniceal shortening, and tarsal conjunctival scarring. Conjunctival granulomas were present in 3/10 eyes. Corneal involvement in the form of punctate keratitis was present in all eyes while 4/10 eyes had an epithelial defect as well. The management of these cases involved topical therapy with corticosteroids and lubricants (n=10 eyes) while pulse doses of intravenous methyl prednisolone were administered in 5/5 cases. Pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide was supplemented in 2/5 cases. Adequate control of the disease was noted in 3/5 cases while one case had a recalcitrant form of the disease and developed a dermalised ocular surface in both eyes. The last patient was lost to follow up during the course of therapy. Bullous pemphigoid can present with an aggressive form of cicatrizing conjunctivitis similar to other variants of autoimmune blistering disorders and must be considered as a differential in cases presenting with ocular cicatricial disease. Long-term intensive immunosuppression is required for the management of these cases to preserve the visual function and the integrity of the globe.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Statutory lien: pre- and post- 2016 amendments to the Malaysian National Land Code [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A statutory lien is a non-registrable security dealing under the National Land Code (NLC) in Malaysia. Lien is usually used as a short-term collateral for a repayment of debt by the proprietor. Prior to the 2016 amendments, section 281(1) of the NLC stated that a proprietor may create a lien over his land by depositing the original title with the lender, as security for a loan; and the lender shall enter a lien-holder’s caveat under section 330(1) to protect his interests. Case law has expanded the scope of section 281 to include an equitable proprietor under the definition of “proprietor” and a third-party loan with the proprietor’s consent or authority under the definition of “loan”. The 2016 amendments removed “for a loan” in sections 281(1) and 330(1). This triggers the analysis on the purposes of lien. Methods: The research methodology adopted is doctrinal legal research. Relevant sections and case law together with the Bill and Parliament’s Hansard record are examined to find the intention of the legislature and Parliament. Results: The amendments allow the lien to be used not merely as security for a loan but also for other purposes (Explanation Note 47 to the Bill). Such deletions have created an ambiguous interpretation; and may be manipulated by fraudsters. In contrast, section 241(1) provides specific purposes such as the repayment of debt, non-debt, or payment of annuity or periodic sum, for the creation of statutory charge. Conclusions: This research is only confined to the scope of lien within the Peninsular Malaysia and not the States of Sabah and Sarawak which have their respective Sabah Land Ordinance and Sarawak Land Code. A future comparative study could be made amongst the legislations. The research output may be useful for the draftsman to clear up the ambiguity in the relevant provisions.

                Background Many studies have assessed the quality of news reports about the effects of health interventions, but there has been no systematic review of such studies or meta-analysis of their results. We aimed to fill this gap (PROSPERO ID: CRD42018095032). Methods We included studies that used at least one explicit, prespecified and generic criterion to assess the quality of news reports in print, broadcast, or online news media, and specified the sampling frame, and the selection criteria and technique. We assessed criteria individually for inclusion in the meta-analyses, excluding ineligible criteria and criteria with inadequately reported results. We mapped and grouped criteria to facilitate evidence synthesis. Where possible, we extracted the proportion of news reports meeting the included criterion. We performed meta-analyses using a random effects model to estimate such proportions for individual criteria and some criteria groups, and to characterise heterogeneity across studies.  Results We included 44 primary studies in the review, and 18 studies and 108 quality criteria in the meta-analyses. Many news reports gave an unbalanced and oversimplified picture of the potential consequences of interventions. A limited number mention or adequately address conflicts of interest (22%; 95% CI 7%-49%) (low certainty), alternative interventions (36%; 95% CI 26%-47%) (moderate certainty), potential harms (40%; 95% CI 23%-61%) (low certainty), or costs (18%; 95% CI 12%-28%) (moderate certainty), or quantify effects (53%; 95% CI 36%-69%) (low certainty) or report absolute effects (17%; 95% CI 4%-49%) (low certainty).  Discussion There is room for improving health news, but it is logically more important to improve the public’s ability to critically appraise health information and make judgements for themselves.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) patterns and mortality: a retrospective case-control study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low and medium income countries (LMICs) such as Kenya experience nearly three times more cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to high income countries (HICs). This is primarily exacerbated by weak health systems especially at the pre-hospital care level. Generating local empirical evidence on TBI patterns and its influence on patient mortality outcomes is fundamental in informing the design of trauma-specific emergency medical service (EMS) interventions at the pre-hospital care level. This study determines the influence of TBI patterns and mortality. Methods: This was a case-control study with a sample of 316 TBI patients. Data was abstracted from medical records for the period of January 2017 to March 2019 in three tertiary trauma care facilities in Kenya. Logistic regression was used to assess influence of trauma patterns on TBI mortality, controlling for patient characteristics and other potential confounders. Results: The majority of patients were aged below 40 years (73%) and were male (85%). Road traffic injuries (RTIs) comprised 58% of all forms of trauma. Blunt trauma comprised 71% of the injuries. Trauma mechanism was the only trauma pattern significantly associated with TBI mortality. The risk of dying for patients sustaining RTIs was 2.83 times more likely compared to non-RTI patients [odds ratio (OR) 2.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-4.93, p=0.001]. The type of transfer to hospital was also significantly associated with mortality outcome, with a public hospital having a two times higher risk of death compared to a private hospital [OR 2.18 95%CI 1.21-3.94, p<0.009]. Conclusion: Trauma mechanism (RTI vs non-RTI) and type of tertiary facility patients are transferred to (public vs private) are key factors influencing TBI mortality burden. Strengthening local EMS trauma response systems targeting RTIs augmented by adequately resourced and equipped public facilities to provide quality lifesaving interventions can reduce the burden of TBIs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Criticality enhances the multilevel reliability of stimulus responses in cortical neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Junhao Liang, Changsong Zhou</p>

Cortical neural networks exhibit high internal variability in spontaneous dynamic activities and they can robustly and reliably respond to external stimuli with multilevel features–from microscopic irregular spiking of neurons to macroscopic oscillatory local field potential. A comprehensive study integrating these multilevel features in spontaneous and stimulus–evoked dynamics with seemingly distinct mechanisms is still lacking. Here, we study the stimulus–response dynamics of biologically plausible excitation–inhibition (E–I) balanced networks. We confirm that networks around critical synchronous transition states can maintain strong internal variability but are sensitive to external stimuli. In this dynamical region, applying a stimulus to the network can reduce the trial-to-trial variability and shift the network oscillatory frequency while preserving the dynamical criticality. These multilevel features widely observed in different experiments cannot simultaneously occur in non-critical dynamical states. Furthermore, the dynamical mechanisms underlying these multilevel features are revealed using a semi-analytical mean-field theory that derives the macroscopic network field equations from the microscopic neuronal networks, enabling the analysis by nonlinear dynamics theory and linear noise approximation. The generic dynamical principle revealed here contributes to a more integrative understanding of neural systems and brain functions and incorporates multimodal and multilevel experimental observations. The E–I balanced neural network in combination with the effective mean-field theory can serve as a mechanistic modeling framework to study the multilevel neural dynamics underlying neural information and cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identification of dynamic mass-action biochemical reaction networks using sparse Bayesian methods</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard Jiang, Prashant Singh, Fredrik Wrede, Andreas Hellander, Linda Petzold</p>

Identifying the reactions that govern a dynamical biological system is a crucial but challenging task in systems biology. In this work, we present a data-driven method to infer the underlying biochemical reaction system governing a set of observed species concentrations over time. We formulate the problem as a regression over a large, but limited, mass-action constrained reaction space and utilize sparse Bayesian inference via the regularized horseshoe prior to produce robust, interpretable biochemical reaction networks, along with uncertainty estimates of parameters. The resulting systems of chemical reactions and posteriors inform the biologist of potentially several reaction systems that can be further investigated. We demonstrate the method on two examples of recovering the dynamics of an unknown reaction system, to illustrate the benefits of improved accuracy and information obtained.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analytical kinetic model of native tandem promoters in E. coli</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vatsala Chauhan, Mohamed N. M. Bahrudeen, Cristina S. D. Palma, Ines S. C. Baptista, Bilena L. B. Almeida, Suchintak Dash, Vinodh Kandavalli, Andre S. Ribeiro</p>

Closely spaced promoters in tandem formation are abundant in bacteria. We investigated the evolutionary conservation, biological functions, and the RNA and single-cell protein expression of genes regulated by tandem promoters in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. We also studied the sequence (distance between transcription start sites ‘<i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub><i>’</i>, pause sequences, and distances from oriC) and potential influence of the input transcription factors of these promoters. From this, we propose an analytical model of gene expression based on measured expression dynamics, where RNAP-promoter occupancy times and <i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub> are the key regulators of transcription interference due to TSS occlusion by RNAP at one of the promoters (when <i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub> ≤ 35 bp) and RNAP occupancy of the downstream promoter (when <i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub> > 35 bp). Occlusion and downstream promoter occupancy are modeled as linear functions of occupancy time, while the influence of <i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub> <i>i</i>s implemented by a continuous step function, fit to <i>in vivo</i> data on mean single-cell protein numbers of 30 natural genes controlled by tandem promoters. The best-fitting step is at 35 bp, matching the length of DNA occupied by RNAP in the open complex formation. This model accurately predicts the squared coefficient of variation and skewness of the natural single-cell protein numbers as a function of <i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub>. Additional predictions suggest that promoters in tandem formation can cover a wide range of transcription dynamics within realistic intervals of parameter values. By accurately capturing the dynamics of these promoters, this model can be helpful to predict the dynamics of new promoters and contribute to the expansion of the repertoire of expression dynamics available to synthetic genetic constructs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sparse connectivity for MAP inference in linear models using sister mitral cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sina Tootoonian, Andreas T. Schaefer, Peter E. Latham</p>

Sensory processing is hard because the variables of interest are encoded in spike trains in a relatively complex way. A major goal in studies of sensory processing is to understand how the brain extracts those variables. Here we revisit a common encoding model in which variables are encoded linearly. Although there are typically more variables than neurons, this problem is still solvable because only a small number of variables appear at any one time (sparse prior). However, previous solutions require all-to-all connectivity, inconsistent with the sparse connectivity seen in the brain. Here we propose an algorithm that provably reaches the MAP (maximum <i>a posteriori</i>) inference solution, but does so using sparse connectivity. Our algorithm is inspired by the circuit of the mouse olfactory bulb, but our approach is general enough to apply to other modalities. In addition, it should be possible to extend it to nonlinear encoding models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Nurturing diversity and inclusion in AI in Biomedicine through a virtual summer program for high school students</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomiko Oskotsky, Ruchika Bajaj, Jillian Burchard, Taylor Cavazos, Ina Chen, Will Connell, Stephanie Eaneff, Tianna Grant, Ishan Kanungo, Karla Lindquist, Douglas Myers-Turnbull, Zun Zar Chi Naing, Alice Tang, Bianca Vora, Jon Wang, Isha Karim, Claire Swadling, Janice Yang, AI4ALL Student Cohort 2020 , Bill Lindstaedt, Marina Sirota</p>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the power to improve our lives through a wide variety of applications, many of which fall into the healthcare space; however, a lack of diversity is contributing to limitations in how broadly AI can help people. The UCSF AI4ALL program was established in 2019 to address this issue by targeting high school students from underrepresented backgrounds in AI, giving them a chance to learn about AI with a focus on biomedicine, and promoting diversity and inclusion. In 2020, the UCSF AI4ALL three-week program was held entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, students participated virtually to gain experience with AI, interact with diverse role models in AI, and learn about advancing health through AI. Specifically, they attended lectures in coding and AI, received an in-depth research experience through hands-on projects exploring COVID-19, and engaged in mentoring and personal development sessions with faculty, researchers, industry professionals, and undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom were women and from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds. At the conclusion of the program, the students presented the results of their research projects at our final symposium. Comparison of pre- and post-program survey responses from students demonstrated that after the program, significantly more students were familiar with how to work with data and to evaluate and apply machine learning algorithms. There were also nominally significant increases in the students’ knowing people in AI from historically underrepresented groups, feeling confident in discussing AI, and being aware of careers in AI. We found that we were able to engage young students in AI via our online training program and nurture greater diversity in AI. This work can guide AI training programs aspiring to engage and educate students entirely online, and motivate people in AI to strive towards increasing diversity and inclusion in this field.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fast and accurate influenza forecasting in the United States with Inferno</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dave Osthus</p>

Infectious disease forecasting is an emerging field and has the potential to improve public health through anticipatory resource allocation, situational awareness, and mitigation planning. By way of exploring and operationalizing disease forecasting, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted FluSight since the 2013/14 flu season, an annual flu forecasting challenge. Since FluSight’s onset, forecasters have developed and improved forecasting models in an effort to provide more timely, reliable, and accurate information about the likely progression of the outbreak. While improving the predictive performance of these forecasting models is often the primary objective, it is also important for a forecasting model to run quickly, facilitating further model development and improvement while providing flexibility when deployed in a real-time setting. In this vein I introduce Inferno, a fast and accurate flu forecasting model inspired by Dante, the top performing model in the 2018/19 FluSight challenge. When pseudoprospectively compared to all models that participated in FluSight 2018/19, Inferno would have placed 2nd in the national and regional challenge as well as the state challenge, behind only Dante. Inferno, however, runs in minutes and is trivially parallelizable, while Dante takes hours to run, representing a significant operational improvement with minimal impact to performance. Forecasting challenges like FluSight should continue to monitor and evaluate how they can be modified and expanded to incentivize the development of forecasting models that benefit public health.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Subicular neurons represent multiple variables of a hippocampal-dependent task by using theta rhythm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Su-Min Lee, Jae-Min Seol, Inah Lee</p>

The subiculum is positioned at a critical juncture at the interface of the hippocampus with the rest of the brain. However, the exact roles of the subiculum in most hippocampal-dependent memory tasks remain largely unknown. One obstacle to make comparisons of neural firing patterns between the subiculum and hippocampus is the broad firing fields of the subicular cells. Here, we used spiking phases in relation to theta rhythm to parse the broad firing field of a subicular neuron into multiple subfields to find the unique functional contribution of the subiculum while male rats performed a hippocampal-dependent visual scene memory task. Some of the broad firing fields of the subicular neurons were successfully divided into multiple subfields similar to those in the CA1 by using the theta phase precession cycle. The new paradigm significantly improved the detection of task-relevant information in subicular cells without affecting the information content represented by CA1 cells. Notably, we found that multiple fields of a single subicular neuron, unlike those in the CA1, carried heterogeneous task-related information such as visual context and choice response. Our findings suggest that the subicular cells integrate multiple task-related factors by using theta rhythm to associate environmental context with action.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The product science of electrically heated tobacco products: a narrative review of the scientific literature [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Heated tobacco products represent a novel category of tobacco products in which a tobacco consumable is heated to a temperature that releases nicotine from the tobacco leaf but not to a temperature sufficient to cause combustion. Heated tobacco products may therefore have the potential to be a less harmful alternative for adult smokers that would otherwise continue to smoke conventional cigarettes. Given the rapid development of this product category, the aim of this review was to examine the available peer-reviewed scientific evidence related to heated tobacco products and highlight any research gaps. In recent years, manufacturers of heated tobacco products have published a number of studies on their respective heated tobacco products. Whilst there is limited research that is independent of commercial interests, the available scientific evidence indicates that heated tobacco products produce a much simpler aerosol than conventional cigarette smoke, with fewer and substantially lower levels of harmful toxicants. Toxicology assessments indicate these reductions in aerosol toxicants translate to reduced biological effects. Biomarker and clinical data from studies in which product use is controlled within a clinical setting, indicate changes in biomarker levels and clinical end-points similar to observations in cessation studies, indicating the potential for reduced harm. The scientific evidence also indicates that exposure of non-users to emissions from heated tobacco products in indoor environments is significantly reduced compared to exposure resulting from smoking conventional cigarettes. Overall, the available scientific evidence indicates that heated tobacco products hold promise as a less harmful alternative to conventional cigarettes, but more independent data is required to validate industry findings. As a growing product category, epidemiological studies and independent population modelling studies are outstanding, and empirical data on how dual tobacco product category use by consumers affects their risk profile is lacking.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quantification of the effects of chimerism on read mapping, differential expression and annotation following short-read de novo assembly. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: De novo assembly is often required for analysing short-read RNA sequencing data. An under-characterized aspect of the contigs produced is chimerism, the extent to which affects mapping, differential expression analysis and annotation. Despite long-read sequencing negating this issue, short-reads remain in use through on-going research and archived datasets created during the last two decades. Consequently, there is still a need to quantify chimerism and its effects.    Methods: Effects on mapping were quantified by simulating reads off the Drosophila melanogaster cDNA library and mapping these to related reference sets containing increasing levels of chimerism. Next, ten read datasets were simulated and divided into two conditions where, within one, reads representing 1000 randomly selected transcripts were over-represented across replicates. Differential expression analysis was performed iteratively with increasing chimerism within the reference set. Finally, an expectation of r-squared values describing the relationship between alignment and transcript lengths for matches involving cDNA library transcripts and those within sets containing incrementing chimerism was created. Similar values calculated for contigs produced by three graph-based assemblers, relative to the cDNA library from which input reads were simulated, or sequenced (relative to the species represented), were compared.    Results: At 5% and 95% chimerism within reference sets, 100% and 77% of reads still mapped, making mapping success a poor indicator of chimerism. At 5% chimerism, of the 1000 transcripts selected for over-representation, 953 were identified during differential expression analysis; at 10% 936 were identified, while at 95% it was 510. This indicates that despite mapping success, per-transcript counts are unpredictably altered. R-squared values obtained for the three assemblers suggest that between 5-15% of contigs are chimeric.     Conclusions: Although not evident based on mapping, chimerism had a significant impact on differential expression analysis and megablast identification. This will have consequences for past and present experiments involving short-reads.

                Background: The emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic threw the world into turmoil. The medical community bore the brunt of the pandemic's toll. Long work hours, and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and social support all had an influence on mental health. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among Lumbini Medical College Teaching Hospital students and employees in Palpa, Nepal. Data entailing their demographic details, pre-existing comorbidities, or death in the family due to COVID-19 was collected using a self-administered survey. In addition, the level of fear, anxiety, obsession, and functional impairment due to COVID-19 was recorded using previously validated respective scales. Results: In total, 403 health-care workers and trainees participated in our study. The average age of the study participants was 23±4 years, and more than half of them (n=262, 65%) were females. A significant association was found between fear score with age (p-value=0.04), gender (p-value <0.01) and occupation (p-value<0.001). The participants suffering from chronic diseases (p-value=0.36), and those who had experienced a COVID-19 death in the family (p-value=0.18), were not found to be significantly obsessed with COVID-19. However, for those who had experienced a COVID-19 death in the family (p-value=0.51) and age (p-value=0.34), these factors were not found to be significantly associated with higher anxiety levels. Nursing students suffered from a significantly greater functional impairment than other medical professionals (mean score=269.15, p-value < 0.001). A moderately positive correlation was observed between fear, anxiety, obsession, and functional impairment scales. Conclusion: This study revealed various socio-demographic characteristics as risk factors for psychological stress in the people related to the health-care profession of Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic. A viable answer to this quandary might be adequate psychosocial intervention by health-care authorities, increased social support, and the introduction of better mental health management measures for the front-line medical workers.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Personalized fMRI Delineates Functional Regions Preserved within Brain Tumors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence from invasive cortical stimulation mapping and noninvasive neuroimaging studies indicates that brain function may be preserved within brain tumors. However, a noninvasive approach to accurately and comprehensively delineate individual-specific functional networks in the whole brain, especially in brain tissues within and surrounding tumors, is still lacking. The purpose of the study is to develop a clinically useful technique that can map functional regions within tumoral brains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed an individual-specific functional network parcellation approach using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) that effectively captured functional networks within and nearby tumors in 20 patients. We examined the accuracy of the functional maps using invasive cortical stimulation and task response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that approximately 33.2% of the tumoral mass appeared to be functionally active and demonstrated robust functional connectivity with non-tumoral brain regions. Functional networks nearby tumors were validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping. Intratumoral sensorimotor networks mapped by our technique could be distinguished by their distinct cortico-cerebellar connectivity patterns and were consistent with hand movement evoked fMRI task activations. Furthermore, in some patients, cognitive networks that were detected in the tumor mass showed long-distance and distributed functional connectivity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our noninvasive approach to mapping individual-specific functional networks using rsfMRI represents a promising new tool for identifying regions with preserved functional connectivity within and surrounding brain tumors, and could be used as a complement to presurgical planning for patients undergoing tumor resection surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The implications of Industry 4.0 on supply chains amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions in supply chains. It has increased the demand for products and decreased the supply of raw materials. This has interrupted many production processes. The emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 have the potential to streamline supply chains by improving time-sensitive customized solutions during this emergency. Purpose: The study identifies the core technologies of Industry 4.0 and the role and impact of these technologies in managing the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in strengthening the supply chain resilience. Design/methodology/approach: An extensive literature review using the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” method was carried out on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains and Industry 4.0 technologies. The study was undertaken by selecting keywords validated by experts, and a search was conducted in the Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases. Publications from the leading journals on these topics were selected. The bibliographical search resulted in 1484 articles, followed by multiple layers of filtering. Finally, the most pertinent articles were selected for review, and a total of 42 articles were analyzed. Findings: The findings of the study showed that the majority of the articles emphasized the digitalization of supply chain management, acknowledging the fundamentals, applications, and prospects, revealing the drivers and challenges of Industry 4.0 technologies to manage disruptions. Most of the authors identified IoT, big data, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, and blockchain to maintain the supply chain resilience. Originality/value: Existing literature on epidemics lacks the basics and practices of utilizing Industry 4.0 technologies in the supply chain recovery process. To fill this research gap, the study summarizes the potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to lessen supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19. The study findings are valuable for policymakers and practitioners and contribute to supply chain management studies.

                Cavazzoni et al. show that Tfh and Tfr cells are both essential for optimization of germinal center responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Limiting Tfh cells results in less SARS-CoV-2 GC responses and lower affinity maturation, whereas limiting Tfr cells promotes non-antigen specific GC responses leading to lower affinity maturation. Altered Tfh/Tfr responses in aging result in unique bimodal antibody responses.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 31 January 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28228-5">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-28228-5</a></p>Back-arc spreading centre jumps have been suggested to be controlled by a number of different drivers. Here, the authors, using 3D numerical models, show that transform faults can trigger back-arc spreading centre jumps, without the need of any ad hoc factors.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 31 January 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28243-6">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-28243-6</a></p>There is an unmet need to discover suitable targets for CAR-T therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here the authors show that GRP78, a key regulator of the unfolded protein response, is highly expressed on the surface of primary AML blasts, but not on normal lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells, and that GRP78-CAR T have anti-AML activity in preclinical models.
