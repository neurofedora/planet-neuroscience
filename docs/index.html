              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20364">Exploring internal representation of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.20364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.

Abstract: In the human brain, white matter development is a complex and long-lasting process involving intermingling micro-and macrostructural mechanisms, such as fiber growth, pruning and myelination. Did you know that all these neurodevelopmental changes strongly affect MRI signals, with consequences on tractography performances and reliability? This communication aims to elaborate on these aspects, highlighting the importance of tracking and studying the developing connections with dedicated approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20744">DB-GNN: Dual-Branch Graph Neural Network with Multi-Level Contrastive Learning for Jointly Identifying Within- and Cross-Frequency Coupled Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.20744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within-frequency coupling (WFC) and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in brain networks reflect neural synchronization within the same frequency band and cross-band oscillatory interactions, respectively. Their synergy provides a comprehensive understanding of neural mechanisms underlying cognitive states such as emotion. However, existing multi-channel EEG studies often analyze WFC or CFC separately, failing to fully leverage their complementary properties. This study proposes a dual-branch graph neural network (DB-GNN) to jointly identify within- and cross-frequency coupled brain networks. Firstly, DBGNN leverages its unique dual-branch learning architecture to efficiently mine global collaborative information and local cross-frequency and within-frequency coupling information. Secondly, to more fully perceive the global information of cross-frequency and within-frequency coupling, the global perception branch of DB-GNN adopts a Transformer architecture. To prevent overfitting of the Transformer architecture, this study integrates prior within- and cross-frequency coupling information into the Transformer inference process, thereby enhancing the generalization capability of DB-GNN. Finally, a multi-scale graph contrastive learning regularization term is introduced to constrain the global and local perception branches of DB-GNN at both graph-level and node-level, enhancing its joint perception ability and further improving its generalization performance. Experimental validation on the emotion recognition dataset shows that DB-GNN achieves a testing accuracy of 97.88% and an F1- score of 97.87%, reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

                arXiv:2504.20588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency response function (FRF) is an established way to describe the outcome of experiments in posture control literature. The FRF is an empirical transfer function between an input stimulus and the induced body segment sway profile, represented as a vector of complex values associated with a vector of frequencies. For this reason, testing the components of the FRF independently with Bonferroni correction can result in a too-conservative approach. Performing statistics on scalar values defined on the FRF, e.g., comparing the averages, implies an arbitrary decision by the experimenter. This work proposes bootstrap prediction and confidence bands as general methods to evaluate the outcome of posture control experiments, overcoming the foretold limitations of previously used approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15477">Observing hidden neuronal states in experiments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2308.15477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit voltage-clamp electrophysiology, a feedback-control method that has successfully been applied to study neuronal (non)linear current-voltage relationships. Yet its full scope has not been explored to date. We reinterpret the voltage-clamp protocol under slow variation of the feedback reference signal using the language of multiple-timescale dynamical systems theory. Gauged under this new epistemic step, we unveil non-observable (hidden) states. More specifically, the experimental measurements from voltage clamp can be put into correspondence with predictions of both stable and unstable states from dynamical systems theory. We demonstrate a general protocol for constructing systematically experimental steady-state bifurcation diagrams for electrophysiologically active cells. We perform our experiments on entorhinal cortex neurons, both excitatory (pyramidal neurons) and inhibitiory (interneurons). Moreover, employing a current-clamp open-loop electrophysiology protocol with slow variation of an applied electrical current drives the neuron to dynamically transition between its observable rest states and its observable spiking states, hence revealing experimental dynamic bifurcations. Overlaying the two aforementioned protocols produces a map of all these neuronal states and effectively leads to an experimental validation of the classical slow-fast dissection method introduced by J. Rinzel in the 1980s and routinely applied ever since in order to analyse slow-fast neuronal models. Our approach opens doors to observing further complex hidden states with more advanced control strategies, allowing to control real cells beyond pharmacological manipulations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12645">Implementing feature binding through dendritic networks of a single neuron</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.12645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A single neuron receives an extensive array of synaptic inputs through its dendrites, raising the fundamental question of how these inputs undergo integration and summation, culminating in the initiation of spikes in the soma. Experimental and computational investigations have revealed various modes of integration operations that include linear, superlinear, and sublinear summation. Interestingly, distinct neuron types exhibit diverse patterns of dendritic integration contingent upon the spatial distribution of dendrites. The functional implications of these specific integration modalities remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ the Purkinje cell as a model system to investigate these intricate questions. Our findings reveal that Purkinje cells (PCs) generally exhibit sublinear summation across their expansive dendrites. The degree of sublinearity is dynamically modulated by both spatial and temporal input. Strong sublinearity necessitates that the synaptic distribution in PCs be globally scattered sensitive, whereas weak sublinearity facilitates the generation of complex firing patterns in PCs. Leveraging dendritic branches characterized by strong sublinearity as computational units, we demonstrate that a neuron can adeptly address the feature-binding problem. Collectively, these results offer a systematic perspective on the functional role of dendritic sublinearity, providing inspiration for a broader understanding of dendritic integration across various neuronal types.

                arXiv:2501.11566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique that measures the intricate brain dynamics underlying cognitive processes with an unparalleled combination of high temporal and spatial precision. MEG data analytics has always relied on advanced signal processing and mathematical and statistical tools for various tasks ranging from data cleaning to probing the signals' rich dynamics and estimating the neural sources underlying the surface-level recordings. Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG.

                arXiv:2504.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy, yet it faces challenges in balancing communication efficiency, model performance, and privacy protection. To address these trade-offs, we formulate FL as a federated multiobjective optimization problem and propose FedMOEAC, a clustering-based evolutionary algorithm that efficiently navigates the Pareto-optimal solution space. Our approach integrates quantization, weight sparsification, and differential privacy to reduce communication overhead while ensuring model robustness and privacy. The clustering mechanism en-hances population diversity, preventing premature convergence and improving optimization efficiency. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that FedMOEAC achieves 98.2% accuracy, reduces communication overhead by 45%, and maintains a privacy budget below 1.0, outperforming NSGA-II in convergence speed by 33%. This work provides a scalable and efficient FL framework, ensuring an optimal balance between accuracy, communication efficiency, and privacy in resource-constrained environments.

                arXiv:2504.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are very useful methods to address semi-supervised learning (SSL) datasets, thanks to their ability to generate samples similar to real data. This approach, called SSL-GAN has attracted many researchers in the last decade. Evolutionary algorithms have been used to guide the evolution and training of SSL-GANs with great success. In particular, several co-evolutionary approaches have been applied where the two networks of a GAN (the generator and the discriminator) are evolved in separate populations. The co-evolutionary approaches published to date assume some spatial structure of the populations, based on the ideas of cellular evolutionary algorithms. They also create one single individual per generation and follow a generational replacement strategy in the evolution. In this paper, we re-consider those algorithmic design decisions and propose a new co-evolutionary approach, called Co-evolutionary Elitist SSL-GAN (CE-SSLGAN), with panmictic population, elitist replacement, and more than one individual in the offspring. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method using three standard benchmark datasets. The results show that creating more than one offspring per population and using elitism improves the results in comparison with a classical SSL-GAN.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20064">Against Opacity: Explainable AI and Large Language Models for Effective Digital Advertising</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.20064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opaqueness of modern digital advertising, exemplified by platforms such as Meta Ads, raises concerns regarding their autonomous control over audience targeting, pricing structures, and ad relevancy assessments. Locked in their leading positions by network effects, ``Metas and Googles of the world'' attract countless advertisers who rely on intuition, with billions of dollars lost on ineffective social media ads. The platforms' algorithms use huge amounts of data unavailable to advertisers, and the algorithms themselves are opaque as well. This lack of transparency hinders the advertisers' ability to make informed decisions and necessitates efforts to promote transparency, standardize industry metrics, and strengthen regulatory frameworks. In this work, we propose novel ways to assist marketers in optimizing their advertising strategies via machine learning techniques designed to analyze and evaluate content, in particular, predict the click-through rates (CTR) of novel advertising content. Another important problem is that large volumes of data available in the competitive landscape, e.g., competitors' ads, impede the ability of marketers to derive meaningful insights. This leads to a pressing need for a novel approach that would allow us to summarize and comprehend complex data. Inspired by the success of ChatGPT in bridging the gap between large language models (LLMs) and a broader non-technical audience, we propose a novel system that facilitates marketers in data interpretation, called SODA, that merges LLMs with explainable AI, enabling better human-AI collaboration with an emphasis on the domain of digital marketing and advertising. By combining LLMs and explainability features, in particular modern text-image models, we aim to improve the synergy between human marketers and AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20183">BLADE: Benchmark suite for LLM-driven Automated Design and Evolution of iterative optimisation heuristics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.20183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automated Algorithm Discovery (AAD), particularly for optimisation heuristics, is an emerging field of research. This emergence necessitates robust, standardised benchmarking practices to rigorously evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLM-driven AAD methods and the resulting generated algorithms, especially given the opacity of their design process and known issues with existing benchmarks. To address this need, we introduce BLADE (Benchmark suite for LLM-driven Automated Design and Evolution), a modular and extensible framework specifically designed for benchmarking LLM-driven AAD methods in a continuous black-box optimisation context. BLADE integrates collections of benchmark problems (including MA-BBOB and SBOX-COST among others) with instance generators and textual descriptions aimed at capability-focused testing, such as generalisation, specialisation and information exploitation. It offers flexible experimental setup options, standardised logging for reproducibility and fair comparison, incorporates methods for analysing the AAD process (e.g., Code Evolution Graphs and various visualisation approaches) and facilitates comparison against human-designed baselines through integration with established tools like IOHanalyser and IOHexplainer. BLADE provides an `out-of-the-box' solution to systematically evaluate LLM-driven AAD approaches. The framework is demonstrated through two distinct use cases exploring mutation prompt strategies and function specialisation.

                arXiv:2504.20510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating the quality control of shot-blasted steel surfaces is crucial for improving manufacturing efficiency and consistency. This study presents a dataset of 1654 labeled RGB images (512x512) of steel surfaces, classified as either "ready for paint" or "needs shot-blasting." The dataset captures real-world surface defects, including discoloration, welding lines, scratches and corrosion, making it well-suited for training computer vision models. Additionally, three classification approaches were evaluated: Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT), Support Vector Machines (SVM) with ResNet-50 feature extraction, and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). The supervised methods (CCT and SVM) achieve 95% classification accuracy on the test set, with CCT leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms and SVM offering a computationally efficient alternative. The CAE approach, while less effective, establishes a baseline for unsupervised quality control. We present interpretable decision-making by all three neural networks, allowing industry users to visually pinpoint problematic regions and understand the model's rationale. By releasing the dataset and baseline codes, this work aims to support further research in defect detection, advance the development of interpretable computer vision models for quality control, and encourage the adoption of automated inspection systems in industrial applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19411">A Comparison-Relationship-Surrogate Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.19411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms often struggle to find well converged (e.g small inverted generational distance on test problems) solutions to multi-objective optimization problems on a limited budget of function evaluations (here, a few hundred). The family of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) offers a potential solution to this shortcoming through the use of data driven models which augment evaluations of the objective functions. A surrogate model which has shown promise in single-objective optimization is to predict the "comparison relationship" between pairs of solutions (i.e. who's objective function is smaller). In this paper, we investigate the performance of this model on multi-objective optimization problems. First, we propose a new algorithm "CRSEA" which uses the comparison-relationship model. Numerical experiments are then performed with the DTLZ and WFG test suites plus a real-world problem from the field of accelerator physics. We find that CRSEA finds better converged solutions than the tested SAEAs on many of the medium-scale, biobjective problems chosen from the WFG suite suggesting the comparison-relationship surrogate as a promising tool for improving the efficiency of multi-objective optimization algorithms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08010">A Self-organizing Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network for Multi-Step Time Series Prediction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.08010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data uncertainty is inherent in many real-world applications and poses significant challenges for accurate time series predictions. The interval type 2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) has shown exceptional performance in uncertainty modelling for single-step prediction tasks. However, extending it for multi-step ahead predictions introduces further issues in uncertainty handling as well as model interpretability and accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new selforganizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural network with multiple outputs (SOIT2FNN-MO). Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer network architecture is developed. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified consequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model for multi-step time series prediction problems. Second, a new link layer is created to improve the accuracy by building temporal connections between multi-step predictions. Third, a new transformation layer is designed to address the problem of the vanishing rule strength caused by high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, a two-stage, self-organizing learning mechanism is developed to automatically extract fuzzy rules from data and optimize network parameters. Experimental results on chaotic and microgrid prediction problems demonstrate that SOIT2FNN-MO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, by achieving a better accuracy ranging from 1.6% to 30% depending on the level of noises in data. Additionally, the proposed model is more interpretable, offering deeper insights into the prediction process.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12352">Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence models lie at the heart of modern deep learning. However, rapid advancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures, such as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by the empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve contextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step process, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression problem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via ``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including linear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners, and softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices: the regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time optimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to capture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for the empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention. Further, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we use to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression methods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more powerful and theoretically principled architectures.

                Background: Altered glymphatic-related fluid dynamics are increasingly recognized as a key feature of Alzheimers disease (AD). We generalized an established diffusion imaging technique to estimate periventricular diffusivity (PVeD), hypothesizing that fast diffusion signals in the periventricular region can reflect amyloid-beta deposition across the AD continuum. Methods: Participants from two multi-site cohorts (n = 440 and 414), comprising cognitively unimpaired individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with AD, were included. We tested and validated the association of PVeD with amyloid-beta burden and core AD characteristics. Results: Lower PVeD was extensively associated with greater amyloid-beta burden, neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and clinical severity. Importantly, the relationship between PVeD and amyloid-beta burden was significantly modulated by APOE4 status, with APOE4 carriers showing a stronger negative association. Baseline PVeD also predicted longitudinal cognitive decline. Discussion: These findings suggest that periventricular fast diffusion signals can reflect APOE4-modulated amyloid-beta burden and cognitive decline in AD.

">Digital Twin Brain Predicts rTMS Effects on Brain State Dynamics in Chronic Tinnitus</a></h4>

              
                Predicting repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) effects on whole-brain dynamics in clinical populations is crucial for developing personalized therapies and advancing precision medicine in brain disorders. This study provides the first proof-of-concept demonstrating that the Digital Twin Brain (DTB) can forecast rTMS effects on brain state dynamics in individuals with brain disorders (chronic tinnitus). First, we identified two aberrant brain states that predominantly overlapped with the somatomotor and default mode networks, respectively. Subsequently, we developed DTB for patients and derived regional responses for each brain region, revealing distinct roles of the parieto-occipital and frontal regions. Mechanistically, we examined the biological plausibility using tinnitus-specific risk genes and investigated the multi-scale neurobiological relevance. Clinically, we found that DTB can predict rTMS effects in an independent, longitudinal dataset (all r > 0.78). Particularly, the predictive capacity exhibits a state-specific nature. Overall, this work proposes a novel DTB-based framework for predicting rTMS effects in clinical populations and provides the first empirical evidence supporting its clinical utility. This approach may be generalizable to other brain disorders and neuromodulation techniques, promoting broader advancements in brain health.

">Functional connectivity patterns as an early indicator of later very early preterm outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal functional brain development associated with preterm birth has been widely reported; however, the neural brain architectures of later neurodevelopmental difficulties are not yet fully understood. Here, we applied connectome-based predictive modeling approaches to identify the brain networks associated with later neurocognitive scores at 2-3 years of age in very preterm infants (<31 weeks gestation, N=79) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The whole-brain functional connectome soon after birth successfully predicted verbal ability at 3 years of corrected age (r=0.53, p=4.04x10^(-7)) and motor ability at age 2 (r=0.39, p=0.0004) in very preterm infants. In particular, we found that functional edges between the frontoparietal network and limbic, motor, and medial frontal networks at birth contributed significantly to the prediction of future verbal language ability, while the edges connecting the medial frontal network and motor and basal ganglia networks contributed the most to the prediction of future motor ability. In a separate validation analysis, we demonstrated that the mean connectivity strength among these top brain networks significantly differentiated (average accuracy 76%, p<0.001) poor from normal performers at 2 and 3 years corrected ages. These findings highlight regional functional connectivity soon after birth as a promising biomarker for identifying risks for later brain disorders, which could inform the targeted development of effective early treatments and interventions.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Extensive studies have demonstrated significant gray matter atrophy in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD); however, the underlying gene expression mechanisms remain largely unknown. To comprehensively characterize the gray matter volume alterations in PD patients, we conducted a neuroimaging meta-analysis and validated the observed atrophic phenotypes in an independent dataset. Leveraging the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), we linked brain transcriptomic data to neuroimaging phenotypes to identify genes associated with PD-related gray matter atrophy. Further enrichment analyses and functional characterization explored the potential roles of these correlated genes in disease pathology. Both the neuroimaging meta-analysis and independent dataset analysis consistently revealed significant gray matter atrophy in PD, particularly in the superior temporal gyrus, highly associated with sensory and motor functions. Spatial transcriptome-neuroimaging correlation analysis identified 1,952 overlapping genes whose expression levels were significantly correlated with the spatial distribution of gray matter atrophy in PD patients. These genes were enriched in several key biological processes and molecular pathways, exhibiting region- and cell type-specific expression, particularly in dopaminergic receptor neurons of brain tissue. This study delineates the spatial distribution of gray matter atrophy in PD and suggests that this neurodegenerative phenotype may result from complex interactions among multiple functionally relevant genes.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>White matter, comprising approximately 50% of the human brain, is crucial for efficient neuronal signaling and a wide range of brain functions, including social cognition, sensation, memory, motor control, and information integration across cortical brain regions in the service of perception and cognition. White matter, composed of myelinated axons, results from complex interactions between different cell types, with oligodendrocytes (OLs) and microglia playing integral roles. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, regulate oligodendrogenesis through phagocytosis and molecular signaling, for example through cytokines, which promote and inhibit maturation stages of OL lineage cells. Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a recognized risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The physiological presentation of ASD includes white matter abnormalities and immune dysregulation. Emerging evidence indicates that MIA may reduce microglial reactivity and alter cytokine release in offspring, potentially disrupting the delicate balance required for proper white matter development. Understanding the intricate interplay between oligodendrocytes, microglia, inflammation, and white matter development in the context of MIA provides valuable insights into the etiology of and core symptoms of ASD and possible therapeutic targets.</span>

This study investigates the refined theoretical framework. Neuroimaging datasets from 60 MDD and 60 healthy controls were obtained from the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression database, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). The cerebral cortex was parcellated using the modular analysis and similarity measurements (MOSI) technique. For each node, the average amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (avgALFF) and nodal strength were calculated. Correlation analyses were conducted to establish an adjacency matrix and assess the relationship between nodal power and strength. The results indicated that the LM system in MDD displayed higher partition numbers and avgALFF (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.005). A significant negative correlation between nodal strength and power was replicated (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 1E-10), suggesting that greater functional input enhances regional neural suppression. Notably, MDD participants exhibited a higher negative correlation between FP nodal power and LM-FP connectivity (stronger suppression) but a lower negative correlation between LM nodal power and FP-LM connectivity (weaker suppression). These findings support the theory of abnormal cortical signal organization and reciprocal suppression in MDD.</span>

Tregs reduce microglial reactivity, assist in regenerative and reparative processes, and promote differentiation of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain, thus modulating white matter development.

By exploring novel research paradigms, including raccoon neural investigations and rodent-driven vehicles (ROVs), the value of expanding research models to incorporate diverse species and environments is examined. As neuroscience advances, the field must move beyond the metaphorical lamp post, venturing into uncharted territory to fully capture the complexity of neurobiological variables. By fostering a culture of discovery over predictability&mdash;supported by innovative and exploratory mentoring approaches&mdash;we can illuminate new frontiers in neuroscience and develop transformative insights for mental health and beyond.</p>

                <p>Individuals with normal hearing exhibit considerable variability in their capacity to understand speech in noisy environments. Previous research suggests the cause of this variance may be due to individual differences in cognition and auditory perception. To investigate the impact of cognitive and perceptual differences on speech comprehension, 25 adult human participants with normal hearing completed numerous cognitive and psychoacoustic tasks including the Flanker, Stroop, Trail Making, reading span, and temporal fine structure tests. They also completed a continuous multitalker spatial attention task while neural activity was recorded using electroencephalography. The auditory cortical N1 response was extracted as a measure of neural speech encoding during continuous speech listening using an engineered "chirped-speech" (Cheech) stimulus. We compared N1 component morphologies of target and masker speech stimuli to assess neural correlates of attentional gains while listening to concurrently played short story narratives. Performance on cognitive and psychoacoustic tasks was used to predict N1 component amplitude differences between attended and unattended speech using multiple regression. Results show inhibitory control and working memory abilities can predict N1 amplitude differences between the target and masker stories. Interestingly, none of the cognitive and psychoacoustic predictors correlated with behavioral speech-in-noise listening performance in the attention task, suggesting that neural measures may capture different aspects of cognitive and auditory processing compared with behavioral measures alone.</p>

                <p>Chronic pain affects millions globally, yet no universally effective treatment exists. The primary motor cortex (M1) has been a key target for chronic pain therapies, with electrical stimulation of the M1 (eMCS) showing promise. However, the mechanisms underlying M1-mediated analgesic effects are not fully understood. We investigated the role of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in M1-mediated analgesia using a neuropathic pain mouse model. In this model, neuropathic pain is associated with increased spontaneous activity of layer V pyramidal neurons (LV-PNs) in the S1, partly attributed to the reduced activity of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SST<sup>+</sup> INs), which normally suppress LV-PNs. While manipulation of either LV-PNs or SST<sup>+</sup> INs has been shown to alleviate pain, the role of S1 in M1-mediated analgesia has not been identified. Using multichannel silicon probes, we applied eMCS to neuropathic mice and observed significant analgesia. Histological analyses revealed that eMCS activated SST<sup>+</sup> INs and suppressed hyperactivity of LV-PNs in the S1, suggesting that eMCS suppresses pain by modulating S1 neuronal circuits, alongside other pain-related regions. Notably, eMCS induced long-lasting analgesia, persisting for at least 2&nbsp;d poststimulation. These findings implicate S1 as a critical mediator of eMCS-induced analgesia and suggest eMCS as a potential durable therapeutic strategy for chronic pain.</p>

                Introduction Impacted cerumen is a widespread reason that patients visit their health care providers. It effects approximately 2–6% of the general population and disproportionately impacts up to 65% of patients over 65. This study compared a new cerumen (earwax) removal product (Solution 1; EOS-002; a glycolic acid/bicarbonate formulation) versus two commercially available products (Solution 2 and Solution 3; both containing carbamide peroxide 6.5%) for their cerumenolytic activity in vitro. Methods Samples of human cerumen were placed in 10 x 75 mm polypropylene test tubes. Approximately 1 mL of each test solution was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The vials were shaken at the 15- and 30-minute time points to simulate rinsing in a clinical setting. Breakdown of the cerumen was graded at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 30-minute time points in a masked manner on a 5-point scale (Grade 0 = no change; Grade 4 = complete disintegration). Results Significantly greater disintegration of the cerumen was observed in the samples exposed to EOS-002 at every time point (P < 0.0001). At 5 minutes, disintegration was observed in 39 out of 43 samples exposed to EOS-002, 0 out of 24 samples exposed to Solution 2, and 1 out of 19 samples exposed to Solution 3. Mean disintegration scores at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes were 1.65, 2.38, 2.95, and 3.24 for EOS-002; 0, 0, 0, and 0.2 for Solution 2; and 0.05, 0.13, 0.16, and 0.21 for Solution 3, respectively. Discussion EOS-002 exhibited a significantly greater ability to breakdown cerumen than the two other products. Disintegration of cerumen occurred with EOS-002 within 5 minutes in 91% (39/43) of the samples. Therefore, EOS-002 provides rapid disintegration of human cerumen in vitro.

                Background Incessant incidences have led to losses of several lives and huge investments in many developing countries, particularly Nigeria. This study evaluated fire safety management strategies of selected shopping malls in the city of Abuja, Nigeria in order to identify specific areas that require improvement. Methods The research adopted a case study approach and analysis of data through qualitative means. An observation guide designed for the study was used to collect data. The data were content analysed and the findings reported in themes with the aid of tables and photographs to enhance clarity and understanding. Results The result revealed that the efficacy of active fire safety strategies of the shopping malls exhibited various levels of inadequacies. Fire prevention devices such as sprinklers, smoke detectors and drenchers were either not provided or sparsely provided. The prevalent fire-mitigation devices found in the malls were fire extinguishers and fire buckets, which are grossly inadequate to prevent the rapid spread of large-scale fire. The passive fire safety measures of the malls also exhibited some levels of inadequacies. The study underscored the need for fire safety strategies in public buildings, particularly large-scale commercial structures with high capacity of users, to be adequately provided and managed in adherence to standard practice and building code requirements. Conclusion The study recommends that building professionals should adapt innovative means to mitigate fire risk in the planning and development of commercial buildings. Also, making provisions to accommodate impulsive human behaviour during times of chaos should be a primary design consideration for building designers. The study emphasizes the need for further attention and improvement in fire safety management strategies implementation in commercial buildings, especially large-scale public facilities such as shopping malls, in order to appreciably guide against the devastating effect of fire in case of an occurrence.

The COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC) was characterized by marked disparities in disease burdens across neighborhoods. Accurate neighborhood-level forecasts are critical for planning more equitable resource allocation to reduce health inequalities; however, such spatially high-resolution forecasts remain scarce in operational use. In this study, we analyze aggregated foot traffic data derived from mobile devices to measure the connectivity among 42 NYC neighborhoods driven by various human activities such as dining, shopping, and entertainment. Using real-world time-varying contact patterns in different place categories, we develop a parsimonious behavior-driven epidemic model that incorporates population mixing, indoor crowdedness, dwell time, and seasonality of virus transmissibility. We fit this model to neighborhood-level COVID-19 case data in NYC and further couple this model with a data assimilation algorithm to generate short-term forecasts of neighborhood-level COVID-19 cases in 2020. We find differential contact patterns and connectivity between neighborhoods driven by different human activities. The behavior-driven model supports accurate modeling of neighborhood-level SARS-CoV-2 transmission throughout 2020. In the best-fitting model, we estimate that the force of infection (FOI) in indoor settings increases sublinearly with crowdedness and dwell time. Retrospective forecasting demonstrates that this behavior-driven model generates improved short-term forecasts in NYC neighborhoods compared to several baseline models. Our findings indicate that aggregated foot-traffic data for routine human activities can support neighborhood-level COVID-19 forecasts in NYC. This behavior-driven model may be adapted for use with other respiratory pathogens sharing similar transmission routes.

                <p>by Alexandra Zahradníková, Jana Pavelková, Miroslav Sabo, Sefer Baday, Ivan Zahradník</p>

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) serve for excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells in a noticeably different way, not fully understood at the molecular level. We addressed the structure of skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac (RyR2) isoforms relevant to gating by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (M<sup>2+</sup>). Bioinformatics analysis of RyR structures ascertained the EF-hand loops as the M<sup>2+</sup> binding inhibition site and revealed its allosteric coupling to the channel gate. The intra-monomeric inactivation pathway interacts with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation pathway in both RyR isoforms, and the inter-monomeric pathway, stronger in RyR1, couples to the gate through the S23*-loop of the neighbor monomer. These structural findings were implemented in the model of RyR operation based on statistical mechanics and the Monod-Wyman-Changeux theorem. The model, which defines closed, open, and inactivated macrostates allosterically coupled to M<sup>2+</sup>-binding activation and inhibition sites, approximated the open probability data for both RyR1 and RyR2 channels at a broad range of M<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. The proposed mechanism of RyR operation provides a new interpretation of the structural and functional data of mammalian RyR channels on common grounds. This may provide a new platform for designing pharmacological interventions in the relevant diseases of skeletal and cardiac muscles. The synthetic approach developed in this work may find general use in deciphering mechanisms of ion channel functions.

While the excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major driver of the global antibiotic resistance crisis, more selective therapies remain unavailable for the majority of bacterial pathogens. This includes the obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens of the genus <i>Chlamydia</i>, which cause millions of urogenital, ocular, and respiratory infections each year. Conducting a comprehensive search of the chemical space for novel antichlamydial activities, we identified over 60 compounds that are chemically diverse, structurally distinct from known antibiotics, non-toxic to human cells, and highly potent in preventing the growth of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> in cell cultures. Some blocked <i>C. trachomatis</i> development reversibly, while others eradicated both established and persistent infections in a bactericidal manner. The top molecules displayed compelling selectivity, yet broad activity against diverse <i>Chlamydia</i> strains and species, including both urogenital and ocular serovars of <i>C</i><i>.</i> <i>trachomatis</i>, as well as <i>Chlamydia muridarum</i> and <i>Chlamydia caviae</i>. Some compounds also displayed synergies with clinically used antibiotics. Critically, we found the most potent antichlamydial compound to inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis via covalent binding to the active site of <i>Chlamydia</i> FabH, identifying a new mechanism of FabH inhibition and highlighting a possible way to selectively treat <i>Chlamydia</i> infections.

                <p>by Daehan Lee, Michael P. Shahandeh, Liliane Abuin, Richard Benton</p>

To explore how brains change upon species evolution, we generated single-cell transcriptomic atlases of the central brains of three closely related but ecologically distinct drosophilids: the generalists <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>Drosophila simulans</i>, and the noni fruit specialist <i>Drosophila sechellia</i>. The global cellular composition of these species’ brains is well-conserved, but we predicted a few cell types with different frequencies, notably perineurial glia of the blood–brain barrier, which we validate <i>in vivo</i>. Gene expression analysis revealed that distinct cell types evolve at different rates and patterns, with glial populations exhibiting the greatest divergence between species. Compared to the <i>D. melanogaster</i> brain, cellular composition and gene expression patterns are more divergent in <i>D. sechellia</i> than in <i>D. simulans</i>—despite their similar phylogenetic distance from <i>D. melanogaster</i>—indicating that the specialization of <i>D. sechellia</i> is reflected in the structure and function of its brain. Expression changes in <i>D. sechellia</i> include several metabolic signaling genes, suggestive of adaptations to its novel source of nutrition. Additional single-cell transcriptomic analysis on <i>D. sechellia</i> revealed genes and cell types responsive to dietary supplement with noni, pointing to glia as sites for both physiological and genetic adaptation to this fruit. Our atlases represent the first comparative datasets for “whole” central brains and provide a comprehensive foundation for studying the evolvability of nervous systems in a well-defined phylogenetic and ecological framework.

The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their respective phenotypes represents an important set of tools to understand basic coronavirus biology as well as the public health implications of individual mutations in variants of concern. While mutations outside of spike are not well studied, the entire viral genome is undergoing evolutionary selection, with several variants containing mutations in the central disordered linker region of the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Here, we identify a mutation (G215C), characteristic of the Delta variant, that introduces a novel cysteine into this linker domain, which results in the formation of a more stable N-N dimer. Using reverse genetics, we determined that this cysteine residue is necessary and sufficient for stable dimer formation in a WA1 SARS-CoV-2 background, where it results in significantly increased viral growth both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that the N:G215C mutant has more encapsidation as measured by increased RNA binding to N, N incorporation into virions, and electron microscopy showing that individual virions are larger, with elongated morphologies.

Recent advancements in genetically encoded calcium indicators, particularly those based on green fluorescent proteins, have optimized their performance for monitoring neuronal activities in a variety of model organisms. However, progress in developing red-shifted GECIs, despite their advantages over green indicators, has been slower, resulting in fewer options for end users. In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced in vivo performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak Δ<i>F</i>/<i>F</i><sub>0</sub> per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons both in culture and in vivo. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to 4-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Under wide-field imaging in primary somatosensory and visual cortices in mice with high labeling density (80–90%), SomaFRCaMPi exhibits up to 40% higher SNR and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Altogether, SomaFRCaMPi improves the accuracy and scale of neuronal activity imaging at single-neuron resolution in densely labeled brain tissues due to a 2–3-fold enhanced automated neuronal segmentation, 50% higher fraction of responsive cells, up to 2-fold higher SNR compared to jRGECO1a. Our findings highlight the potential of SomaFRCaMPi, comparable to the most sensitive soma-targeted GCaMP, for precise spatial recording of neuronal populations using popular imaging modalities in model organisms such as zebrafish and mice.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>A theory and network model are presented of how scene representations are built by forming spatial view cells in the ventromedial visual cortical scene pathway to the hippocampus in primates including humans. Layer 1, corresponding to V1–V4, connects to Layer 2 in the retrosplenial scene area and uses competitive learning to form visual feature combination neurons for the part of the scene being fixated, a visual fixation scene patch. In Layer 3, corresponding to the parahippocampal scene area and hippocampus, the visual fixation scene patches are stitched together to form whole scene representations. This is performed with a continuous attractor network for a whole scene made from the overlapping Gaussian receptive fields of the neurons as the head rotates to view the whole scene. In addition, in Layer 3, gain modulation by gaze direction maps visual fixation scene patches to the correct part of the whole scene representation when saccades are made. Each neuron in Layer 3 is thus a spatial view cell that responds to a location in a viewed scene based on visual features in a part of the scene. The novel conceptual advances are that this theory shows how scene representations may be built in primates, including humans, based on features in spatial scenes that anchor the scene representation to the world being viewed (to allocentric, world-based, space); and how gaze direction contributes to this. This offers a revolutionary approach to understanding the spatial representations for navigation and episodic memory in primates, including humans.</p>

                During development of the gyrencephalic brain, both the formation of cortical folds and the establishment of axonal tracts require large, coordinated mechanical deformations. Cortical folding enables a high ratio of cortical surface area to brain volume, which is thought to enhance overall processing power. Meanwhile, a complex network of axonal connections facilitates communication between distant brain regions. The mechanisms underlying the formation of brain folds and axon tract organization remain widely debated. However, evidence emerging from measurements of mechanical stress, combined with physical and mathematical models, suggests that constrained cortical expansion generates folds via mechanical instability. In this opinion article, we highlight recent models and experimental data suggesting that mechanical stress induced by cortical folding also mediates axonal growth. We propose a key role for mechanics in establishing brain morphology and the organization of white matter fascicles of the mature brain.

                Hu et al. show the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv4.2 as an activity-dependent substrate of UBE3A. UBE3A ubiquitinates Kv4.2 at K103 and mediates neuronal activity-induced degradation of DPP6-containing Kv4.2 protein. Deficits in neuronal plasticity and cognitive inflexibility in Angelman syndrome model mice are rescued when bred with Kv4.2 conditional knockout mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103757">A toolbox for ablating excitatory and inhibitory synapses</a></h4>

              
                Recombinant optogenetic and chemogenetic proteins are potent tools for manipulating neuronal activity and controlling neural circuit function. However, there are few analogous tools for manipulating the structure of neural circuits. Here, we introduce three rationally designed genetically encoded tools that use E3 ligase-dependent mechanisms to trigger the degradation of synaptic scaffolding proteins, leading to functional ablation of synapses. First, we developed a constitutive excitatory synapse ablator, PFE3, analogous to the inhibitory synapse ablator GFE3. PFE3 targets the RING domain of the E3 ligase Mdm2 and the proteasome-interacting region of Protocadherin 10 to the scaffolding protein PSD-95, leading to efficient ablation of excitatory synapses. In addition, we developed a light-inducible version of GFE3, paGFE3, using a novel photoactivatable complex based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl2c. paGFE3 degrades Gephyrin and ablates inhibitory synapses in response to 400 nm light. Finally, we developed a chemically inducible version of GFE3, chGFE3, which degrades inhibitory synapses when combined with the bio-orthogonal dimerizer HaloTag ligand-trimethoprim. Each tool is specific, reversible, and capable of breaking neural circuits at precise locations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102179">LC8 enhances 53BP1 foci through heterogeneous bridging of 53BP1 oligomers</a></h4>

              
                53BP1 is a key player in DNA repair and together with BRCA1 regulate selection of DNA double strand break repair mechanisms. Localization of DNA repair factors to sites of DNA damage by 53BP1 is controlled by its oligomerization domain (OD) and binding to LC8, a hub protein that functions to dimerize &gt;100 clients. Here we show that 53BP1 OD is a trimer, an unusual finding for LC8 clients which are all dimers or tetramers. As a trimer, 53BP1 forms a heterogeneous mixture of complexes when bound to dimeric LC8 with the largest mass corresponding to a dimer-of-trimers bridged by 3 LC8 dimers. Analytical ultracentrifugation and isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrate that only the second of the three LC8 recognition motifs is necessary for a stable bridged complex. The stability of the bridged complex is tuned by multivalency, binding specificity of the second LC8 site, and the length of the linker separating the LC8 binding domain and OD. 53BP1 mutants deficient in bridged species fail to impact 53BP1 focus formation in human cell culture studies, suggesting that the primary role of LC8 is to bridge 53BP1 trimers which in turn promotes recruitment of 53BP1 at sites of DNA damage. We propose that the formation of higher-order oligomers of 53BP1 explains how LC8 elicits an improvement in 53BP1 foci and affects the structure and functions of 53BP1.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97671">Microglia aging in the hippocampus advances through intermediate states that drive activation and cognitive decline</a></h4>

              
                During aging, microglia – the resident macrophages of the brain – exhibit altered phenotypes and contribute to age-related neuroinflammation. While numerous hallmarks of age-related microglia have been elucidated, the progression from homeostasis to dysfunction during the aging process remains unresolved. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we undertook complementary cellular and molecular analyses of microglia in the mouse hippocampus across the adult lifespan and in the experimental aging model of heterochronic parabiosis. Single-cell RNA-Seq and pseudotime analysis revealed age-related transcriptional heterogeneity in hippocampal microglia and identified intermediate states of microglial aging that also emerge following heterochronic parabiosis. We tested the functionality of intermediate stress response states via TGFβ1 and translational states using pharmacological approaches in vitro to reveal their modulation of the progression to an activated state. Furthermore, we utilized single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with in vivo adult microglia-specific <i>Tgfb1</i> conditional genetic knockout mouse models to demonstrate that microglia advancement through intermediate aging states drives transcriptional inflammatory activation and hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85599">Leveraging place field repetition to understand positional versus nonpositional inputs to hippocampal field CA1</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is believed to encode episodic memory by binding information about the content of experience within a spatiotemporal framework encoding the location and temporal context of that experience. Previous work implies a distinction between positional inputs to the hippocampus from upstream brain regions that provide information about an animal’s location and nonpositional inputs which provide information about the content of experience, both sensory and navigational. Here, we leverage the phenomenon of ‘place field repetition’ to better understand the functional dissociation between positional and nonpositional information encoded in CA1. Rats navigated freely on a novel maze consisting of linear segments arranged in a rectilinear, city-block configuration, which combined elements of open-field foraging and linear-track tasks. Unlike typical results in open-field foraging, place fields were directionally tuned on the maze, even though the animal’s behavior was not constrained to extended, one-dimensional (1D) trajectories. Repeating fields from the same cell tended to have the same directional preference when the fields were aligned along a linear corridor of the maze, but they showed uncorrelated directional preferences when they were unaligned across different corridors. Lastly, individual fields displayed complex time dynamics which resulted in the population activity changing gradually over the course of minutes. These temporal dynamics were evident across repeating fields of the same cell. These results demonstrate that the positional inputs that drive a cell to fire in similar locations across the maze can be behaviorally and temporally dissociated from the nonpositional inputs that alter the firing rates of the cell within its place fields, offering a potential mechanism to increase the flexibility of the system to encode episodic variables within a spatiotemporal framework provided by place cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103096">A circadian clock drives behavioral activity in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and provides a potential mechanism for seasonal timing</a></h4>

              
                Antarctic krill is a species with fundamental importance for the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Their large biomass and synchronized movements, like diel vertical migration (DVM), significantly impact ecosystem structure and the biological carbon pump. Despite decades of research, the mechanistic basis of DVM remains unclear. Circadian clocks help organisms anticipate daily environmental changes, optimizing adaptation. In this study, we used a recently developed activity monitor to record swimming activity of individual, wild-caught krill under various light conditions and across different seasons. Our data demonstrate how the krill circadian clock, in combination with light, drives a distinct bimodal pattern of swimming activity, which could facilitate ecologically important behavioral patterns, such as DVM. Rapid damping and flexible synchronization of krill activity indicate that the krill clock is adapted to a life at high latitudes and seasonal activity recordings suggest a clock-based mechanism for the timing of seasonal processes. Our findings advance our understanding of biological timing and high-latitude adaptation in this key species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100406">IDH1 regulates human erythropoiesis by eliciting chromatin state reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is the key enzyme that can modulate cellular metabolism, epigenetic modification, and redox homeostasis. Gain-of-function mutations and decreased expression of IDH1 have been demonstrated to be associated with pathogenesis of various myeloid malignancies characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, the function and mechanism of IDH1 in human erythropoiesis still remains unclear. Here, utilizing the human erythropoiesis system, we present an evidence of IDH1-mediated chromatin state reprogramming besides its well-characterized metabolism effects. We found that knockdown IDH1 induced chromatin reorganization and subsequently led to abnormalities biological events in erythroid precursors, which could not be rescued by addition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers or supplementation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG).We further revealed that knockdown IDH1 induces genome-wide changes in distribution and intensity of multiple histone marks, among which H3K79me3 was identified as a critical factor in chromatin state reprogramming. Integrated analysis of ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq recognized that SIRT1 was the key gene affected by IDH1 deficiency. Thus, our current work provided novel insights for further clarifying fundamental biological function of IDH1 which has substantial implications for an in-depth understanding of pathogenesis of diseases with IDH1 dysfunction and accordingly development of therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89494">An atypical basement membrane forms a midline barrier during left-right asymmetric gut development in the chicken embryo</a></h4>

              
                Correct intestinal morphogenesis depends on the early embryonic process of gut rotation, an evolutionarily conserved program in which a straight gut tube elongates and forms into its first loops. However, the gut tube requires guidance to loop in a reproducible manner. The dorsal mesentery (DM) connects the gut tube to the body and directs the lengthening gut into stereotypical loops via left-right (LR) asymmetric cellular and extracellular behavior. The LR asymmetry of the DM also governs blood and lymphatic vessel formation for the digestive tract, which is essential for prenatal organ development and postnatal vital functions including nutrient absorption. Although the genetic LR asymmetry of the DM has been extensively studied, a divider between the left and right DM has yet to be identified. Setting up LR asymmetry for the entire body requires a <i>Lefty1</i>+ midline barrier to separate the two sides of the embryo, without it, embryos have lethal or congenital LR patterning defects. Individual organs including the brain, heart, and gut also have LR asymmetry, and while the consequences of left and right signals mixing are severe or even lethal, organ-specific mechanisms for separating these signals remain poorly understood. Here, we uncover a midline structure composed of a transient double basement membrane, which separates the left and right halves of the embryonic chick DM during the establishment of intestinal and vascular asymmetries. Unlike other basement membranes of the DM, the midline is resistant to disruption by intercalation of Netrin4 (Ntn4). We propose that this atypical midline forms the boundary between left and right sides and functions as a barrier necessary to establish and protect organ asymmetry.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95629">Olfactory ensheathing cells from adult female rats are hybrid glia that promote neural repair</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are unique glial cells found in both central and peripheral nervous systems where they support continuous axonal outgrowth of olfactory sensory neurons to their targets. Previously, we reported that following severe spinal cord injury, OECs transplanted near the injury site modify the inhibitory glial scar and facilitate axon regeneration past the scar border and into the lesion. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the reparative properties of OECs, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing of OECs from adult rats to study their gene expression programs. Our analyses revealed five diverse OEC subtypes, each expressing novel marker genes and pathways indicative of progenitor, axonal regeneration, secreted molecules, or microglia-like functions. We found substantial overlap of OEC genes with those of Schwann cells, but also with microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. We confirmed established markers on cultured OECs, and localized select top genes of OEC subtypes in olfactory bulb tissue. We also show that OECs secrete Reelin and Connective tissue growth factor, extracellular matrix molecules which are important for neural repair and axonal outgrowth. Our results support that OECs are a unique hybrid glia, some with progenitor characteristics, and that their gene expression patterns indicate functions related to wound healing, injury repair, and axonal regeneration.

">Type I interferons enhance human dorsal root ganglion nociceptor excitability and induce TRPV1 sensitization</a></h4>

              
                Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical cytokines for antiviral defense and are linked to painful inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and neuropathic pain in humans. Studies in rodent models demonstrate a direct action on sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) to promote hyperexcitability but rodent behavioral results are conflicting with some reports of pro-nociceptive actions and others of anti-nociception. Given the role of type I IFNs in human disease, we sought to clarify the action of action of IFN- and IFN-{beta} on human DRG (hDRG) nociceptors. We found that IFN receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are functionally expressed by these neurons and their engagement induces canonical STAT1 signaling and non-canonical MAPK activation as measured by increased phosphorylation of the cap-binding protein eIF4E by MNK1/2 kinases. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, Ca2+-imaging, and multi-electrode arrays we demonstrate that IFN- and -{beta} increase the excitability of hDRG neurons with short (30 min) and long-term (24-48 h) exposure and prolong the duration of capsaicin responses, an effect that is blocked by inhibition of MNK1/2 with eFT508, a specific inhibitor of these kinases. Our studies support the conclusion that type I IFNs are pronociceptive when they interact with hDRG nociceptors in the periphery.

">Degraded mapping of disparity tuning in visual cortex explains deficits in binocular depth perception</a></h4>

              
                Sensory cortex is highly organized, but understanding why remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that depriving juvenile mice of vision in one eye during the critical period for the development of binocularity (monocular deprivation) caused enduring deficits in binocular depth perception. This deprivation of binocular vision severely degraded retinotopic mapping of binocular disparity tuning, despite no detectable differences in the range or selectivity of disparity tuning by populations of neurons. Disparity tuning was strongest in the central portion of the visual field and transitioned from representing nearer to farther depths from the lower to upper visual field, respectively. Monocular deprivation caused greater uniformity in disparity across visual space and an overall shift to nearer disparities. We propose that this disruption to the organization of disparity tuning explains impaired binocular depth perception.

                According to the protocortex hypothesis, extrinsic thalamic signaling is necessary for refining cortical areas and cell types, but the mechanism by which these inputs shape the development and expansion of the human cortex remains largely unexplored. We fuse cortical and thalamic organoids to study this process. Using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing and cellular imaging, we discover that thalamic signals during a critical period promote human cortical upper-layer neurogenesis. In assembloid models and human primary cortex, we find NRXN1 mediates thalamic axon contact with primate-enriched outer radial glia, driving developmental gene expression changes. Genetic perturbation of NRXN1 in thalamic neurons reduces these contacts and attenuates cortical upper-layer neurogenesis. These findings in human developmental models suggest a novel role for thalamic regulation of primate outer radial glia cell fate.

">Characterizing semantic compositions in the brain: A model-driven fMRI re-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Semantic composition allows us to construct complex meanings (e.g., "dog house", "house dog") from simpler constituents ("dog", "house"). So far, neuroimaging studies have mostly relied on high-level contrasts (e.g., meaningful > non-meaningful phrases) to identify brain regions sensitive to semantic composition. However, such an approach is less apt at addressing how composition is carried out, namely what functions best characterize the integration of constituent concepts. To address this limitation, we rely on simple computational models to explicitly characterize alternative compositional operations, and use representational similarity analysis to compare the representations of models to those of target regions of interest within the general semantic network. To better target composition beyond specific task demands, we re-analyze fMRI data aggregated from four published studies (N = 85), all employing two-word combinations but differing in task requirements. Converging evidence from confirmatory and exploratory analyses reveals compositional representations in the pars triangularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA45), even when analyses are restricted to a subset where the task did not require participants to actively engage in semantic processing. These results suggest that BA45 represents combinatorial information automatically across task demands, and further characterize these combinatorial representations as resulting from the (symmetric) intersection of constituent features. Additionally, a cluster of compositional representations emerges in the left middle superior temporal sulcus, while semantic, but not compositional, representations are observed in the left angular gyrus. Overall, our work clarifies which brain regions represent semantic information compositionally across different contexts and task demands, and qualifies which operations best describe composition.

">Effect of Transcranial Light Stimulation on the Neurovascular Unit in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial light stimulation (tLS) is emerging as a non-invasive approach for enhancing brain function and treating neurological disorders; however, its impact on the human neurovascular unit (NVU) remains poorly understood. Herein, we combined photon transport modeling with multimodal neuroimaging to reveal how light influences vascular and neuronal responses in the human brain. Simulations of photon propagation through transcranial tissue captured key scattering and attenuation patterns, guiding the localization of light effects in vivo. Using simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging and arterial spin labeling, we showed that tLS significantly increased blood oxygenation level-dependent signals and cerebral blood flow in the light-affected regions. These hemodynamic changes co-occurred with a reduction in cortical excitability, as revealed by electroencephalographic source reconstruction and transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked potentials. To probe the underlying mechanism, we incorporated inhibitory neural inputs into the computational NVU model. The model predicted that tLS enhances inhibitory neuronal activity and nitric oxide release, driving vasodilation and elevating metabolic support. These findings revealed that transcranial photons can differentially modulate neuronal and vascular components of the NVU--suppressing excitability while promoting perfusion--thereby suggesting a novel therapeutic avenue for targeting neurovascular dynamics in cognitive and clinical applications.

">Non-duality in brain and experience of advanced meditators - Key role for Intrinsic Neural Timescales</a></h4>

              
                Distinguishing between self (internal) and environment (external) is fundamental to human experience, with ordinary waking consciousness structured around this duality. However, contemplative traditions describe non-dual states where this distinction dissolves. Despite its significance, the neural basis of non-duality remains underexplored. Using psychological questionnaires for non-duality experience and EEG-based intrinsic neural timescales as measured by the autocorrelation window (ACW), we studied non-duality in advanced meditators, novice meditators, and controls. All subjects underwent breath-watching meditation (internal attention) and a visual oddball cognitive task (external attention); this allowed us to conceptualize non-duality as a lack of distinction between internal and external attention. Our key findings include: (a) advanced meditators report greater experience of non-duality during breath-watching (psychological scales), (b) EEG-based ACW is longer during internal attention (breath watch) than external attention (oddball task) in all subjects taken together, (c) advanced meditators show no such distinction with equal duration of their ACW during both internal and external attention (we replicated this finding in another dataset of expert meditators); (d) the advanced meditators internal-external ACW difference correlated with their experience of the degree of non-duality (psychological scales) during internal attention. Together, these findings suggest that the brains intrinsic neural timescales during internal and external attention play a key role in mediating the experience of non-duality in advanced meditators.

                CXCL4 (PF4) is a chemokine stored in platelets that has pleiotropic effects across biological settings. These effects include driving of inflammation and fibrosis as well as reversal of the effects of ageing. We have recently demonstrated that CXCL4 function is driven, independently of known chemokine receptors, through binding to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains on proteoglycans within the cell surface glycocalyx. In this study, we have used intravital imaging and radioactive tracer studies, in combination with an exogenous inhibitor and a GAG-binding CXCL4 mutant, to demonstrate that CXCL4 can enter the brain parenchyma of mice by binding to proteoglycans within the cell surface of the endothelial glycocalyx of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that CXCL4 directly promotes neurogenesis in vitro, which is mediated by its ability to oligomerise and bind to GAGs. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for CXCL4 uptake and function within the brain. Furthermore, these data have important implications for understanding CXCL4 during health and disease that may enable development of CXCL4-related therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and ageing.

                Animals respond to environmental cues to time phenological events, but the intrinsic mechanism of circannual timing remains elusive. We used transcriptomic sequencing and frequent sampling, during three distinct phases (induction, maintenance and recovery) of circannual interval timing for Djungarian hamster energy balance, to investigate the molecular architecture of a neuroendocrine seasonal clock. Our study identified three distinct phases of transcript changes, with deiodinase type-3 (Dio3) expression activated during the early induction phase. Subsequent work demonstrated that targeted mutation of Dio3 resulted in a shorter period for circannual interval timing. Hamsters that exhibit naturally disrupted Dio3 expression do not show any change in body mass or pelage. Our work demonstrates that changes in Dio3 induction is essential for setting the period of circannual interval timing.

">Spatiotemporal Analysis of Remyelination Reveals a Concerted Interferon-Responsive Glial State That Coordinates Immune Infiltration</a></h4>

              
                Remyelination, the process by which axons are re-encased in myelin after injury, is a critical step in restoring brain function, yet the dynamics from initial injury to repair remain poorly characterized. Here, we combined optimized single-nucleus RNA-seq with Slide-seqv2, a high-resolution spatial transcriptomics technology, to densely reconstruct the cellular processes that coordinate remyelination after a focal demyelinating injury. This revealed several findings: First, we found extensive transcriptional diversity of glia and monocyte-derived macrophages from demyelination to repair. Second, we identified a population of infiltrating peripheral lymphocytes--predominantly CD8 T-cells and natural killer cells--that are enriched specifically during remyelination. Third, we identified a concerted interferon-response gene signature that is shared across several cell types--microglia, astrocytes, and the oligodendrocyte lineage--just prior to reestablishment of myelin. These interferon-responsive glia (IRG) form clusters around remyelinating white matter and their formation is solely dependent on the type I interferon receptor. Functionally, we found that IRG secrete the cytokine CXCL10 which mediates infiltration of peripheral lymphocytes into the repairing white matter. Depletion of the most abundant infiltrating lymphocyte, CD8 T-cells, attenuated the differentiation of mature oligodendrocytes during remyelination. Together, our data reveals the diversity of glial-immune interactions that orchestrate white matter repair and a type I-dependent glial state that drives lymphocyte influx into damaged white matter to modulate oligodendrocyte differentiation.

">Organization of brainwide inputs to discrete lateral septum projection populations</a></h4>

              
                The lateral septum (LS) is anatomically positioned to play a critical role in directing information from the hippocampus and cortex to downstream subcortical structures, such as the hypothalamus. In fact, early anatomical tracing studies investigated the organization of hippocampal inputs to the LS and its hypothalamic outputs to begin to understand how its structure might relate to its function. These studies also characterized the cellular anatomy of the LS and the organization of different molecular markers within it. However, relatively little is known about the organization of other, non-hypothalamic projection populations within the LS and what types of input these different projection populations receive. Here, we used retrograde tracing to determine the organization of LS projections to six different brain regions that mediate various social behaviors. We found that these projection populations occupy discrete anatomical compartments within the LS. We then used a monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy to map brainwide inputs to these six discrete LS projection populations and examine how different brain regions innervate them. We identified unique region-dependent patterns of inputs to individual LS projection populations. In particular, we observed differences in cortical, hippocampal and thalamic innervation of the six different LS projection populations, while the hypothalamic inputs were largely similar across projection populations. Thus, this study provides insight into the anatomical connectivity that may underlie the functional heterogeneity of the LS.

">Quantum Magnetization Exchange through Transient Hydrogen Bond Matrix Defines Magnetic Resonance Signal Relaxation and Anisotropy in Central Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                The integrity of cellular membranes (lipid bilayers) and myelin sheaths covering axons is a crucial feature controlling normal brain structural and functional networks. Yet, in vivo evaluation of this integrity at the nanoscale level of the cellular membranes organization is challenging.

Herein we explore the dual property of biological water in Central Nervous System (CNS), as one of the major stabilizing factors of cellular membranes, and the major source of MRI signal. We introduce the Basic Transient Hydrogen Bond (THB) model of the MR signal relaxation due to the quantum spin/magnetization exchanges within the THB Matrix encompassing water molecules and membrane-forming macromolecules.

Our data show the existence of two THB Matrix components with distinct lifetimes - one in a few nano-second range, and another in the range of tens nanoseconds. Importantly, the former component facilitates longitudinal relaxation of MR signal, the latter contributes to its transverse relaxation and causes the anisotropy of MR signal relaxation. These distinct features offer opportunity to study nanoscale level microstructure of cellular membranes. Furthermore, the ability to differentiate distinct THB Matrix components based on their MR signal relaxation properties can be fundamental to identifying pathological changes and enhancing disease visibility on MRI scans.

">Survival of Transplanted Retinal Ganglion Cell in Human Donor Eyes under Elevated Pressure</a></h4>

              
                Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies characterized by visual field loss, classically due to increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. Current treatment options reduce IOP, but progressive RGC degeneration persists. The ability to reprogram de novo RGCs from human corneal keratocytes provides a valuable tool to potentially restore vision in patients with late-stage disease when most RGCs are irreversibly damaged. We investigate the survival of these human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived RGCs after culturing them in human donor eyes under conditions of elevated and normal IOP using the pressurized ocular translaminar autonomous system (TAS) chamber. The hiPSCs were generated by reprogramming human donor keratocytes using Sendai viral vectors with Yamanaka factors. The hiPSCs were then differentiated into retinal organoids (ROs) from which RGCs were obtained. The RGCs were transduced with AAV2-CBA-EGFP (Adeno-Associated Virus serotype 2- Chicken Beta Actin- Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) and successfully transplanted into donor human eyes obtained from individuals having non-ocular history. They were pressurized for 5-7 days, with the left eye maintained at normal IOP and right eye at high IOP. Viability was measured by expression levels of pro-survival pathways via qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry staining, and electroretinography (ERG) for retinal function. After RGC transplantation, increased expression of pro-survival and decreased inflammatory and apoptotic markers were identified in normal IOP conditions compared to high IOP. In conclusion, survival of RGCs was more conducive under normal IOP conditions with significantly increased degeneration observed at high IOP. Thus, suggesting that elevated IOP could potentially create a microenvironment that would significantly inhibit successful transplantation of de novo RGCs.

">Cell type-specific contributions to impaired blood-brain barrier and cerebral metabolism in presymptomatic 5XFAD mice</a></h4>

              
                Altered cerebral metabolism and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction are emerging as critical contributors to the preclinical phase of Alzheimers disease (AD), underscoring their role in early pathogenesis. To identify sensitive biomarkers before irreversible neuronal loss and cognitive decline, we examined 5XFAD mice at 3 months of age by applying multiple advanced MRI techniques. Arterial spin tagging based MRI revealed increased BBB permeability and water extraction fraction, indicating compromised BBB integrity at the early stage of pathogenesis in 5xFAD mice. Despite preserved cerebral blood flow, a decreased unit mass cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was evident in the same cohorts of 5XFAD mice. Interestingly, a region-specific decrease of tissue pH values was detected in the hippocampus of these 5XFAD mice by creatine chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI. Elevated neuronal H4K12 lactylation in the hippocampus supports the reduced pH values. To further dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these MRI-detectable changes in 5XFAD mice, we conducted single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) with optimized blood vessel enrichment protocols. Our results revealed cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in the hippocampus of 3-month-old 5XFAD mice, including downregulation of synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission genes in the CA1 and dentate gyrus excitatory neurons, impaired endothelial gene expression linked to brain barrier function and angiogenesis, altered innate immune response genes in astrocytes, as well as upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism genes in the CA1 excitatory neurons. These findings underlie the intricate interplay between BBB disruption and metabolic dysregulation before the onset of cognitive decline in AD. Our study demonstrates that BBB dysfunction and cerebral metabolic alterations preceded brain hypoperfusion and cognitive decline, emphasizing potential molecular pathways for early intervention. These findings, once validated in human studies, could significantly enhance early diagnosis and inform novel therapeutic strategies targeting early AD pathogenesis.

">Telmisartan and Lisinopril Show Potential Benefits in Rescuing Cognitive-Behavioral Function Despite Limited Improvements in Neuropathological Outcomes in Tg-SwDI Mice</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a cerebrovascular disease that results from beta-amyloid (A{beta}) accumulation in the vessel walls that is associated with cognitive impairment and other neurological pathologies. There are currently no medications approved to treat CAA. This study investigated whether renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-targeting drugs, commonly prescribed to treat hypertension, can be repurposed to treat CAA, and whether their effects differ by sex. Male and female Tg-SwDI mice were treated for 5 months with sub-depressor doses of either telmisartan [angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)] or lisinopril [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor] starting at 3 months of age. Blood pressure monitoring was performed 2 and 4 months after the start of treatment, followed by behavior testing at 7 months of age. Histochemical analyses were conducted to determine vasculopathy, A{beta} pathology, and neuroinflammation (microgliosis and astrogliosis). Outcomes in drug-treated and untreated Tg-SwDI mice were compared to each other and with wild-type (C57BL/6J) controls. Overall, both drugs were able to rescue some cognitive-behavioral functions; however, no reductions in A{beta} levels were observed, and only limited improvements in vascular density and neuroinflammatory markers were detected. Notably, some treatment effects varied with sex, the specific behavioral task, and the brain region analyzed. These findings support the hypothesis that RAS-targeting drugs exert neuroprotective effects through mechanisms beyond blood pressure control offering a promising therapeutic avenue for CAA.

">Stochastic activity in low-rank recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The geometrical and statistical properties of brain activity depend on the way neurons connect together to form recurrent circuits. How the structure of connectivity shapes the emergent activity remains however not fully understood. We investigate this question in recurrent neural networks with linear additive stochastic dynamics. We assume that the synaptic connectivity can be expressed in a low-rank form, parameterized by a handful of connectivity vectors, and and examine how the geometry of emergent activity relates to these vectors. Our findings reveal that this relationship critically depends on the dimensionality of the external stochastic inputs. When inputs are low-dimensional, activity is confined to a low-dimensional subspace spanned by a subset of the connectivity vectors, whose dimensionality matches the rank of the connectivity matrix, along with the external inputs. Conversely, when inputs are high-dimensional, activity is generally high-dimensional; recurrent dynamics shape activity within a subspace spanned by all connectivity vectors, with a dimensionality equal to twice the rank of the connectivity matrix. Applying our formalism to excitatory-inhibitory circuits, we discuss how inputs geometry also play a crucial role in determining the amount of input amplification generated by non-normal dynamics. Our work provides a foundation for studying activity in structured brain circuits under realistic noise conditions, and offers a framework for interpreting stochastic models inferred from experimental data.

">Estimating fMRI Timescale Maps</a></h4>

              
                Brain activity unfolds over hierarchical timescales that reflect how brain regions integrate and process information, linking functional and structural organization. While timescale studies are prevalent, existing estimation methods rely on the restrictive assumption of exponentially decaying autocorrelation and only provide point estimates without standard errors, limiting statistical inference. In this paper, we formalize and evaluate two methods for mapping timescales in resting-state fMRI: a time-domain fit of an autoregressive (AR1) model and an autocorrelation-domain fit of an exponential decay model. Rather than assuming exponential autocorrelation decay, we define timescales by projecting the fMRI time series onto these approximating models, requiring only stationarity and mixing conditions while incorporating robust standard errors to account for model misspecification. We introduce theoretical properties of timescale estimators and show parameter recovery in realistic simulations, as well as applications to fMRI from the Human Connectome Project. Comparatively, the time-domain method produces more accurate estimates under model misspecification, remains computationally efficient for high-dimensional fMRI data, and yields maps aligned with known functional brain organization. In this work we show valid statistical inference on fMRI timescale maps, and provide Python implementations of all methods.

">Pitfalls of mapping functional and molecular human brain imaging data from separate cohorts</a></h4>

              
                It has become increasingly common to probe correlations between human brain imaging measures of receptor/protein binding and function using population-level brain maps drawn from independent cohorts, estimating correlations across regions. This strategy raises issues of interpretation that we highlight here with a multimodal brain imaging dataset and simulation studies. Twenty-four healthy participants completed neuroimaging with both [11C]Cimbi-36 positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans to estimate receptor binding potential (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), respectively, in 18 cortical/subcortical regions. Correlations between BP and CBF were estimated in three ways: 1) Pearson correlation across regions of mean regional BP and CBF ({rho}l), to mimic studies using data from independent cohorts; 2) Pearson correlation between BP and CBF across participants in each region ({rho}2); or 3) the correlation between BP and CBF across participants across all regions within a single linear mixed effects model ({rho}3). We observed a significant positive correlation across regions ([Formula]l = 0.672; p = 0.0023). Region-specific correlations across participants were substantively lower and not statistically significant ([Formula]2: mean = 0.140, range = -0.112 to 0.336; all p > 0.10), nor when estimated simultaneously within a linear mixed model ([Formula]3 = 0.138, p = 0.26). Our simulation study illustrated that regional differences in BP or CBF mean and variance can bias across regions correlations by 1000% or create a type-1 error of 100%. Our observations that both the estimated correlation and the statistical significance can differ greatly highlights that inferring across region correlation as evidence for correlation across participants is erroneous. Without validated methods that limit confounding and other biases, we discourage future studies from inferring across region correlation of population-level brain maps from independent cohorts in this manner.

                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in communication and social interaction and may stem from an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) signaling in neural circuits. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons are crucial for maintaining E/I balance and regulating network oscillations. Alterations in the number of PV+ interneurons or reductions in PV expression have been observed in both the postmortem brains of individuals with ASD and in animal models, including those induced by in utero exposure to maternal brain-reactive antibodies. In this study, we investigate the impact of in utero exposure to maternal anti-Caspr2 IgG on PV+ interneuron development and function in the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate a selective reduction in PV+ interneurons and perisomatic inhibitory synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region of juvenile and adult male offspring exposed in utero to anti-Caspr2 antibodies compared to controls. Additionally, local field potential (LFP) recordings from these mice show increased gamma power and altered neuronal firing patterns during social interactions, indicating functional impairments in inhibitory circuitry. These findings highlight the consequences of exposure to maternal anti-Caspr2 antibodies on PV+ interneuron development and function, providing insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ASD associated behavioral phenotypes.

Epidemiological and prospective clinical studies have also reported associations between early-life exposure to anesthesia and neurodevelopmental deficits in children, raising significant concerns about pediatric anesthesia and highlighting the urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of anesthetic-induced developmental neurotoxicity (AIDN) using human-relevant models.

MethodsThis study employed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoids that were exposed to varying doses of anesthetic propofol for 1 to 6 hours, including single and repeated exposures. In parallel, serum samples were collected pre- and post-surgery from pediatric patients under 4 years old (n = 10 per group) who underwent either short (<1 hour) or prolonged anesthesia (>3 hours) at the Childrens Hospital of Wisconsin between September 2018 and October 2019. Pathological changes in organoids were assessed using chemical assays, electron microscopy, and western blotting. Brain injury-related proteins in patient serum were quantified via ELISA. Genome-wide expression profiling was conducted on 18,855 mRNAs and 27,427 lncRNAs in organoids and serum using microarray and bioinformatics.

ResultsHigher doses, longer duration, and repeated exposures to propofol led to increased apoptosis in organoids. Six-hour exposure induced autophagy as evidenced by LC3-II elevation and led to dysregulation of 553 mRNAs and 792 lncRNAs in organoids, along with their co-expressed signaling networks, affecting pathways related to synaptic integrity, mitochondrial function, and inflammation. ELISA and serum analysis of pediatric patients (<4 years old) exposed to anesthesia (>3 hours) demonstrated elevated brain cell injury-associated proteins (e.g., increased NSE) and brain cell type-specific gene expression changes. Serum findings corroborated organoid data, identifying 21 mRNAs and 12 lncRNAs that were dysregulated in both models and associated with cell injury, neuronal development, inflammation, and learning deficits.

ConclusionsThis study represents the first integrative transcriptomic analysis of AIDN using both 3D human cerebral organoids and pediatric patient serum--two complementary, human-relevant models. By identifying consistently dysregulated coding and non-coding RNAs across both platforms, we provide compelling evidence of shared molecular signatures linked to neuronal injury, inflammation, and neurodevelopmental disruption. These findings offer not only mechanistic insights but also lay the groundwork for the development of minimally invasive biomarkers and future therapeutic strategies. This dual-model approach bridges experimental discovery with clinical relevance, advancing the translational understanding of pediatric anesthetic neurotoxicity and supporting efforts to improve long-term neurological outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.

">Characterization of the functional and clinical impacts of CACNA1A missense variants found in neurodevelopmental disorders</a></h4>

              
                CACNA1A encodes the P/Q-type CaV2.1 calcium channels whose function underlies neuronal excitability, presynaptic neurotransmitter release, and Ca2+ signaling in neurons. Pathogenic variants in CACNA1A have been found in individuals with various neurological conditions, including hemiplegic migraine, epilepsy, developmental delay, and ataxia. Clinical presentations can vary significantly between patients, with limited information known about the underlying neurobiology of these different clinical patterns. Adding further complication, prior work on pathogenic missense variants has demonstrated variable impacts on CaV2.1 channel function, sometimes in opposite directions. As such, the relationships between specific coding variants, electrophysiological properties, and clinical phenotypes remain elusive. In this study, we determined the biophysical properties of an allelic series of 42 de novo missense CACNA1A variants discovered in a neurodevelopmental disorder cohort of more than 31,000 individuals, together with the most common eight coding variants found in the general population. We found that all but one de novo variant altered at least one aspect of the channel properties examined, and the majority (70%) of the variants reduced the channel current density. In addition, for variants that encode human CaV2.1 channels (hCaV2.1) with detectable currents, nearly 50% altered how channels respond to membrane potential, while common variations did not significantly change any channel biophysical properties. Coupled with our functional analyses and AlphaMissense prediction, we showed that CaV2.1 missense variants significantly underlie the risk of developmental epileptic encephalopathy. Subsequently, we examined the physiological impact of variant hCaV2.1 using NEURON simulations as an omnibus output of neuronal function and found that abnormal biophysical channel properties have a profound impact on Purkinje cell excitability. Most interestingly, we correlated the clinical phenotype with molecular consequences of missense variants provided by our comprehensive functional analyses and found that distinct CaV2.1 channel molecular function is significantly associated with different clinical outcomes. By analyzing an entire allelic series of CACNA1A de novo changes in a large cohort of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, we provide a powerful approach to dissecting the role of missense variants in CACNA1A channelopathy, which in turn may help pave the way for future precision medicine initiatives.

                Depression affects over 350 million people worldwide, with treatment resistance occurring in up to 30% of cases. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has emerged as a promising intervention, yet the neurophysiological mechanisms determining which patients will respond remain poorly understood. Here, we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography and whole-brain computational modeling to uncover the mechanistic basis of treatment efficacy in 90 patients with treatment-resistant depression. We identified two distinct neurophysiological signatures that differentiate responders from non-responders: (1) post-treatment shifts in excitation-inhibition balance toward greater inhibitory control, and (2) a pre-treatment brain state characterized by anticorrelated dynamics between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and DLPFC. These features were significantly correlated with clinical improvement and could not be explained by non-specific factors. Our findings provide a neurophysiologically-informed framework for developing personalized and optimized neuromodulation approaches in treatment-resistant depression.

">Early visual signatures and benefits of intra-saccadic motion streaks</a></h4>

              
                Eye movements routinely induce motion streaks as they shift visual projections across the retina at high speeds. To investigate the visual consequences of intra-saccadic motion streaks, we co-registered eye tracking and EEG while gaze-contingently shifting target objects during saccades, presenting either continuous,  streaky or apparent, step-like motion in four directions. We found significant reductions of secondary saccade latency, as well as improved decoding of the post-saccadic target location from the EEG signal when motion streaks were available. These signals arose as early as 50 ms after saccade offset and had a clear occipital topography. Using a physiologically plausible visual processing model, we provide evidence that the targets motion trajectory is coded in orientation-selective channels and that speed of gaze correction was linked to the visual dynamics arising from the combination of saccadic and target motion, providing a parsimonious explanation of the behavioral benefits of intra-saccadic motion streaks.

">A New Serological Autoantibody Signature Associated with Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                The role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) remains incompletely understood. In this study, we analyzed serum samples from a cohort of MS patients in Qatar using high-throughput KoRectly Expressed (KREX) immunome protein-array technology. Compared to healthy controls, MS patients showed significantly altered autoantibody responses to 129 proteins, with a notable enrichment in autoantibodies targeting antiviral immune response-related proteins. Machine learning analysis identified a distinct molecular signature comprising 17 differentially expressed autoantibodies, including those against MX1, ISG20, MAX, SUFU, NR1H2, HMGN5, and EPHA10. Among these, autoantibodies against MX1-a key effector in the interferon-alpha/beta signaling pathway-showed the most pronounced increase, with nearly a threefold elevation in MS patients. While MX1 has previously been implicated in MS, this is the first report of autoantibody reactivity against the protein, suggesting a potential role in disease onset and progression. These findings support a link between antiviral immune responses and MS pathophysiology and offer a promising blood-based autoantibody signature that could inform future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

">Representational dynamics during extinction of fear memories in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Extinction learning - the suppression of a previously acquired fear response - is critical for adaptive behavior and core for understanding the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders. Electrophysiological studies in rodents have revealed critical roles of theta (4-12Hz) oscillations in amygdala and hippocampus during both fear learning and extinction, and engram research has shown that extinction relies on the formation of novel, highly context-dependent memory traces that suppress the initial fear memories. Whether similar processes occur in humans and how they relate to previously described neural mechanisms of episodic memory formation and retrieval remains unknown. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in epilepsy patients provide direct access to the deep brain structures of the fear and extinction network, while representational similarity analysis (RSA) allows characterizing the memory traces of specific cues and contexts. Here we combined these methods to show that amygdala theta oscillations during extinction learning signal safety rather than threat and that extinction memory traces are characterized by stable and context-specific neural representations that are coordinated across the extinction network. We further demonstrate that context specificity during extinction learning predicts the reoccurrence of fear memory traces during a subsequent test period, while reoccurrence of extinction memory traces predicts safety responses. Our results reveal the neurophysiological mechanisms and representational characteristics of context-dependent extinction learning in the human brain. In addition, they show that the mutual competition of fear and extinction memory traces provides a mechanistic basis for clinically important phenomena such as fear renewal and extinction retrieval.

">Backpropagation through time training of an unrolled Hodgkin Huxley model for automatic conductance estimation</a></h4>

              
                Precise estimation of biophysical parameters such as ion channel conductances in single neurons is essential for understanding neuronal excitability and for building accurate computational models. However, inferring these parameters from experimental data is challenging, often requiring extensive voltage-clamp measurements or laborious manual tuning. Here we present a novel approach that leverages backpropagation through time (BPTT) to automatically fit a Hodgkin--Huxley (HH) conductance-based model to observed voltage traces. We unroll the HH model dynamics in time and treat the unknown maximum conductances as learnable parameters in a differentiable simulation. By optimizing the model to minimize the mean squared error between simulated and observed membrane voltage, our method directly recovers the underlying conductances (for sodium gNa, potassium gK, and leak gL) from a single voltage response. In simulations, the BPTT-trained model accurately identified conductance values across different neuron types and remained robust to typical levels of measurement noise. Even with a single current-clamp recording as training data, the approach achieved precise fits, highlighting its efficiency. This work demonstrates a powerful automated strategy for biophysical system identification, opening the door to rapid, high-fidelity neuron model customization from electrophysiological recordings. The code is availible at https://github.com/skysky2333/HH_BPTT.

">Continuous theta-burst stimulation of the prefrontal cortex in the macaque monkey: no evidence for within-target inhibition or cross-hemisphere disinhibition of neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) can perturb neural activity and behavior by inducing effects that persist beyond the relatively short stimulation period. Although widely used in basic research and clinical settings, there lacks an understanding of the neurophysiological and behavioural effects of cTBS. Two assumptions motivating the use of cTBS are that it will i) inhibit neural activity in the targeted area, and ii) consequently disinhibit neural activity in the mirroring region in the contralateral cortex. Here, we test these assumptions in the oculomotor system of the rhesus macaque. In two macaques, we delivered cTBS between blocks of trials where they performed a delayed pro-/anti-saccade task, delivered cTBS to the right PFC (areas 8Ar and 46, which includes the frontal eye fields; 32 cTBS-PFC sessions), to the air as a SHAM control (27 cTBS-SHAM sessions), or to the nearby primary motor cortex as a brain control (21 cTBS-M1 sessions). Across these different types of sessions, we compared changes in oculomotor behavior (reaction times, error rates, peak saccade velocity), and changes in neural activity recorded from the left, contralateral PFC. Despite multiple lines of evidence consistent with TMS influencing neural activity in the cTBS-PFC and cTBS-M1 sessions, we found no behavioral evidence for inhibition of the right PFC in the cTBS-PFC sessions, nor any evidence for contralateral disinhibition in the left PFC. Our results call into question some of the fundamental assumptions underlying the application of cTBS.

">Brainstem sensing of multiple body signals during food consumption</a></h4>

              
                Studies of body-to-brain communication often examine one stimulus or organ at a time, yet the brain must integrate many body signals during behavior. For example, food consumption generates diverse oral and post-oral chemical and mechanical signals transduced by well-characterized peripheral neuronal pathways. Far less is known about how these and other bodily signals are integrated and organized in the brainstem lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN), a key interoceptive sensory hub. We established methods to image the activity of 1000s of neurons throughout a large region of mouse LPBN. Food consumption drove a seconds-long wave of activity across LPBN, with dynamics mirroring the movement of food through the upper gastrointestinal tract observed using X-ray fluoroscopy. By imaging the same neurons across days, we found that spatially clustered subsets of neurons encoded oral signals, stomach filling, visceral malaise, arousal, and/or body movement. Moreover, only certain subsets were modulated by cortical input. Together, these experiments reveal a functional specialization in the LPBN that integrates contextual information from the body to guide behavior.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Mental rotation is a spatial cognitive ability influenced by several factors, including cognitive traits. However, the relationship between mental rotation performance, cognitive traits, and brain activity is still uncertain. To fill this gap, we recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging data while 55 neurotypical participants performed mental rotation with images of geometric objects, human bodies, and real objects. Cognitive traits were evaluated through the Object–Spatial Imagery Questionnaire (visual cognitive style), a perspective-taking task, and the Cognitive Flexibility Scale. Analysis of accuracy and reaction time revealed that (i) mental rotation in spatial-visualizers was more accurate and faster than in object-visualizers, and (ii) visual cognitive style and perspective-taking positively correlated with mental rotation. Brain activity data indicated that (i) individuals with better mental rotation performance had smaller brain activation, particularly in sensorimotor regions, (ii) for the spatial–visual scale and perspective-taking, high scorers had smaller brain activity than low performers, (iii) for the object–visual scale, high scorers had greater brain activity than low scorers. Supporting a neural efficiency hypothesis, the present study highlights the influence of cognitive traits on mental rotation performance and brain efficiency, with spatial-visualizers showing more efficient neural processing. These findings contribute to our understanding of how cognitive styles shape spatial cognition.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study investigated the impact of auditory and visual deprivation on speech processing by analyzing auditory evoked potentials (MMN, P3a, P2, N2b) in congenitally blind individuals, cochlear implant (CI) users, and normal-hearing controls. Using a passive oddball paradigm with /u/ as the standard stimulus and /i/ and /y/ as deviants, we recorded and analyzed auditory evoked potentials in fronto-central and centro-parietal regions. Blind participants exhibited significantly faster MMN and N2b latencies than controls and CI users, reflecting enhanced auditory temporal resolution due to cross-modal plasticity. CI users showed reduced P2 and N2b amplitudes, indicating challenges in early sensory processing and conflict monitoring, particularly for the /i/–/u/ contrast. Notably, blind participants had larger P3a amplitudes, emphasizing superior attentional engagement in response to deviant stimuli. Postlingually deafened CI users exhibited greater P3a amplitudes than prelingually deafened users, underscoring the impact of early auditory experiences on cortical responses. These findings demonstrate distinct effects of sensory deprivation on speech processing, with blind individuals showing compensatory neural mechanisms and CI users experiencing sensory and cognitive challenges. The results underscore the need for personalized rehabilitation strategies to enhance outcomes for populations with sensory deprivation and highlight the potential of cross-modal plasticity in auditory rehabilitation.</span>

The primary aim of this study is to investigate shifts in the functional gradients underlying hierarchical brain network organization in ASD and to assess their potential contribution to clinical symptom severity. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine changes in functional gradients across seven major brain networks in a cohort of 52 individuals with ASD and 40 healthy controls. In the somatomotor network, neither the first nor third gradient showed significant group differences; however, two regions—right paracentral lobule and right postcentral gyrus—exhibited significant differences in the second gradient. In the frontoparietal network, only the left middle frontal gyrus in the second gradient showed a significant group difference. For the ventral attention network, only the primary gradient exhibited significant differences in the left insula, the right insula, and the right median cingulate and paracingulate gyri. In the default mode network, all three gradients showed statistically significant differences. These results suggest potential neuroimaging biomarkers for assessing the severity of ASD in preschool-aged children.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical excitability, the tendency of neurons to respond to various stimuli, is impaired in most neuropsychiatric conditions. Non-invasive brain stimulation can exert therapeutic effects by modulating the cortical excitability. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) have shown promise in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including improving cognitive abilities and motor function following stroke. Oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (otDCS), as a novel stimulation paradigm, combines tDCS and tACS to simultaneously regulate neuronal membrane potentials and oscillatory rhythms. This combination may produce more significant effects on neurons. To investigate this, participants received the following stimuli for 20 min on different days: (i) 2 mA 40 Hz otDCS, (ii) 2 mA 40 Hz tACS, (iii) 2 mA tDCS, and (iv) sham stimulation. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) were assessed both before and after stimulation. The increase in MEPs amplitudes was most pronounced under otDCS conditions compared with tACS and tDCS. Furthermore, analysis of TMS-EEG data revealed that changes in time-varying brain network patterns were most pronounced after otDCS, manifesting as enhanced brain-wide information connectivity. Our results indicate that gamma otDCS has significant potential for regulating cortical excitability and activating brain networks.</span>

We measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants elicited a sound via button press, observed another person performing this action, or listened to external sounds. By applying multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we found evidence for altered processing in the right auditory cortex for sounds following both self-performed and observed actions relative to external sounds. Evidence for the prediction of auditory action consequences was found in the bilateral cerebellum and the right supplementary motor area, but only for self-performed actions.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 79 first-episode schizophrenia and 90 healthy controls. All patients received antipsychotic monotherapy for up to 12 weeks and underwent a second scan. We found that significantly reduced static FC in CEN-DMN/SN and SN-SCN were observed in nonresponders after treatment, whereas almost no difference was observed in responders. The nonresponders showed significantly higher dynamic FC in PN-DMN/SN than responders at baseline. Further, the baseline FC in core brain networks were treated as moderators involved in symptom relief and distinguished response subtypes with high classification accuracy. Collectively, the current work highlights the potential of communications among five core brain networks in searching biomarkers of antipsychotic monotherapy response and neuroanatomical subtypes, advancing the understanding of antipsychotic treatment mechanisms in schizophrenia.</span>

                Background Microalgae-based products offer a sustainable solution for food, fuel, and agricultural inputs, presenting environmental benefits and economic opportunities. A comprehensive assessment is needed to understand their potential in supporting sustainability goals, considering the complex interplay between production methods, energy sources, and environmental impacts. Methods This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three microalgae-derived products – biodiesel, fish feed, and biofertilizer – through a comprehensive life cycle assessment. Nine scenarios were explored comparing three electricity profiles (current Thai mix, 50% renewable/50% current mix hybrid, 100% renewable) across the three products. The assessment evaluated environmental impacts and potential economic benefits of transitioning to these microalgae-based alternatives. Results and discussion All products demonstrated potential for significant environmental benefits under increased renewable energy scenarios. Fish feed consistently exhibited the lowest environmental impacts across all categories examined, showing substantial improvements with increased renewable energy use. With an annual demand of 0.4 million tonnes, fish feed could generate USD 560 million in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 million tonnes. Fulfilling the projected biodiesel demand of 4,015 million liters per year through microalgae production could yield approximately USD 3.5 billion in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 30 million tonnes compared to conventional fossil-based diesel. Additionally, algal biofertilizer production could meet a 5 million tonnes annual demand, offering USD 2 billion in revenue while reducing CO2 emissions by 6 million tonnes yearly. Collectively, these products could offset 37 million tonnes of CO2, representing about 14% of Thailand’s total CO2 emissions, contributing significantly to the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 20-30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Conclusion Transitioning to microalgae-based products could transform the aquaculture, energy, and agricultural sectors, potentially supporting the national climate change mitigation goals, if implemented.

                <p>The primary motor cortex (M1) is strongly engaged by movement planning and execution. However, the role of M1 activity in voluntary grasping is still not completely understood. Here we analyze recordings of M1 neurons during the execution of a delayed reach-to-grasp task, where monkeys had to actively grasp an object with either a side or a precision grip, and then pull it with a low or high amount of force. Single cell and neural populations analyses showed that grip type was robustly and specifically encoded by a large population of neurons, while force level was weakly and transiently encoded within mixed-selective neurons that also encoded grip type. Notably, the grip type was stably decoded from motor cortical populations during the preparation and execution epochs of the task. Our results are consistent with the idea that planning and performing specific grasping movements are high-level skills that strongly engage M1 neurons, while the execution of pulling force might be prominently encoded at lower stages of the motor system.</p>

                <p>Investigation of neural processes underlying motor control requires behavioral readouts that capture the richness of actions, including both categorical (choice-based) information and motor execution (kinematics). We present an open-source platform for behavioral training of head-fixed mice that combines a stationary or retractable forelimb-based joystick, sound-presentation system, capacitive lick sensor, and water reward dispenser. The setup allows for the creation of multiple behavioral paradigms, two of which are highlighted here: a two-alternative forced-choice auditory-motor discrimination paradigm and a two-armed bandit value-based decision-making task. In the auditory-motor paradigm, mice learn to report high- or low-frequency tones by pushing or pulling the joystick. In the value-based paradigm, mice learn to push or pull the joystick based on the history of rewarded trials. In addition to reporting categorical choices, this setup provides a rich dataset of motor parameters that reflect components of the underlying learning and decision processes in both of these tasks. These kinematic parameters (including joystick speed and displacement, Fr&eacute;chet similarity of trajectories, tortuosity, angular standard deviation, and movement vigor) provide key additional insights into the motor execution of choices that are not as readily assessed in other paradigms. The system's flexibility of task design, joystick readout, and ease of construction represent an advance compared with currently available manipulandum tasks in mice. We provide detailed schematics for constructing the setup and protocols for behavioral training using both paradigms, with the hope that this open-source resource is readily adopted by neuroscientists interested in mechanisms of sensorimotor integration, motor control, and choice behavior.</p>

                <p>Behavioral and neuroscientific studies have shown that watching a speaker's lip movements aids speech comprehension. Intriguingly, even when videos of speakers are presented silently, various cortical regions track auditory features, such as the envelope. Recently, we demonstrated that eye movements track low-level acoustic information when attentively listening to speech. In this study, we investigated whether ocular speech tracking occurs during visual speech and how it influences cortical silent speech tracking. Furthermore, we compared data from hearing individuals, congenitally deaf individuals, and those who became deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) later in life to assess how audiovisual listening experience and auditory deprivation (early vs late onset) affect neural and ocular speech tracking during silent lip-reading. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we examined ocular and neural speech tracking of 75 participants observing silent videos of a speaker played forward and backward. Our main finding is a clear ocular unheard speech tracking effect with dominance of &lt;1&nbsp;Hz, which was not present for lip movements. Similarly, we observed an &le; 1.3&nbsp;Hz effect of neural unheard speech tracking in temporal regions for hearing participants. Importantly, neural tracking was not directly linked to ocular tracking. Strikingly, across listening groups, deaf participants with auditory experience showed higher ocular speech tracking than hearing participants, while no ocular speech tracking effect was revealed for congenitally deaf participants in a very small sample. This study extends previous work by demonstrating the involvement of eye movements in speech processing, even in the absence of acoustic input.</p>

                <p>The re-emergence of task-related activation patterns during awake rest has been reported to play a role in memory consolidation and perceptual learning. This study aimed to test whether such reactivation occurs in the primary sensorimotor cortex following a visuomotor task. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, 42 healthy participants (13 women and 29 men) learned visuomotor tracking, while a rotational perturbation was introduced between the cursor position and joystick angle. This visuomotor task block was interleaved with a control block, during which participants passively viewed a replay of their previously performed cursor movements. Half of the participants used their right hand, whereas the other half used their left hand to control the joystick. Resting-state scans were acquired before and after the visuomotor task sessions. A multivariate pattern classifier was trained to classify task and control blocks and was then tested on resting-state scans collected before and after the task session. Results revealed a significant increase in the number of volumes classified as "task" during post-task rest compared with pre-task rest, indicating re-emergence of task-related activity. Representational similarity analysis also showed a greater similarity to task-related patterns during the post-task rest period. Furthermore, this effect was specific to the left primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the hand used and significantly correlated with motor improvement following rest. Our findings reveal the reactivation of recent task-related experience in the primary sensorimotor cortex.</p>

                Background Vehicle safety and stability are paramount in the automotive industry, with aerodynamics playing a crucial role in enhancing these attributes. Spoilers, often used to modify airflow around vehicles, can significantly impact performance depending on their design and configuration. This study explores the use of airfoils as spoilers with adjustable trailing edges to dynamically control downforce and lift forces, aiming to improve vehicle stability and performance. Methods Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed using ANSYS Fluent ® software (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA) The authors confirm that they have obtained the necessary license for the use of this software in academic research. to analyses the aerodynamic effects of spoilers with varying trailing edge angles (AOTE). A Tesla car model was designed in CATIA™ software (Dassault Systèmes), Vélizy-Villacoublay, France), and simulations were conducted at speeds ranging from 120 km/h to 350 km/h. The Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model was employed to accurately capture airflow patterns. The computational domain was configured as a wind tunnel, and a grid independence study ensured the reliability of the results. Boundary conditions included velocity inlets, pressure outlets, and no-slip walls for the car and spoiler surfaces. Results The study revealed that adjusting the trailing edge angle had a significant impact on downforce and lift forces. At a trailing edge angle of 30 degrees, the negative lift force increased by up to 36%, while at zero degrees, it increased by up to 17%. The positive lift force was optimized to enhance vehicle performance during acceleration, resulting in an overall increase in total lift force by up to 15%. The simulated drag coefficient of 0.256 showed a 6% discrepancy compared to Tesla’s reported value of 0.24, primarily due to differences in mesh refinement and the omission of certain design features. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of movable trailing edge spoilers in improving vehicle stability, handling, and acceleration. The ability to dynamically adjust aerodynamic forces offers a practical solution for enhancing vehicle performance and safety. Future research will focus on refining control algorithms and testing under a broader range of driving conditions. These findings provide a strong foundation for integrating advanced aerodynamic features into modern vehicle designs.

     alt="Ontogenetic Changes in Endocranial Anatomy in Gorgosaurus libratus (Theropoda: Tyrannosauridae) Provide Insight Into the Evolution of the Tyrannosauroid Endocranium"/>
<p>Changes through growth (ontogenetic) in the braincase of the eutyrannosaurian tyrannosauroid <i>Gorgosaurus libratus</i> are discussed. Most notably, brain cavity endocasts of immature <i>Gorgosaurus</i> are found to more clearly show details of the brain morphology than more mature individuals, a finding that has implications for improving dinosaur paleoneurology.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Over the past two decades, increased accessibility to computed tomography (CT) scanners has greatly facilitated documentation of the endocranium in numerous extinct theropod taxa. However, most of these studies have focused on the morphology of mature individuals, thus changes or variation through ontogeny of the endocranium in theropods remains largely unknown. The current study sheds light on the endocranial anatomy of the eutyrannosaurian tyrannosauroid, <i>Gorgosaurus libratus</i>, in both an ontogenetic and evolutionary context. Based on CT scans of six <i>Gorgosaurus</i> braincases, including those of two recently discovered juvenile individuals, we virtually reconstruct and describe the endocranial morphology for a growth series of <i>G. libratus</i>. Despite considerable changes in skull architecture, relatively few ontogenetic changes occurred in the endocranium of <i>Gorgosaurus</i>. These changes include a subtle increase in the length of the hindbrain region of the endocast and increased inflation of the tympanic sinus diverticula in adults relative to juveniles. Among the most significant ontogenetic changes is a decrease in the distinctiveness of the brain morphology in endocasts as <i>Gorgosaurus</i> mature. The endocasts of juvenile <i>Gorgosaurus</i> exhibit better defined cerebral hemispheres, optic lobes, and cerebella than those of larger and more mature individuals. This suggests a closer correspondence between the endocast and the brain in juvenile tyrannosaurids, indicating the endocast of juvenile individuals provides a more accurate representation of the structure of the brain and its regions relative to the endocast of more mature individuals. The brain of <i>Gorgosaurus</i> displays a mix of basal archosaurian traits and more derived coelurosaurian traits. More primitive archosaurian features of the <i>Gorgosaurus</i> brain include large olfactory bulbs and tracts, a posteroventrally oriented long axis of the cerebrum, and posteriorly positioned optic lobes, whereas derived features include prominent hindbrain flexure, a somewhat enlarged cerebrum, and a cerebellum that at least partially separates the left and right optic lobes. An understanding of the evolutionary acquisition of such derived features leading to the avian brain may be further elucidated via the study of the endocasts of juvenile individuals (more reflective of the structure/organization of various brain regions) of earlier-diverging theropods (e.g., Allosauroidea, Megalosauroidea, and Coelophysoidea).</p>

     alt="Molecular and Morphological Circuitry of the Octopus Sucker Ganglion"/>
<p>Each of the prehensile suckers on the octopus arm contains a sucker ganglion embedded in the sucker musculature. The function of this ganglion has long been disputed. We provide molecular evidence that the sucker ganglion comprises sensory and motor elements and demonstrate circuit pathways for local processing as well as connections to central nervous system. Thus, the sucker ganglion is well situated for control of sucker reflexes and integrative sensorimotor processing.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The octopus sucker is a profoundly complex sensorimotor structure. Each of the hundreds of suckers that line the octopus arm can move independently or in concert with one another. These suckers also contain an intricate sensory epithelium, enriched with chemotactile receptors. Much of the massive nervous system embedded in the octopus arm mediates control of the suckers. Each arm houses a large axial nerve cord (ANC), which features local enlargements corresponding to each sucker. There is also a sucker ganglion, a peripheral nervous element, situated in the stalk of every sucker. The structure and function of the sucker ganglion remain obscure. We examined the cellular organization and molecular composition of the sucker ganglion in <i>Octopus bimaculoides</i>. The sucker ganglion has an ellipsoid shape and features an unusual organization: the neuropil of the ganglion is distributed as a cap aborally (away from the sucker) and a small pocket orally (toward the sucker), with neuronal cell bodies concentrated in the space between. Using in situ hybridization, we detected positive expression of sensory (<i>PIEZO</i>) and motor (<i>LHX3</i> and <i>MNX</i>) neuron markers in the sucker ganglion cell bodies. Nerve fibers spread out from the sucker ganglion, targeting the surrounding sucker musculature and the oral roots extending to the ANC. Our results indicate that the sucker ganglion is composed of both sensory and motor elements and suggest that this ganglion is not a simple relay for the ANC, but facilitates local reflexes for each sucker.</p>

Lamont, Jamaluddin Jompa, Mochyudho Prasetya, Laura Richardson, Lucille Chapuis, Emma Weschke, Andrew Hoey, Ricardo Beldade, Suzanne C. Mills, Anne Haguenauer, Frederic Zuberer, Stephen D.

Passive acoustic monitoring can offer insights into the state of coral reef ecosystems at low-costs and over extended temporal periods. Comparison of whole soundscape properties can rapidly deliver broad insights from acoustic data, in contrast to detailed but time-consuming analysis of individual bioacoustic events. However, a lack of effective automated analysis for whole soundscape data has impeded progress in this field. Here, we show that machine learning (ML) can be used to unlock greater insights from reef soundscapes. We showcase this on a diverse set of tasks using three biogeographically independent datasets, each containing fish community (high or low), coral cover (high or low) or depth zone (shallow or mesophotic) classes. We show supervised learning can be used to train models that can identify ecological classes and individual sites from whole soundscapes. However, we report unsupervised clustering achieves this whilst providing a more detailed understanding of ecological and site groupings within soundscape data. We also compare three different approaches for extracting feature embeddings from soundscape recordings for input into ML algorithms: acoustic indices commonly used by soundscape ecologists, a pretrained convolutional neural network (P-CNN) trained on 5.2 million hrs of YouTube audio, and CNN’s which were trained on each individual task (T-CNN). Although the T-CNN performs marginally better across tasks, we reveal that the P-CNN offers a powerful tool for generating insights from marine soundscape data as it requires orders of magnitude less computational resources whilst achieving near comparable performance to the T-CNN, with significant performance improvements over the acoustic indices. Our findings have implications for soundscape ecology in any habitat.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013006">Dynamic modeling of EEG responses to natural speech reveals earlier processing of predictable words</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jin Dou, Andrew J. Anderson, Aaron S. White, Samuel V. Norman-Haignere, Edmund C. Lalor</p>

In recent years, it has become clear that EEG indexes the comprehension of natural, narrative speech. One particularly compelling demonstration of this fact can be seen by regressing EEG responses to speech against measures of how individual words in that speech linguistically relate to their preceding context. This approach produces a so-called temporal response function that displays a centro-parietal negativity reminiscent of the classic N400 component of the event-related potential. One shortcoming of previous implementations of this approach is that they have typically assumed a linear, time-invariant relationship between the linguistic speech features and the EEG responses. In other words, the analysis typically assumes that the response has the same shape and timing for every word – and only varies (linearly) in terms of its amplitude. In the present work, we relax this assumption under the hypothesis that responses to individual words may be processed more rapidly when they are predictable. Specifically, we introduce a framework wherein the standard linear temporal response function can be modulated in terms of its amplitude, latency, and temporal scale based on the predictability of the current and prior words. We use the proposed approach to model EEG recorded from a set of participants who listened to an audiobook narrated by a single talker, and a separate set of participants who attended to one of two concurrently presented audiobooks. We show that expected words are processed faster – evoking lower amplitude N400-like responses with earlier peaks – and that this effect is driven both by the word’s own predictability and the predictability of the immediately preceding word. Additional analysis suggests that this finding is not simply explained based on how quickly words can be disambiguated from their phonetic neighbors. As such, our study demonstrates that the timing and amplitude of brain responses to words in natural speech depend on their predictability. By accounting for these effects, our framework also improves the accuracy with which neural responses to natural speech can be modeled.

                <p>by Neil Philip Hobbs, Ian Hastings</p>

Insecticide resistance management (IRM) is critical to maintain the operational effectiveness of insecticides used in public health vector control. Evaluating IRM strategies rests primarily on computational models. Most models assume monogenic resistance, but polygenic resistance may be a more appropriate assumption. Conventionally, polygenic models assume selection differentials are constant over successive generations. We present a dynamic method for calculating the selection differentials accounting for the level of resistance and insecticide efficacy. This allows the inclusion of key parameters namely insecticide dosing, insecticide decay and cross resistance, increasing biological and operational realism. Two methods for calculating the insecticide selection differential were compared: truncation (only the most resistant individuals in the population survive) and probabilistic (individual survival depends on their level of resistance). The probabilistic calculation is extendable to multiple gonotrophic cycles, whereby mosquitoes may encounter different insecticides over their life span. A range of IRM strategies of direct policy relevance can be simulated, including the implication of reduced dose mixtures. We describe in detail the calculation and calibration of these models. We demonstrate the ability of the models to simulate a variety of IRM strategies and implications of including these features of the models. In simple IRM strategy evaluations, the truncation and probabilistic models give comparable results to each other and against published polygenic and monogenic models. Analysis of model simulations indicates there is often little difference between sequences or rotations of insecticides. Full-dose mixtures remain the best evaluated IRM strategy. Consistency between models increases confidence in their predictions especially when demonstrating model assumptions do not significantly impact key operational decisions. Using the multiple-gonotrophic cycle model we calculate the age distributions of mosquitoes which provides a framework to link resistance management with disease transmission. Future applications will investigate more scenario-specific evaluations of IRM strategies to inform public health policy.

                <p>by Linda Iris Joseph Tomy, Elif Köksal-Ersöz, Anca Nica, Maxime Yochum, Pascal Benquet, Fabrice Wendling</p>

The therapeutic application of centromedian nucleus stimulation (CMS) has been limited by uncertainties regarding its mechanism of action. In this study, we used stereoelectro-encephalography (SEEG) signals recorded from a patient with refractory epilepsy, caused by focal cortical dysplasia, which is a malformation of cortical development. SEEG recordings revealed that neocortical interictal discharges could be suppressed by CMS. These effects were found to be frequency-dependent: while 50 Hz CMS induced no change in neocortical epileptiform activity, CMS at 70 Hz, 100 Hz and 150 Hz led to periods of suppression of neocortical epileptiform activity. These periods were shown to have different durations depending on the stimulation protocol. We developed a neurophysiologically-plausible thalamocortical model to explain these observations. This model included glutamatergic subpopulations and GABAergic subpopulations in the neocortical and the thalamic compartments. Synaptic inhibition and short-term plasticity mechanisms were integrated into the latter compartment. We hypothesized that the enhanced activation of thalamic inhibitory subpopulations during high frequency CMS (>70Hz) would result in GABA spillover which activated synaptic GABAergic receptors on the thalamocortical relay cells. This decreased the thalamic driving-input to the neocortex, hence suppressing interictal discharges in the dysplastic neocortical tissue. While inhibition of thalamocortical relay cells was maximal for CMS at 70 Hz and 100 Hz, this was not the case for 150 Hz CMS, suggesting that presynaptic GABAergic receptors were activated and that the rate of GABA reuptake was increased. Thus, our model suggests that the transient suppression of the neocortical epileptic activity with CMS may be primarily due to extra-synaptic tonic inhibition in the thalamocortical relay cells. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of high-frequency CMS in epilepsy and pave the way for further research and optimization of this therapeutic approach.

                <p>by Xiaopeng Wei, Jingli Wu, Gaoshi Li, Jiafei Liu, Xi Wu, Chang He</p>

It is a significant step for single cell analysis to identify cell types through clustering single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, great challenges still remain due to the inherent high-dimensionality, noise, and sparsity of scRNA-seq data. In this study, scPEDSSC, a deep sparse subspace clustering method based on proximity enhancement, is put forward. The self-expression matrix (SEM), learned from the deep auto-encoder with two part generalized gamma (TPGG) distribution, are adopted to generate the similarity matrix along with its second power. Compared with eight state-of-the-art single-cell clustering methods on twelve real biological datasets, the proposed method scPEDSSC can achieve superior performance in most datasets, which has been verified through a number of experiments.

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has long been associated with economic and social decision-making in neuroimaging studies. Several debates question whether different ventral mPFC (vmPFC) and dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) regions have specific functions or whether there is a gradient supporting social and nonsocial cognition. Here, we tested an unusually large sample of rare participants with focal damage to the mPFC (<i>N</i> = 33), individuals with lesions elsewhere (<i>N</i> = 17), and healthy controls (<i>N</i> = 71) (total <i>N</i> = 121). Participants completed a temporal discounting task to estimate their baseline discounting preferences before learning the preferences of two other people, one who was more temporally impulsive and one more patient. We used Bayesian computational models to estimate baseline discounting and susceptibility to social influence after learning others’ economic preferences. mPFC damage increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence compared to healthy controls and increased overall susceptibility to social influence compared to those with lesions elsewhere. Importantly, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) of computational parameters showed that this heightened susceptibility to social influence was attributed specifically to damage to the dmPFC (area 9; permutation-based threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) <i>p</i> < 0.025). In contrast, lesions in the vmPFC (areas 13 and 25) and ventral striatum were associated with a preference for seeking more immediate rewards (permutation-based TFCE <i>p</i> < 0.05). We show that the dmPFC is causally implicated in susceptibility to social influence, with distinct ventral portions of mPFC involved in temporal discounting. These findings provide causal evidence for sub-regions of the mPFC underpinning fundamental social and cognitive processes.

                <p>by Fabienne Brutscher, Federico Germani, George Hausmann, Lena Jutz, Konrad Basler</p>

Innate immunity in <i>Drosophila</i> acts as an organismal surveillance system for external stimuli or cellular fitness and triggers context-specific responses to fight infections and maintain tissue homeostasis. However, uncontrolled activation of innate immune pathways can be detrimental. In mammals, innate immune signaling is often overactivated in malignant cells and contributes to tumor progression. <i>Drosophila</i> tumor models have been instrumental in the discovery of interactions between pathways that promote tumorigenesis, but little is known about whether and how the Toll innate immune pathway interacts with oncogenes. Here we use a <i>Drosophila</i> epithelial in vivo model to investigate the interplay between Toll signaling and oncogenic Ras. In the absence of oncogenic Ras (Ras<sup>V12</sup>), Toll signaling suppresses differentiation and induces apoptosis. In contrast, in the context of Ras<sup>V12</sup>, cells are protected from cell death and Dorsal promotes cell survival and proliferation to drive hyperplasia. Taken together, we show that the tissue-protective functions of innate immune activity can be hijacked by pre-malignant cells to induce tumorous overgrowth.

Cancer-driving mutations synergize with inflammatory stress signaling pathways during carcinogenesis. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> tumor models are increasingly recognized as models to inform conserved molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis with both local and systemic effects of cancer. Although initial discoveries of the Toll-NFκB signaling pathway in development and immunity were pioneered in <i>Drosophila</i>, limited information is available for its role in cancer progression. Using a well-studied cooperative Ras<sup>V12</sup>-driven epithelial-derived tumor model, we here describe functions of Toll-NF-κB signaling in malignant <i>Ras</i><sup>V12</sup><i>, scrib</i><sup>-</sup> tumors. The extracellular Toll pathway components ModSP and PGRP-SA and intracellular signaling Kinase, Pelle/IRAK, are rate-limiting for tumor growth. The Toll pathway NFκB protein Dorsal as well as <i>cactus/I</i>κΒ show elevated expression in tumors with highest expression in invasive cell populations. Oncogenic Ras<sup>V12</sup>, and not loss of <i>scribble,</i> confers increased expression and heterogenous distribution of two Dorsal isoforms, DorsalA and DorsalB, in different tumor cell populations. Mechanistic analyses demonstrates that Dorsal, in concert with the BTB-transcription factor Chinmo, drives growth and malignancy by suppressing differentiation, counteracting apoptosis, and promoting invasion of <i>Ras</i><sup>V12</sup><i>, scrib</i><sup>-</sup> tumors.

                Background Telemedicine has improved adherence to heart failure (HF) treatment, however it has not yet been tailored specifically to address HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Our objective is to undertake a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research studies that focus on telemedicine in HFrEF. Methods We conducted an extensive literature review encompassing trials which included outpatients with HFrEF who underwent telemedicine compared with usual care. We exclude any studies without ejection fraction data. Three bibliographic databases from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were utilized in our search from January 1999 to May 2023. The endpoints of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF-related hospitalization. The Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) and the risk of bias in non-randomized studies – of interventions (ROBINS-I) were used for non-randomized or observational studies. To quantitatively analyze the collective findings, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was computed for each outcome. Results Out of the initial pool of 4,947 articles, we narrowed down our analysis to 27 studies, Results showed that telemedicine significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 – 0.78; p<0.00001), cardiovascular-related mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 – 0.80, p < 0.00001), and HF-related hospitalization based on number of events (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 – 0.94, p = 0.009) as well as number of patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 – 0.87, p < 0.0001). Conclusion Telemedicine was shown significantly beneficial in decreasing mortality and hospitalization in HFrEF patients. Future research should focus on standardizing effective telemedicine practices due to the existing variability in methods and clinical situation of the patients.

                Background In the fast-paced digital world, e-learning has become the most convenient medium for higher education institutions to provide scalable education. It is used to provide a flexible educational process through the employment of new technologies. Due to the impact of the war on education in Lebanon during fall 2024-2025 and the suspension of traditional learning, e-learning adoption was the answer to the ministry of education and higher education call for learning continuity. Despite extensive research on e-learning systems, limited empirical evidence exists on factors affecting its success during wartime. This study aims to assesses this success in achieving learning outcomes within the context of higher education under war risks based on the Delone and McLean IS model [1]. Methods A quantitative approach was employed using a structured questionnaire distributed to 429 students and academic staff within higher education institutions in Lebanon. Sampling and data analysis were conducted through structural equation modelling to test hypothesized relationships of the proposed model in SPSS 27.0 using the path analysis. Results The goodness-of-fit measurement of the model represent the desirability and good fit of the model (SRMR = 0. 048). The Cronbach’s α values varying between 0.765 and 0.944, and CR values varying between 0.753, and 0.954, were considered sufficiently error-free and demonstrated the model’s internal consistency and the constructs’ good reliability. The AVE values ranging from 0.509 to 0.808 were all valid, and their convergent validity was fulfilled. The HTMT and the confidence interval empirical criterions are met and constructs discriminant validity is certain. The R2, β, and Q2 measures showed which constructs have strong or weak relationships strength, and large or small predictive relevance. Conclusions According to empirical results, findings reveal that war-perceived risk directly and indirectly affects all model dimensions. Service quality does not significantly affect the intention to use/use, or user satisfaction. Moreover, intention to use/use had no significant impact on the success of e-learning in terms of satisfying its users and attaining their expected learning outcomes. Thus, the war risks imposes the e-learning usage to achieve its outcomes as the only available solution for learning in such circumstances.

                Background Standard multi-drug therapy (MDT) with duration of 6-12 months is generally effective for treating leprosy. However, in cases of lepromatous (LL) and borderline lepromatous (BL) patients with high bacterial loads and complicated circumtances, prolonged duration treatment is more often observed. As prolonged duration may affect patient adherence negatively, adding ofloxacin to MDT is a promising approach to prevent prolonged treatment. Method This retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of adding ofloxacin to MDT in 21 patients diagnosed with LL or BL leprosy at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Bacterial load and viability were tracked using the Bacteriological Index (BI) and Morphological Index (MI), and were compared using non-parametric Friedman test before and after the patients were given ofloxacin. Findings Adding ofloxacin to MDT led to a significant reductions in both BI and MI. The median MI dropped to zero after six months of combined treatment (p<0.001), with significant differences between baseline and 6, 9, and 12-months. BI also significantly declined (p=0.007), with significant reductions between baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12-month assessments. The proportion of patients reaching an MI of zero also steadily increased. Interpretation Ofloxacin as an adjunctive therapy to MDT substantially improves treatment of leprosy with high bacterial and morphological index. Faster bacterial clearance prevent prolonged treatment duration, potentially improving adherence, outcomes and reducing relapse risk. Ofloxacin is the only second-line leprosy treatment covered by the national health insurance in Indonesia. Earlier initiation of this adjunctive therapy may offer greater benefits.

                Acute cellular rejection remains a significant challenge, affecting 10-40% of liver transplant recipients despite advancements in immunosuppressive therapies. While liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing rejection, it is invasive, costly, and associated with potential complications. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) has emerged as a promising noninvasive biomarker, providing real-time insights into graft health through simple blood sampling. This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of dd-cfDNA-modulated immunosuppression in reducing acute T-cell-mediated rejection. Participants undergoing live donor liver transplantation will be randomized into two groups. The intervention group will have dd-cfDNA levels monitored on postoperative days 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90, with elevated levels prompting adjustments in immunosuppressive therapy. The control group will follow standard liver function test (LFT)- based protocols. Both groups will undergo liver biopsy only if significant LFT abnormalities are observed. The primary outcome is the incidence of biopsy-proven rejection. Secondary outcomes include the effectiveness of dd-cfDNA for early rejection detection compared to LFTs and an assessment of graft integrity at one year. Additional analyses will explore correlations between dd-cfDNA levels, T-cell markers, and rejection subtypes. This trial hypothesizes that dd-cfDNA monitoring can reduce rejection rates and minimize the need for invasive biopsies, ultimately improving patient outcomes. With no added risk as only routine follow-up blood samples are required, this study offers a potential paradigm shift in noninvasive, personalized post-transplant rejection management.

                Abstract* Background Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums caused by the buildup of bacterial plaque along the gum line. It can be reduced and prevented by regularly brushing your teeth with a good quality toothpaste. Recently, toothpaste made from natural ingredients has been developed which tends to be popular because it has minimal side effects and a pleasant odor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the herbal toothpaste mix in gingivitis model rats. Methods The product profile of toothpaste mix extracts (TPME) was carried out with organoleptic tests that pay attention to odor, color, taste and texture. in vivo testing was carried out on a sample of 30 Wistar rats modeling gingivitis with tooth brushing treatment twice a day for 7 days in the negative control group (base toothpaste), positive control (commercial toothpaste), toothpaste mix extract (TPME). Profiles of fibroblasts, collagen, angiogenesis counts, monocyte cell counts, polynuclear cell counts were observed by Haematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) and Masson Trichome (MT) staining, with immunohistochemical (IHC) markers CD163 and CD86. Proinflammatory gene expression was also observed in Interleukin-1 Beta (IL-1β) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) genes. Results TPME had a positive response to odor, color, taste and texture characters. Histological observations on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 showed the most significant results on day 7 with an increase in the number of collagen, fibroblasts, angiogenesis, and M2 on CD163 which was in line with the decrease in the number of polynuclear cells, monocytes, M1 on CD86, expression of pro-inflammatory genes IL-1β, and IL-6 which were significantly different from other treatments (p<0.050). Conclusion TPME is able to become a toothpaste product that can treat gingivitis with twice daily application which has the potential to be a promising product to be applied in the future.

                Background Noninvasive conservative treatment of Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) strategies should be carried out before considering invasive treatment options that may lead to irreparable damage. Physical therapy is an effective noninvasive therapy for managing the signs and symptoms of TMDs. To date, the most effective therapeutic approach for managing TMDs pain remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the most effective physical therapy for pain management, symptom control, and quality of life improvement in patients with TMDs. Methods A systematic data search from three databases was performed (PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Sciences). The modified PICOS questions were used with selected criteria: Studies with randomized controlled trial and case series about adult patients diagnosed with TMDs with physical therapy and outcome of reduction of pain and improving function. Studies written in English were selected for this review. Discrepancies were resolved by other author. Results From 490 studies published between 1986 and 2022 with 79 duplicates, data screening was conducted on 414 studies, and 20 studies were included, comparing physical exercise, postural manipulation with splint therapy or accupuncture were analyze. Most interventions demonstrated statistically significant improvements as measured by the study outcomes. Conclusions Most types of physical therapy demonstrated positive effects on patients with TMDs. Furthermore, physical therapy for both cervical and regional TMJ manipulation can be an alternative long-term treatment for TMDs. Physical therapy is as effective or superior to splint therapy. However, many diverse interventions in these studies, the appropriate treatment must be selected carefully based on the patient’s needs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1251/v3?src=rss">Influence of spin-off decision on financing risk: Empirical insight from Indonesian Islamic banks [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Spin-offs play a significant role in organizational development strategies, particularly in Islamic banking, by fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and Shariah-compliant management practices. Indonesia stands as a pioneer in implementing the dual banking system and has established a spin-off policy to foster the growth of Islamic banking. This study investigates whether the spin-off decision has a significant impact on financing risk in Indonesian Islamic banks. Methods Financing risk is measured by the non-performing financing ratio, while the spin-off decision is represented by a dummy variable equal to 1 for the post-spin-off period and 0 for the pre-spin-off period. This study utilizes data from semi-annual reports of 35 Indonesian Islamic banks and analyzes it using a dynamic panel model with the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to overcome potential endogeneity issues that might bias the results. Results The findings reveal that spin-offs significantly reduce financing risk, thereby enhancing the financial resilience and boosting investor appeal. Notably, this implies that Islamic banks operating as Islamic windows exhibit a higher level of financing risk compared to fully-fledged Islamic banks. Furthermore, a noteworthy pattern emerges that spin-off Islamic banks with substantial assets demonstrate greater risk in comparison to their counterparts with more modest assets. System GMM also confirmed the result. Conclusions Islamic banks can significantly reduce their financing risks by establishing independent Islamic banks, or spin-offs. Unlike Islamic windows, which are typically integrated within conventional banks and face higher risk levels, standalone Islamic banks offer greater flexibility and control over their operations. Therefore, spin-off policies for Islamic banks appear to be a viable strategy, as independence fosters enhanced risk sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-223/v2?src=rss">Blockchain-enhanced electoral integrity: a robust model for secure digital voting systems in Oman [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Ensuring the security and trustworthiness of a digitized and automated electoral process remains a significant challenge in democratic systems. As digital voting systems are increasingly being investigated worldwide, ensuring the integrity of the process using robust security measures is of great importance. This paper presents a simplified model to enhance electoral integrity by leveraging Blockchain technology in the context of Oman’s digital voting system. The model uses Blockchain technology to create a secure and trustworthy voting environment, addressing key vulnerabilities in digital electoral systems. Methods The research utilized a quantitative approach, employing an experimental design methodology using open-source software to simulate voting systems. Synthetic population data is used to operate these systems, while advanced biometric authentication technologies verify voter identities. Blockchain technology is leveraged to ensure secure vote recording, with smart contracts used to authenticate voters and securely record votes. Additionally, synchronous transactions are executed for both voter registration and voting processes, enhancing the overall security and efficiency of the system. Results The experimental results show that Blockchain enhances electoral integrity and security in Oman’s voting system, improving elections’ transparency and reliability. The performance evaluation of the model focuses on efficiency, reliability, and scalability metrics. Asynchronous transactions are utilized to improve processing time for voter registration and voting. Election administrators can manage, monitor, and certify election results, while Ethereum nodes ensure decentralized verification and transparency in the voting process. Conclusion This research offers insights for policymakers to consider Blockchain for electoral reforms, addressing issues like data integrity, fraud prevention, and transparency to boost voter trust.

Inhibition of PI4KIIIα reduces PI(4)P levels, thereby slowing synaptic vesicle exo-endocytosis, primarily due to impaired Ca2+ channel function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102938">Rhythmic circuit function is more robust to changes in synaptic than intrinsic conductances</a></h4>

              
                Circuit function results from both intrinsic conductances of network neurons and the synaptic conductances that connect them. In models of neural circuits, different combinations of maximal conductances can give rise to similar activity. We compared the robustness of a neural circuit to changes in their intrinsic versus synaptic conductances. To address this, we performed a sensitivity analysis on a population of conductance-based models of the pyloric network from the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG). The model network consists of three neurons with nine currents: a sodium current (Na), three potassium currents (Kd, KCa, KA), two calcium currents (CaS and CaT), a hyperpolarization-activated current (H), a non-voltage-gated leak current (leak), and a neuromodulatory current (MI). The model cells are connected by seven synapses of two types, glutamatergic and cholinergic. We produced one hundred models of the pyloric network that displayed similar activities with values of maximal conductances distributed over wide ranges. We evaluated the robustness of each model to changes in their maximal conductances. We found that individual models have different sensitivities to changes in their maximal conductances, both in their intrinsic and synaptic conductances. As expected, the models become less robust as the extent of the changes increases. Despite quantitative differences in their robustness, we found that in all cases, the model networks are more sensitive to the perturbation of their intrinsic conductances than their synaptic conductances.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97105">The epididymis contributes to sperm DNA integrity and early embryo development through Cysteine-Rich Secretory Proteins</a></h4>

              
                Numerous reports showed that the epididymis plays key roles in the acquisition of sperm fertilizing ability but its contribution to embryo development remains less understood. Female mice mated with males with simultaneous mutations in <i>Crisp1</i> and <i>Crisp3</i> genes exhibited normal <i>in vivo</i> fertilization but impaired embryo development. In this work, we found that this phenotype was not due to delayed fertilization, and it was observed in eggs fertilized by epididymal sperm either <i>in vivo</i> or <i>in vitro</i>. Of note, eggs fertilized <i>in vitro</i> by mutant sperm displayed impaired meiotic resumption unrelated to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations defects during egg activation, supporting potential sperm DNA defects. Interestingly, cauda but not caput epididymal mutant sperm exhibited increased DNA fragmentation, revealing that DNA integrity defects appear during epididymal transit. Moreover, exposing control sperm to mutant epididymal fluid or to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-supplemented control fluid significantly increased DNA fragmentation. This, together with the higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels detected in mutant sperm, supports a dysregulation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis within the epididymis and sperm as the main factor responsible for embryo development failure. These findings highlight the contribution of the epididymis beyond fertilization and identify CRISP1 and CRISP3 as novel factors essential for sperm DNA integrity and early embryo development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99389">Follicular helper- and peripheral helper-like T cells drive autoimmune disease in human immune system mice</a></h4>

              
                Human immune system (HIS) mice constructed in various ways are widely used for investigations of human immune responses to pathogens, transplants, and immunotherapies. In HIS mice that generate T cells de novo from hematopoietic progenitors, T cell-dependent multisystem autoimmune disease occurs, most rapidly when the human T cells develop in the native NOD.Cg- <i>Prkdc</i>scid <i>Il2rg</i>tm1Wjl (NSG) mouse thymus, where negative selection is abnormal. Disease develops very late when human T cells develop in human fetal thymus grafts, where robust negative selection is observed. We demonstrate here that PD-1<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> peripheral (Tph) helper-like and follicular (Tfh) helper-like T cells developing in HIS mice can induce autoimmune disease. Tfh-like cells were more prominent in HIS mice with a mouse thymus, in which the highest levels of IgG were detected in plasma, compared to those with a human thymus. While circulating IgG and IgM antibodies were autoreactive to multiple mouse antigens, in vivo depletion of B cells and antibodies did not delay the development of autoimmune disease. Conversely, adoptive transfer of enriched Tfh- or Tph-like cells induced disease and autoimmunity-associated B cell phenotypes in recipient mice containing autologous human APCs without T cells. Tfh/Tph cells from mice with a human thymus expanded and induced disease more rapidly than those originating in a murine thymus, implicating HLA-restricted T cell-APC interactions in this process. Since Tfh, Tph, autoantibodies, and lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) have all been implicated in various forms of human autoimmune disease, the observations here provide a platform for the further dissection of human autoimmune disease mechanisms and therapies.

     alt="Dopaminergic Central Neurons and Peripheral Sensory Systems in Pteropod and Nudibranch Molluscs"/>
<p>This study revealed the unprecedented complexity of dopaminergic peripheral neural systems in gastropod molluscs, with lineage-specific diversification of sensory and modulatory functions.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In Euthyneuran molluscs, the distribution and plethora of dopamine (DA) functions are likely coupled to the feeding ecology with a broad spectrum of modifications both in the central and peripheral neural systems. However, studies of benthic grazers currently dominate the analysis of DA-mediated signaling, whereas adaptations to pelagic lifestyles and other feeding strategies are unknown. Here, we characterize the distribution of central and peripheral neurons in representatives of distinct ecological groups: the pelagic predatory pteropod <i>Clione limacina</i> (Pteropoda, Gymnosomata) and its prey — <i>Limacina helicina</i> (Pteropoda, Thecosomata), as well as the plankton eater <i>Melibe leonina</i> (Nudipleura, Nudibranchia). By using tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity as a reporter, we mapped their dopaminergic systems. Across all studied species, despite their differences in ecology, small numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the central ganglia contrast to an incredible density of these neurons in the peripheral nervous system, primarily representing sensory-like cells, which are predominantly concentrated in the chemotactic areas and project afferent axons to the central nervous system. Combined with tubulin immunoreactivity, this study illuminates the complexity of sensory signaling and peripheral neural systems in Euthyneuran molluscs with lineage-specific adaptations across different taxonomical and ecological groups.</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by α-synuclein aggregation in neurons. Recent advances suggest α-synuclein aggregates could serve as a biomarker for PD and related synucleinopathies. This study used surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (sFIDA) to measure α-synuclein aggregates in urine. Patients with PD and isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a precursor to PD, had elevated concentrations compared with healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity were 83% and 65% for PD versus controls and 89% and 62% for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder versus controls. The findings highlight sFIDA's potential for diagnosing synucleinopathies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of several muscle damage biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (PARALS) were considered for this study. Survival was defined as the time from diagnosis to death, tracheostomy, or the censoring date. Blood levels of potassium, creatinine, creatine kinase, phosphorus, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) diagnosis were evaluated as potential prognostic biomarkers. A Cox model was developed for each biomarker and adjusted for sex, onset age, onset site, and diagnostic delay. Significant findings from PARALS were evaluated in the Pooled Resource Open-Access Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database. Additionally, a joint model was constructed to evaluate the prognostic role of phosphatemia slope over time using longitudinal data from PRO-ACT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,444 and 1,023 patients were included in the PARALS and PRO-ACT cohorts, respectively. Only creatinine (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–0.85) and phosphorus (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.04–1.24) showed a significant association with survival in the PARALS cohort. These findings were further validated in the PRO-ACT cohort (creatinine HR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.13–0.35, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; phosphorus HR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.13–4.88, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Longitudinal data from the PRO-ACT database showed that an increase of 0.1 mmol/l per month in phosphate levels was also associated with a HR of 8.26 (95% CI = 1.07–96.6, <i>p</i> = 0.044).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Creatininemia was confirmed as a prognostic marker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, both phosphatemia levels at diagnosis and its rate of change over time were identified as a potential prognostic marker for ALS. As with other blood biomarkers, phosphate levels are cost-effective and minimally invasive to measure, supporting their potential use in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The functions of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in basal transcription complexes remain poorly understood. Bhuiyan et al. find that the basal transcription factor TFIID contains an IDR that drives the subunit TAF2 to nuclear speckles to influence RNA splicing. Thus, TAF2 links the basal transcription machinery to RNA splicing factors.

                Introduction Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease affecting quality of life and causing pruritus. The factors influencing itch and its impact on the quality of life in Thai psoriasis patients are unknown. We aimed to identify these factors and their effect on quality of life. Methods In this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, we included patients with psoriasis who received treatment at Chulabhorn Hospital in Thailand from January 2019 to July 2021. Interviewer is the non-dermatologist practician. The patient’s information was collected, including demographic data, Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS) score, factors affecting itch, and score on the Thai version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). We performed descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Results Of 100 participants, most (99%) experienced itching, with a moderate degree of pruritus (mean Itch NRS score 6.5 ± 2.6) and a moderate effect on quality of life (mean DLQI score 9.4 ± 6.2). Factors associated with itch aggravation were dry skin (p-value = 0.003) and heat and humidity (p-value = 0.042). The results of binary logistic regression revealed that factors associated with moderate-to-extremely large DLQI scores were itch intensity (no-to-mild vs. moderate-to-severe itch: odds ratio [OR] = 13.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.72–65.32, p < 0.001; and adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 31.17; 95% CI = 4.55–213.36; p < 0.001. Conclusions Our findings revealed that the quality of life among patients with psoriasis is their greatest concern. Eliminating the itch intensity that affects their quality of life is crucial but remains challenging in Thailand.

                <p>by Matthew T. Parker, Samija Amar, José A. Campoy, Kristin Krause, Sergio Tusso, Magdalena Marek, Bruno Huettel, Korbinian Schneeberger</p>

Phenotypic differences between individuals of a species are often caused by differences in gene expression, which are in turn caused by genetic variation. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis is a methodology by which we can identify such causal variants. Scaling eQTL analysis is costly due to the expense of generating mapping populations, and the collection of matched transcriptomic and genomic information. We developed a rapid eQTL analysis approach using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing of gametes from a small number of heterozygous individuals. Patterns of inherited polymorphisms are used to infer the recombinant genomes of thousands of individual gametes and identify how different haplotypes correlate with variation in gene expression. Applied to Arabidopsis pollen nuclei, our approach uncovers both <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-eQTLs, ultimately mapping variation in a master regulator of sperm cell development that affects the expression of hundreds of genes. This establishes snRNA-sequencing as a powerful, cost-effective method for the mapping of meiotic recombination, addressing the scalability challenges of eQTL analysis and enabling eQTL mapping in specific cell-types.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neuroimaging is routinely utilized to identify new inflammatory activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). A large language model to classify narrative magnetic resonance imaging reports in the electronic health record (EHR) as discrete data could provide significant benefits for MS research. The objectives of the current study were to develop such a prompt and to illustrate its research applications through a common clinical scenario: monitoring response to B-cell depleting therapy (BCDT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>An institutional ecosystem that securely connects healthcare data with ChatGPT4 was applied to clinical MS magnetic resonance imaging reports in a single institutional EHR (2000–2022). A prompt (msLesionprompt) was developed and iteratively refined to classify the presence or absence of new T2-weighted lesions (newT2w) and contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL). The multistep validation included evaluating efficiency (time and cost), comparison with manually annotated reports using standard confusion matrix, and application to identifying predictors of newT2w/CEL after BCDT start.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Accuracy of msLesionprompt was high for detection of newT2w (97%) and CEL (96.8%). All 14,888 available reports were categorized in 4.13 hours ($28); 79% showed no newT2w or CEL. Data extracted showed expected suppression of new activity by BCDT (&gt;97% monitoring magnetic resonance images after an initial “rebaseline” scan). Neighborhood poverty (Area Deprivation Index) was identified as a predictor of inflammatory activity (newT2w: OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.10–2.59, <i>p</i> = 0.017; CEL: OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01–2.34, <i>p</i> = 0.046).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Extracting discrete information from narrative imaging reports using an large language model is feasible and efficient. This approach could augment many real-world analyses of MS disease evolution and treatment response. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
