              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07796">Enhancing Olfactory Perception Through Large Language Models: Integrating Sensory Data for Advanced Odor Recognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of biological principles into artificial olfactory systems has led to significant advancements in odor detection and classification. Inspired by the intricate mechanisms of natural olfaction, researchers are developing sophisticated systems that mimic the functionality of biological olfactory pathways. These systems utilize high-density chemoresistive sensor arrays (HCSA) combined with advanced computational techniques, such as FPGA-accelerated glomerular convergence circuits (FGCC) and hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNN). This bioinspired approach enables real-time adaptive responses to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of odor identification. At the core of these innovations is the multiparametric sigmoidal sensor activation (MPSA), which quantifies VOCs by leveraging the diverse responses of sensor arrays. The implementation of lateral inhibition via programmable synaptic crossbars (LIPSC) further refines odor processing by mimicking neural interactions found in biological systems. Additionally, temporal self-organizing maps (TSOM) facilitate dynamic clustering of odor patterns, allowing for a nuanced understanding of complex odor environments. A novel aspect of this research lies in the Grassmannian manifold embedding (GME) of odor profiles, which provides a mathematical framework for representing and analyzing the multidimensional nature of odors. Coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo-optimized feedback (HMC-FB), this system effectively compensates for drift in sensor readings, ensuring consistent performance over time. By bridging the gap between biological inspiration and technological innovation, these artificial olfactory systems are poised to revolutionize applications ranging from environmental monitoring to food safety and healthcare diagnostics.

                arXiv:2502.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate decoding of neural spike trains and relating them to motor output is a challenging task due to the inherent sparsity and length in neural spikes and the complexity of brain circuits. This master project investigates experimental methods for decoding zebra finch motor outputs (in both discrete syllables and continuous spectrograms), from invasive neural recordings obtained from Neuropixels.
  There are three major achievements: (1) XGBoost with SHAP analysis trained on spike rates revealed neuronal interaction patterns crucial for syllable classification. (2) Novel method (tokenizing neural data with GPT2) and architecture (Mamba2) demonstrated potential for decoding of syllables using spikes. (3) A combined contrastive learning-VAE framework successfully generated spectrograms from binned neural data.
  This work establishes a promising foundation for neural decoding of complex motor outputs and offers several novel methodological approaches for processing sparse neural data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07828">Some things to know about achieving artificial general intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and foreseeable GenAI models are not capable of achieving artificial general intelligence because they are burdened with anthropogenic debt. They depend heavily on human input to provide well-structured problems, architecture, and training data. They cast every problem as a language pattern learning problem and are thus not capable of the kind of autonomy needed to achieve artificial general intelligence. Current models succeed at their tasks because people solve most of the problems to which these models are directed, leaving only simple computations for the model to perform, such as gradient descent. Another barrier is the need to recognize that there are multiple kinds of problems, some of which cannot be solved by available computational methods (for example, "insight problems"). Current methods for evaluating models (benchmarks and tests) are not adequate to identify the generality of the solutions, because it is impossible to infer the means by which a problem was solved from the fact of its solution. A test could be passed, for example, by a test-specific or a test-general method. It is a logical fallacy (affirming the consequent) to infer a method of solution from the observation of success.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08070">Normative Cerebral Perfusion Across the Lifespan</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral perfusion plays a crucial role in maintaining brain function and is tightly coupled with neuronal activity. While previous studies have examined cerebral perfusion trajectories across development and aging, precise characterization of its lifespan dynamics has been limited by small sample sizes and methodological inconsistencies. In this study, we construct the first comprehensive normative model of cerebral perfusion across the human lifespan (birth to 85 years) using a large multi-site dataset of over 12,000 high-quality arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI scans. Leveraging generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), we mapped nonlinear growth trajectories of cerebral perfusion at global, network, and regional levels. We observed a rapid postnatal increase in cerebral perfusion, peaking at approximately 7.1 years, followed by a gradual decline into adulthood. Sex differences were evident, with distinct regional maturation patterns rather than uniform differences across all brain regions. Beyond normative modeling, we quantified individual deviations from expected CBF patterns in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, identifying disease-specific perfusion abnormalities across four brain disorders. Using longitudinal data, we established typical and atypical cerebral perfusion trajectories, highlighting the prognostic value of perfusion-based biomarkers for detecting disease progression. Our findings provide a robust normative framework for cerebral perfusion, facilitating precise characterization of brain health across the lifespan and enhancing the early identification of neurovascular dysfunction in clinical populations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07543">Ordinal Characterization of Similarity Judgments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.07543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing judgments of similarity within a perceptual or semantic domain, and making inferences about the underlying structure of this domain from these judgments, has an increasingly important role in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We present a new framework for this purpose that makes limited assumptions about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments. The approach starts from a dataset of empirical judgments of relative similarities: the fraction of times that a subject chooses one of two comparison stimuli to be more similar to a reference stimulus. These empirical judgments provide Bayesian estimates of underling choice probabilities. From these estimates, we derive indices that characterize the set of judgments in three ways: compatibility with a symmetric dis-similarity, compatibility with an ultrametric space, and compatibility with an additive tree. Each of the indices is derived from rank-order relationships among the choice probabilities that, as we show, are necessary and sufficient for local consistency with the three respective characteristics. We illustrate this approach with simulations and example psychophysical datasets of dis-similarity judgments in several visual domains and provide code that implements the analyses at https://github.com/jvlab/simrank.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15405">Predicting Parkinson's disease trajectory using clinical and functional MRI features: a reproduction and replication study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.15405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood physiopathology and no established biomarkers for the diagnosis of early stages and for prediction of disease progression. Several neuroimaging biomarkers have been studied recently, but these are susceptible to several sources of variability related for instance to cohort selection or image analysis. In this context, an evaluation of the robustness of such biomarkers to variations in the data processing workflow is essential. This study is part of a larger project investigating the replicability of potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD. Here, we attempt to reproduce (re-implementing the experiments with the same data, same method) and replicate (different data and/or method) the models described in [1] to predict individual's PD current state and progression using demographic, clinical and neuroimaging features (fALFF and ReHo extracted from resting-state fMRI). We use the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org), as in [1] and aim to reproduce the original cohort, imaging features and machine learning models as closely as possible using the information available in the paper and the code. We also investigated methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction pipelines and sets of input features. Different criteria were used to evaluate the reproduction and compare the reproduced results with the original ones. Notably, we obtained significantly better than chance performance using the analysis pipeline closest to that in the original study (R2 \&gt; 0), which is consistent with its findings. Moreover, using derived data provided by the authors of the original study, we were able to make an exact reproduction and managed to obtain results that were close to the original ones. The challenges encountered while reproducing and replicating the original work are likely explained by the complexity of neuroimaging studies, in particular in clinical settings. We provide recommendations to further facilitate the reproducibility of such studies in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06143">The Integrated Information Theory needs Attention</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.06143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) might be our current best bet at a scientific explanation of phenomenal consciousness. IIT focuses on the distinctively subjective and phenomenological aspects of conscious experience. Currently, it offers the fundaments of a formal account, but future developments shall explain the qualitative structures of every possible conscious experience. But this ambitious project is hindered by one fundamental limitation. IIT fails to acknowledge the crucial roles of attention in generating phenomenally conscious experience and shaping its contents. Here, we argue that IIT urgently needs an account of attention. Without this account, IIT cannot explain important informational differences between different kinds of experiences. Furthermore, though some IIT proponents celebratedly endorse a double dissociation between consciousness and attention, close analysis reveals that such as dissociation is in fact incompatible with IIT. Notably, the issues we raise for IIT will likely arise for many internalist theories of conscious contents in philosophy, especially theories with primitivist inclinations. Our arguments also extend to the recently popularized structuralist approaches. Overall, our discussion highlights how considerations about attention are indispensable for scientific as well as philosophical theorizing about conscious experience.

                arXiv:2406.18439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural correlations play a critical role in sensory information coding. They are of two kinds: signal correlations, when neurons have overlapping sensitivities, and noise correlations from network effects and shared noise. It is commonly thought that stimulus and noise correlations should have opposite signs to improve coding. However, experiments from early sensory systems and cortex typically show the opposite effect, with many pairs of neurons showing both types of correlations to be positive and large. Here, we develop a theory of information coding by correlated neurons which resolves this paradox. We show that noise correlations are always beneficial if they are strong enough, unless neurons are perfectly correlated by the stimulus. Extensive tests on retinal recordings under different visual stimuli confirm our predictions. Finally, using neuronal recordings and modeling, we show that for high dimensional stimuli noise correlation benefits the encoding of fine-grained details of visual stimuli, at the expense of large-scale features, which are already well encoded.

                arXiv:2409.08868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have proved in both human-based and computer-based tests that natural concepts generally 'entangle' when they combine to form complex sentences, violating the rules of classical compositional semantics. In this article, we present the results of an innovative video-based cognitive test on a specific conceptual combination, which significantly violates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt version of Bell's inequalities ('CHSH inequality'). We also show that collected data can be faithfully modeled within a quantum-theoretic framework elaborated by ourselves and a 'strong form of entanglement' occurs between the component concepts. While the video-based test confirms previous empirical results on entanglement in human cognition, our empirical approach surpasses language barriers and eliminates the need for prior knowledge, enabling universal accessibility. Finally, this transformative methodology allows one to unravel the underlying connections that drive our perception of reality. As a matter of fact, we provide a novel explanation for the appearance of entanglement in both physics and cognitive realms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07247">A Relativistic Theory of Consciousness (shorten version)</a></h4>

Abstract: This paper is a shorten version of the full paper that was published in the journal Frontiers of Psychology in May 2022. In recent decades, the scientific study of consciousness has significantly increased our understanding of this elusive phenomenon. Yet, despite critical development in our understanding of the functional side of consciousness, we still lack a fundamental theory regarding its phenomenal aspect. The phenomenal aspect of consciousness is the first-person answer to what it is like question, and it has thus far proved recalcitrant to direct scientific investigation. The question of how the brain, or any cognitive system, can create conscious experience out of neural representations poses a great conundrum to science. Naturalistic dualists argue that it is composed of a primitive, private, nonreductive element of reality. Illusionists, on the other hand, argue that it is merely a cognitive illusion. We contend that both the dualist and illusionist positions are flawed because they tacitly assume consciousness to be an absolute property that does not depend on the observer. We developed a conceptual and a mathematical argument for a relativistic theory of consciousness in which a system either has or does not have phenomenal consciousness with respect to some observer. According to the theory, Phenomenal consciousness is neither private nor delusional, just relativistic. In the frame of reference of the cognitive system, it will be observable (first-person perspective) and in other frame of reference it will not (third-person perspective). These two cognitive frames of reference are both correct, just as in the case of an observer that claims to be at rest while another will claim that the observer has constant velocity. Neither observer position can be privileged, as they both describe the same underlying reality.

                arXiv:2410.16524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel supervised learning approach for spiking neural networks that does not rely on traditional backpropagation. Instead, it employs spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) within a supervised framework for image recognition tasks. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using the MNIST dataset. The model achieves approximately 40\% learning accuracy with just 10 training stimuli, where each category is exposed to the model only once during training (one-shot learning). With larger training samples, the accuracy increases up to 87\%, maintaining negligible ambiguity. Notably, with only 10 hidden neurons, the model reaches 89\% accuracy with around 10\% ambiguity. This proposed method offers a robust and efficient alternative to traditional backpropagation-based supervised learning techniques.

                arXiv:2502.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presented study introduces a novel distributed cloud-edge framework for autonomous multi-UAV systems that combines the computational efficiency of neuromorphic computing with nature-inspired control strategies. The proposed architecture equips each UAV with an individual Spiking Neural Network (SNN) that learns to reproduce optimal control signals generated by a cloud-based controller, enabling robust operation even during communication interruptions. By integrating spike coding with nature-inspired control principles inspired by Tilapia fish territorial behavior, our system achieves sophisticated formation control and obstacle avoidance in complex urban environments. The distributed architecture leverages cloud computing for complex calculations while maintaining local autonomy through edge-based SNNs, significantly reducing energy consumption and computational overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches. Our framework addresses critical limitations of conventional methods, including the dependency on pre-modeled environments, computational intensity of traditional methods, and local minima issues in potential field approaches. Simulation results demonstrate the system's effectiveness across two different scenarios. First, the indoor deployment of a multi-UAV system made-up of 15 UAVs. Then the collision-free formation control of a moving UAV flock including 6 UAVs considering the obstacle avoidance. Owing to the sparsity of spiking patterns, and the event-based nature of SNNs in average for the whole group of UAVs, the framework achieves almost 90% reduction in computational burden compared to traditional von Neumann architectures implementing traditional artificial neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08098">Unsupervised categorization of similarity measures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general, objects can be distinguished on the basis of their features, such as color or shape. In particular, it is assumed that similarity judgments about such features can be processed independently in different metric spaces. However, the unsupervised categorization mechanism of metric spaces corresponding to object features remains unknown. Here, we show that the artificial neural network system can autonomously categorize metric spaces through representation learning to satisfy the algebraic independence between neural networks, and project sensory information onto multiple high-dimensional metric spaces to independently evaluate the differences and similarities between features. Conventional methods often constrain the axes of the latent space to be mutually independent or orthogonal. However, the independent axes are not suitable for categorizing metric spaces. High-dimensional metric spaces that are independent of each other are not uniquely determined by the mutually independent axes, because any combination of independent axes can form mutually independent spaces. In other words, the mutually independent axes cannot be used to naturally categorize different feature spaces, such as color space and shape space. Therefore, constraining the axes to be mutually independent makes it difficult to categorize high-dimensional metric spaces. To overcome this problem, we developed a method to constrain only the spaces to be mutually independent and not the composed axes to be independent. Our theory provides general conditions for the unsupervised categorization of independent metric spaces, thus advancing the mathematical theory of functional differentiation of neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19243">Efficient Learning With Sine-Activated Low-rank Matrices</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.19243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank decomposition has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing parameter efficiency in neural network architectures, gaining traction across diverse applications in machine learning. These techniques significantly lower the number of parameters, striking a balance between compactness and performance. However, a common challenge has been the compromise between parameter efficiency and the accuracy of the model, where reduced parameters often lead to diminished accuracy compared to their full-rank counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates a sinusoidal function within the low-rank decomposition process. This approach not only preserves the benefits of the parameter efficiency characteristic of low-rank methods but also increases the decomposition's rank, thereby enhancing model performance. Our method proves to be a plug in enhancement for existing low-rank models, as evidenced by its successful application in Vision Transformers (ViT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D shape modelling.

                arXiv:2410.03943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics. Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting. Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS outperforms Mamba by nearly 2x and LRU by 2.5x on a sequence modeling task with sequences of length 50k.

                arXiv:2411.16737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach that has gained attention for its potential to enable collaborative model training across clients while protecting data privacy, making it an attractive solution for the chemical industry. This work aims to provide the chemical engineering community with an accessible introduction to the discipline. Supported by a hands-on tutorial and a comprehensive collection of examples, it explores the application of FL in tasks such as manufacturing optimization, multimodal data integration, and drug discovery while addressing the unique challenges of protecting proprietary information and managing distributed datasets. The tutorial was built using key frameworks such as $\texttt{Flower}$ and $\texttt{TensorFlow Federated}$ and was designed to provide chemical engineers with the right tools to adopt FL in their specific needs. We compare the performance of FL against centralized learning across three different datasets relevant to chemical engineering applications, demonstrating that FL will often maintain or improve classification performance, particularly for complex and heterogeneous data. We conclude with an outlook on the open challenges in federated learning to be tackled and current approaches designed to remediate and improve this framework.

	<p>Purpose: Determine if performing ultrasound-guided, bilateral, two-level cervical sympathetic chain blocks (2LCSB) (performed on subsequent days) provides durable improvement in symptoms associated with anxiety. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted between January 2022 and November 2024. We identified 114 patients who received bilateral, 2LCSB for anxiety symptoms. Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) outcome measure scores were collected at baseline and three-months post procedure in 71 males and 43 females. Results: Out of 114 patients, 99 patients (86.8%) showed a long-lasting improvement in their GAD-7 scores. Collected GAD-7 forms had a baseline average of 15.52 (14.99 for males and 16.40 for females), which decreased after three months to an average of 7.28 (6.96 for males and 7.81 for females). This represents a 52% average improvement in anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: In individuals treated with bilateral, 2LCSB, GAD-related symptoms were improved by 52% for at least 3 months regardless of initial anxiety severity.</p>

	<p>Background: Co-occurring conditions and psychiatric comorbidities are more frequently observed in autistic individuals than in typically developing populations. Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the agreement of parent- and self-reported psychopathological assessment using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) and the Youth Self Report (YSR/11-18), respectively, in autistic adolescents without intellectual impairment. Methods: 54 autistic adolescents without intellectual impairment (11&amp;amp;ndash;18 years; M = 14.73; SD = 2.28) were assessed with a psychiatric and psychological evaluation conducted by expert clinicians also using self- and parent-reported scales and semi-structured interviews (K-SADS PL, CDI, MASC) including CBCL/6-18 and YSR/11-18. Results: According to clinical judgment, over 90% of participants had at least a comorbidity: anxiety (68.5%) and mood disorder (57.4%) were the most frequent. The results indicate significant discrepancies between parent- and self-reports across the three summary scales, which assess emotional and behavioral problems, as well as their combined presentation, often observed in youth with ASD. Specifically, differences were found in Internalizing (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), Externalizing (p = 0.013), and Total Problems (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) scales. Conclusions: The findings show the lack of agreement in parent- and self-reported scales in our sample. These results suggest the need for a cross- and multi-informant approach to support clinical judgment and understand psychopathological comorbidities of autistic adolescents without intellectual impairment.</p>

	<p>Background: Brain-inspired models are commonly employed for artificial intelligence. However, the complex environment can hinder the performance of electronic equipment. Therefore, enhancing the injury resistance of brain-inspired models is a crucial issue. Human brains have self-adaptive abilities under injury, so drawing on the advantages of the human brain to construct a brain-inspired model is intended to enhance its injury resistance. But current brain-inspired models still lack bio-plausibility, meaning they do not sufficiently draw on real neural systems&amp;amp;rsquo; structure or function. Methods: To address this challenge, this paper proposes the complex spiking neural network (Com-SNN) as a brain-inspired model, in which the topology is inspired by the topological characteristics of biological functional brain networks, the nodes are Izhikevich neuron models, and the edges are synaptic plasticity models with time delay co-regulated by excitatory synapses and inhibitory synapses. To evaluate the injury resistance of the Com-SNN, two injury-resistance metrics are investigated and compared with SNNs with alternative topologies under the stochastic removal of neuron models to simulate the consequence of stochastic attacks. In addition, the injury-resistance mechanism of brain-inspired models remains unclear, and revealing the mechanism is crucial for understanding the development of SNNs with injury resistance. To address this challenge, this paper analyzes the synaptic plasticity dynamic regulation and dynamic topological characteristics of the Com-SNN under stochastic attacks. Results: The experimental results indicate that the injury resistance of the Com-SNN is superior to that of other SNNs, demonstrating that our results can help improve the injury resistance of SNNs. Conclusions: Our results imply that synaptic plasticity is an intrinsic element impacting injury resistance, and that network topology is another element that impacts injury resistance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/7/e0216242024?rss=1">Late Development of Sensory Thresholds for Horizontal Relative Disparity in Human Visual Cortex in the Face of Precocial Development of Thresholds for Absolute Disparity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Immaturities exist at multiple levels of the developing human visual pathway, starting with immaturities in photon efficiency and spatial sampling in the retina and on through immaturities in the early and later stages of cortical processing. Here, we use steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and controlled visual stimuli to determine the degree to which sensitivity to horizontal retinal disparity is limited by the visibility of the monocular half-images, the ability to encode absolute disparity, or the ability to encode relative disparity. Responses were recorded from male and female human participants at average ages of 5.3 &plusmn; 1.6 months, 4.7&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;1.3 years, and 25.3 &plusmn; 6 years. Horizontal disparity sensitivity was measured using planar stereograms that modulated absolute disparity and stereograms portraying disparity gratings that additionally contained relative disparity. Disparity thresholds for absolute disparity changed little over development, but those for relative disparity changed by a factor of ~10. SSVEPs were also recorded in response to contrast and blur modulation of dynamic random-dot patterns to measure sensitivity to the spatiotemporal content of the monocular half-images. Equating subjective contrast and blur levels between infants, children, and adults based on these measurements did not equate disparity sensitivity. The protracted developmental sequence for horizontal relative disparity coding shown in our measurements is not simply inherited from immaturities in encoding absolute disparity or retinal image contrast but rather reflects immaturities in the computations needed to represent relative disparity that likely involves extrastriate cortical areas where relative disparity is first extracted.</p>

                <p>To comprehend speech, human brains identify meaningful units, like words, in the speech stream. But whereas the English &lsquo;<I>She believed him.</I>&rsquo; has three words, the Arabic equivalent &lsquo;<I>saddaqathu</I>&rsquo; forms one word with three meaningful subword units, called morphemes: a verb stem (&lsquo;<I>saddaqa</I>&rsquo;), a subject suffix (&lsquo;-<I>t</I>-&rsquo;), and a direct object pronoun (&lsquo;-<I>hu</I>&rsquo;). It remains unclear whether and how speech comprehension involves morpheme processing, above and beyond other language units. Here, we propose and test hierarchically nested encoding models of speech comprehension: a <scp>nai&#x0308;ve</scp> model with word-, syllable-, and sound-level information; a <scp>bottom-up</scp> model with additional morpheme boundary information; and <scp>predictive</scp> models that process morphemes before these boundaries. We recorded MEG data as 27 participants (16 female) listened to Arabic sentences like &lsquo;<I>saddaqathu</I><I>.</I>&rsquo; A temporal response function analysis revealed that in temporal and left inferior frontal regions, <scp>predictive</scp> models outperform the <scp>bottom-up</scp> model, which outperforms the <scp>nai&#x0308;ve</scp> model. Moreover, verb stems were either length-<scp>ambiguous</scp> (e.g., &lsquo;<I>saddaqa</I>&rsquo; is initially mistakable for the shorter stem &lsquo;<I>sadda</I>&rsquo;, meaning &lsquo;<I>blocked</I>&rsquo;) or length-unambiguous (e.g., &lsquo;<I>qayyama</I>&rsquo;, meaning &lsquo;<I>evaluated</I>&rsquo;, cannot be mistaken for a shorter stem) but shared a uniqueness point, beyond which stem identity is disambiguated. Evoked analyses revealed differences between conditions before the uniqueness point, suggesting that, rather than await disambiguation, the brain employs <scp>proactive</scp> predictive strategies, processing accumulated input as soon as any possible stem is identifiable, even if not uniquely. These findings highlight the role of morphemes in speech and the importance of including morpheme-level information in neural and computational models of speech comprehension.</p>

                <p>How master splicing regulators cross talk with each other and to what extent transcription regulators are differentially spliced remain unclear in the developing brain. Here, cell-type&ndash;specific RNA-Seq analyses of the developing neocortex uncover variable expression of the Rbfox1/2/3 genes and enriched alternative splicing events in transcription regulators, altering protein isoforms or inducing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Transient expression of Rbfox proteins in radial glial progenitors induces neuronal splicing events preferentially in transcription regulators such as <I>Meis2</I> and <I>Tead1</I>. Surprisingly, Rbfox proteins promote the inclusion of a mammal-specific alternative exon and a previously undescribed poison exon in <I>Ptbp1</I>. Simultaneous ablation of <I>Rbfox1/2/3</I> in the neocortex downregulates neuronal isoforms and disrupts radial neuronal migration. Furthermore, the progenitor isoform of <I>Meis2</I> promotes <I>Tgfb3</I> transcription, while the <I>Meis2</I> neuron isoform promotes neuronal differentiation. These observations indicate that transcription regulators are differentially spliced between cell types in the developing neocortex. (The sex has not been reported to affect cortical neurogenesis in mice, and embryos of both sexes were studied without distinguishing one or the other.)</p>

                <p>Spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) degeneration is a candidate factor for reduced hearing outcomes in cochlear implant (CI) users. However, there is no procedure available to identify CI contacts close to focal SGN degeneration in human patients. In an animal model, we assessed the impact of focal SGN degeneration on electrical responsiveness and derived an electrophysiological marker for the presence, location, and size of such lesions. We introduced cochlear microlesions in 13 guinea pigs (six female) and recorded electrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAP) after 8&ndash;12&nbsp;d. These were compared with recordings from controls (<I>N</I> = 8) and acutely lesioned cochleae (<I>N</I> = 12). We stimulated via 6-contact CIs in monopolar configuration with symmetric, biphasic pulses of alternating polarity. We histologically assessed the lesion and its relative position to the CI contacts. The lesions (230&ndash;850&nbsp;&micro;m) significantly elevated thresholds and reduced amplitudes. The effect was found at stimulation distances of 3.5&nbsp;mm from the lesion. A novel eCAP marker, Failure Index (FI: maximal input/output ratio), was significantly elevated in the presence of degenerated SGN. It indicates the failure to efficiently transduce the stimulation current into neural activation (N1P1 amplitude). The FI showed classification accuracies of 80% and identified contacts closest to the lesion in ~80% of cases within &plusmn;700&nbsp;&micro;m (~electrode spacing) from the lesion site and was correlated with the lesion size. Thus, the FI is a clinically relevant, noninvasive marker that is suitable for clinical datasets without a priori knowledge on lesions, when combined with the statistical method of median splitting.</p>

                <p>We describe a chamber system to perform imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetic stimulation in awake and anesthetized marmosets. We developed this low-profile chamber design to be able to access the underlying tissue when needed or to leave it sealed for long periods. Such accessibility is useful to maintain chamber clarity as well as perform viral or drug injections at different time points. The chamber is flexible as either optical or electrophysiological recording can be performed in the same chamber by exchanging chamber inserts. The design provides an easy approach to day-to-day stable neural recordings that was developed for marmosets and can be extended to other species.</p>

                <p>Sensory experience during development has lasting effects on perception and neural processing. Exposing juvenile animals to artificial stimuli influences the tuning and functional organization of the auditory cortex, but less is known about how the rich acoustical environments experienced by vocal communicators affect the processing of complex vocalizations. Here, we show that in zebra finches (<I>Taeniopygia guttata</I>), a colonial-breeding songbird species, exposure to a naturalistic social-acoustical environment during development has a profound impact on auditory perceptual behavior and on cortical-level auditory responses to conspecific song. Compared to birds raised by pairs in acoustic isolation, male and female birds raised in a breeding colony were better in an operant discrimination task at recognizing conspecific songs with and without masking colony noise. Neurons in colony-reared birds had higher average firing rates, selectivity, and discriminability, especially in the narrow-spiking, putatively inhibitory neurons of a higher-order auditory area, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM). Neurons in colony-reared birds were also less correlated in their tuning, more efficient at encoding the spectrotemporal structure of conspecific song, and better at filtering out masking noise. These results suggest that the auditory cortex adapts to noisy, complex acoustical environments by strengthening inhibitory circuitry, functionally decoupling excitatory neurons while maintaining overall excitatory-inhibitory balance.</p>

                <p>The cell adhesion molecule leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal protein 2 (LRRTM2) is crucial for synapse development and function. However, our understanding of its endogenous trafficking has been limited due to difficulties in manipulating its coding sequence (CDS) using standard genome editing techniques. Instead, we replaced the entire LRRTM2 CDS by adapting a two-guide CRISPR knock-in method, enabling complete control of LRRTM2. In primary rat hippocampal cultures dissociated from embryos of both sexes, N-terminally tagged, endogenous LRRTM2 was found in 80% of synapses, and synaptic LRRTM2 content correlated with PSD-95 and AMPAR levels. LRRTM2 was also enriched with AMPARs outside synapses, demonstrating the sensitivity of this method to detect relevant new biology. Finally, we leveraged total genomic control to increase the synaptic levels of LRRTM2 via simultaneous mutation of its C-terminal domain, which did not correspondingly increase AMPAR enrichment. The coding region of thousands of genes span lengths suitable for whole-CDS replacement, suggesting this simple approach will enable straightforward structure&ndash;function analysis in neurons.</p>

                <p>Hierarchy has been identified as a principle underlying the organization of human brain networks. However, it remains unclear how the network hierarchy is disrupted in Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms and how it is modulated by the underlying genetic architecture. The aim of this study was to explore alterations in the motor functional hierarchical organization of the cerebrum and their underlying genetic mechanism. In this study, the brain network hierarchy of each group was described through a connectome gradient analysis among 68 healthy controls (HC), 70 postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype, and 69 tremor-dominant (TD) subtype, including both male and female participants, according to its motor symptoms. Furthermore, transcription-neuroimaging association analyses using gene expression data from Allen Human Brain Atlas and case-control gradient differences were performed to identify genes associated with gradient alterations. Different PD motor subtypes exhibited contracted principal and secondary functional gradients relative to HC. The identified genes in different PD motor subtypes enriched for shared biological processes like metal ion transport and inorganic ion transmembrane transport. In addition, these genes were overexpressed in Ntsr+ neurons cell, enriched in extensive cortical regions and wide developmental time windows. Aberrant cerebral functional gradients in PD-related motor symptoms have been detected, and the motor-disturbed genes have shared biological functions. The present findings may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hierarchical alterations in PD.</p>

                <p>Genetic information is involved in the gradual emergence of cortical areas since the neural tube begins to form, shaping the heterogeneous functions of neural circuits in the human brain. Informed by invasive tract-tracing measurements, the cortex exhibits marked interareal variation in connectivity profiles, revealing the heterogeneity across cortical areas. However, it remains unclear about the organizing principles possibly shared by genetics and cortical wiring to manifest the spatial heterogeneity across the cortex. Instead of considering a complex one-to-one mapping between genetic coding and interareal connectivity, we hypothesized the existence of a more efficient way that the organizing principles are embedded in genetic profiles to underpin the cortical wiring space. Leveraging vertex-wise tractography in diffusion-weighted MRI, we derived the global connectopies (GCs) in both female and male to reliably index the organizing principles of interareal connectivity variation in a low-dimensional space, which captured three dominant topographic patterns along the dorsoventral, rostrocaudal, and mediolateral axes of the cortex. More importantly, we demonstrated that the GCs converge with the gradients of a vertex-by-vertex genetic correlation matrix on the phenotype of cortical morphology and the cortex-wide spatiomolecular gradients. By diving into the genetic profiles, we found that the critical role of genes scaffolding the GCs was related to brain morphogenesis and enriched in radial glial cells before birth and excitatory neurons after birth. Taken together, our findings demonstrated the existence of a genetically determined space that encodes the interareal connectivity variation, which may give new insights into the links between cortical connections and arealization.</p>

                <p>Attention is key to perception and human behavior, and evidence shows that it periodically samples sensory information (&lt;20&nbsp;Hz). However, this view has been recently challenged due to methodological concerns and gaps in our understanding of the function and mechanism of rhythmic attention. Here we used an intensive ~22&nbsp;h psychophysical protocol combined with reverse correlation analyses to infer the neural representation underlying these rhythms. Participants (male/female) performed a task in which covert spatial (sustained and exploratory) attention was manipulated and then probed at various delays. Our results show that sustained and exploratory attention periodically modulate perception via different neural computations. While sustained attention suppresses distracting stimulus features at the alpha (~12&nbsp;Hz) frequency, exploratory attention increases the gain around task-relevant stimulus feature at the theta (~6&nbsp;Hz) frequency. These findings reveal that both modes of rhythmic attention differentially shape sensory tuning, expanding the current understanding of the rhythmic sampling theory of attention.</p>

                <p>Natural scenes are filled with groups of similar items. Humans employ ensemble coding to extract the summary statistical information of the environment, thereby enhancing the efficiency of information processing, something particularly useful when observing natural scenes. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the representation of ensemble information in the brain remain elusive. In particular, whether ensemble representation results from the mere summation of individual item representations or it engages other specific processes remains unclear. In this study, we utilized a set of orientation ensembles wherein none of the individual item orientations were the same as the ensemble orientation. We recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals from human participants (both sexes) when they performed an ensemble orientation discrimination task. Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and the inverted encoding model (IEM) were employed to unravel the neural mechanisms of the ensemble orientation representation and track its time course. First, we achieved successful decoding of the ensemble orientation, with a high correlation between the decoding and behavioral accuracies. Second, the IEM analysis demonstrated that the representation of the ensemble orientation differed from the sum of the representations of individual item orientations, suggesting that ensemble coding could further modulate orientation representation in the brain. Moreover, using source reconstruction, we showed that the representation of ensemble orientation manifested in early visual areas. Taken together, our findings reveal the emergence of the ensemble representation in the human visual cortex and advance the understanding of how the brain captures and represents ensemble information.</p>

                <p>We aimed to identify the neuronal correlates of performance errors in a difficult timing task. Male rats were trained to seek rewards and avoid shocks depending on the position of photic conditioned stimuli (CS-R and CS-S, respectively). Then, they were exposed to conflict trials where they had to time the interval between the CS-R and CS-S to obtain rewards while avoiding footshocks. There were pronounced individual differences in behavioral strategies on conflict trials. When presented with a CS-S, some rats quickly left the shock sector, forsaking the option of earning a reward, and rarely got shocked. Others earned rewards by delaying avoidance based on the interval between the CS-R and CS-S but were shocked more often. The probability rats would fail a given trial was not stable across trials as rats engaged in incorrect trial runs that were longer than expected by chance. Since this finding suggested that rats shift between two quasi-stable processing modes, we next examined the neuronal correlates of errors. Incorrect trials coincided with reduced firing rates in CA1 and sensory cortical neurons. Moreover, trial-to-trial variations in the firing rates of simultaneously recorded neurons were more strongly correlated on error than correct trials. Last, the power of low-frequency local field potential oscillations was higher during incorrect trials. The finding that the neuronal correlates of correct and error trials are similar in the hippocampus and neocortex lead us to hypothesize that they depend on changes in the activity of common afferents, such as neuromodulatory inputs.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum, identified to be active during cognitive and social behavior, has multisynaptic connections through the cerebellar nuclei (CN) and thalamus to cortical regions, yet formation and modulation of these pathways are not fully understood. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) respond to changes in local cellular activity and emerge during development. PNNs are implicated in learning and neurodevelopmental disorders, but their role in the CN during development is unknown. Connectivity deficits, specifically between lateral CN (LCN) and cortical regions have been found in autism spectrum disorder with patients displaying reduced cognitive flexibility. To examine the role of LCN on cognition, neural activity was perturbed in both male and female mice using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) from postnatal day 21 to 35. We found that while an adolescent LCN disruption did not alter task acquisition, correct choice reversal performance was dependent on DREADD manipulation and sex. Inhibitory DREADDs improved reversal learning in males (5&nbsp;d faster to criteria), and excitatory DREADDs improved female reversal learning (10&nbsp;d faster to criteria) compared with controls. Interestingly, the DREADD manipulation in females regardless of direction reduced PNN intensity, whereas in males, only the inhibitory DREADDs reduced PNNs. This suggests a chronic adolescent LCN manipulation may have sex-specific compensatory changes in PNN structure and LCN output to improve reversal learning. This study provides new evidence for LCN in nonmotor functions and sex-dependent differences in behavior and CN plasticity.</p>

                <p>Real-world choice options have many features or attributes, whereas the reward outcome from those options only depends on a few features or attributes. It has been shown that humans learn and combine feature-based with more complex conjunction-based learning to tackle challenges of learning in naturalistic reward environments. However, it remains unclear how different learning strategies interact to determine what features or conjunctions should be attended to and control choice behavior, and how subsequent attentional modulations influence future learning and choice. To address these questions, we examined the behavior of male and female human participants during a three-dimensional learning task in which reward outcomes for different stimuli could be predicted based on a combination of an informative feature and conjunction. Using multiple approaches, we found that both choice behavior and reward probabilities estimated by participants were most accurately described by attention-modulated models that learned the predictive values of both the informative feature and the informative conjunction. Specifically, in the reinforcement learning model that best fit choice data, attention was controlled by the difference in the integrated feature and conjunction values. The resulting attention weights modulated learning by increasing the learning rate on attended features and conjunctions. Critically, modulating decision-making by attention weights did not improve the fit of data, providing little evidence for direct attentional effects on choice. These results suggest that in multidimensional environments, humans direct their attention not only to selectively process reward-predictive attributes but also to find parsimonious representations of the reward contingencies for more efficient learning.</p>

                <p>To develop reparative therapies for neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS), we need to better understand the physiology of loss and replacement of oligodendrocytes, the cells that make myelin and are the target of damage in MS. <I>In vivo</I> two-photon fluorescence microscopy allows direct visualization of oligodendrocytes in the intact brain of transgenic mouse models, promising a deeper understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of replacing oligodendrocytes after damage. However, the task of tracking the fate of individual oligodendrocytes requires extensive effort for manual annotation and is especially challenging in three-dimensional images. While several models exist for annotating cells in two-dimensional images, few models exist to annotate cells in three-dimensional images and even fewer are designed for tracking cells in longitudinal imaging. Notably, existing options often come with a substantial financial investment, being predominantly commercial or confined to proprietary software. Furthermore, the complexity of processes and myelin formed by individual oligodendrocytes can result in the failure of algorithms that are specifically designed for tracking cell bodies alone. Here, we propose a fast, free, consistent, and unsupervised beta-mixture oligodendrocyte segmentation system (FAST) that is written in open-source software, and can segment and track oligodendrocytes in three-dimensional images over time with minimal human input. We showed that the FAST model can segment and track oligodendrocytes similarly to a blinded human observer. Although FAST was developed to apply to our studies on oligodendrocytes, we anticipate that it can be modified to study four-dimensional <I>in vivo</I> data of any brain cell with associated complex processes.</p>

                <p>The perception of scenes is associated with processing in a network of scene-selective regions in the human brain. Prior research has identified a posterior&ndash;anterior bias within this network. Posterior scene regions exhibit preferential connectivity with early visual and posterior parietal regions, indicating a role in representing egocentric visual features. In contrast, anterior scene regions demonstrate stronger connectivity with frontoparietal control and default mode networks, suggesting a role in mnemonic processing of locations. Despite these findings, evidence linking connectivity in these regions to cognitive scene processing remains limited. In this preregistered study, we obtained cognitive behavioral measures alongside resting-state fMRI data from a large-scale public dataset to investigate interindividual variation in scene processing abilities relative to the functional connectivity of the scene network. Our results revealed substantial individual differences in scene recognition, spatial memory, and navigational abilities. Resting-state functional connectivity reproduced the posterior&ndash;anterior bias within the scene network. However, contrary to our preregistered hypothesis, we did not observe any consistent associations between interindividual variation in this connectivity and behavioral performance. These findings highlight the need for further research to clarify the role of these connections in scene processing, potentially through assessments of functional connectivity during scene-relevant tasks or in naturalistic conditions.</p>

                Background This study aimed to answer the following major question: Who thinks better, non-native speakers of English or ChatGPT?. It provides evidence from processing and interpreting center-embedding English constructions that the human brain surpasses ChatGPT and that ChatGPT cannot be regarded as a theory of language. Methods Fifteen non-native English speakers were recruited as participants. A center-embedding English sentence was presented to both the study participants and the ChatGPT. The ability of the ChatGPT to predict and remember was also tested. Results The study findings reveal that the human brain is still far ahead of Large Language Models, specifically ChatGPT, even in the case of non-native speakers of L2 English. They also showed ChatGPT’s inability to predict and remember. Conclusions The study concludes that the human brain’s ability to process and interpret natural language data and to predict and remember is unique and that ChatGPT still lags behind this unique human ability.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-195/v1?src=rss">Exploring predictors of psychological preparedness for flood victims: A conceptual framework for Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Flooding is one of the most frequent and damaging disasters in Malaysia with major social, economic, and psychological consequences. Compared to material and logistical preparedness, the psychological aspects of disaster management are not given much emphasis. Methods This conceptual paper employs a systematic literature review to understand the factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. The literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate, Directory of Open Access Journals, Supplemental Index and Google Scholar with keywords including “disaster preparedness, flood, natural disaster and psychological preparedness”. Articles were included if they focused on preparedness towards disasters as well as examined coping mechanisms, perceptions and preparedness behaviours in the context of flood-related crises and excluded if they lack methodological rigor. The review synthesized findings using a thematic analysis approach, identifying psychological resilience and coping strategies in flood-affected populations, the role of social support networks in preparedness and recovery as well as mental health implications of floods, including anxiety, trauma, and post-disaster recovery. This synthesis informed the development of a conceptual model to address factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. According to contemporary theories of catastrophe risk reduction and psychological resilience, critical variables included are risk perception, outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, anxiety, and social support. Results It was proposed that these factors work together to determine an individual’s psychological preparedness, enhancing their ability to cope with the psychological and emotional strain of a flood disaster. Conclusions By offering these perspectives, the study contributes to the limited academic discussion on psychological preparedness in Malaysia, which aims to improve the psychological resilience of communities vulnerable to flooding. The proposed framework emphasizes the importance of incorporating psychological preparedness into existing disaster management strategies to reduce the overall damage caused by floods.

                Background Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with stage 1B or higher cancers. Moringa oleifera and Plukenetia volubilis (Sacha inchi) have been reported to enhance various biological functions, including antitumor and antiproliferative activity. Methods In order to evaluate this potential present in crude extracts of the leaves of these plants, as well as the seed oil of P.volubilis, the antitumor activity was determined according to the effect of these derivatives on different biological parameters such as cytotoxicity, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis (among others), in AGS cells (CRL-1739). Results All extracts tested were cytotoxic at 90 and 160 μg/ml concentrations. P. volubilis seed oil showed 95% mortality at 1% concentration (CC50 = 46.7%). Cell proliferation was inhibited, and all extracts affected the cell cycle, but the P. volubilis oil significantly induced an accumulation of AGS cells in the sub G1 phase, inducing DNA fragmentation as a mechanism of cell death. The ethanolic M. oleifera leaf extract also inhibited cell migration. Conclusion M. oleifera, P. volubilis leaf extracts and P. volubilis seed oil can potentially be antitumor products. Further validation in a murine model of gastric cancer is needed to investigate the antitumor potential of these extracts further and to continue the development of herbal products that can help in the management of this type of tumor.

                <p>by Lars Berling, Jonathan Klawitter, Remco Bouckaert, Dong Xie, Alex Gavryushkin, Alexei J Drummond</p>

Bayesian phylogenetic analysis with MCMC algorithms generates an estimate of the posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees in the form of a sample of phylogenetic trees and related parameters. The high dimensionality and non-Euclidean nature of tree space complicates summarizing the central tendency and variance of the posterior distribution in tree space. Here we introduce a new tractable tree distribution and associated point estimator that can be constructed from a posterior sample of trees. Through simulation studies we show that this point estimator performs at least as well and often better than standard methods of producing Bayesian posterior summary trees. We also show that the method of summary that performs best depends on the sample size and dimensionality of the problem in non-trivial ways.

                Introduction Ammonia leaks during ice production can have significant impacts on the health of workers, nearby communities, and the environment. Exposure to ammonia can lead to both acute and chronic adverse effects. Methods A basic cause analysis of ammonia leakage in an ice production facility in Chonburi Province was conducted using Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Boolean algebra equations were applied to construct primary causes, define failure type, and establish prioritization. Risk assessment was performed based on the criteria established by the Department of Industrial Work, incorporating both likelihood and severity to determine the risk level. Results The results identified 22 potential scenarios that contributed to ammonia leakage. When prioritizing these scenarios, dust accumulation and clogging of the fan, uninsulated ammonia transport pipes, coil obstruction due to scale build-up, incorrect shaft bearing motor, and the use of non-heat-resistant lubricants were significant contributors. Risk assessment analysis indicated both moderate and high risk of ammonia leakage. The use of incorrect bearing and non-heat-resistant lubricant in pumps was identified as high-risk, with a score of 9. Conclusions To mitigate this risk, it is necessary to replace bearings with standard ones and use heat-resistant lubricants to prevent pump failure and reduce cooling inefficiencies, which could lead to ammonia leaks. Regular inspection and maintenance should also be implemented. Furthermore, it is essential to enhance workers’ skills and expertise through training and practice.

                Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in various domains, but generating realistic human hands remains a challenge. This study explores the limitations of AI in capturing the fine details and proportions of hands, using Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) as a case study. Methods Our analysis reveals that CLIP struggles to accurately represent hands due to inadequate training data, anatomical complexities, and practical challenges. We conducted a series of tests and analyses to identify the primary causes of CLIP’s difficulties. Results Our results show that CLIP’s struggles stem from data biases and insufficient anatomical representation in training datasets. Specifically, we found distorted finger relationships, inaccurate proportions, and deviations from expected hand geometry. Conclusion This study aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the current limitations and propose possible directions for future research. By leveraging CLIP for evaluation, control algorithms for structure enforcement, DALL-E for generation, AR for gesture tracking, and 3D modeling for anatomical accuracy, we can overcome the challenges of generating realistic human hands and advance AI’s capabilities in artistic creativity

                Background Brucellosis is the most common zoonotic disease in Oman. Studies about genetic diversity of Brucella are limited in the country. This study aimed to genotype Brucella melitensis in human isolates and milk samples using multi-locus variable number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA-14) in Oman. Methods MLVA-14 was employed for forty-nine B. melitensis recovered from human isolates (n = 21), one goat isolate, and milk samples (n = 27). Results Clustering analysis separated the 49 B. melitensis strains into two main clusters including 31 genotypes. In Dhofar Governorate, shared genotypes among different animal species were identified; the same genotypes were found also in human isolates. Moreover, there was a close genetic relationship between human and milk sample strains from Dhofar and AD Dakhiliya Governorates. Phylogeography investigated by Minimum Spanning Tree analysis showed that Omani strains belonged to the East Mediterranean lineage and formed a distinct branch with a close relationship with two strains from the United Arab Emirates. Moreover, eight Omani strains genotyped from milk shared the same MLVA profile as strains from Spain, Portugal, China, India, and Turkey. The caprine isolate was an outlier correlated with a big cluster mostly formed by isolates from China with other strains from Portugal, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Mongolia, Marocco, France and Spain. Conclusions This study highlights the zoonotic nature of B. melitensis transmission from infected livestock to humans and also its circulation among different animal species. The One Health approach is the way to develop policies and programs for disease surveillance and control.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-190/v1?src=rss">Prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus and its Association with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy, Peripheral Vascular Disorder among Security Personnel in United Arab Emirates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Aim This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and associated complications, such as Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) and Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), among security personnel in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods Data were gathered from a sample of 166 security professionals, aged 25–65 years, with a minimum of 8 hours of daily work and at least 2 years of experience, using an observational, cross-sectional study design. The 10 g Semmes Weinstein monofilament testing, Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, and vibration pressure threshold were used for DPN screening followed by the DN4 questionnaire, and the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) was used for PVD assessment. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Research Board (IRB), and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Results The study found a prevalence of 9.6% of DM among security personnel in the UAE. We also found a statistically significant and strong association between DM and DPN (r=0.83; p < 0.001). In contrast, a moderate correlation was observed with PVD (r= 0.56). SPSS version 29 was used for data analysis, and statistical significance was set at a p-value ≤0.05. Conclusion The prevalence of DM among securities in UAE is 9.6%, which is significant, as the total DM prevalence in UAE according to the 2021 report is 12.3%. There is a strong correlation between DM and DPN, suggesting that security personnel could be at higher risk of developing “Diabetic Foot Syndrome” due to the nature and demands of the job. In addition, neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease can increase risk and cause associated foot complications.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), similar to embryonic stem cells, are a class of pluripotent stem cells with the potential to differentiate into various kinds of cells. Because the application of hiPSCs obtained by reprogramming patients' somatic cells in the treatment of brain diseases bypasses the ethical constraints on the use of embryonic stem cells and mitigates immune rejection, hiPSCs have profound clinical application prospects. In this review, we first summarized the differentiation methods of hiPSCs into different kinds of neurons, and secondly discussed the application of hiPSCs in several brain disease models, so as to provide a reference for the future application of hiPSCs in the studies and treatment of brain diseases.</p>

     alt="Structure of the Femoral Chordotonal Organ in the Oleander Hawkmoth, Daphnis nerii"/>
<p>Insect legs serve as organs of locomotion as well as sensory probes into the environment. This study characterizes the mechanosensory femoral chordotonal organ (FeCO) in the legs in the Oleander hawkmoth <i>Daphnis nerii</i>. FeCO senses tibial movements relative to the femur and functions both as a proprioceptor and an exteroceptor in diverse insects. MicroCT and confocal microscopy imaging of the <i>D. nerii</i> legs reveal that the FeCO has ventral (vFeCO) and dorsal (dFeCO) subunits. These are vastly different in their size, the number of neurons, and the dimensions of their scolopales, which are accessory structures in chordotonal organs. The subunits are mechanically connected to the tibia via a cuticular apodeme. Together, the subunits can be modeled as two viscoelastic elements connected in parallel to an elastic apodeme. The structural characterization of FeCO presented here lays the groundwork for future investigation into its structure-function relationships.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Insect legs serve as crucial organs for locomotion and also act as sensory probes into the environment. They are involved in several complex movements including walking, jumping, prey capture, manipulation of objects, and self-grooming. These behaviors require continuous modulation of motor output through mechanosensory feedback, which is provided by numerous mechanosensors located on the cuticle and within the soft tissue. A key mechanosensory organ in the insect leg, the femoral chordotonal organ (FeCO), detects movements of the femoro-tibial joint. This organ is multifunctional and senses both self-generated movements (proprioception) and external stimuli (exteroception). Movements of the tibia alter the length of FeCO, which activates the embedded mechanosensory neurons. Due to the mechanical nature of these stimuli, the structure and material properties of the FeCO are crucial for their function, alongside the encoding properties of FeCO neurons. Here, as a first step toward understanding how its structure modulates its function, we characterized the morphology and anatomy of FeCO in the hawkmoth <i>Daphnis nerii</i>. Using a combination of computed micro-tomography, neuronal dye fills, and confocal microscopy, we describe the structure of FeCO and the location, composition, and central projections of FeCO neurons. FeCO is located in the proximal half of the femur and is composed of the ventral (vFeCO) and dorsal scoloparia (dFeCO), which vary vastly in their sizes and in the number of neurons they house. Moreover, the characteristic accessory structures of chordotonal organs, the scolopales, significantly differ in their sizes when compared between the two scoloparia. FeCO neurons project to the central nervous system and terminate in the respective hemiganglia. Using these morphological data, we propose a mechanical model of FeCO, which can help us understand several FeCO properties relating to its physiological function.</p>

                Gyurkovska et al. identify a micro-ER-phagy pathway that clears aberrant, but not normal, membrane proteins under nutritional stress and provide a live glimpse of engulfment of cargo by the lysosome. This pathway occurs before degradation of normal proteins by macro-autophagy and requires a ubiquitin ligase and the ESCRT complex.

                Liver tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells are important for liver-stage malaria immunity. Chua et al. demonstrate that optimal generation of long-lived liver Trm cells requires priming by cDC1, post-priming exposure to antigen and inflammation, and consideration of the timing and types of vaccine boosters. These findings inform future vaccine design.

                Tang et al. describe a critical molecule, miR-155, which enhances CD8+ T cells that combat CRC and respond to immunotherapy. In multiple human cancers, miR-155 defines a CD8+ T cell state that predicts immunotherapy responses and may serve as a biomarker of immunotherapy candidates, potentially enhancing therapeutic and patient outcomes.

                Calangiu et al. show that, during oculomotor behaviors, the strongest choice representations in dlPFC encode action memories rather than action plans. These retrospective representations seem to be largely fixed across different behaviors, tasks, and learning time scales, supporting the existence of a predominant, rigid representation of space in the dlPFC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100541">Pharmacologic activation of integrated stress response kinases inhibits pathologic mitochondrial fragmentation</a></h4>

              
                Excessive mitochondrial fragmentation is associated with the pathologic mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in the pathogenesis of etiologically diverse diseases, including many neurodegenerative disorders. The integrated stress response (ISR) – comprising the four eIF2α kinases PERK, GCN2, PKR, and HRI – is a prominent stress-responsive signaling pathway that regulates mitochondrial morphology and function in response to diverse types of pathologic insult. This suggests that pharmacologic activation of the ISR represents a potential strategy to mitigate pathologic mitochondrial fragmentation associated with human disease. Here, we show that pharmacologic activation of the ISR kinases HRI or GCN2 promotes adaptive mitochondrial elongation and prevents mitochondrial fragmentation induced by the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Further, we show that pharmacologic activation of the ISR reduces mitochondrial fragmentation and restores basal mitochondrial morphology in patient fibroblasts expressing the pathogenic D414V variant of the pro-fusion mitochondrial GTPase MFN2 associated with neurological dysfunctions, including ataxia, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. These results identify pharmacologic activation of ISR kinases as a potential strategy to prevent pathologic mitochondrial fragmentation induced by disease-relevant chemical and genetic insults, further motivating the pursuit of highly selective ISR kinase-activating compounds as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in diverse human diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99068">Decoding phase separation of prion-like domains through data-driven scaling laws</a></h4>

              
                Proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains (PLDs) are common drivers of the formation of biomolecular condensates and are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations. Here, we exploit the accuracy of our residue-resolution coarse-grained model, Mpipi, to quantify the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins (hnRNPA1, TDP43, FUS, EWSR1, RBM14, and TIA1). Our simulations reveal the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations. These rules are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire family tested, suggesting that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates. Our work offers a quantitative lens into how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions vary in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103068">Glucokinase activity controls peripherally located subpopulations of β-cells that lead islet Ca2+ oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Oscillations in insulin secretion, driven by islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, are crucial for glycemic control. Prior studies, performed with single-plane imaging, suggest that subpopulations of electrically coupled β-cells have privileged roles in leading and coordinating the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. Here, we used three-dimensional (3D) light-sheet imaging to analyze the location and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of single β-cells within the entire islet at &gt;2 Hz. In contrast with single-plane studies, 3D network analysis indicates that the most highly synchronized β-cells are located at the islet center, and remain regionally but not cellularly stable between oscillations. This subpopulation, which includes ‘hub cells’, is insensitive to changes in fuel metabolism induced by glucokinase and pyruvate kinase activation. β-Cells that initiate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave (leaders) are located at the islet periphery, and strikingly, change their identity over time via rotations in the wave axis. Glucokinase activation, which increased oscillation period, reinforced leader cells and stabilized the wave axis. Pyruvate kinase activation, despite increasing oscillation frequency, had no effect on leader cells, indicating the wave origin is patterned by fuel input. These findings emphasize the stochastic nature of the β-cell subpopulations that control Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and identify a role for glucokinase in spatially patterning ‘leader’ β-cells.

                For traditional laboratory microscopy observation, the multi-dimensional, real-time, in situ observation of three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids has always been the pain point in cell spheroid observation. In this study, we designed a side-view observation petri dish/device that reflects light, enabling in situ observation of the 3D morphology of cell spheroids using conventional inverted laboratory microscopes. We used a 3D-printed handle and frame to support a first-surface mirror, positioning the device within a cell culture petri dish to image cell spheroid samples. The imaging conditions, such as the distance between the mirror and the 3D spheroids, the light source, and the impact of the culture medium, were systematically studied to validate the in situ side-view observation. The results proved that placing the surface mirror adjacent to the spheroids enables non-destructive in situ real-time tracking of tumor spheroid formation, migration, and fusion dynamics. The correlation between spheroid thickness and dark core appearance under light microscopy and the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy doxorubicin and natural killer cells on spheroids’ 3D structure was investigated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98593">Interleukin-1 prevents SARS-CoV-2-induced membrane fusion to restrict viral transmission via induction of actin bundles</a></h4>

              
                Innate immune responses triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, while host factors including proinflammatory cytokines are critical for viral containment. By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells. Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus prevents syncytia formation. Notably, in vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium. Together, by revealing the function and underlying mechanism of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, our study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97029">Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is modulated by light and gates rapid phase shifts of the circadian clock</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock enables organisms to synchronize biochemical and physiological processes over a 24 hr period. Natural changes in lighting conditions, as well as artificial disruptions like jet lag or shift work, can advance or delay the clock phase to align physiology with the environment. Within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, circadian timekeeping and resetting rely on both membrane depolarization and intracellular second-messenger signaling. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) facilitate calcium influx in both processes, activating intracellular signaling pathways that trigger <i>Period</i> (<i>Per</i>) gene expression. However, the precise mechanism by which these processes are concertedly gated remains unknown. Our study in mice demonstrates that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is modulated by light and regulates phase shifts of the circadian clock. We observed that knocking down Cdk5 in the SCN of mice affects phase delays but not phase advances. This is linked to uncontrolled calcium influx into SCN neurons and an unregulated protein kinase A (PKA)-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. Consequently, genes such as <i>Per1</i> are not induced by light in the SCN of Cdk5 knock-down mice. Our experiments identified Cdk5 as a crucial light-modulated kinase that influences rapid clock phase adaptation. This finding elucidates how light responsiveness and clock phase coordination adapt activity onset to seasonal changes, jet lag, and shift work.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98152">SERBP1 interacts with PARP1 and is present in PARylation-dependent protein complexes regulating splicing, cell division, and ribosome biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                RNA binding proteins (RBPs) containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are present in diverse molecular complexes where they function as dynamic regulators. Their characteristics promote liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and the formation of membraneless organelles such as stress granules and nucleoli. IDR-RBPs are particularly relevant in the nervous system and their dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumor development. Serpine1 mRNA-binding protein 1 (SERBP1) is a unique member of this group, being mostly disordered and lacking canonical RNA-binding domains. We defined SERBP1’s interactome, uncovered novel roles in splicing, cell division and ribosomal biogenesis, and showed its participation in pathological stress granules and Tau aggregates in Alzheimer’s brains. SERBP1 preferentially interacts with other G-quadruplex (G4) binders, implicated in different stages of gene expression, suggesting that G4 binding is a critical component of SERBP1 function in different settings. Similarly, we identified important associations between SERBP1 and PARP1/polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation). SERBP1 interacts with PARP1 and its associated factors and influences PARylation. Moreover, protein complexes in which SERBP1 participates contain mostly PARylated proteins and PAR binders. Based on these results, we propose a feedback regulatory model in which SERBP1 influences PARP1 function and PARylation, while PARylation modulates SERBP1 functions and participation in regulatory complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87380">Brain areas for reversible symbolic reference, a potential singularity of the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of symbolic thinking has been proposed as a dominant cognitive criterion to distinguish humans from other primates during hominisation. Although the proper definition of a symbol has been the subject of much debate, one of its simplest features is bidirectional attachment: the content is accessible from the symbol, and vice versa. Behavioural observations scattered over the past four decades suggest that this criterion might not be met in non-human primates, as they fail to generalise an association learned in one temporal order (A to B) to the reverse order (B to A). Here, we designed an implicit fMRI test to investigate the neural mechanisms of arbitrary audio–visual and visual–visual pairing in monkeys and humans and probe their spontaneous reversibility. After learning a unidirectional association, humans showed surprise signals when this learned association was violated. Crucially, this effect occurred spontaneously in both learned and reversed directions, within an extended network of high-level brain areas, including, but also going beyond, the language network. In monkeys, by contrast, violations of association effects occurred solely in the learned direction and were largely confined to sensory areas. We propose that a human-specific brain network may have evolved the capacity for reversible symbolic reference.

                One of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy termed ‘P3 editing’, which links <span class="underline">p</span>rotein-<span class="underline">p</span>rotein <span class="underline">p</span>roximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98523">Ezrin defines TSC complex activation at endosomal compartments through EGFR–AKT signaling</a></h4>

              
                Endosomes have emerged as major signaling hubs where different internalized ligand–receptor complexes are integrated and the outcome of signaling pathways are organized to regulate the strength and specificity of signal transduction events. Ezrin, a major membrane–actin linker that assembles and coordinates macromolecular signaling complexes at membranes, has emerged recently as an important regulator of lysosomal function. Here, we report that endosomal-localized EGFR/Ezrin complex interacts with and triggers the inhibition of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC complex) in response to EGF stimuli. This is regulated through activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Loss of Ezrin was not sufficient to repress TSC complex by EGF and culminated in translocation of TSC complex to lysosomes triggering suppression of mTORC1 signaling. Overexpression of constitutively active EZRIN<sup>T567D</sup> is sufficient to relocalize TSC complex to the endosomes and reactivate mTORC1. Our findings identify EZRIN as a critical regulator of autophagy via TSC complex in response to EGF stimuli and establish the central role of early endosomal signaling in the regulation of mTORC1. Consistently, Medaka fish deficient for Ezrin exhibit defective endo-lysosomal pathway, attributable to the compromised EGFR/AKT signaling, ultimately leading to retinal degeneration. Our data identify a pivotal mechanism of endo-lysosomal signaling involving Ezrin and its associated EGFR/TSC complex, which are essential for retinal function.

">A common algorithm for confidence judgements across visual, auditory and audio-visual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Most studies investigating the computational basis of decision confidence have focused on simple visual perceptual tasks, leaving open questions about how confidence is formed in decisions involving other sensory modalities or those requiring the integration of information across modalities. To address these gaps, we used computational modelling to analyse confidence judgements in perceptual decisions involving visual, auditory, and audio-visual stimuli. Drawing on research into visual confidence, we adapted models from the literature to evaluate their fit to our data, comparing three popular classes: unscaled evidence strength, scaled evidence strength, and Bayesian models. Our results show that the scaled evidence strength models consistently outperformed the other model classes across all tasks and could also be used to predict behaviour in the audio-visual task from the unidimensional auditory and visual model fits. These findings suggest that confidence judgements across different perceptual decisions rely on a shared algorithm that dynamically accounts for both sensory uncertainty and evidence strength, without the computation of posterior probabilities. Additionally, we investigated the algorithms used for multidimensional (audio-visual) confidence judgements specifically, showing that participants integrated both the visual and auditory dimensions of the stimulus, rather than relying solely on the most informative modality, and used a modality-independent measure of sensory uncertainty to adjust their confidence. Overall, our findings provide evidence for a common algorithm underlying confidence judgements across modalities and demonstrate the broad applicability of the scaled evidence strength algorithm, even in tasks requiring the integration of distinct sensory information.

">Fast adaptation in invertebrate looming-sensitive descending neurons</a></h4>

              
                Motion vision plays a crucial role in guiding dynamic behaviors, such as determining when to escape from predators, pursue prey, navigate obstacles, or adjust flight patterns during migration. Adaptation to repetitive motion stimuli is a crucial aspect of this process, allowing animals to efficiently process new stimuli while avoiding sensory overload. This helps animals remain responsive to novel or important stimuli, ensuring appropriate behavioral reactions. Adaptation to looming stimuli, which often signal an approaching threat through the rapid expansion of an object's image on the retina, allows animals to distinguish harmless from harmful stimuli. While neural adaptation has been extensively studied in the fly's optic lobes, less is known about how descending neurons, which link the optic lobes to the motor centers in the thoracic ganglia, adapt. To address this gap, we investigate adaptation in looming-sensitive descending neurons in the hoverfly Eristalis tenax. Using intracellular recordings, we show that these descending neurons adapt to looming stimuli with inter-stimulus intervals of 1-3 s. We show that the level of adaptation depends on the ISI, with shorter intervals leading to greater adaptation. Specifically, we find that adaptation leads to decreased response duration, with a pronounced delayed response onset. We identified descending neurons that responded to looming stimuli either unilaterally or bilaterally and used this to show that most of the adaptation takes place within the neuron itself, rather than its pre-synaptic inputs. Finally, we found that the wing beat amplitude of tethered hoverflies did not appear to adapt to repetitive looming stimuli.

">Tissue damage-induced axon injury-associated responses in sensory neurons - requirements, prevention, and potential role in persistent post-surgical pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain resulting from tissue damage, including surgical incision, is often only partially responsive to standard treatments focusing on inflammation, suggesting additional mechanisms are involved. Tissue damage leads to expression in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons of genes associated with axonal injury and regeneration, most notably activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and GAP-43. ATF3 expression is associated with sensitization of cellular physiology and enhanced amplitude/duration of a nociceptive reflex. It is unclear how tissue damage leads to these changes in the sensory neurons, but it could include direct damage to the tissue-innervating axons and inflammation-associated retrograde biochemical signalling. Using the CTM reflex to map innervation fields, we examined the necessity and sufficiency of incision, inflammation, and axonal conduction for induction of ATF3 in response to skin incision. Incision outside the innervation field, but close enough to induce inflammation inside the innervation field, was not sufficient to induce ATF3 expression in the field-innervating DRG. Incision inside the innervation field led to strong expression of ATF3. Anti-inflammatory treatments did not prevent this induction of ATF3. In rodent models of repeated injury - a major etiological factor for chronic pain - ATF3 expression was synergistically-increased and the threshold for paw-withdrawal to mechanical stimulation was significantly decreased for an extended duration. Together, these results suggest that actual damage to axons innervating the skin is both necessary and sufficient for induction of ATF3, expression of which appears additionally increased by repeated injury. Further, pre-treatment of the nerves innervating the incised skin with bupivacaine, a local anesthetic commonly used to reduce surgical pain, did not prevent induction of ATF3, indicating that conduction of action potentials is not necessary for induction of ATF3. We also determined that closure of incision with surgical glue significantly reduced incision-induced expression of GAP-43. Intriguingly, treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG), known to enhance membrane integrity after injury among other effects, reduced incision-associated ATF3 expression and electrophysiological changes. These results suggest that pain resulting from tissue damage may arise from a mix of ATF3-/axonal-damage-associated mechanism as well as ATF3-independent inflammation-related mechanisms and therefore require a mix of approaches to achieve more complete control.

">Semiparametric Confidence Sets for Arbitrary Effect Sizes in Longitudinal Neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                The majority of neuroimaging inference focuses on hypothesis testing rather than effect estimation. With concerns about replicability, there is growing interest in reporting standardized effect sizes from neuroimaging group-level analyses. Confidence sets are a recently developed approach to perform inference for effect sizes in neuroimaging but are restricted to univariate effect sizes and cross-sectional data. Thus, existing methods exclude increasingly common multigroup or nonlinear longitudinal associations of biological brain measurements with inter- and intra-individual variations in diagnosis, development, or symptoms. We broadly generalize the confidence set approach by developing a method for arbitrary effect sizes in longitudinal studies. Our method involves robust estimation of the effect size image and spatial and temporal covariance function based on generalized estimating equations. We obtain more efficient effect size estimates by concurrently estimating the exchangeable working covariance and using a nonparametric bootstrap to determine the joint distribution of effect size across voxels used to construct confidence sets. These confidence sets identify regions of the image where the lower or upper simultaneous confidence interval is above or below a given threshold with high probability. We evaluate the coverage and simultaneous confidence interval width of the proposed procedures using realistic simulations and perform longitudinal analyses of aging and diagnostic differences of cortical thickness in Alzheimer's disease and diagnostic differences of resting-state hippocampal activity in psychosis. This comprehensive approach along with the visualization functions integrated into the pbj R package offers a robust tool for analyzing repeated neuroimaging measurements.

">The Link to Oxidative Metabolism Varies across rs-fMRI Metrics: A Whole-Brain Assessment Using Macrovascular Correction</a></h4>

              
                One of the major obstacles to the clinical application of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is the complex nature of its measurements, which limits interpretability. An approach to enhance the interpretability of the rs-fMRI metrics is to link them to more fundamental brain physiology, especially cerebral metabolism. Previous studies have established associations between glucose metabolism (CMRglu) and rs-fMRI measurements. In spite of this, oxidative metabolism (CMRO2) is more closely related to cerebral blood flow (CBF) and thus the BOLD signal, and its relationship with CMRglu is complex. Additionally, most currently published rs-fMRI metrics are uncorrected for macrovascular contribution, which may obscure the neuronal contributions. In this study, we measured resting CMRO2 (along with the oxygen extraction fraction, OEF and cerebral blood flow, CBF) using gas-free calibrated fMRI. We used linear mixed-effects (LME) models to examine associations between CMRO2 and various rs-fMRI metrics before and after macrovascular correction. We found that: 1) significant associations exist between CMRO2 and multiple rs-fMRI metrics, with the strongest association found for the global functional density (gFCD) and the weakest for seed-based functional connectivity (FC); 2) associations with rs-fMRI metrics also varied for OEF and CBF; 3) significant sex differences were observed in the above associations; 4) the use of macrovascular correction substantially strengthened the goodness fit of all LME models examined. This latter improvement further validates the use of macrovascular correction in rs-fMRI. These results provide a framework for linking rs-fMRI metrics to fundamental brain physiology, thus improving interpretability of rs-fMRI measurements. This is the first study to formally link whole-brain MRI-based baseline CMRO2 and rs-fMRI metrics, and helps to push the envelope for rs-fMRI in future clinical applications.

                Non-invasive spatiotemporal imaging of brain activity during large-scale, whole body movement is a significant methodological challenge for the field of movement neuroscience. Here, we present a dataset recorded using a new imaging modality, optically-pumped magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG), to record brain activity during human stepping. Participants (n=3) performed a visually guided stepping task requiring precise foot placement while dual-axis and triaxial OP-MEG and leg muscle activity (electromyography, EMG) were recorded. The dataset also includes a structural MRI for each participant and foot kinematics. We validate the fidelity of the OPM data by showing movement-related beta band desynchronization source localised to the primary motor cortex. This multimodal dataset offers a resource for methodological development and testing for OPM data (e.g., movement-related interference rejection), within-subject analyses, and exploratory analyses to generate hypotheses for further work on the neural control of human stepping.

">Astrocytic PI3Kα controls synaptic plasticity and cognitive function via serine metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are known to modulate neuronal activity by gliotransmission and through metabolic regulation. However, the connection between these two processes is still poorly defined. In this work we show that the p110 isoform of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in astrocytes is required for long-term potentiation (LTP) and has an impact on learning and memory. Using a specific deletion of p110 from hippocampal astrocytes in adult mice, we found that LTP depends on astrocytic p110 to sustain D-serine levels for the activation of NMDA receptors during LTP induction. This requirement is based on the L-serine biosynthetic pathway of the astrocyte, which is defective in the absence of p110 because of a reduced glycolytic flux. Accordingly, the behavioral impairment in mice lacking p110 can be rescued by in vivo administration of L-serine. These results link for the first time the function of PI3K in astrocytes to cerebral metabolism and its influence in synaptic plasticity and cognition.

">Annotation Comparison Explorer (ACE): connecting brain cell types across studies of health and Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell multiomic technologies have allowed unprecedented access to gene profiles of individual cells across species and organ systems, including >1000 papers focused on brain cell types alone. The Allen Institute has created foundational atlases characterizing mammalian brain cell types in the adult mouse brain and the neocortex of aged humans with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD). With so many public cell type classifications (or 'taxonomies') available and many groups choosing to define their own, linking cell types and associated knowledge between studies remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce Annotation Comparison Explorer (ACE), a web application for comparing cell type assignments and other cell-based annotations (e.g., donor demographics, anatomic locations, batch variables, and quality control metrics). ACE allows filtering of cells and includes an interactive set of tools for comparing two or more taxonomy annotations alongside collected knowledge (e.g., increased abundance in disease conditions, cell type aliases, or other information about a specific cell type). We present three primary use cases for ACE. First, we demonstrate how a user can assign cell type labels from the Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD) taxonomy to cells from their own study and compare these cell type mappings to existing cell type assignments and cell metadata. Second, we extend this approach to ten published human AD studies which we previously reprocessed through a common data analysis pipeline. This allowed us to compare brain taxonomies across otherwise incomparable studies and identify congruent cell type abundance changes in AD, including a decrease in abundance of subsets of somatostatin interneurons. Finally, ACE includes translation tables between different mouse and human brain cell type taxonomies publicly accessible on Allen Brain Map, from initial studies in individual neocortical areas to more recent studies spanning the whole brain. ACE can be freely and publicly accessed as a web application (https://sea-ad.shinyapps.io/ACEapp/) and on GitHub (github.com/AllenInstitute/ACE).

">Ketamine Alters Tuning of Neural and Behavioral Spatial Working Memory Precision</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in working memory (WM) are a hallmark of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, yet their neurobiological basis remains poorly understood. Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are critical for spatial WM (sWM), with NMDAR antagonist ketamine known to attenuate task-evoked activation and reduce sWM accuracy. Cortical microcircuit models hypothesize that NMDAR antagonism impairs sWM by broadening neural spatial tuning, but this mechanism has not been directly tested in humans. Using a pharmacological fMRI approach, we showed how ketamine broadened neural spatial tuning, attenuated activation across visual, parietal, and frontal areas, and worsened sWM performance in healthy humans. Ketamine-induced changes in tuning were more consistent across individuals and brain regions than changes in overall activation and correlated with individual differences in sWM performance. These findings provide empirical evidence linking NMDAR antagonism to disruptions in cortical microcircuit dynamics, the resulting neural tuning alterations, and sWM impairments, advancing frameworks for therapeutic development.

">The Relationship Between Visual Motion Detection Thresholds and Visual Sensitivity to Medial/Lateral Balance Control</a></h4>

              
                The ability to differentiate between self-motion and motion in the environment is an important factor for maintaining upright balance control. Visual motion can elicit the sensation of a fall by cueing a false position sense. While there is evidence supporting the role of central vision and fall risk, including measures of contrast sensitivity, depth perception, and size of the visual field, the relationship between motion detection thresholds and balance control remains unknown. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between visual motion detection thresholds (VMDTs) of the environment and measures of visual sensitivity to balance disturbances in the environment while walking. Thirty young adults (18-35 years) and thirty older adults (55-79 years) participated in a counter-balanced study where they 1) walked on a self-paced treadmill within a virtual environment that delivered frontal plane multi-sine visual disturbances at three amplitudes (6{degrees}, 10{degrees}, and 15{degrees}), and 2) performed 100 trials of a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task in which they discriminated between a counterclockwise (left) and clockwise (right) rotation of a visual scene under three conditions (standing, standing with optic flow, and walking). Visual sensitivity was measured using frequency response functions of the center of mass displacement relative to the screen tilt (cm/deg) while VMDTs were measured by fitting a psychometric curve to the responses of the 2AFC task. We found significant positive correlations between measures of visual sensitivity and VMDTs for 7 out of the 9 conditions in young adults, and nonsignificant positive correlations between the two measures in older adults. VMDTs were overall higher in older adults, although not significantly in the standing condition, indicating more motion in the environment is required for older adults to consciously perceive it. VMDTs also tended to increase from standing, standing with optic flow, and walking, although not significantly between the standing and standing with optic flow conditions for both populations. We interpret the positive correlations between the two measures as an indication that individuals with lower motion detection thresholds can more accurately differentiate between self-motion and motion in the environment, resulting in lower responses from visual disturbances in the environment.

">The role of symmetry breaking in connectivity and neurodegeneracy in the brain's resting state dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The functioning of brain networks can be broadly categorized as an interplay of two main contributors, namely the neurological processes dictating the local dynamics and the patterns of anatomical connections that enable the interactions between the various local processes, resulting in a global emergent behavior. Using Brain Network Modeling we describe the constraints of the anatomical structure upon the resting state dynamics of the human brain. We identify a low-dimensional representation of the brain states, the Resting State Manifold (RSM), and leveraging network degeneracy and its relationship to structural properties, we identify dynamic patterns supported by the RSM. Noise driven dynamics of the BNM are used to explore the manifold and validate the contours of degeneracy. We demonstrate that the patterns of degeneracy regulate the dynamics of the broader system in the presence of external and/or internal perturbations, revealing the productive relationship between emergent network processes and their constituent network entities.

">Retro Nasal blockade reduces the Neural Processing of Sucrose in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Traditionally, taste perception is understood to occur through taste receptors located in the oral cavity, particularly on the tongue. Recent findings suggest that taste compounds, when aerosolized, can reach the retro nasal olfactory region and be perceived. However, the neural mechanisms by which the human brain interprets taste stimuli via retro nasal pathways remain unclear. Healthy adults (N=34, Mean age 25 yrs.) were recruited. We examined neural activity during the tasting of sucrose with a nose clip on (to block retro nasal sensation) compared to when there was no nose clip. We examined whole brain data and ROIs involved in taste (insula, postcentral gyrus, amygdala), smell (olfactory cortex, piriform cortex) odour attention (sgACC) and multi-modal flavour processing (OFC) and reward (pgACC and nucleus accumbens). We also examined subjective ratings of pleasantness and fullness of the sucrose with and without the nose clip. We found that the nose clip condition reduced neural activity in primary taste and olfaction regions and regions involved in attention to odours, and food reward. When examining the whole brain activity, we also found reduced activity in the rolandic operculum, lingual gyrus and precuneus. The olfactory cortex and prefrontal cortex ROIs tracked the sucrose subjective fullness ratings, but this effect was not present with the nose clip on. In conclusion, our findings are the first to demonstrate that blocking retro nasal sensation with a nose clip significantly reduces the subjective and objective neural responses to sucrose taste. These findings support the idea that retro nasal sensations could play a role in the perception of sucrose taste. This study suggests that developing more satisfying low-sugar foods could be achieved by enhancing the perception of sweetness through aroma modulation.

">Humans can learn bimodal priors in complex sensorimotor behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Extensive research suggests that humans integrate sensory information and prior expectations in a Bayesian manner to reduce uncertainty in perception and action. However, while Bayesian integration provides a powerful explanatory framework, the question remains as to what extent it explains human behaviour in naturalistic situations, including more complex movements and distributions. Here, we examine whether humans can learn bimodal priors in a complex sensorimotor task: returning tennis serves. Participants returned serves in an immersive virtual reality setup with realistic movements and spatiotemporal task demands matching those in real tennis. The location of the opponent's serves followed a bimodal distribution. We manipulated visual uncertainty through three levels of ball speeds: slow, moderate, and fast. After extensive exposure to the opponent's serves, participants' movements were biased by the bimodal prior distribution. As predicted by Bayesian theory, the magnitude of the bias depends on visual uncertainty. Additionally, our data indicate that participants' movements in this complex task were not only biased by prior expectations but also by biomechanical constraints and associated motor costs. Intriguingly, an explicit knowledge test after the experiment revealed that, despite incorporating prior knowledge of the opponent's serve distribution into their behaviour, participants were not explicitly aware of the pattern. Our results show that humans can implicitly learn and utilise bimodal priors in complex sensorimotor behaviour.

">Enhanced Neural Plasticity of the Primary Visual Cortex in Visual Snow Syndrome: Evidence from MEG Gamma Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS) is a neurological disorder characterized by persistent visual disturbances and associated symptoms. Although the neural basis of VSS remains poorly understood, it may involve increased neuronal excitability and/or altered neuroplasticity in the visual cortex, which could, in turn, affect visual gamma oscillations. An altered excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance is hypothesized to alter the modulation of gamma power and frequency by stimulation intensity, while maladaptive neuroplasticity may impact time-dependent changes in gamma power during repeated stimulation. To investigate potential alterations in E-I balance and neuroplasticity in VSS, we magnetoencephalography to record visual gamma oscillations in 26 VSS patients and 27 healthy controls. Participants were exposed to repeatedly presented high-contrast annular gratings, which were either static or drifting at varying speeds to systematically manipulate stimulation intensity. We also measured heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and repetitive visual stimulation to explore the relationship between time-dependent gamma changes and parasympathetic activation, which is known to promote activity-dependent plasticity. Our results showed no significant group differences in gamma power or frequency, nor in their modulation by drift rate, suggesting that the excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance in the primary visual cortex remains largely intact in VSS. Both groups exhibited an initial brief decrease in gamma power followed by a sustained linear increase with stimulus repetition, likely reflecting activity-dependent plasticity. HRV parameters were comparable across groups, with the parasympathetic-sympathetic balance index correlating with repetition-related increase in gamma power, further supporting the link between time-dependent gamma changes and neuroplasticity. Notably, VSS patients exhibited a steeper repetition-related increase in gamma power, indicating atypically heightened activity-dependent plasticity in this group. These findings provide the first experimental evidence suggesting that altered activity-dependent neuroplasticity plays a role in the pathophysiology of VSS. Furthermore, they identify repetition-related increases in gamma power as a potential biomarker of aberrant neuroplasticity, offering novel insights into VSS pathophysiology and potential avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions.

">Axonal Mechanotransduction Drives Cytoskeletal Responses to Physiological Mechanical Forces</a></h4>

              
                Axons experience strong mechanical forces due to animal movement. While these forces serve as sensory cues in mechanosensory neurons, their impact on other neuron types remains poorly defined. Here, we uncover signaling that controls an axonal cytoskeletal response to external physiological forces and plays a key role in axonal integrity. Live imaging of microtubules at single-polymer resolution in a C. elegans motor neuron reveals local oscillatory movements that fine-tune polymer positioning. Combining cell-specific chemogenetic silencing with targeted degradation alleles to distinguish neuron-intrinsic from extrinsic regulators of these movements, we find that they are driven by muscle contractions and require the mechanosensitive protein Talin, the small GTPase RhoA, and actomyosin activity in the axon. Genetic perturbation of the axon's ability to buffer tension by disrupting the spectrin-based membrane-associated skeleton leads to RhoA hyperactivation, actomyosin relocalization to foci at microtubule ends, and converts local oscillations into processive bidirectional movements. This results in large gaps between microtubules, disrupting coverage of the axon and leading to its breakage and degeneration. Notably, hyperpolarizing muscle or degrading components of the mechanotransduction signaling pathway in the axon rescues cytoskeletal defects in spectrin-deficient axons. These results identify mechanisms of an axonal cytoskeletal response to physiological forces and highlight the importance of force-buffering and mechanotransduction signaling for axonal integrity.

">Ankyrins are essential for synaptic integrity of photoreceptors in the mouse outer retina</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian visual system consists of two distinct pathways: rod- and cone-driven vision. The rod pathway is responsible for dim light vision whereas the cone pathway mediates daylight vision and color perception. The distinct processing of visual information begins at the first synapse of rod and cone photoreceptors. The unique composition and organization of the rod and cone synapse is what allows information to be parsed into the different visual pathways. Although this is a critical process for vision, little is known about the key molecules responsible for establishing and maintaining the distinct synaptic architecture of the rod and cone synapse. In the present study, we uncovered a new role for Ankyrins in maintaining the synaptic integrity of the rod and cone synapse. Loss of Ankyrin-B and Ankyrin-G results in connectivity defects between photoreceptors and their synaptic partners. Ultrastructure analysis of the rod and cone synapse revealed impaired synaptic innervation, abnormal terminal morphology, and disruption of synaptic connections. Consistent with these findings, functional studies revealed impaired in vivo retinal responses in animals with loss of Ankyrin-B and Ankyrin-G. Taken together, our data supports a new role for Ankyrins in maintaining synaptic integrity and organization of photoreceptor synapses in the mouse outer retina.

">Spike sorting AI agent</a></h4>

              
                Spike sorting is a fundamental process for decoding neural activity, involving preprocessing, spike detection, feature extraction, clustering, and validation. However, conventional spike sorting methods are highly fragmented, labor-intensive, and heavily reliant on expert manual curation, limiting their scalability and reproducibility. This challenge has become more pressing with advances in neural recording technology, such as high-density Neuropixels for large-scale neural recording or flexible electrodes for long-term stable recording over months to years. The volume and complexity of these datasets make manual curation infeasible, requiring an automated and scalable solution. Here, we introduce SpikeAgent, a multimodal large language model (LLM)-based AI agent that automates and standardizes the entire spike sorting pipeline. Unlike traditional approaches, SpikeAgent integrates multiple LLM backends, coding functions, and established algorithms, autonomously performing spike sorting with reasoning-based decision-making and real-time interaction with intermediate results. It generates interpretable reports, providing transparent justifications for each sorting decision, enhancing transparency and reliability. We benchmarked SpikeAgent against human experts across various neural recording technology, demonstrating its versatility and ability to achieve curation consistency that are equal to, or even higher than human experts. It also drastically reduces the expertise barrier and accelerates the curation and validation time by orders of magnitude. Moreover, it enables automated interpretability of the neural spiking data, which cannot be achieved by any conventional methods. SpikeAgent presents a paradigm shift in processing signals for neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces, while laying the ground for AI agent-augmented science across various domains.

">Too little and too much: medial prefrontal functional inhibition impairs early acquisition of operant reversal learning, whereas medial prefrontal disinhibition impairs established serial-reversal performance in rats</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia has been linked to hypofrontality (reduced prefrontal activation) and neural disinhibition (reduced GABAergic inhibition) within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), as well as reversal learning deficits. Interestingly, whilst reversal learning has been strongly linked to the orbitofrontal cortex, research suggests that the primate dlPFC - or its rodent analogue, the medial PFC (mPFC) - is less important for this process. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that the mPFC may be required for reversal learning if the reversal is particularly demanding. Furthermore, even if the mPFC is not required, mPFC disinhibition may impair reversals, because it may disrupt processing in mPFC projection sites. To test this, we induced mPFC functional inhibition and disinhibition in rats, using microinfusions of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol or antagonist picrotoxin, respectively, and examined the impact on early and serial reversals on a food-reinforced two-lever discrimination task. Using classical performance measures and Bayesian trial-by-trial strategy analysis, we found that mPFC functional inhibition impaired early, but not serial, reversals by increasing perseveration and impairing exploratory (lose-shift) behavior. In contrast, disinhibition impaired serial reversals, which was associated with reduction in both exploratory (lose-shift) and exploitative (win-stay) behavior. These findings suggest that mPFC hypoactivation and disinhibition disrupt distinct aspects of reversal learning by different mechanisms.

">Exposure to rotenone triggers redox driven systemwide lipidome alterations and metabolic tradeoffs linked to Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                With the global rise in aging populations, the increasing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases underscores concerns about brain health, with pesticides like rotenone, emerging as key environmental hazardous. The precise mechanism by which chronic environmental concentration of rotenone exposure causes Parkinson-like phenotype is not understood. Previous studies showed that rotenone induces depletion of dopaminergic neurons by influencing mitochondrial functions. Mitochondrial dysfunction alters lipid homeostasis; therefore, brain lipids can be potential targets for the early risk assessment and prognosis of Parkinsons disease (PD). However, the specific lipidome changes and associated biomarkers of chronic rotenone in vivo exposure causing PD are largely unknown. This study investigates the lipid profile disruptions and biomarkers induced by environmentally relevant concentrations of chronic rotenone exposure using the neuro-model Drosophila melanogaster. An untargeted LC-HRAMS-based lipidomics identified that lipid classes, GP, SP, FA and GL were significantly altered. Furthermore, system-wide loss of cross talk of mitochondrial and peroxisome lipids by altering their redox homeostasis causing PD was observed. Additionally, lipid oxidative stress markers, and behavior abnormalities correlated with altered lipids linked to PD. The findings highlight the rotenone induced complex metabolic trade-offs, prioritizing brains neural integrity at the expense of peripheral lipid levels, leading to PD.
