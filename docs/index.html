<p>Speech rhythms have been dealt with in three main ways: from the
introspective analyses of rhythm as a correlate of syllable and foot timing in
linguistics and applied linguistics, through analyses of durations of segments
of utterances associated with consonantal and vocalic properties, syllables,
feet and words, to models of rhythms in speech production and perception as
physical oscillations. The present study avoids introspection and
human-filtered annotation methods and extends the signal processing paradigm of
amplitude envelope spectrum analysis by adding an additional analytic step of
edge detection, and postulating the co-existence of multiple speech rhythms in
rhythm zones marked by identifiable edges (Rhythm Zone Theory, RZT). An
exploratory investigation of the utility of RZT is conducted, suggesting that
native and non-native readings of the same text are distinct sub-genres of read
speech: a reading by a US native speaker and non-native readings by relatively
low-performing Cantonese adult learners of English. The study concludes by
noting that with the methods used, RZT can distinguish between the speech
rhythms of well-defined sub-genres of native speaker reading vs. non-native
learner reading, but needs further refinement in order to be applied to the
paradoxically more complex speech of low-performing language learners, whose
speech rhythms are co-determined by non-fluency and disfluency factors in
addition to well-known linguistic factors of grammar, vocabulary and discourse
constraints.

<p>In this short communication I present a study on cortical thickness and

modular organisation of these networks by the cortical surface frontal,
temporal, parietal and occipital divisions. Secondly, I mapped the coupling
topology of cortical thickness and functional networks for positive and
negative correlations. Finally, I showed that the coupled positive correlations
map onto within-lobe cortical interactions and negative onto between-lobes

<p>Patients diagnosed with epilepsy experience cognitive dysfunction that may be
due to a transient cognitive/memory impairment (TCI/TMI) caused by spontaneous
epileptiform spikes. We asked in a cohort of 166 adult patients with medically
refractory focal epilepsy if spikes in specific neuroanatomical regions during
verbal episodic memory encoding would significantly decrease the probability of
recall. We found using a na\"ive Bayesian machine learning model that the
probability of correct word recall decreased significantly by 11.9% when spikes
occurred in left Brodmann area 21 (BA)21, (p&lt;0.001), 49.7% in left BA38
(p=0.01), and 32.2% in right BA38 (p&lt;0.001), and 21.4% in left BA36 (p&lt;0.01).
We also examined the influence of the seizure-onset zone and the language
dominant hemisphere on this effect. Our results demonstrate that spontaneous
epileptiform spikes produce a large effect TCI/TMI in brain regions known to be
important in semantic processing and episodic memory. Thus memory impairment in
patients with epilepsy may be attributable to cellular events associated with
abnormal inter-ictal electrical events.

<p>Neurons typically show two distinct dynamical regimes: Resting state,
corresponding to a stable fixpoint, are often observed for low average input.
Higher input commonly result in tonic spiking, which corresponds to a stable
limit cycle. Some neurons, however, show an additional intermediate, bistable
regime, with coexistence of resting-state fixpoint and limit-cycle spiking. In
this article, a bistable neuron with spike onset at a saddle-homoclinic orbit
bifurcation is investigated. In the bistable region, noise can switch between
rest and spiking, and thus increase the variability of the spike train compared
to neurons with only one stable attractor. This has consequences for spike-time
coding as it effectively increases the output entropy of neuronal ensembles.
Here, the spiking statistics is derived for homoclinic conductance-based neuron
models. Switching between rest and spiking is mainly determined along the
downstroke of the action potential, a dynamical feature lacking in common
neuron models with reset dynamics. Nonetheless similar derivations can be
applied to quadratic integrate-and-fire models. The derived interspike interval
distribution is shown to be unimodal, which warrants the future use of
meanfield approaches to networks of bistable neurons.

<p>by Wan Yang, Juan Li, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Measles is a highly infectious, severe viral disease. The disease is targeted for global eradication; however, this result has proven challenging. In China, where countrywide vaccination coverage for the last decade has been above 95% (the threshold for measles elimination), measles continues to cause large epidemics. To diagnose factors contributing to the persistency of measles, here we develop a model-inference system to infer measles transmission dynamics in China. The model-inference system uses demographic and vaccination data for each year as model inputs to directly account for changing population dynamics (including births, deaths, migrations, and vaccination). In addition, it simultaneously estimates unobserved model variables and parameters based on incidence data. When fitted to yearly incidence data for the entire population, it is able to accurately estimate independent, out-of-sample age-specific incidence. Using this validated model-inference system, we are thus able to estimate epidemiological and demographical characteristics key to measles transmission during 1951–2004 for three key locations in China, including its capital Beijing. These characteristics include age-specific population susceptibility and incidence rates, the basic reproductive number (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>), reporting rate, population mixing intensity, and amplitude of seasonality. Key differences among the three sites reveal population and epidemiological characteristics crucial for understanding the current persistence of measles epidemics in China. We also discuss the implications our findings have for future elimination strategies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k-kP7DF8SuQ" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/X8WcHZJyKEE/article">Social evolution under demographic stochasticity</a></h4>

<p>by David V. McLeod, Troy Day</p>

How social traits such as altruism and spite evolve remains an open question in evolutionary biology. One factor thought to be potentially important is demographic stochasticity. Here we provide a general theoretical analysis of the role of demographic stochasticity in social evolution. We show that the evolutionary impact of stochasticity depends on how the social action alters the recipient’s life cycle. If the action alters the recipient’s death rate, then demographic stochasticity always favours altruism and disfavours spite. On the other hand, if the action alters the recipient’s birth rate, then stochasticity can either favour or disfavour both altruism and spite depending on the ratio of the rate of population turnover to the population size. Finally, we also show that this ratio is critical to determining if demographic stochasticity can reverse the direction of selection upon social traits. Our analysis thus provides a general understanding of the role of demographic stochasticity in social evolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X8WcHZJyKEE" width="1" />

<p>by Limeng Pu, Rajiv Gandhi Govindaraj, Jeffrey Mitchell Lemoine, Hsiao-Chun Wu, Michal Brylinski</p>

Comprehensive characterization of ligand-binding sites is invaluable to infer molecular functions of hypothetical proteins, trace evolutionary relationships between proteins, engineer enzymes to achieve a desired substrate specificity, and develop drugs with improved selectivity profiles. These research efforts pose significant challenges owing to the fact that similar pockets are commonly observed across different folds, leading to the high degree of promiscuity of ligand-protein interactions at the system-level. On that account, novel algorithms to accurately classify binding sites are needed. Deep learning is attracting a significant attention due to its successful applications in a wide range of disciplines. In this communication, we present DeepDrug3D, a new approach to characterize and classify binding pockets in proteins with deep learning. It employs a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network in which biomolecular structures are represented as voxels assigned interaction energy-based attributes. The current implementation of DeepDrug3D, trained to detect and classify nucleotide- and heme-binding sites, not only achieves a high accuracy of 95%, but also has the ability to generalize to unseen data as demonstrated for steroid-binding proteins and peptidase enzymes. Interestingly, the analysis of strongly discriminative regions of binding pockets reveals that this high classification accuracy arises from learning the patterns of specific molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, aromatic and hydrophobic contacts. DeepDrug3D is available as an open-source program at https://github.com/pulimeng/DeepDrug3D with the accompanying TOUGH-C1 benchmarking dataset accessible from https://osf.io/enz69/.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IOucG4wUETk" width="1" />

<p>by Ahmed A. Metwally, Philip S. Yu, Derek Reiman, Yang Dai, Patricia W. Finn, David L. Perkins</p>

Food allergy is usually difficult to diagnose in early life, and the inability to diagnose patients with atopic diseases at an early age may lead to severe complications. Numerous studies have suggested an association between the infant gut microbiome and development of allergy. In this work, we investigated the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict food allergies in early life (0-3 years) from subjects’ longitudinal gut microbiome profiles. Using the DIABIMMUNE dataset, we show an increase in predictive power using our model compared to Hidden Markov Model, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and LASSO regression. We further evaluated whether the training of LSTM networks benefits from reduced representations of microbial features. We considered sparse autoencoder for extraction of potential latent representations in addition to standard feature selection procedures based on Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and variance prior to the training of LSTM networks. The comprehensive evaluation reveals that LSTM networks with the mRMR selected features achieve significantly better performance compared to the other tested machine learning models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0lsCUFCXces" width="1" />

<p>by Honda Naoki, Ryutaro Akiyama, Dini Wahyu Kartika Sari, Shin Ishii, Yasumasa Bessho, Takaaki Matsui</p>

The reproducibility of embryonic development is remarkable, although molecular processes are intrinsically stochastic at the single-cell level. How the multicellular system resists the inevitable noise to acquire developmental reproducibility constitutes a fundamental question in developmental biology. Toward this end, we focused on vertebrate somitogenesis as a representative system, because somites are repeatedly reproduced within a single embryo whereas such reproducibility is lost in segmentation clock gene-deficient embryos. However, the effect of noise on developmental reproducibility has not been fully investigated, because of the technical difficulty in manipulating the noise intensity in experiments. In this study, we developed a computational model of ERK-mediated somitogenesis, in which bistable ERK activity is regulated by an FGF gradient, cell-cell communication, and the segmentation clock, subject to the intrinsic noise. The model simulation generated our previous <i>in vivo</i> observation that the ERK activity was distributed in a step-like gradient in the presomitic mesoderm, and its boundary was posteriorly shifted by the clock in a stepwise manner, leading to regular somite formation. Here, we showed that this somite regularity was robustly maintained against the noise. Removing the clock from the model predicted that the stepwise shift of the ERK activity occurs at irregular timing with irregular distance owing to the noise, resulting in somite size variation. This model prediction was recently confirmed by live imaging of ERK activity in zebrafish embryos. Through theoretical analysis, we presented a mechanism by which the clock reduces the inherent somite irregularity observed in clock-deficient embryos. Therefore, this study indicates a novel role of the segmentation clock in noise-resistant developmental reproducibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5KQ0qVfE2zo" width="1" />

<p>by Stephanie L. Barnes, Nathan M. Belliveau, William T. Ireland, Justin B. Kinney, Rob Phillips</p>

Despite the central importance of transcriptional regulation in biology, it has proven difficult to determine the regulatory mechanisms of individual genes, let alone entire gene networks. It is particularly difficult to decipher the biophysical mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in living cells and determine the energetic properties of binding sites for transcription factors and RNA polymerase. In this work, we present a strategy for dissecting transcriptional regulatory sequences using <i>in vivo</i> methods (massively parallel reporter assays) to formulate quantitative models that map a transcription factor binding site’s DNA sequence to transcription factor-DNA binding energy. We use these models to predict the binding energies of transcription factor binding sites to within 1 <i>k</i><sub>B</sub><i>T</i> of their measured values. We further explore how such a sequence-energy mapping relates to the mechanisms of trancriptional regulation in various promoter contexts. Specifically, we show that our models can be used to design specific induction responses, analyze the effects of amino acid mutations on DNA sequence preference, and determine how regulatory context affects a transcription factor’s sequence specificity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S0hkB9Alflg" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the initial termination rate of status epilepticus (SE) in a large observational study and explore associated variables.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data of adults treated for SE were collected prospectively in centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, during 4.5 years. Incident episodes of 1,049 patients were analyzed using uni‐ and multivariate statistics to determine factors predicting cessation of SE within 1 hour (for generalized convulsive SE [GCSE]) and 12 hours (for non‐GCSE) of initiating treatment.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Median age at SE onset was 70 years; most frequent etiologies were remote (32%) and acute (31%). GCSE was documented in 43%. Median latency between SE onset and first treatment was 30 minutes in GCSE and 150 minutes in non‐GCSE. The first intravenous compound was a benzodiazepine in 86% in GCSE and 73% in non‐GCSE. Bolus doses of the first treatment step were lower than recommended by current guidelines in 76% of GCSE patients and 78% of non‐GCSE patients. In 319 GCSE patients (70%), SE was ongoing 1 hour after initiating treatment and in 342 non‐GCSE patients (58%) 12 hours after initiating treatment. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that use of benzodiazepines as first treatment step and a higher cumulative dose of anticonvulsants within the first period of treatment were associated with shorter time to cessation of SE for both groups.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In clinical practice, treatment guidelines were not followed in a substantial proportion of patients. This underdosing correlated with lack of cessation of SE. Our data suggest that sufficiently dosed benzodiazepines should be used as a first treatment step. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1–12</p>

<p>This paper describes the outlines of a research program for understanding the
cognitive-emotional brain, with an emphasis on the issue of dynamics: How can
we study, characterize, and understand the neural underpinnings of
cognitive-emotional behaviors as inherently dynamic processes? The framework
embraces many of the central themes developed by Steve Grossberg in his
extensive body of work in the past 50 years. By embracing head on the
leitmotifs of dynamics, decentralized computation, emergence, selection and
competition, and autonomy, it is proposed that a science of the mind-brain can
be developed that is built upon a solid foundation of understanding behavior
while employing computational and mathematical tools in an integral manner. A
key implication of the framework is that standard ways of thinking about
causation are inadequate when unravelling the workings of a complex system such
as the brain. Instead, it is proposed that researchers should focus on
determining the dynamic multivariate structure of brain data. Accordingly,
central problems become to characterize the dimensionality of neural
trajectories, and the geometry of the underlying neural space. At a time when
the development of neurotechniques has reached a fever pitch, neuroscience
needs to redirect its focus and invest comparable energy in the conceptual and
theoretical dimensions of its research endeavor. Otherwise we run the risk of
being able to measure 'every atom' in the brain in a theoretical vacuum.

For animals to perform coordinated movements requires the precise organization of neural circuits controlling motor function. Motor neurons (MNs), key components of these circuits, project their axons from the central nervous system and form precise terminal branching patterns at specific muscles. Focusing on the <i>Drosophila</i> leg neuromuscular system we show that the stereotyped terminal branching of a subset of MNs is mediated by interacting transmembrane Ig superfamily proteins DIP-α and Dpr10, present in MNs and target muscles, respectively. The DIP-α/Dpr10 interaction is needed only after MN axons reach the vicinity of their muscle targets. Live imaging suggests that precise terminal branching patterns are gradually established by DIP-α/Dpr10-dependent interactions between fine axon filopodia and developing muscles. Further, different leg MNs depend on the DIP-α and Dpr10 interaction to varying degrees that correlate with the morphological complexity of the MNs and their muscle targets.

The <i>Drosophila</i> larval neuromuscular system provides an ideal context in which to study synaptic partner choice, because it contains a small number of pre- and postsynaptic cells connected in an invariant pattern. The discovery of interactions between two subfamilies of IgSF cell surface proteins, the Dprs and the DIPs, provided new candidates for cellular labels controlling synaptic specificity. Here we show that DIP-α is expressed by two identified motor neurons, while its binding partner Dpr10 is expressed by postsynaptic muscle targets. Removal of either DIP-α or Dpr10 results in loss of specific axonal branches and NMJs formed by one motor neuron, MNISN-1s, while other branches of the MNISN-1s axon develop normally. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of <i>dpr10</i> correlates with muscle innervation by MNISN-1s during embryonic development. We propose a model whereby DIP-α and Dpr10 on opposing synaptic partners interact with each other to generate proper motor neuron connectivity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42508">Quantitative insights into the cyanobacterial cell economy</a></h4>

Phototrophic microorganisms are promising resources for green biotechnology. Compared to heterotrophic microorganisms, however, the cellular economy of phototrophic growth is still insufficiently understood. We provide a quantitative analysis of light-limited, light-saturated, and light-inhibited growth of the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 using a reproducible cultivation setup. We report key physiological parameters, including growth rate, cell size, and photosynthetic activity over a wide range of light intensities. Intracellular proteins were quantified to monitor proteome allocation as a function of growth rate. Among other physiological adaptations, we identify an upregulation of the translational machinery and downregulation of light harvesting components with increasing light intensity and growth rate. The resulting growth laws are discussed in the context of a coarse-grained model of phototrophic growth and available data obtained by a comprehensive literature search. Our insights into quantitative aspects of cyanobacterial adaptations to different growth rates have implications to understand and optimize photosynthetic productivity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42392">Retinal direction selectivity in the absence of asymmetric starburst amacrine cell responses</a></h4>

In the mammalian retina, direction-selectivity is thought to originate in the dendrites of GABAergic/cholinergic starburst amacrine cells, where it is first observed. However, here we demonstrate that direction selectivity in downstream ganglion cells remains remarkably unaffected when starburst dendrites are rendered non-directional, using a novel strategy combining a conditional GABA<sub>A</sub> α2 receptor knockout mouse with optogenetics. We show that temporal asymmetries between excitation/inhibition, arising from the differential connectivity patterns of starburst cholinergic and GABAergic synapses to ganglion cells, form the basis for a parallel mechanism generating direction selectivity. We further demonstrate that these distinct mechanisms work in a coordinated way to refine direction selectivity as the stimulus crosses the ganglion cell's receptive field. Thus, precise spatiotemporal patterns of inhibition and excitation that determine directional responses in ganglion cells are shaped by two 'core' mechanisms, both arising from distinct specializations of the starburst network.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42101">Surface color and predictability determine contextual modulation of V1 firing and gamma oscillations</a></h4>

The integration of direct bottom-up inputs with contextual information is a core feature of neocortical circuits. In area V1, neurons may reduce their firing rates when their receptive field input can be predicted by spatial context. Gamma-synchronized (30-80Hz) firing may provide a complementary signal to rates, reflecting stronger synchronization between neuronal populations receiving mutually predictable inputs. We show that large uniform surfaces, which have high spatial predictability, strongly suppressed firing yet induced prominent gamma-synchronization in macaque V1, particularly when they were colored. Yet, chromatic mismatches between center and surround, breaking predictability, strongly reduced gamma-synchronization while increasing firing rates. Differences between responses to different colors, including strong gamma-responses to red, arose from stimulus adaptation to a full-screen background, suggesting prominent differences in adaptation between M- and L-cone signaling pathways. Thus, synchrony signaled whether RF inputs were predicted from spatial context, while firing rates increased when stimuli were unpredicted from context.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41541">Brain signatures of a multiscale process of sequence learning in humans</a></h4>

Extracting the temporal structure of sequences of events is crucial for perception, decision-making, and language processing. Here, we investigate the mechanisms by which the brain acquires knowledge of sequences and the possibility that successive brain responses reflect the progressive extraction of sequence statistics at different timescales. We measured brain activity using magnetoencephalography in humans exposed to auditory sequences with various statistical regularities, and we modeled this activity as theoretical surprise levels using several learning models. Successive brain waves related to different types of statistical inferences. Early post-stimulus brain waves denoted a sensitivity to a simple statistic, the frequency of items estimated over a long timescale (habituation). Mid-latency and late brain waves conformed qualitatively and quantitatively to the computational properties of a more complex inference: the learning of recent transition probabilities. Our findings thus support the existence of multiple computational systems for sequence processing involving statistical inferences at multiple scales.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41124">Structures in multiple conformations reveal distinct transition metal and proton pathways in an Nramp transporter</a></h4>

Nramp family transporters—expressed in organisms from bacteria to humans—enable uptake of essential divalent transition metals via an alternating-access mechanism that also involves proton transport. We present high-resolution structures of <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> (Dra)Nramp in multiple conformations to provide a thorough description of the Nramp transport cycle by identifying the key intramolecular rearrangements and changes to the metal coordination sphere. Strikingly, while metal transport requires cycling from outward- to inward-open states, efficient proton transport still occurs in outward-locked (but not inward-locked) DraNramp. We propose a model in which metal and proton enter the transporter via the same external pathway to the binding site, but follow separate routes to the cytoplasm, which could facilitate the co-transport of two cationic species. Our results illustrate the flexibility of the LeuT fold to support a broad range of substrate transport and conformational change mechanisms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40712">Molecular and topological reorganizations in mitochondrial architecture interplay during Bax-mediated steps of apoptosis</a></h4>

During apoptosis, Bcl-2 proteins such as Bax and Bak mediate the release of pro-apoptotic proteins from the mitochondria by clustering on the outer mitochondrial membrane and thereby permeabilizing it. However, it remains unclear how outer membrane openings form. Here, we combined different correlative microscopy and electron cryo-tomography approaches to visualize the effects of Bax activity on mitochondria in human cells. Our data show that Bax clusters localize near outer membrane ruptures of highly variable size. Bax clusters contain structural elements suggesting a higher order organization of their components. Furthermore, unfolding of inner membrane cristae is coupled to changes in the supramolecular assembly of ATP synthases, particularly pronounced at membrane segments exposed to the cytosol by ruptures. Based on our results, we propose a comprehensive model in which molecular reorganizations of the inner membrane and sequestration of outer membrane components into Bax clusters interplay in the formation of outer membrane ruptures.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39695">A first order phase transition mechanism underlies protein aggregation in mammalian cells</a></h4>

The formation of misfolded protein aggregates is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. The aggregate formation process exhibits an initial lag phase when precursor clusters spontaneously assemble. However, most experimental assays are blind to this lag phase. We develop a quantitative assay based on super-resolution imaging in fixed cells and light sheet imaging of living cells to study the early steps of aggregation in mammalian cells. We find that even under normal growth conditions mammalian cells have precursor clusters. The cluster size distribution is precisely that expected for a so-called super-saturated system in first order phase transition. This means there exists a nucleation barrier, and a critical size above which clusters grow and mature. Homeostasis is maintained through a Szilard model entailing the preferential clearance of super-critical clusters. We uncover a role for a putative chaperone (RuvBL) in this disassembly of large clusters. The results indicate early aggregates behave like condensates.

Fatty acyl reductases (FARs) are involved in the biosynthesis of fatty alcohols that serve a range of biological roles. Insects typically harbor numerous FAR gene family members. While some FARs are involved in pheromone biosynthesis, the biological significance of the large number of FARs in insect genomes remains unclear.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We mapped alterations of the functional structure of the cerebral cortex using a novel imaging approach in a sample of 160 obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. Whole-brain functional connectivity maps were generated using multidistance measures of intracortical neural activity coupling defined within isodistant local areas. OCD patients demonstrated neural activity desynchronization within the orbitofrontal cortex and in primary somatosensory, auditory, visual, gustatory, and olfactory areas. Symptom severity was significantly associated with the degree of functional structure alteration in OCD-relevant brain regions. By means of a novel imaging perspective, we once again identified brain alterations in the orbitofrontal cortex, involving areas purportedly implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD. However, our results also indicated that weaker intracortical activity coupling is also present in each primary sensory area. On the basis of previous neurophysiological studies, such cortical activity desynchronization may best be interpreted as reflecting deficient inhibitory neuron activity and altered sensory filtering.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dysfunction of motor cortices is thought to contribute to motor disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD).

We first demonstrate licking deficits and concurrent alterations of spiking activity in ALM of head-fixed mice with unilateral depletion of dopaminergic neurons (i.e., mice injected with 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle). Hemilesioned mice displayed delayed licking initiation, shorter duration of licking bouts, and lateral deviation of tongue protrusions. In parallel with these motor deficits, we observed a reduction in the prevalence of cue responsive neurons and altered preparatory activity. Acute and local blockade of D1 receptors in ALM recapitulated some of the key behavioral and neural deficits observed in hemilesioned mice. Altogether, our data show a direct relationship between cortical D1 receptor modulation, cue-evoked, and preparatory activity in ALM, and licking initiation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>To uncover the ontogenesis of the human indusium griseum (IG), 28 post-mortem fetal human brains, 12–40 postconceptional weeks (PCW) of age, and 4 adult brains were analyzed immunohistochemically and compared with post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 28 fetal brains (14–41 PCW). The morphogenesis of the IG occurred between 12 and 15 PCW, transforming the bilateral IG primordia into a ribbon-like cortical lamina. The histogenetic transition of sub-laminated zones into the three-layered cortical organization occurred between 15 and 35 PCW, concomitantly with rapid cell differentiation that occurred from 18 to 28 PCW and the elaboration of neuronal connectivity during the entire second half of gestation. The increasing number of total cells and neurons in the IG at 25 and 35 PCW confirmed its continued differentiation throughout this period. High-field 3.0 T post-mortem MRI enabled visualization of the IG at the mid-fetal stage using T2-weighted sequences. In conclusion, the IG had a distinct histogenetic differentiation pattern than that of the neighboring intralimbic areas of the same ontogenetic origin, and did not show any signs of regression during the fetal period or postnatally, implying a functional role of the IG in the adult brain, which is yet to be disclosed.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In many species of Mammalia, the surface of the brain develops from a smooth structure to one with many fissures and folds, allowing for vast expansion of the surface area of the cortex. The importance of understanding what drives cortical folding extends beyond mere curiosity, as conditions such as preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal alcohol syndrome are associated with impaired folding in the infant and child. Despite being a key feature of brain development, the mechanisms driving cortical folding remain largely unknown. In this review we discuss the possible role of the subplate, a developmentally transient compartment, in directing region-dependent development leading to sulcal and gyral formation. We discuss the development of the subplate in species with lissencephalic and gyrencephalic cortices, the characteristics of the cells found in the subplate, and the possible presence of molecular cues that guide axons into, and out of, the overlying and multilayered cortex before the appearance of definitive cortical folds. An understanding of what drives cortical folding is likely to help in understanding the origins of abnormal folding patterns in clinical pathologies.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>During early development, the infant brain is highly plastic and sensory experiences modulate emerging cortical maps, enhancing processing efficiency as infants set up key linguistic precursors. Early interactive acoustic experience (IAE) with spectrotemporally-modulated non-speech has been shown to facilitate optimal acoustic processing and generalizes to novel non-speech sounds at 7-months-of-age. Here we demonstrate that effects of non-speech IAE endure well beyond the immediate training period and robustly generalize to speech processing. Infants who received non-speech IAE differed at 9-months-of-age from both naïve controls and those with only passive acoustic exposure, demonstrating broad modulation of oscillatory dynamics. For the standard syllable, increased high-gamma (&gt;70 Hz) power within auditory cortices indicates that IAE fosters native speech processing, facilitating establishment of phonemic representations. The higher left beta power seen may reflect increased linking of sensory information and corresponding articulatory patterns, while bilateral decreases in theta power suggest more mature automatized speech processing, as less neuronal resources were allocated to process syllabic information. For the deviant syllable, left-lateralized gamma (&lt;70 Hz) enhancement suggests IAE promotes phonemic-related discrimination abilities. Theta power increases in right auditory cortex, known for favoring slow-rate decoding, implies IAE facilitates the more demanding processing of the sporadic deviant syllable.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Alcohol abuse is a major public health problem worldwide. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control regular drinking may help to reduce hazards of alcohol consumption. While immunological mechanisms have been related to alcohol drinking, most studies reported changes in immune function that are secondary to alcohol use. In this report, we analyse how the gene “TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator” (<span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span>) affects alcohol drinking behavior. Based on our recent discovery in a large GWAS dataset that suggested an association of <span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span>, SNP rs197273, with alcohol drinking, we report that SNP rs197273 in <span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span> is associated both with gene expression (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 1.16 × 10<sup>−19</sup>) and regional methylation (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 5.90 × 10<sup>−25</sup>). A <span style="font-style: italic;">tank</span> knock out mouse model suggests a role of TANK in alcohol drinking, anxiety-related behavior, as well as alcohol exposure induced activation of insular cortex NF-κB. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies among up to 1896 adolescents reveal that TANK is involved in the control of brain activity in areas of aversive interoceptive processing, including the insular cortex, but not in areas related to reinforcement, reward processing or impulsiveness. Our findings suggest that the cortical neuroimmune regulator TANK is associated with enhanced aversive emotional processing that better protects from the establishment of alcohol drinking behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampus displays a complex organization and function that is perturbed in many neuropathologies. Histological work revealed a complex arrangement of subfields along the medial–lateral and the ventral–dorsal dimension, which contrasts with the anterior–posterior functional differentiation. The variety of maps has raised the need for an integrative multimodal view. We applied connectivity-based parcellation to 1) intrinsic connectivity 2) task-based connectivity, and 3) structural covariance, as complementary windows into structural and functional differentiation of the hippocampus. Strikingly, while functional properties (i.e., intrinsic and task-based) revealed similar partitions dominated by an anterior–posterior organization, structural covariance exhibited a hybrid pattern reflecting both functional and cytoarchitectonic subdivision. Capitalizing on the consistency of functional parcellations, we defined robust functional maps at different levels of partitions, which are openly available for the scientific community. Our functional maps demonstrated a head–body and tail partition, subdivided along the anterior–posterior and medial–lateral axis. Behavioral profiling of these fine partitions based on activation data indicated an emotion–cognition gradient along the anterior–posterior axis and additionally suggested a self-world-centric gradient supporting the role of the hippocampus in the construction of abstract representations for spatial navigation and episodic memory.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/540724v1?rss=1">TIMP-1 attenuates the development of cutaneous inflammation-induced hypersensitivity</a></h4>

Unresolved inflammation is a significant predictor for developing chronic pain, and targeting the mechanisms underlying inflammation offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention. During inflammation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity contributes to tissue remodeling and inflammatory signaling through proteolytic maturation of cytokines. MMP activity is regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1-4. TIMP-1 and -2 have known roles in pain, but only in the context of MMP inhibition. However, TIMP-1 also has receptor-mediated cell signaling functions that are not well understood. Here, we examined how TIMP-1-dependent cell signaling impacted inflammatory hypersensitivity and ongoing pain. We found that hindpaw injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) increased keratinocyte-derived TIMP-1 that peaked 3 days following inflammation, when mechanical hypersensitivity began to emerge in WT mice. These data suggest that TIMP-1 expression inhibits the development of inflammatory hypersensitivity. To examine this possibility, we injected TIMP-1 knockout (T1KO) mice with a diluted CFA mixture to examine how subtle cutaneous inflammation affected behavioral hypersensitivity. T1KO mice exhibited rapid onset thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity at the site of inflammation that was absent or attenuated in WT controls. We also found that T1KO mice exhibited hypersensitivity in adjacent tissues innervated by different sets of afferents, and skin contralateral to the site of inflammation. Replacement of recombinant murine (rm)TIMP-1 alleviated hypersensitivity when administered at the site and time of inflammation. To examine the MMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms of rmTIMP-1, T1KO mice were administered full-length rmTIMP-1, the N-terminal region (TIMP-1(N)) with MMP-inhibitory properties, or the C-terminal region (TIMP-1(C)) that retains receptor signaling function. Each of the peptides prevented inflammatory hypersensitivity, suggesting that rmTIMP-1 acts through mechanisms that also include receptor-mediated cell signaling. We also found that hypersensitivity was neither due to genotype-specific differences in MMP-9 activity or expression, nor to differences in cytokine expression. Finally, to evaluate the potential clinical utility of TIMP-1, we administered rmTIMP-1 to WT mice and found that rmTIMP-1 prevented clonidine-induced conditioned place preference (e.g., ongoing pain) and inflammatory mechanical hypersensitivity. Collectively, our data suggest a novel role for TIMP-1 in the attenuation of inflammatory pain that occurs through previously uncharacterized cell signaling mechanisms.

This study aimed to evaluate the linear association of age with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of white matter such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). We assessed patterns of overlap between linear correlations of age with FA with RD, MD and AD to characterize the process of white matter degeneration observed with ageing. 79 healthy adults aged between 18 and 75 took part in the study. The DTI data were based on 61 directions acquired with a b-value of 2000. There was a statistically significant negative linear correlation of age with FA and AD and a positive linear correlation with RD and MD, and AD. The forceps minor tract showed largest percentage of voxels with an association of age with FA, RD and AD, and the anterior thalamic radiation with MD. We found 5 main patterns of overlap: FA alone (15.95%); FA and RD (31.90%); FA and AD (12.99%); FA, RD and AD (27.37%); FA RD, and MD (6.94%). Patterns of overlap between diffusion measures may reflect underlying biological changes with healthy ageing such as loss of myelination, axonal damage, as well as mild microstructural and chronic white matter impairments. This study may provide information about causes of degeneration in specific regions of the brain, and how this may affect healthy brain functioning in older adults.

Hallucinations, including auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), occur in both the healthy population and in psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia (often developing after a prodromal period). In addition, hallucinations can be in-context (they can be consistent with the environment, such as when one hallucinates the end of a sentence that has been repeated many times), or out-of-context (such as the bizarre hallucinations associated with schizophrenia). In previous work, we introduced a model of hallucinations as false (positive) inferences based on a (Markov decision process) formulation of active inference. In this work, we extend this model to include content - to disclose the computational mechanisms behind in- and out-of-context hallucinations. In active inference, sensory information is used to disambiguate alternative hypotheses about the causes of sensations. Sensory information is balanced against prior beliefs, and when this balance is tipped in the favor of prior beliefs, hallucinations can occur. We show that in-context hallucinations arise when (simulated) subjects cannot use sensory information to correct prior beliefs about hearing a voice, but beliefs about content (i.e. the sequential order of a sentence) remain accurate. When hallucinating subjects also have inaccurate beliefs about state transitions, out-of-context hallucinations occur; i.e. their hallucinated speech content is disordered. Furthermore, subjects with inaccurate beliefs about state transitions but an intact ability to use sensory information do not hallucinate and are reminiscent of prodromal patients. This work demonstrates the different computational mechanisms that may underlie the spectrum of hallucinatory experience - from the healthy population to psychotic states.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/540237v1?rss=1">Mouse trigeminal neurons respond to kokumi substances</a></h4>

Using in vivo confocal Ca2+ imaging, we investigated whether oral application of kokumi substances elicits responses in trigeminal somatosensory ganglion neurons of the mouse. Our results show that 100 M {gamma}EVG ({gamma}-Glu-Val-Gly), a potent kokumi stimulus, evokes responses in a very small fraction (0.6 %) of neurons in area V3 (oral sensory field) of the trigeminal ganglion. By comparison, cooled artificial saliva elicited thermal-evoked responses in &gt;7 % of V3 trigeminal ganglion neurons. {gamma}EVG-evoked responses were small and quite variable, with latencies ranging from 2 to over 200 sec. Co-application of the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) inhibitor NPS-2143 significantly decreased {gamma}EVG-evoked activity. Furthermore, we show that 4 additional kokumi substances evoked responses in mouse trigeminal ganglion neurons. All neurons responding to kokumi compounds were small cells, with mean diameters below 20 m. In summary, our data show that certain physiological and pharmacological properties of responses to kokumi compounds can be recorded from sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion of living mice. Thus, sensory neurons in the somatosensory trigeminal ganglia may transmit signals from the oral cavity to the central nervous system to generate the texture perceptions that are part of the enigmatic sensations evoked by kokumi substances.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/540187v1?rss=1">Sensorimotor adaptation compensates for distortions of 3D shape information</a></h4>

Visual perception often fails to recover the veridical 3D shape of objects in the environment due to ambiguity and variability in the available depth cues. However, we rely heavily on 3D shape estimates when planning movements, for example reaching to pick up an object from a slanted surface. Given the wide variety of distortions that can affect 3D perception, how do our actions remain accurate across different environments? One hypothesis is that the visuomotor system performs selective filtering of 3D information to minimize distortions. Indeed, some studies have found that actions appear to preferentially target stereo information when it is put in conflict with texture information. However, since these studies analyze averages over multiple trials, this apparent preference could be produced by sensorimotor adaptation. In Experiment 1, we create a set of cue-conflict stimuli where one available depth cue is affected by a constant bias. Sensory feedback rapidly aligns the motor output with physical reality in just a few trials, which can make it seem as if action planning selectively relies on the reinforced cue--yet no change in the relative influences of the cues is necessary to eliminate the constant errors. In contrast, when one depth cue becomes less correlated with physical reality, variable movement errors will occur, causing canonical adaptation to fail as the opposite error corrections cancel out. As a result, canonical adaptation cannot explain the preference for stereo found in studies with variable errors. However, Experiment 2 shows that persistent errors can produce a novel form of adaptation that gradually reduces the relative influence of an unreliable depth cue. These findings show that grasp control processes are continuously modified based on sensory feedback to compensate for both biases and noise in 3D visual processing, rather than having a hardwired preference for one type of depth information.

Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by degeneration and progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Currently no cure for this disease is available. Existing drugs alleviate PD symptoms, but fail to halt neurodegeneration. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is able to protect and repair dopamine neurons in vitro and in animal models of PD, but its clinical use is complicated by pharmacokinetic properties. In the present study we demonstrate the ability of a small molecule agonist of GDNF receptor RET to support the survival of cultured dopamine neurons only when they express GDNF receptors. In addition, BT13 activates intracellular signaling cascades in vivo, stimulates release of dopamine and protect the function of dopaminergic neurons in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD. In contrast to GDNF, BT13 is able to penetrate through the blood-brain-barrier. Thus, BT13 serves as an excellent tool compound for the development of novel disease-modifying treatments against PD.

Zebrafish have a remarkable capacity to regenerate following spinal cord (SC) injury but the responsible cellular events are not well understood. We used in vivo imaging and genetics to pin-point specific cellular processes controlling SC regeneration in zebrafish. We identified two temporally and mechanistically distinct phases of cellular regeneration in the SC. The initial phase relies on migration of precursor neurons to the injury, enabling rapid functional recovery, and activation of quiescent neural progenitor cells (NPCs). A second phase of regenerative neurogenesis compensates for both the lost tissue and cells depleted due to precursor neuron migration. We propose a critical role of precursor neurons recruitment in initiating neuronal circuit recovery and buying sufficient time for regenerative neurogenesis to take place. Taken together, our data suggests an unanticipated role of precursor cell recruitment in driving neural repair and functional recovery during the regenerative response.

Onset primacy is a robust behavioural phenomenon whereby humans identify the sudden appearance of an object in the environment (onset) with greater speed and accuracy than other types of visual change, such as the sudden disappearance of an object from the environment (offset). The default mode hypothesis explains this phenomenon by postulating that onset detection is the default processing mode of the attentional system. The present study aimed to test this by investigating whether onset primacy is also reflected on a neural level, as indicated by the comparative efficiency of neural processing for onsets, using electroencephalography. It was hypothesised that this relative efficiency would be reflected in the P300 event-related potential as a greater mean amplitude with an earlier peak across temporal, parietal, and occipital regions during onset detection, compared to offset detection. This prediction was tested through a change detection task in which participants were required to identify the location of onset or offset between paired images of naturalistic scenes. Results showed that P300 amplitude and latency differed between onset and offset conditions in the anticipated directions, supporting the default mode hypothesis. These results suggest that the P300 is a neural marker of onset primacy in visual change detection.

Persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) in children following a mild traumatic brain injury is a growing public health concern. There is a pressing need to understand the neural underpinning of PCS following concussion. Here, we examine the relationship between whole-brain functional connectivity with PCS and behavioral assessments in a prospective study of 110 children. We find that PCS and behaviors including poor cognition and sleep quality are associated with connectivity within segregated functional brain networks. The identification of a single "positive-negative" dimension linking whole-brain connectivity with symptoms and behaviors enables better prognosis and stratification towards targeted therapeutic interventions tailored to individuals.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/539551v1?rss=1">Predicting Empathy from Resting Brain Connectivity</a></h4>

Recent studies suggest that individual differences in empathic concern may be mediated by continuous interactions between self-other resonance and cognitive control networks. To test this hypothesis, we used machine learning to examine whether resting fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of task demands) of resonance and control networks could predict trait empathy (n=58). Indeed, resonance and control networks' interconnectivity predicted empathic concern. Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity within the somatomotor network. In light of numerous reported sex differences in empathy, we controlled for biological sex and also studied separately what aspect of these features could predict participants' sex. Sex was best predicted by the interconnectivity of the visual system with the resonance, somatomotor, and cingulo-opercular network, as well as the somatomotor-control network connectivity. These findings confirm that variation in empathic responses to others reflects characteristic network properties detectable regardless of task demands. Furthermore, network properties of the visual system may be a locus of sex differences previously unaccounted for in empathy research. Finally, these findings suggest that it may be possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.

Measuring and assessing the cognitive load associated with different tasks is crucial for many applications, from the design of instructional materials to monitoring the mental wellbeing of aircraft pilots. The goal of this paper is to utilize EEG to infer the cognitive workload of subjects during intelligence tests. We chose the well established advanced progressive matrices test, an ideal work-frame because it presents problems at increasing levels of difficulty, and has been rigorously validated in past experiments. We train classic machine learning models using basic EEG measures as well as measures of network connectivity and signal complexity. Our findings demonstrate that cognitive load can be well predicted using these features, even for a low number of channels. We show that by creating an individually tuned neural network for each subject, we can improve prediction compared to a general model and that such models are robust to decreasing the number of available channels as well.

On the basis of embodied/-enacted theories of the mind, investigations of spatial cognition related to real world environments have become current research interests. How this perspective relates to acquiring spatial knowledge not by active exploration, but through map learning, however, remains unresolved. Therefore, we designed a large virtual city comprised of over 200 houses, suitable for active exploration or spatial learning based on a map. Here, we report our results after single and repeated 30-minute training sessions using an interactive city map. We tested subjects' knowledge of the orientation of houses towards cardinal north and of two houses relative to each other and the locations of two houses towards each other in a pointing task. Our results revealed that a single training session was sufficient to repeatedly view the majority of houses covering a large area of the city. However, repeated training sessions were necessary to improve the performance level and reveal significant differences between tasks. In contrast to a previous study in a real world city, performance in the two orientation tasks was better than in the pointing task. The lack of distance and the lack of angular difference effects onto task performance suggest the use of a global reference frame. Performance was positively correlated with a self-report on spatial abilities (FRS) in the absolute orientation and pointing task but not the relative orientation task. Overall, our results suggest that training with an interactive city map enhances abstract knowledge, not directly available from an embodied perspective.

Experimental models of pain in humans are crucial for understanding pain mechanisms. The most often used muscle pain models involve the injection of algesic substances, such as hypertonic saline solution or nerve growth factor, or exercise-induced delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). However, these models are either invasive or take substantial time to develop, and the elicited level of pain/soreness is difficult to control. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose to elicit muscle pain by a localized application of short-wave diathermy (SWD). In this crossover study, SWD was administered to eighteen healthy volunteers to the wrist extensor muscle group, with a constant stimulation intensity and up to 4 minutes. We measured pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pinprick sensitivity (PPS) and performed a psychophysical evaluation of muscle soreness at baseline and at 0, 30 and 60 minutes. SWD evoked localized muscle pain/soreness in the wrist extensor muscle group and a decrease of PPT in the treated arm compared with the control arm that lasted for at least 60 minutes, reflecting ongoing hyperalgesia after SWD application. PPS was not significantly altered 30 to 60 min following SWD, suggesting a minimal contribution from skin tissue to sustained hyperalgesia.

Critics often cite statistical problems as prime contributors to the reproducibility crisis of science, expressing great concern about research that bases major conclusions on single p-valued statistical tests. The critics also argue that the predicted reliability of neuroscience research in particular is low because much of the work depends heavily on small experimental sample sizes and, hence, its statistical tests lack adequate power. It is not known how common the practice of basing major conclusions on single tests is in neuroscience or how the statistical criticisms affect the validity of conclusions drawn by laboratory research that evaluates hypotheses via multiple tests. I review a sample of neuroscience publications to estimate the prevalence and extensiveness of hypothesis-testing research. I then apply the method of R.A. Fisher for combining test results to show that the practice of testing multiple predictions of hypotheses increases the predicted reliability of neuroscience research.

Expectancy shapes our perception of impending events. Although such an interplay between cognitive and affective processes is often impaired in mental disorders, it is not well understood how top-down expectancy signals modulate future affect. We therefore track the information flow in the brain during cognitive and affective processing segregated in time using task-specific cross-correlations. Participants in two independent fMRI studies (N1 = 37 &amp; N2 = 55) were instructed to imagine a situation with affective content as indicated by a cue, which was then followed by an emotional picture congruent with expectancy. To correct for intrinsic covariance of brain function, we calculate resting-state cross-correlations analogous to the task. First, using factorial modeling of delta cross-correlations (task-rest) of the first study, we find that the magnitude of expectancy signals in the anterior insula cortex (AIC) modulates the BOLD response to emotional pictures in the anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in opposite directions. Second, using hierarchical linear modeling of lagged connectivity, we demonstrate that expectancy signals in the AIC indeed foreshadow this opposing pattern in the prefrontal cortex. Third, we replicate the results in the second study using a higher temporal resolution, showing that our task-specific cross-correlation approach robustly uncovers the dynamics of information flow. We conclude that the AIC arbitrates the recruitment of distinct prefrontal networks during cued picture processing according to triggered expectations. Taken together, our study provides new insights into neuronal pathways channeling cognition and affect within well-defined brain networks. Better understanding of such dynamics could lead to new applications tracking aberrant information processing in mental disorders.

White matter (WM) plasticity during adulthood is a recently described phenomenon by which experience can shape brain structure. It has been observed in humans using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, it remains unclear which mechanisms drive or underlie WM plasticity in adulthood. Here, we combined DTI and mRNA expression analysis and examined the effects of somatosensory experience in adult rats. Somatosensory experience resulted in differences in WM and grey matter structure. C-FOS mRNA expression, a marker of cortical activity, in the barrel cortex correlated with the structural WM measures, suggesting that WM plasticity is activity-dependent. Analysis of myelin-related genes revealed higher myelin basic protein expression in WM, while genome-wide RNA sequencing analysis identified 134 differentially-expressed genes regulating proteins involved in functions related to cell proliferation and differentiation, neuronal activity modulation and regulation of myelination. In conclusion, the macroscale measures of WM differences identified in response to somatosensory experience are supported by molecular evidence, which strongly suggest myelination as, at least, one of the underlying mechanisms.

Hearing loss has been implicated as a risk factor for schizophrenia, but it is not known whether this association arises from common etiology, top-down influences (e.g., social isolation), bottom-up neurobiological mechanisms, or combinations of these factors. Patients with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) have a 25-30% risk of developing schizophrenia, and also suffer frequent hearing loss. Here, we used the Df1/+ mouse model of 22q11.2DS to investigate the relationship between hearing loss and susceptibility to schizophrenia-relevant brain and behavioral abnormalities. Df1/+ mice have a multi-gene deletion analogous to the chromosomal microdeletion that causes human 22q11.2DS, and like human 22q11.2DS patients exhibit high rates of hearing loss arising primarily from susceptibility to middle ear inflammation. We found that hearing loss in Df1/+ mice affected schizophrenia-relevant endophenotypes, including electrophysiological measures of central auditory gain and behavioral measures of auditory sensorimotor gating. Moreover, PV+ inhibitory interneurons, another marker for schizophrenia pathology, were significantly reduced in density in auditory cortex but not secondary motor cortex of Df1/+ mice with hearing loss. These results reveal bottom-up neurobiological mechanisms through which peripheral hearing loss arising from the 22q11.2 deletion may promote the emergence of schizophrenia-relevant auditory brain and behavioral abnormalities, and also suggest a link between conductive hearing loss and reduced PV+ interneuron density in the auditory cortex.

Because sensory measurements are temporally and spatially local, the estimation of an object or event can be viewed as the grouping of these measurements into representations of their common causes. Perceptual grouping is believed to reflect internalized regularities of the natural environment, yet grouping cues have traditionally been identified using informal observation, and investigated using artificial stimuli. The relationship of grouping to natural signal statistics has thus remained unclear, and additional or alternative cues remain possible. Here we derive auditory grouping cues by measuring and summarizing statistics of natural sound features. Feature co-occurrence statistics reproduced established cues but also revealed previously unappreciated grouping principles. The results suggest that auditory grouping is adapted to natural stimulus statistics, show how these statistics can reveal novel grouping phenomena, and provide a framework for studying grouping in natural signals.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/539510v1?rss=1">Can transcranial direct current stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex enhance proprioception?</a></h4>

Introduction: Proprioception is critical for accurate and consistent movement, and is processed by the sensorimotor cortex. Increased prefrontal activity is associated with improved proprioception and motor performance. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been found to increase activity of the sensorimotor cortex. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether anodal tDCS of the DLPFC may enhance proprioception measured with a target task. It was hypothesized that tDCS over the left DLPFC would improve motor performance (error and variability) on a target task completed without vision. Design: Single blind, within-participant, sham-controlled trial. Methods: Fifteen healthy young adults (M:F=6:9, age=23.3 years) completed 18 trials of a computerized target task (manipulating a mouse) with their non-dominant upper-limb, with and without vision, before and after (pre/post assessment) 20-minutes of stimulation (anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC) and sham conditions. Averages and coefficient of variation (CV, variability between trials) of spatio-temporal parameters associated with the movement were measured. Stimulation/ sham sessions were counterbalanced (stimulation first session, n=8), with each session separated by one week. Repeated-measures ANOVA and pairwise comparisons (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were conducted. Results: Regarding distance travelled CV, a significant interaction between condition and assessment (F(1,14)=5.09, p=0.041) demonstrated that variability was significantly less post-stimulation compared to pre (p=0.003). A significant interaction between assessment and vision (F(1,14)=30.08, p&lt;0.001) regarding distance travelled CV showed that without vision, variability was significantly less at post compared to pre (p&lt;0.001), and this decrease was found after the stimulation condition only (95% CI = 7.4 +/- 1.6 [4.0 to 10.9]). Conclusion: Since variability of distance travelled during the target task without vision was lower post-stimulation compared to pre, consistency of movement without vision, and therefore proprioception, may have been enhanced by anodal tDCS of the DLPFC. This improvement could be due to modulation of fronto-striatal-thalamic circuits. These findings may be the first step in developing tDCS methods as an effective adjunct therapy for dysfunctional proprioception in various disorders, such as Parkinson disease.

A defining feature of sleep is reduced responsiveness to external stimuli, but the mechanisms gating sensory-evoked arousal remain unclear. We hypothesized that reduced locus-coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) activity during sleep mediates unresponsiveness, and its action promotes sensory-evoked awakenings. We tested this using electrophysiological, behavioral, pharmacological, and optogenetic techniques alongside auditory stimulation in freely behaving rats. We found that systemic reduction of NE signaling lowered probability of sound-evoked awakening (SEAs). The level of tonic LC activity during sleep anticipated SEAs. Optogenetic LC activation promoted arousal as evident in sleep-wake transitions, EEG desynchronization, and pupil dilation. Importantly, liminal LC excitation during sound presentation increased SEA probability. Optogenetic LC silencing using a soma-targeted anion-conducting opsin (GtACR) stopped LC spiking and constricted pupils. Brief periods of LC opto-silencing reduced the probability of SEAs. Thus, LC-NE activity determines the likelihood of sensory-evoked awakenings and its reduction during sleep constitutes a key factor mediating behavioral unresponsiveness.

Constraint-based modeling (CBM) is increasingly used to analyze the metabolism of complex microbial communities involved in ecology, biomedicine, and various biotechnological processes. While CBM is an established framework for studying the metabolism of single species with linear stoichiometric models, CBM of communities with balanced growth is more complicated, not only due to the larger size of the multi-species metabolic network but also because of the bilinear nature of the resulting community models. Moreover, the solution space of these community models often contains biologically unrealistic solutions, which, even with model linearization and under application of certain objective functions, cannot easily be excluded. Here we present RedCom, a new approach to build reduced community models in which the metabolisms of the participating organisms are represented by net conversions computed from the respective single-species networks. By discarding (single-species) net conversions that violate a minimality criterion in the exchange fluxes, it is ensured that unrealistic solutions in the community model are excluded where a species altruistically synthesizes large amounts of byproducts (instead of biomass) to fulfill the requirements of other species. We employed the RedCom approach for modeling communities of up to nine organisms involved in typical degradation steps of anaerobic digestion in biogas plants. Compared to full (bilinear and linearized) community models, we found that the reduced community models obtained with RedCom are not only much smaller but allow, also in the largest model with nine species, extensive calculations required to fully characterize the solutions space and to reveal key properties of communities with maximum methane yield and production rates. Furthermore, the predictive power of the reduced community models is significantly larger because they predict much smaller ranges of feasible community compositions and exchange fluxes still being consistent with measurements obtained from enrichment cultures. For an enrichment culture for growth on ethanol, we also used metaproteomic data to further constrain the solution space of the community models. Both model and proteomic data indicated a dominance of acetoclastic methanogens (Methanosarcinales) and Desulfovibrionales being the least abundant group in this microbial community.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nukP6-AaBg4" width="1" />

<p>by Dave Osthus, Ashlynn R. Daughton, Reid Priedhorsky</p>

The ability to produce timely and accurate flu forecasts in the United States can significantly impact public health. Augmenting forecasts with internet data has shown promise for improving forecast accuracy and timeliness in controlled settings, but results in practice are less convincing, as models augmented with internet data have not consistently outperformed models without internet data. In this paper, we perform a controlled experiment, taking into account data backfill, to improve clarity on the benefits and limitations of augmenting an already good flu forecasting model with internet-based nowcasts. Our results show that a good flu forecasting model can benefit from the augmentation of internet-based nowcasts in practice for all considered public health-relevant forecasting targets. The degree of forecast improvement due to nowcasting, however, is uneven across forecasting targets, with short-term forecasting targets seeing the largest improvements and seasonal targets such as the peak timing and intensity seeing relatively marginal improvements. The uneven forecasting improvements across targets hold even when “perfect” nowcasts are used. These findings suggest that further improvements to flu forecasting, particularly seasonal targets, will need to derive from other, non-nowcasting approaches.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NREuF014noo" width="1" />

ABSTRACT<p>Vestibulospinal neurons are organized into discrete groups projecting from brainstem to spinal cord, enabling vertebrates to maintain proper balance and posture. The two largest groups are the lateral vestibulospinal tract (LVST) group and the contralateral medial vestibulospinal tract (cMVST) group, with different projection lateralities and functional roles. In search of a molecular basis for these differences, we performed RNA sequencing on LVST and cMVST neurons from mouse and chicken embryos followed by immunohistofluorescence validation. Focusing on transcription factor (TF)-encoding genes, we identified TF signatures that uniquely distinguish the LVST from the cMVST group and further parse different rhombomere-derived portions comprising the cMVST. Immunohistofluorescence assessment of the CNS from spinal cord to cortex demonstrated that these TF signatures are restricted to the respective vestibulospinal groups and some neurons in their immediate vicinity. Collectively, these results link the combinatorial expression of TFs to developmental and functional subdivisions within the vestibulospinal system.</p><p><b>Significance statement:</b> The molecular underpinnings of hodological and functional subdivisions within brainstem-to-spinal cord projection neurons are poorly understood. Transcriptomic profiling is an important step towards obtaining a molecular characterization of individual projection neuron groups and identifying candidate genes potentially involved in their specification. Here we use this approach to identify transcription factor signatures conserved in mouse and chicken that distinguish the two major vestibulospinal projection neuron groups and define coherent subpopulations within them, using whole transcriptome sequencing and immunohistofluorescence combined with retrograde tracing.</p>

Abstract<p>Dynamical changes in the environment strongly impact our perception. Likewise, sensory systems preferentially represent stimulus changes, enhancing temporal contrast. In olfaction, odor concentration changes across consecutive inhalations (<i>C<sub>t</sub></i>) can guide odor source localization, yet the neural representation of <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> has not been studied in vertebrates. <b>We have found that, in the mouse olfactory bulb, a subset of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells represents <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, enhancing the contrast between different concentrations.</b> These concentration change responses are direction selective: they respond either to increments or decrements of concentration, reminiscent of ON and OFF selectivity in the retina. This contrast enhancement scales with the magnitude, but not the duration of the concentration step. Further, <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> can be read out from the total spike count per sniff, unlike odor identity and intensity, which are represented by fast temporal spike patterns. Our results demonstrate that a subset of M/T cells represents <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, providing a signal that may instruct navigational decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.</p><p><b>Significance</b> As an animal tracks an odor plume, concentration changes over time. Here we show that olfactory bulb neurons explicitly represent concentration changes between consecutive inhalations. This response property enhances temporal contrast, as in other sensory systems. Fine temporal spike patterns do not improve concentration change decoding. These signals may guide olfactory navigation in the natural environment.</p>

Abstract<p>Development of the nervous system relies on a balance between axon and dendrite growth and subsequent pruning and degeneration. The developmental degeneration of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory axons has been well studied in part because it can be readily modeled by removing the trophic support by nerve growth factor (NGF) <i>in vitro</i>. We have recently reported that axonal fragmentation induced by NGF withdrawal is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and here we address the mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry required for developmental axon degeneration of mouse embryonic DRG neurons. Our results show that the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid family member 1 (TRPV1) cation channel plays a critical role mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in DRG axons withdrawn from NGF. We further demonstrate that TRPV1 activation is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that is driven through protein kinase C (PKC) and NADPH oxidase (NOX) -dependent pathways that become active upon NGF withdrawal. These findings demonstrate novel mechanistic links between NGF deprivation, PKC activation, ROS generation and TRPV1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in sensory axon degeneration.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neurons are equipped with the genetic means to degenerate, and a subset of peripheral neurons normally degenerate during embryonic development to establish a mature pattern. This beneficial neurodegeneration is regulated by signaling pathways that are only partially understood, yet share components with pathways that mediate pathological degeneration of crucial neural structures during adult diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Here, we identify TRPV1 as a key regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into axoplasm that is required for developmental degeneration modeled by NGF withdrawal from sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion <i>in vitro.</i> Crucially, we report that the TRPV1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux is prompted by a signaling axis comprised of PKC-dependent NOX complex activation and ROS generation upstream of TRPV1.</p>

Abstract<p>Low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) that express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 are thought to signal affective touch, and may also play a role in mechanical allodynia. However, the nature of the central termination of C-LTMRs in the dorsal horn remains largely unexplored. Here we used light and electron microscopy in combination with VGLUT3 immunolabeling as a marker of C-LTMR terminations to investigate this issue. VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMRs formed central terminals of type II glomeruli in the inner part of lamina II of the dorsal horn, often establishing multiple asymmetric synapses with postsynaptic dendrites but also participating in synaptic configurations with presynaptic axons and dendrites. Unexpectedly, essentially all VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals showed substantial VGLUT1 expression in the rat, whereas such terminals in mice lacked VGLUT1. Most VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals exhibited weak-to-moderate VGLUT2 expression. Further, C-LTMR terminals formed numerous synapses with excitatory protein kinase C interneurons and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons, whereas synapses with calretinin neurons were scarce. C-LTMR terminals rarely if ever established synapses with neurokinin 1 receptor-possessing dendrites traversing lamina II. Thus, VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals appear to largely correspond to neurofilament-lacking central terminals of type II glomeruli in inner lamina II and can thus be identified at the ultrastructural level by morphological criteria. The participation of C-LTMR terminals in type II glomeruli involving diverse populations of interneuron indicates highly complex modes of integration of C-LTMR mediated signaling in the dorsal horn. Furthermore, differences in VGLUT1 expression indicate distinct species differences in synaptic physiology of C-LTMR terminals.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Here we show that low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) form central terminals of a certain class of synaptic glomeruli, where they are subject to presynaptic inhibition and establish synapses onto distinct populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. These results prompt a revised interpretation of dorsal horn ultrastructure, and provide a basis for ultrastructural identification of C-LTMRs in future studies of the role of these fibers in somatosensation. Furthermore, our observations indicate that C-LTMR terminations are subject to complex regulation and are well-positioned to participate in integration of afferent signals that lead to percepts of affective touch and pain.</p>

<p>Extracting and detecting spike activities from the fluorescence observations
is an important step in understanding how neuron systems work. The main
challenge lies in that the combination of the ambient noise with dynamic
baseline fluctuation, often contaminates the observations, thereby
deteriorating the reliability of spike detection. This may be even worse in the
face of the nonlinear biological process, the coupling interactions between
spikes and baseline, and the unknown critical parameters of an underlying
physiological model, in which erroneous estimations of parameters will affect
the detection of spikes causing further error propagation. In this paper, we
propose a random finite set (RFS) based Bayesian approach. The dynamic
behaviors of spike sequence, fluctuated baseline and unknown parameters are
formulated as one RFS. This RFS state is capable of distinguishing the hidden
active/silent states induced by spike and non-spike activities respectively,
thereby \emph{negating the interaction role} played by spikes and other
factors. Then, premised on the RFS states, a Bayesian inference scheme is
designed to simultaneously estimate the model parameters, baseline, and crucial
spike activities. Our results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can gain an
extra $12\%$ detection accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art MLSpike
method.

<p>Process-oriented theories of cognition must be evaluated against time-ordered
observations. Here we present a representative example for data assimilation of
the SWIFT model, a dynamical model of the control of spatial fixation position
and fixation duration during reading. First, we develop and test an approximate
likelihood function of the model, which is a combination of a pseudo-marginal
spatial likelihood and an approximate temporal likelihood function. Second, we
use a Bayesian approach to parameter inference using an adapative Markov chain
Monte Carlo procedure. Our results indicate that model parameters can be
estimated reliably for individual subjects. We conclude that approximative
Bayesian inference represents a considerable step forward for the area of
eye-movement modeling, where modelling of individual data on the basis of
process-based dynamic models has not been possible before.

<p>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has a unique role in memory retrieval:
fMRI and electrocorticography studies suggest that within the ventral PPC (VPC)
specifically, there is an anterior-posterior functional divergence between
externally-oriented and internally-oriented attention to memory (AtoM).
However, the role of VPC during verbal episodic encoding, and the relationship
between encoding- and retrieval-related activity, is less understood. Here we
show that activation within a subregion of VPC is doubly dissociated between
its anterior and posterior parts, during encoding compared to recall in a free
recall task. We found that regional activation defined by increased high gamma
power and decreased beta power oscillations during encoding and recall
correlated with recall success. During word encoding, iEEG sites that showed
this correlation were located anterior to those that showed deactivation.
Conversely, during word recall, sites that showed stronger correlations between
activity and number of words recalled were located more posteriorly. Our
results demonstrate the significance of high gamma and beta oscillations
suggesting a push-pull relationship between attention to external stimuli and
internal memories within left ventral PPC. Knowledge of this divergence of
function along the anterior-posterior axis within left ventral PPC may prove
useful for guiding brain stimulation strategies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43482">Temporal identity establishes columnar neuron morphology, connectivity, and function in a <i>Drosophila</i> navigation circuit</a></h4>

The insect central complex (CX) is a conserved brain region containing 60+ neuronal subtypes, several of which contribute to navigation. It is not known how CX neuronal diversity is generated or how developmental origin of subtypes relates to function. We mapped the developmental origin of four key CX subtypes and found that neurons with similar origin have similar axon/dendrite targeting. Moreover, we found that the temporal transcription factor (TTF) Eyeless/Pax6 regulates the development of two recurrently-connected CX subtypes: Eyeless loss simultaneously produces ectopic P-EN neurons with normal axon/dendrite projections, and reduces the number of E-PG neurons. Furthermore, transient loss of Eyeless during development impairs adult flies' capacity to perform celestial navigation. We conclude that neurons with similar developmental origin have similar connectivity, that Eyeless maintains equal E-PG and P-EN neuron number, and that Eyeless is required for the development of circuits that control adult navigation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41043">Emergence of trait variability through the lens of nitrogen assimilation in <i>Prochlorococcus</i></a></h4>

Intraspecific trait variability has important consequences for the function and stability of marine ecosystems. Here we examine variation in the ability to use nitrate across hundreds of <i>Prochlorococcus </i>genomes to better understand the modes of evolution influencing intraspecific allocation of ecologically important functions. Nitrate assimilation genes are absent in basal lineages but occur at an intermediate frequency that is randomly distributed within recently emerged clades. The distribution of nitrate assimilation genes within clades appears largely governed by vertical inheritance, gene loss, and homologous recombination. By mapping this process onto a model of <i>Prochlorococcus'</i> macroevolution, we propose that niche-constructing adaptive radiations and subsequent niche partitioning set the stage for loss of nitrate assimilation genes from basal lineages as they specialized to lower light levels. Retention of these genes in recently emerged lineages has likely been facilitated by selection as they sequentially partitioned into niches where nitrate assimilation conferred a fitness benefit.

<p>by Dimitrije Marković, Andrea M. F. Reiter, Stefan J. Kiebel</p>

In our daily lives timing of our actions plays an essential role when we navigate the complex everyday environment. It is an open question though how the representations of the temporal structure of the world influence our behavior. Here we propose a probabilistic model with an explicit representation of state durations which may provide novel insights in how the brain predicts upcoming changes. We illustrate several properties of the behavioral model using a standard reversal learning design and compare its task performance to standard reinforcement learning models. Furthermore, using experimental data, we demonstrate how the model can be applied to identify participants’ beliefs about the latent temporal task structure. We found that roughly one quarter of participants seem to have learned the latent temporal structure and used it to anticipate changes, whereas the remaining participants’ behavior did not show signs of anticipatory responses, suggesting a lack of precise temporal expectations. We expect that the introduced behavioral model will allow, in future studies, for a systematic investigation of how participants learn the underlying temporal structure of task environments and how these representations shape behavior.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MvC8apYzGP4" width="1" />

The circadian oscillator, an internal time-keeping device found in most organisms, enables timely regulation of daily biological activities by maintaining synchrony with the external environment. The mechanistic basis underlying the adjustment of circadian rhythms to changing external conditions, however, has yet to be clearly elucidated. We explored the mechanism of action of nicotinamide in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, a metabolite that lengthens the period of circadian rhythms, to understand the regulation of circadian period. To identify the key mechanisms involved in the circadian response to nicotinamide, we developed a systematic and practical modeling framework based on the identification and comparison of gene regulatory dynamics. Our mathematical predictions, confirmed by experimentation, identified key transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of circadian period and uncovered the role of blue light in the response of the circadian oscillator to nicotinamide. We suggest that our methodology could be adapted to predict mechanisms of drug action in complex biological systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vbjb0fubKc0" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic modifiers in rare disease have long been suspected to contribute to the considerable variance in disease expression, including Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). To address this question the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium collected a large standardized sample of such rare CMT1A patients over a period of eight years. CMT1A is caused in most patients by a uniformly sized 1.5Mb duplication event involving the gene <i>PMP22</i>.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We genotyped DNA samples from 971 CMT1A patients on Illumina beadchips. Genome‐wide analysis was performed in a subset of 330 of these patients, who expressed the extremes of a hallmark symptom: mild and severe foot dorsiflexion strength impairment. <i>SIPA1L2</i> (signal induced proliferation associated 1 like 2), the top identified candidate modifier gene, was expressed in the peripheral nerve and our functional studies identified and confirmed interacting proteins using co‐immunoprecipitation analysis, mass spectrometry, and immunocytochemistry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and <i>in vitro</i> siRNA experiments were used to analyze gene regulation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified significant association of four SNPs (rs10910527, rs7536385, rs4649265, rs1547740) in <i>SIPA1L2</i> with foot dorsiflexion strength (P &lt; 1×10<sup>‐7</sup>). Co‐immunoprecipitation and mass‐spectroscopy studies identified β‐actin and MYH9 as SIPA1L2 binding partners. Further, we show that <i>SIPA1L2</i> is part of a myelination‐associated co‐expressed network regulated by the master transcription factor SOX10. Importantly, <i>in vitro</i> knock‐down of <i>SIPA1L2</i> in Schwannoma cells lead to a significant reduction of <i>PMP22</i> expression, hinting at a potential strategy for drug development.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>offers a new pathway to therapeutic interventions.</p>

Abstract<p>Hyperthermia-induced febrile seizures (FSs) are the most common seizures during childhood, and prolonged complex FSs can result in the development of epilepsy. Currently, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are used as medications for FSs with the aim of enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity. However, it is still up for debate whether these enhancers of GABAergic neurotransmission could depolarize immature neurons with relatively higher levels of the intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> in the developing brain during FSs. Here, we performed simultaneous video-local field potential (LFP) monitoring to determine whether benzodiazepines and barbiturates affect the phenotypes of FSs in postnatal day 11 (P11) and P14 mice. We found that low-dose administration of diazepam decreased the incidence of clonic seizures at P11. We also found that high-dose administration of diazepam and pentobarbital exacerbated the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of the induction phase of experimental FSs at P11 but not at P14. We further found that the deteriorated phenotypes at P11 were suppressed when Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>2Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), which mediates Cl<sup>-</sup> influx, was blocked by treatment with the diuretic bumetanide. Though our findings do not exclude the involvement of sedation effect of high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators in worsening experimental FSs at P11, pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic signaling could aggravate seizure activity in the early phase of FSs.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Febrile seizures are the most common neurological disorder in children. For the treatment of febrile seizures, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators are generally used and successfully supress seizures in most cases. However, it is still up for debate whether these drugs could depolarize immature neurons in the developing brain. Here, using a mouse model of febrile seizures, we show that high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators exacerbate the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of complex febrile seizures at postnatal day 11 but not at 14. We further found that the Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>2Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter isoform 1 blocker bumetanide suppresses the phenotypes deteriorated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators. Thus, our findings suggest high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators possibly activate immature neurons.</p>

Abstract<p>Prematurity is associated with significantly increased risk of neurobehavioral pathologies, including autism and schizophrenia. A common feature of these psychiatric disorders is prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibitory circuit disruption due to GABAergic interneuron alteration. Cortical interneurons are generated and migrate throughout late gestation and early infancy, making them highly susceptible to perinatal insults such as preterm birth. Term and preterm PFC pathology specimens were assessed using immunohistochemical markers for interneurons. Based on the changes seen, a new preterm encephalopathy mouse model was developed to produce similar PFC interneuron loss. Maternal immune activation (MIA; modeling chorioamnionitis, associated with 85% of extremely preterm births) was combined with chronic sublethal hypoxia (CSH; modeling preterm respiratory failure), with offspring of both sexes assessed anatomically, molecularly and neurobehaviorally. In the PFC examined from the human preterm samples compared to matched term samples at corrected age, a decrease in somatostatin and calbindin interneurons was seen in upper cortical layers. This pattern of interneuron loss in upper cortical layers was mimicked in the mouse PFC following the combination of MIA and CSH, but not after either insult alone. This persistent interneuron loss is associated with postnatal microglial activation that occurs during CSH only after MIA. The combined insults lead to long-term neurobehavioral deficits which parallel human psychopathologies that may be seen after extremely preterm birth. This new preclinical model supports a paradigm in which specific cellular alterations seen in preterm encephalopathy can be linked with a risk of neuropsychiatric sequela. Specific interneuron subtypes may provide therapeutic targets to prevent or ameliorate these neurodevelopmental risks.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Growing evidence suggests that a common component of psychiatric disorders is damage to inhibitory neurons. In the frontal lobe, these neurons continue to develop during late gestation and infancy, predisposing preterm survivors to neurobehavioral disorders and/or cognitive impairment. Preventing neuronal damage depends on having accurate models of preterm brain injury with well-defined outcome measures that can be examined in both small animals and humans. In this study, interneuron number were assessed in term and preterm human frontal brain tissues and in a novel multifactorial model that combines prenatal inflammation with postnatal hypoxia resulting in long-term inhibitory neuron loss. This new model was validated through anatomical and functional assessments that directly translate to human measures.</p>

Abstract<p>Ferroptotic death is a mechanism for tumor suppression by pharmacological inhibitors that target the X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter (cystine/glutamate antiporter) in a host of non-CNS and CNS tumors. Inhibition of this transporter leads to reduction of cystine uptake, cyst(e)ine deprivation, subsequent depletion of the versatile antioxidant glutathione, and reactive lipid species dependent death. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors of the X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter can also induce neuronal cell death raising concerns about toxicity in the CNS and PNS if these agents are used for chemotherapy. Here, we show that ferroptotic death induced by the canonical ferroptosis inducer erastin is similar in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and primary cortical neurons although cell death is mediated more potently in cancer cells. Reducing the toxicity of ferroptosis inducers will require, among other things, the identification of agents that protect neurons from ferroptosis but exacerbate it in tumor cells. While we show that a number of agents known to block ferroptosis in primary mouse neurons also inhibit ferroptosis in fibrosarcoma cells, class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors selectively protect neurons while augmenting ferroptosis in cancer cells. Our results further suggest that cell death pathways induced by erastin in these two cell types is statistically identical to each other and identical to oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons, where death is also mediated via inhibition of X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> cystine transport. Together, these studies identify HDACs inhibitors as a novel class of agents to augment tumor suppression by ferroptosis induction and to minimize neuronal toxicity that could manifest as peripheral neuropathy or chemo brain.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> A major challenge in cancer chemotherapy is to effectively kill tumor cells while preserving healthy issue. The nervous system is particularly vulnerable to side effects by anti-cancer agents. Agents that induce a recently identified type of cell death, called ferroptosis, are widely being considered for cancer treatment. However, precise understanding of how ferroptosis induction in cancer cells may simultaneously thwart function or viability of post-mitotic neurons is essential in defining the efficacy and toxicity of these agents. We show that mechanisms of ferroptotic cell death in cancer cells are similar to those in neurons. We leverage prior studies of ferroptosis in neurons to identify histone deacetylase inhibitors as agents that enhance chemotherapy-induced ferroptosis of tumors while inhibiting ferroptosis in neurons.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0198-18.2019v1?rss=1">A cellular mechanism underlying enhanced capability for complex olfactory discrimination learning</a></h4>

ABSTRACT<p>The biological mechanisms underlying complex forms of learning requiring the understanding of rules based on previous experience are yet unknown. Previous studies raise the intriguing possibility that improvement in complex learning tasks requires the long-term modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability, induced by reducing the conductance of the slow calcium-dependent potassium current (sI<sub>AHP</sub>) simultaneously in most neurons in the relevant neuronal networks in several key brain areas. Such sI<sub>AHP</sub> reduction is expressed in attenuation of the post-burst after-hyperpolarization (AHP) potential, and thus in enhanced repetitive action potential firing.</p><p>Using complex olfactory-discrimination (OD) learning as a model for complex learning, we show that brief activation of the GluK2 subtype glutamate receptor results in long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability in neurons from controls, but not from trained rats. Such an effect can be obtained by a brief tetanic synaptic stimulation or by direct application of kainate, both of which reduce the post-burst AHP in pyramidal neurons. Induction of long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability is mediated via a metabotropic process that requires PKC and ERK activation.</p><p>Intrinsic neuronal excitability cannot be modulated by synaptic activation in neurons from GluK2 knockout mice. Accordingly, these mice are incapable of learning the complex OD task. Moreover, viral-induced overexpression of Gluk2 in piriform cortex pyramidal neurons results in remarkable enhancement of complex OD learning. Thus, signaling via kainate receptors has a central functional role in higher cognitive abilities.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study we describe the molecular and cellular mechanism for complex learning.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that complex learning is accompanied by enhanced intrinsic neuronal excitability, induced by reducing the conductance of a slow potassium current in most neurons in the relevant brain areas.</p><p>Using complex olfactory-discrimination (OD) learning we show that the kainate GluK2 subtype glutamate receptor is necessary and sufficient for complex learning. Intrinsic neuronal excitability cannot be modulated in neurons from GluK2 knockout mice. Accordingly, these mice are incapable of learning the complex task. Moreover, viral-induced overexpression of Gluk2 in piriform cortex pyramidal neurons enhances complex learning remarkably.</p><p>Thus, post-synaptic activation of GluK2 receptors has a central functional role in higher cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Swathi Ayloo, Chenghua Gu</p><div><p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a functional interface separating the brain from the circulatory system and is essential for homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB regulates molecular flux to maintain an optimal environment for neuronal function and protects the brain from toxins and pathogens. Endothelial cells forming the walls of CNS blood vessels constitute the BBB. CNS endothelial cells exhibit two features that underlie the restrictive properties of the BBB: specialized tight junctions that prevent paracellular passage between the blood and the brain, and unusually low levels of vesicle trafficking that limit transcellular transport or transcytosis. While the prevailing view in the field was that specialized tight junctions contributed to CNS barrier properties, recent findings have revealed the importance of maintaining low rates of transcytosis at the BBB. It is now clear that suppression of transcytosis at the BBB is an active process and CNS-specific genetic programs inhibit this pathway to maintain a functional barrier.</p></div>

<p>The NEURON simulator has been developed over the past three decades and is
widely used by neuroscientists to model the electrical activity of neuronal
networks. Large network simulation projects using NEURON have supercomputer
allocations that individually measure in the millions of core hours.
Supercomputer centers are transitioning to next generation architectures and
the work accomplished per core hour for these simulations could be improved by
an order of magnitude if NEURON was able to better utilize those new hardware
capabilities. In order to adapt NEURON to evolving computer architectures, the
compute engine of the NEURON simulator has been extracted and has been
optimized as a library called CoreNEURON. This paper presents the design,
implementation and optimizations of CoreNEURON. We describe how CoreNEURON can
be used as a library with NEURON and then compare performance of different
network models on multiple architectures including IBM BlueGene/Q, Intel
Skylake, Intel MIC and NVIDIA GPU. We show how CoreNEURON can simulate existing
NEURON network models with 4-7x less memory usage and 2-7x less execution time
while maintaining binary result compatibility with NEURON.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10962">A morphospace framework to assess cognitive flexibility based on brain functional networks. (arXiv:1901.10962v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Unfolding how the brain functionally shifts within the cognitive space
remains an unresolved question. From a brain connectivity perspective, there
exist two main concepts: cognitive shifts and cognitive flexibility. Although
the former is the proxy of the latter, the biggest challenge, in terms of
bridging these two concepts, lies in the fact that cognitive shifts are
governed by topological rules whereas cognitive flexibility is purely
numerical. In this paper, we bridge the aforementioned concepts while
preserving the complexity of cognition by proposing a formalism based on a 2D
network morphospace that quantifies trapping and exit characteristics of
network subsystems, naturally interpreted as functional communities. We show
that the constructed measurements reflect the emergent phenomenon of
higher-order cognitive states in addition to being able to quantify cognitive
flexibility, as a direct output. Leveraging this analytic framework, cognitive
shifts among traversedly integrated/segregated states of cognition are shown to
be projected from subject specific cognitive signatures. The evidence of
individual fingerprint emerged from cognitive flexibility domain legitimizes
the quest to explore the intrinsic relationship between flexibility of
functional networks and behavioral measures, including fluid intelligence. The
constructed multi-linear models using flexibility descriptors demonstrate an
above chance level of specificity. Finally, through the associations between
behavioral measures and flexibility theory, we found that frontoparietal (FP)
activation level, expressed through FP preconfiguration, and default mode
network (DMN) efficiency, expressed through DMN preconfiguration, are
positively correlated with all behavioral measures.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42722">Visualization of currents in neural models with similar behavior and different conductance densities</a></h4>

Conductance-based models of neural activity produce large amounts of data that can be hard to visualize and interpret. We introduce visualization methods to display the dynamics of the ionic currents and to display the models' response to perturbations. To visualize the currents' dynamics we compute the percent contribution of each current and display them over time using stacked-area plots. The waveform of the membrane potential and the contribution of each current change as the models are perturbed. To represent these changes over a range of the perturbation control parameter, we compute and display the distributions of these waveforms. We illustrate these procedures in six examples of bursting model neurons with similar activity but that differ as much as 3-fold in their conductance densities. These visualization methods provide heuristic insight into why individual neurons or networks with similar behavior can respond widely differently to perturbations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41250">Quantitative uniqueness of human brain evolution revealed through phylogenetic comparative analysis</a></h4>

While the human brain is clearly large relative to body size, less is known about the timing of brain and brain component expansion within primates and the relative magnitude of volumetric increases. Using Bayesian phylogenetic comparative methods and data for both extant and fossil species, we identified that a distinct shift in brain-body scaling occurred as hominins diverged from other primates, and again as humans and Neanderthals diverged from other hominins. Within hominins, we detected a pattern of directional and accelerating evolution towards larger brains, consistent with a positive feedback process in the evolution of the human brain. Contrary to widespread assumptions, we found that the human neocortex is not exceptionally large relative to other brain structures. Instead, our analyses revealed a single increase in relative neocortex volume at the origin of haplorrhines, and an increase in relative cerebellar volume in apes.

Bacterial metabolism is fundamental to survival and pathogenesis. We explore how <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> utilises amino acids as nitrogen sources, using a combination of bacterial physiology and stable isotope tracing coupled to mass spectrometry metabolomics methods. Our results define core properties of the nitrogen metabolic network from <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, such as: (i) the lack of homeostatic control of certain amino acid pool sizes; (ii) similar rates of utilisation of different amino acids as sole nitrogen sources; (iii) improved nitrogen utilisation from amino acids compared to ammonium; and (iv) co-metabolism of nitrogen sources. Finally, we discover that alanine dehydrogenase is involved in ammonium assimilation in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, in addition to its essential role in alanine utilisation as a nitrogen source. This study represents the first in-depth analysis of nitrogen source utilisation by <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and reveals a flexible metabolic network with characteristics that are likely a product of evolution in the human host.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39065">Anillin regulates epithelial cell mechanics by structuring the medial-apical actomyosin network</a></h4>

Cellular forces sculpt organisms during development, while misregulation of cellular mechanics can promote disease. Here, we investigate how the actomyosin scaffold protein Anillin contributes to epithelial mechanics in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> embryos. Increased mechanosensitive recruitment of Vinculin to cell-cell junctions when Anillin is overexpressed, suggested that Anillin promotes junctional tension. However, junctional laser ablation unexpectedly showed that junctions recoil faster when Anillin is depleted and slower when Anillin is overexpressed. Unifying these findings, we demonstrate that Anillin regulates medial-apical actomyosin. Medial-apical laser ablation supports the conclusion that that tensile forces are stored across the apical surface of epithelial cells, and Anillin promotes the tensile forces stored in this network. Finally, we show that Anillin's effects on cellular mechanics impact tissue-wide mechanics. These results reveal Anillin as a key regulator of epithelial mechanics and lay the groundwork for future studies on how Anillin may contribute to mechanical events in development and disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38070">Generative modeling of multi-mapping reads with mHi-C advances analysis of Hi-C studies</a></h4>

Current Hi-C analysis approaches are unable to account for reads that align to multiple locations, and hence underestimate biological signal from repetitive regions of genomes. We developed and validated mHi-C, a multi-read mapping strategy to probabilistically allocate Hi-C multi-reads. mHi-C exhibited superior performance over utilizing only uni-reads and heuristic approaches aimed at rescuing multi-reads on benchmarks. Specifically, mHi-C increased the sequencing depth by an average of 20% resulting in higher reproducibility of contact matrices and detected interactions across biological replicates. The impact of the multi-reads on the detection of significant interactions is influenced marginally by the relative contribution of multi-reads to the sequencing depth compared to uni-reads, cis-to-trans ratio of contacts, and the broad data quality as reflected by the proportion of mappable reads of datasets. Computational experiments highlighted that in Hi-C studies with short read lengths, mHi-C rescued multi-reads can emulate the effect of longer reads. mHi-C also revealed biologically supported <i>bona fide </i>promoter-enhancer interactions and topologically associating domains involving repetitive genomic regions, thereby unlocking a previously masked portion of the genome for conformation capture studies.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The neural substrates of intelligence represent a fundamental but largely uncharted topic in human developmental neuroscience. Prior neuroimaging studies have identified modest but highly dynamic associations between intelligence and cortical thickness (CT) in childhood and adolescence. In a separate thread of research, quantitative genetic studies have repeatedly demonstrated that most measures of intelligence are highly heritable, as are many brain regions associated with intelligence. In the current study, we integrate these 2 streams of prior work by examining the genetic contributions to CT–intelligence relationships using a genetically informative longitudinal sample of 813 typically developing youth, imaged with high-resolution MRI and assessed with Wechsler Intelligence Scales (IQ). In addition to replicating the phenotypic association between multimodal association cortex and language centers with IQ, we find that CT–IQ covariance is nearly entirely genetically mediated. Moreover, shared genetic factors drive the rapidly evolving landscape of CT–IQ relationships in the developing brain.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In early blind individuals, brain activation by a variety of nonperceptual cognitive tasks extends to the visual cortex, while in the sighted it is restricted to supramodal association areas. We hypothesized that such activation results from the integration of different sectors of the visual cortex into typical task-dependent networks. We tested this hypothesis with fMRI in blind and sighted subjects using tasks assessing speech comprehension, incidental long-term memory and both verbal and nonverbal executive control, in addition to collecting resting-state data. All tasks activated the visual cortex in blind relative to sighted subjects, which enabled its segmentation according to task sensitivity. We then assessed the unique brain-scale functional connectivity of the segmented areas during resting state. Language-related seeds were preferentially connected to frontal and temporal language areas; the seed derived from the executive task was connected to the right dorsal frontoparietal executive network; and the memory-related seed was uniquely connected to mesial frontoparietal areas involved in episodic memory retrieval. Thus, using a broad set of language, executive, and memory tasks in the same subjects, combined with resting state connectivity, we demonstrate the selective integration of different patches of the visual cortex into brain-scale networks with distinct localization, lateralization, and functional roles.</span>

Patch-clamp recordings taken from acute brain slices revealed that Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels in CeM are inhibited by prototypical volatile anesthetic ISO (250 and 500 μM) and selective T-channels blocker 3,5-dichloro-<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>-[1-(2,2-dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide (TTA-P2). Both TTA-P2 and ISO attenuated tonic and burst firing modes, and hyperpolarized CeM neurons from wild type (WT) mice. These effects were greatly diminished or abolished in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 null mice. Our ensuing in vivo local field potential (LFP) recordings from CeM indicated that the ability of TTA-P2 and anesthetic concentrations of ISO to promote δ oscillation was substantially weakened in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 null mice. Furthermore, escalating ISO concentrations induced stronger burst-suppression LFP pattern in mutant than in WT mice. Our results demonstrate for the first time the importance of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels in thalamocortical oscillations from the non-specific thalamic nuclei that underlie clinically important effects of ISO.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In Parkinson’s disease, the degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons is consistently associated with modified metabolic activity in the cerebellum. Here we examined the functional reorganization taking place in the cerebello–cerebral circuit in a murine model of Parkinson’s disease with 6-OHDA lesion of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Cerebellar optogenetic stimulations evoked similar movements in control and lesioned mice, suggesting a normal coupling of cerebellum to the motor effectors after the lesion. In freely moving animals, the firing rate in the primary motor cortex was decreased after the lesion, while cerebellar nuclei neurons showed an increased firing rate. This increase may result from reduced inhibitory Purkinje cells inputs, since a population of slow and irregular Purkinje cells was observed in the cerebellar hemispheres of lesioned animals. Moreover, cerebellar stimulations generated smaller electrocortical responses in the motor cortex of lesioned animals suggesting a weaker cerebello–cerebral coupling. Overall these results indicate the presence of functional changes in the cerebello–cerebral circuit, but their ability to correct cortical dysfunction may be limited due to functional uncoupling between the cerebellum and cerebral cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A consensus on the number of morphologically different types of pyramidal cells (PCs) in the neocortex has not yet been reached, despite over a century of anatomical studies, due to the lack of agreement on the subjective classifications of neuron types, which is based on expert analyses of neuronal morphologies. Even for neurons that are visually distinguishable, there is no common ground to consistently define morphological types. The objective classification of PCs can be achieved with methods from algebraic topology, and the dendritic arborization is sufficient for the reliable identification of distinct types of cortical PCs. Therefore, we objectively identify 17 types of PCs in the rat somatosensory cortex. In addition, we provide a solution to the challenging problem of whether 2 similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The mammalian cerebral cortex is divided into different areas according to their function and pattern of connections. Studies comparing primary visual (V1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of primates have demonstrated striking pyramidal neuron (PN) specialization not present in comparable areas of the mouse neocortex. To better understand PFC evolution and regional PN specialization, we studied the tree shrew, a species with a close phylogenetic relationship to primates. We defined the tree shrew PFC based on cytoarchitectonic borders, thalamic connectivity and characterized the morphology and electrophysiology of layer II/III PNs in V1 and PFC. Similar to primates, the PFC PNs in the tree shrew fire with a regular spiking pattern and have larger dendritic tree and spines than those in V1. However, V1 PNs showed strikingly large basal dendritic arbors with high spine density, firing at higher rates and in a more varied pattern than PFC PNs. Yet, unlike in the mouse and unreported in the primate, medial prefrontal PN are more easily recruited than either the dorsolateral or V1 neurons. This specialization of PN morphology and physiology is likely to be a significant factor in the evolution of cortex, contributing to differences in the computational capacities of individual cortical areas.</span>

The multifaceted functions of the brain are borne through seemingly infinite spatiotemporal interactions between its resident neural elements. Using a combinatorial approach, Schuman and colleagues (J. Neurosci. 2018;39:125–139) recently identify four layer 1 cortical interneuron subtypes, including a hitherto uncharacterized neuron they term the ‘canopy’ cell. Properties unique to each of the subtypes likely endow them with distinct roles in top-down processing.

<p>by Itay Katzir, Murat Cokol, Bree B. Aldridge, Uri Alon</p>

Drug combinations are a promising approach to achieve high efficacy at low doses and to overcome resistance. Drug combinations are especially useful when drugs cannot achieve effectiveness at tolerable doses, as occurs in cancer and tuberculosis (TB). However, discovery of effective drug combinations faces the challenge of combinatorial explosion, in which the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the number of drugs and doses. A recent advance, called the dose model, uses a mathematical formula to overcome combinatorial explosion by reducing the problem to a feasible quadratic one: using data on drug pairs at a few doses, the dose model accurately predicts the effect of combinations of three and four drugs at all doses. The dose model has not yet been tested on higher-order combinations beyond four drugs. To address this, we measured the effect of combinations of up to ten antibiotics on <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> growth, and of up to five tuberculosis (TB) drugs on the growth of <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>. We find that the dose model accurately predicts the effect of these higher-order combinations, including cases of strong synergy and antagonism. This study supports the view that the interactions between drug pairs carries key information that largely determines higher-order interactions. Therefore, systematic study of pairwise drug interactions is a compelling strategy to prioritize drug regimens in high-dimensional spaces.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HjJA1n5znGo" width="1" />

<p>by Sulav Duwal, Laura Dickinson, Saye Khoo, Max von Kleist</p>

Currently, there is no effective vaccine to halt HIV transmission. However, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the drug combination Truvada can substantially decrease HIV transmission in individuals at risk. Despite its benefits, Truvada-based PrEP is expensive and needs to be taken once-daily, which often leads to inadequate adherence and incomplete protection. These deficits may be overcome by next-generation PrEP regimen, including currently investigated long-acting formulations, or patent-expired drugs. However, poor translatability of animal- and <i>ex vivo</i>/<i>in vitro</i> experiments, and the necessity to conduct long-term (several years) human trials involving considerable sample sizes (N&gt;1000 individuals) are major obstacles to rationalize drug-candidate selection. We developed a prophylaxis modelling tool that mechanistically considers the mode-of-action of all available drugs. We used the tool to screen antivirals for their prophylactic utility and identify lower bound effective concentrations that can guide dose selection in PrEP trials. While <i>in vitro</i> measurable drug potency usually guides PrEP trial design, we found that it may over-predict PrEP potency for all drug classes except reverse transcriptase inhibitors. While most drugs displayed graded concentration-prophylaxis profiles, protease inhibitors tended to switch between none- and complete protection. While several treatment-approved drugs could be ruled out as PrEP candidates based on lack-of-prophylactic efficacy, darunavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine and rilpivirine could more potently prevent infection than existing PrEP regimen (Truvada). Notably, some drugs from this candidate set are patent-expired and currently neglected for PrEP repurposing. A next step is to further trim this candidate set by ruling out compounds with ominous safety profiles, to assess different administration schemes in silico and to test the remaining candidates in human trials.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WUqKyesJwDU" width="1" />

Gut microbiota and human relationships are strictly connected to each other. What we eat reflects our body-mind connection and synchronizes with people around us. However, how this impacts on gut microbiota and, conversely, how gut bacteria influence our dietary behaviors has not been explored yet. To quantify the complex dynamics of this interplay between gut and human behaviors we explore the “gut-human behavior axis” and its evolutionary dynamics in a real-world scenario represented by the social multiplex network. We consider a dual type of similarity, homophily and gut similarity, other than psychological and unconscious biases. We analyze the dynamics of social and gut microbial communities, quantifying the impact of human behaviors on diets and gut microbial composition and, backwards, through a control mechanism. Meal timing mechanisms and “chrono-nutrition” play a crucial role in feeding behaviors, along with the quality and quantity of food intake. Considering a population of shift workers, we explore the dynamic interplay between their eating behaviors and gut microbiota, modeling the social dynamics of chrono-nutrition in a multiplex network. Our findings allow us to quantify the relation between human behaviors and gut microbiota through the methodological introduction of gut metabolic modeling and statistical estimators, able to capture their dynamic interplay. Moreover, we find that the timing of gut microbial communities is slower than social interactions and shift-working, and the impact of shift-working on the dynamics of chrono-nutrition is a fluctuation of strategies with a major propensity for defection (e.g. high-fat meals). A deeper understanding of the relation between gut microbiota and the dietary behavioral patterns, by embedding also the related social aspects, allows improving the overall knowledge about metabolic models and their implications for human health, opening the possibility to design promising social therapeutic dietary interventions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JTUsq9HYq3M" width="1" />

<p>by Jordan J. Clark, Mark L. Benson, Richard D. Smith, Heather A. Carlson</p>

Understanding how ligand binding influences protein flexibility is important, especially in rational drug design. Protein flexibility upon ligand binding is analyzed herein using 305 proteins with 2369 crystal structures with ligands (holo) and 1679 without (apo). Each protein has at least two apo and two holo structures for analysis. The inherent variation in structures with and without ligands is first established as a baseline. This baseline is then compared to the change in conformation in going from the apo to holo states to probe induced flexibility. The inherent backbone flexibility across the apo structures is roughly the same as the variation across holo structures. The induced backbone flexibility across apo-holo pairs is larger than that of the apo or holo states, but the increase in RMSD is less than 0.5Å. Analysis of χ<sub>1</sub> angles revealed a distinctly different pattern with significant influences seen for ligand binding on side-chain conformations in the binding site. Within the apo and holo states themselves, the variation of the χ<sub>1</sub> angles is the same. However, the data combining both apo and holo states show significant displacements. Upon ligand binding, χ<sub>1</sub> angles are frequently pushed to new orientations outside the range seen in the apo states. Influences on binding site variation could not be easily attributed to features such as ligand size or x-ray structure resolution. By combining these findings, we find that most binding site flexibility is compatible with the common practice in flexible docking, where backbones are kept rigid and side chains are allowed some degree of flexibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gUvhEfpxopQ" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0393-18.2019v1?rss=1">Modes of accessing bicarbonate for the regulation of membrane guanylate cyclase (ROS-GC) in retinal rods and cones</a></h4>

ABSTRACT<p>The membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, that synthesizes cyclic GMP for use as a second messenger for visual transduction in retinal rods and cones, is stimulated by bicarbonate. Bicarbonate acts directly on ROS-GC1, because it enhanced the enzymatic activity of a purified, recombinant fragment of bovine ROS-GC1 consisting solely of the core catalytic domain. Moreover, recombinant ROS-GC1 proved to be a true sensor of bicarbonate, rather than a sensor for CO<sub>2</sub>. Access to bicarbonate differed in rods and cones of larval salamander, <i>Ambystoma tigrinum</i>, of unknown sex. In rods, bicarbonate entered at the synapse and diffused to the outer segment, where it was removed by Cl<sup>-</sup> dependent exchange. In contrast, cones generated bicarbonate internally from endogenous CO<sub>2</sub> or from exogenous CO<sub>2</sub> that was present in extracellular solutions of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate production from both sources of CO<sub>2</sub> was blocked by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide. Carbonic anhydrase II expression was verified immunohistochemically in cones but not in rods. In addition, cones acquired bicarbonate at their outer segments as well as at their inner segments. The multiple pathways for access in cones may support greater uptake of bicarbonate than in rods and buffer changes in its intracellular concentration.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bicarbonate accentuates the role of the membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, in phototransduction. In current research, bicarbonate rather than gaseous CO<sub>2</sub> is proven to be the ligand for ROS-GCs. Bicarbonate may be preferred because its movements are subject to tighter control. In rods, membrane impermeant bicarbonate gains entry at the synaptic zone and is cleared by Cl<sup>-</sup>-dependent exchange at the outer segment. A novel insight is that while cones are similar, they also obtain bicarbonate at their outer segments and express an enzyme for making their own bicarbonate from endogenous together with exogenous CO<sub>2</sub>. Multiple pathways for access in cones indicate a need for greater uptake of bicarbonate and better buffering of its intracellular concentration than in rods.</p>

Abstract<p>The inter-regional connectivity of sensory structures in the brain allows for the modulation of sensory processing in manners important for perception. In the olfactory system, odor representations in the olfactory bulb (OB) are modulated by feedback centrifugal innervation from several olfactory cortices, including the piriform cortex and anterior olfactory nucleus. Previous studies reported that an additional olfactory cortex, the olfactory tubercle, also centrifugally innervates the OB and may even shape the activity of OB output neurons. In an attempt to identify the cell-types of this centrifugal innervation, we performed retrograde tracing experiments in mice utilizing three unique strategies, including retrobeads, retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV) driving a fluorescent reporter, and retrograde AAV driving Cre-expression in the Ai9 floxed transgenic reporter line. Our results replicated the standing literature and uncovered robustly labeled neurons in the ipsilateral piriform cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, and numerous other structures known to innervate the OB. Surprisingly, consistent throughout all of our approaches, no labeled soma were observed in the olfactory tubercle. These findings indicate that the olfactory tubercle is unique among other olfactory cortices in that it does not innervate the OB, which refines our understanding of the centrifugal modulation of the OB.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The perception of our environment relies upon the distribution of sensory information throughout brain regions. This is true in the olfactory system wherein projections between olfactory centers, including feedback centrifugal input to the olfactory bulb, provide the basis for olfactory perception. Here, we show that one olfactory cortical structure, the olfactory tubercle, is unique among olfactory cortices in that it lacks feedback projections to the olfactory bulb. This ‘negative result’ is important in that it refines current models for the circuitry of our olfactory system and challenges previous literature reporting such a pathway in fact exists.</p>

<p>Alcohol abuse leads to aberrant forms of emotionally salient memory, i.e., limbic memory, that promote escalated alcohol consumption and relapse. Accordingly, activity-dependent structural abnormalities are likely to contribute to synaptic dysfunctions that occur from suddenly ceasing chronic alcohol consumption. Here we show that alcohol-dependent male rats fail to perform an emotional-learning task during abstinence but recover their functioning by l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanin (l-DOPA) administration during early withdrawal. l-DOPA also reverses the selective loss of dendritic "long thin" spines observed in medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell of alcohol-dependent rats during abstinence, as well as the reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining and postsynaptic density-95-positive elements. Patch-clamp experiments in NAc slices reveal that both <i>in vivo</i> systemic l-DOPA administration and <i>in vitro</i> exposure to dopamine can restore the loss of long-term depression (LTD) formation, counteract the reduction in NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents and rectify the altered NMDAR/AMPAR ratio observed in alcohol-withdrawn rats. Further, <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis experiments show that blunted dopaminergic signaling is revived after l-DOPA treatment during early withdrawal. These results suggest a key role of an efficient dopamine signaling for maintaining, and restore, neural trophism, NMDA-dependent LTD, and ultimately optimal learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Blunted dopamine signaling and altered glutamate connectivity in the nucleus accumbens represent the neuroanatomical basis for the impairment in aversive limbic memory observed during withdrawal in alcohol dependence. Supplying l-DOPA during withdrawal re-establishes synaptic morphology and functional neuroadaptations, suggesting a complete recovery of nucleus accumbens glutamatergic synaptic plasticity when dopamine is revived. Importantly, restoring dopamine transmission allows those synapses to encode emotionally relevant information and rescue flexibility in the neuronal circuits that process limbic memory formation. Under these conditions, drugs capable of selectively boosting the dopaminergic function during the "fluid" and still responsive state of the early withdrawn maladaptive synapses may help in the treatment of alcohol addiction.</p>

<p>Breast cancer patients using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as an adjuvant therapy often report side effects, including hot flashes, mood changes, and cognitive impairment. Despite long-term use in humans, little is known about the effects of continuous AI administration on the brain and cognition. We used a primate model of human cognitive aging, the common marmoset, to examine the effects of a 4-week daily administration of the AI letrozole (20 μg, p.o.) on cognition, anxiety, thermoregulation, brain estrogen content, and hippocampal pyramidal cell physiology. Letrozole treatment was administered to both male and female marmosets and reduced peripheral levels of estradiol (E2), but unexpectedly increased E2 levels in the hippocampus. Spatial working memory and intrinsic excitability of hippocampal neurons were negatively affected by the treatment possibly due to increased hippocampal E2. While no changes in hypothalamic E2 were observed, thermoregulation was disrupted by letrozole in females only, indicating some impact on hypothalamic activity. These findings suggest adverse effects of AIs on the primate brain and call for new therapies that effectively prevent breast cancer recurrence while minimizing side effects that further compromise quality of life.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are used as an adjuvant therapy for estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer and are associated with side effects, including hot flashes, depression/anxiety, and memory deficits severe enough for many women to discontinue this life-saving treatment. AIs are also used by men, yet sex differences in the reported side effects have not been systematically studied. We show that AI-treated male and female marmosets exhibit behavioral changes consistent with these CNS symptoms, as well as elevated hippocampal estradiol and compromised hippocampal physiology. These findings illustrate the need for (1) a greater understanding of the precise mechanisms by which AIs impact brain function and (2) the development of new treatment approaches for breast cancer patients that minimize adverse effects on the brain.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/5/900?rss=1">Lateralized Suppression of Alpha-Band EEG Activity As a Mechanism of Target Processing</a></h4>

<p>Alpha-band (8–12 Hz) EEG activity has been linked to visual attention since the earliest EEG studies. More recent studies using spatial cuing paradigms have shown that alpha is suppressed over the hemisphere contralateral to a to-be-attended location, suggesting that alpha serves as a mechanism of preparatory attention. Here, we demonstrate that alpha also plays a role in active target processing. EEG activity was recorded from a group of healthy male and female human subjects in two visual search experiments. In addition to alpha activity, we also assessed the N2pc event-related potential component, a lateralized transient EEG response that has been tightly linked with the focusing of attention on visual targets. We found that the visual search targets triggered both an N2pc component and a suppression of alpha-band activity that was greatest over the hemisphere contralateral to the target (which we call "target-elicited lateralized alpha suppression" or TELAS). In Experiment 1, both N2pc and TELAS were observed for targets presented in the lower visual field but were absent for upper-field targets. However, these two lateralized effects had different time courses and they responded differently to manipulations of crowding in Experiment 2. These results indicate that lateralized alpha-band activity is involved in active target processing and is not solely a preparatory mechanism and also that TELAS and N2pc reflect a related but separable neural mechanism of visuospatial attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The very first EEG studies demonstrated that alpha-band (8–12 Hz) EEG oscillations are suppressed when people attend to visual information and more recent research has shown that cuing an individual to expect a target at a specific location produces lateralized suppression in the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, lateralized alpha may serve as a preparatory mechanism. In the present study, we found that a similar lateralized alpha effect is triggered by the appearance of a visual target even though the location could not be anticipated, demonstrating that alpha also serves as an active mechanism of target processing. Moreover, we found that alpha lateralization can be dissociated from other lateralized measures of target selection, indicating that it reflects a distinct mechanism of attention.</p>

<p>Sleep loss is associated with increased obesity risk, as demonstrated by correlations between sleep duration and change in body mass index or body fat percentage. Whereas previous studies linked this weight gain to disturbed endocrine parameters after sleep deprivation or restriction, neuroimaging studies revealed upregulated neural processing of food rewards after sleep loss in reward-processing areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and insula. To address this ongoing debate between hormonal versus hedonic factors underlying sleep-loss-associated weight gain, we rigorously tested the association between sleep deprivation and food cue processing using high-resolution fMRI and assessment of hormones. After taking blood samples from 32 lean, healthy, human male participants, they underwent fMRI while performing a neuroeconomic, value-based decision-making task with snack food and trinket rewards following a full night of habitual sleep and a night of sleep deprivation in a repeated-measures crossover design. We found that des-acyl ghrelin concentrations were increased after sleep deprivation compared with habitual sleep. Despite similar hunger ratings due to fasting in both conditions, participants were willing to spend more money on food items only after sleep deprivation. Furthermore, fMRI data paralleled this behavioral finding, revealing a food-reward-specific upregulation of hypothalamic valuation signals and amygdala–hypothalamic coupling after a single night of sleep deprivation. Behavioral and fMRI results were not significantly correlated with changes in acyl, des-acyl, or total ghrelin concentrations. Our results suggest that increased food valuation after sleep loss might be due to hedonic rather than hormonal mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epidemiological studies suggest an association between overweight and reduced nocturnal sleep, but the relative contributions of hedonic and hormonal factors to overeating after sleep loss are a matter of ongoing controversy. Here, we tested the association between sleep deprivation and food cue processing in a repeated-measures crossover design using fMRI. We found that willingness to pay increased for food items only after sleep deprivation. fMRI data paralleled this behavioral finding, revealing a food-reward-specific upregulation of hypothalamic valuation signals and amygdala-hypothalamic coupling after a single night of sleep deprivation. However, there was no evidence for hormonal modulations of behavioral or fMRI findings. Our results suggest that increased food valuation after sleep loss is due to hedonic rather than hormonal mechanisms.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/5/876?rss=1">Puncta of Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS) Mediate NMDA Receptor Signaling in the Auditory Midbrain</a></h4>

<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a neurotransmitter synthesized in the brain by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Using immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging in the inferior colliculus (IC, auditory midbrain) of the guinea pig (<i>Cavia porcellus</i>, male and female), we show that nNOS occurs in two distinct cellular distributions. We confirm that, in the cortices of the IC, a subset of neurons show cytoplasmic labeling for nNOS, whereas in the central nucleus (ICc), such neurons are not present. However, we demonstrate that all neurons in the ICc do in fact express nNOS in the form of discrete puncta found at the cell membrane. Our multi-labeling studies reveal that nNOS puncta form multiprotein complexes with NMDA receptors, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), and PSD95. These complexes are found apposed to glutamatergic terminals, which is indicative of synaptic function. Interestingly, these glutamatergic terminals express both vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 denoting a specific source of brainstem inputs. With <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings of multiunit activity in the ICc, we found that local application of NMDA enhances sound-driven activity in a concentration-dependent and reversible fashion. This response is abolished by blockade of nNOS or sGC, indicating that the NMDA effect is mediated solely via the NO and cGMP signaling pathway. This discovery of a ubiquitous, but highly localized, expression of nNOS throughout the ICc and demonstration of the dramatic influence of the NMDA activated NO pathway on sound-driven neuronal activity imply a key role for NO signaling in auditory processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), the enzyme that synthesizes nitric oxide (NO), occurs as puncta in apparently all neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICc) in the auditory midbrain. Punctate nNOS appears at glutamatergic synapses in a complex with glutamate NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs), soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC, the NO receptor), and PSD95 (a protein that anchors receptors and enzymes at the postsynaptic density). We show that NMDA-R modulation of sound-driven activity in the ICc is solely mediated by activation of nNOS and sGC. The presence of nNOS throughout this sensory nucleus argues for a major role of NO in hearing. Furthermore, this punctate form of nNOS expression may exist and have gone unnoticed in other brain regions.</p>

<p>New memories are believed to be consolidated over several hours of post-task sleep. The reactivation or "replay" of hippocampal cell assemblies has been proposed to provide a key mechanism for this process. However, previous studies have indicated that such replay is restricted to the first 10–30 min of post-task sleep, suggesting that it has a limited role in memory consolidation. We performed long-duration recordings in sleeping and behaving male rats and applied methods for evaluating the reactivation of neurons in pairs as well as in larger ensembles while controlling for the continued activation of ensembles already present during pre-task sleep ("preplay"). We found that cell assemblies reactivate for up to 10 h, with a half-maximum timescale of ~6 h, in sleep following novel experience, even when corrected for preplay. We further confirmed similarly prolonged reactivation in post-task sleep of rats in other datasets that used behavior in novel environments. In contrast, we saw limited reactivation in sleep following behavior in familiar environments. Overall, our findings reconcile the duration of replay with the timescale attributed to cellular memory consolidation and provide strong support for an integral role of replay in memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons that are active during an experience reactivate again afterward during rest and sleep. This replay of ensembles of neurons has been proposed to help strengthen memories, but it has also been reported that replay occurs only in the first 10–30 min of sleep, suggesting a circumscribed role. We performed long-duration recordings in the hippocampus of rats and found that replay persists for several hours in sleep following novel experience, far beyond the limits found in previous reports based on shorter recordings. These findings reconcile the duration of replay with the hours-long timescales attributed to memory consolidation.</p>

<p>Neurons in the auditory cortex are tuned to specific ranges of sound frequencies. Although the cellular and network mechanisms underlying neuronal sound frequency selectivity are well studied and reflect the interplay of thalamocortical and intracortical excitatory inputs and further refinement by cortical inhibition, the precise synaptic signaling mechanisms remain less understood. To gain further understanding on these mechanisms and their effects on sound-driven behavior, we used <i>in vivo</i> imaging as well as behavioral approaches in awake and behaving female and male mice. We discovered that synaptic zinc, a modulator of neurotransmission and responsiveness to sound, sharpened the sound frequency tuning of principal and parvalbumin-expressing neurons and widened the sound frequency tuning of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary auditory cortex. In the absence of cortical synaptic zinc, mice exhibited reduced acuity for detecting changes in sound frequencies. Together, our results reveal that cell-type-specific effects of zinc contribute to cortical sound frequency tuning and enhance acuity for sound frequency discrimination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal tuning to specific features of sensory stimuli is a fundamental property of cortical sensory processing that advantageously supports behavior. Despite the established roles of synaptic thalamocortical and intracortical excitation and inhibition in cortical tuning, the precise synaptic signaling mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we investigated these mechanisms in the mouse auditory cortex. We discovered a previously unknown signaling mechanism linking synaptic zinc signaling with cell-specific cortical tuning and enhancement in sound frequency discrimination acuity. Given the abundance of synaptic zinc in all sensory cortices, this newly discovered interaction between synaptic zinc and cortical tuning can provide a general mechanism for modulating neuronal stimulus specificity and sensory-driven behavior.</p>

<p>Perceptual decision-making is the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies. Most modeling analyses are based on statistical processes of accumulation of evidence. In contrast, very few works confront attractor network models' predictions with empirical data from continuous sequences of trials. Recently however, numerical simulations of a biophysical competitive attractor network model have shown that such a network can describe sequences of decision trials and reproduce repetition biases observed in perceptual decision experiments. Here we get more insights into such effects by considering an extension of the reduced attractor network model of Wong and Wang (2006), taking into account an inhibitory current delivered to the network once a decision has been made. We make explicit the conditions on this inhibitory input for which the network can perform a succession of trials, without being either trapped in the first reached attractor, or losing all memory of the past dynamics. We study in detail how, during a sequence of decision trials, reaction times and performance depend on nonlinear dynamics of the network, and we confront the model behavior with empirical findings on sequential effects. Here we show that, quite remarkably, the network exhibits, qualitatively and with the correct order of magnitude, post-error slowing and post-error improvement in accuracy, two subtle effects reported in behavioral experiments in the absence of any feedback about the correctness of the decision. Our work thus provides evidence that such effects result from intrinsic properties of the nonlinear neural dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Much experimental and theoretical work is being devoted to the understanding of the neural correlates of perceptual decision-making. In a typical behavioral experiment, animals or humans perform a continuous series of binary discrimination tasks. To model such experiments, we consider a biophysical decision-making attractor neural network, taking into account an inhibitory current delivered to the network once a decision is made. Here we provide evidence that the same intrinsic properties of the nonlinear network dynamics underpins various sequential effects reported in experiments. Quite remarkably, in the absence of feedback on the correctness of the decisions, the network exhibits post-error slowing (longer reaction times after error trials) and post-error improvement in accuracy (smaller error rates after error trials).</p>

<p>Neurons in the murine olfactory epithelium (OE) differ by the olfactory receptor they express as well as other molecular phenotypes that are regionally restricted. These patterns can be precisely regenerated following epithelial injury, suggesting that spatial cues within the tissue can direct neuronal diversification. Nonetheless, the permanency and mechanism of this spatial patterning remain subject to debate. Via transplantation of stem and progenitor cells from dorsal OE into ventral OE, we demonstrate that, in mice of both sexes, nonautonomous spatial cues can direct the spatially circumscribed differentiation of olfactory sensory neurons. The vast majority of dorsal transplant-derived neurons express the ventral marker OCAM (NCAM2) and lose expression of NQO1 to match their new location. Single-cell analysis also demonstrates that OSNs adopt a fate defined by their new position following progenitor cell transplant, such that a ventral olfactory receptor is expressed after stem and progenitor cell engraftment. Thus, spatially constrained differentiation of olfactory sensory neurons is plastic, and any bias toward an epigenetic memory of place can be overcome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spatially restricted differentiation of olfactory sensory neurons is both key to normal olfactory function and a challenging example of biological specificity. That the stem cells of the olfactory epithelium reproduce the organization of the olfactory periphery to a very close approximation during lesion-induced regeneration begs the question of whether stem cell-autonomous genomic architecture or environmental cues are responsible. The plasticity demonstrated after transfer to a novel location suggests that cues external to the transplanted stem and progenitor cells confer neuronal identity. Thus, a necessary prerequisite is satisfied for using engraftment of olfactory stem and progenitor cells as a cellular therapeutic intervention to reinvigorate neurogenesis whose exhaustion contributes to the waning of olfaction with age.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/5/802?rss=1">Chronic Energy Depletion due to Iron Deficiency Impairs Dendritic Mitochondrial Motility during Hippocampal Neuron Development</a></h4>

<p>During development, neurons require highly integrated metabolic machinery to meet the large energy demands of growth, differentiation, and synaptic activity within their complex cellular architecture. Dendrites/axons require anterograde trafficking of mitochondria for local ATP synthesis to support these processes. Acute energy depletion impairs mitochondrial dynamics, but how chronic energy insufficiency affects mitochondrial trafficking and quality control during neuronal development is unknown. Because iron deficiency impairs mitochondrial respiration/ATP production, we treated mixed-sex embryonic mouse hippocampal neuron cultures with the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) to model chronic energetic insufficiency and its effects on mitochondrial dynamics during neuronal development. At 11 days in vitro (DIV), DFO reduced average mitochondrial speed by increasing the pause frequency of individual dendritic mitochondria. Time spent in anterograde motion was reduced; retrograde motion was spared. The average size of moving mitochondria was reduced, and the expression of fusion and fission genes was altered, indicating impaired mitochondrial quality control. Mitochondrial density was not altered, suggesting that respiratory capacity and not location is the key factor for mitochondrial regulation of early dendritic growth/branching. At 18 DIV, the overall density of mitochondria within terminal dendritic branches was reduced in DFO-treated neurons, which may contribute to the long-term deficits in connectivity and synaptic function following early-life iron deficiency. The study provides new insights into the cross-regulation between energy production and dendritic mitochondrial dynamics during neuronal development and may be particularly relevant to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, many of which are characterized by impaired brain iron homeostasis, energy metabolism and mitochondrial trafficking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study uses a primary neuronal culture model of iron deficiency to address a gap in understanding of how dendritic mitochondrial dynamics are regulated when energy depletion occurs during a critical period of neuronal maturation. At the beginning of peak dendritic growth/branching, iron deficiency reduces mitochondrial speed through increased pause frequency, decreases mitochondrial size, and alters fusion/fission gene expression. At this stage, mitochondrial density in terminal dendrites is not altered, suggesting that total mitochondrial oxidative capacity and not trafficking is the main mechanism underlying dendritic complexity deficits in iron-deficient neurons. Our findings provide foundational support for future studies exploring the mechanistic role of developmental mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders characterized by mitochondrial energy production and trafficking deficits.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/5/788?rss=1">Input-Specific Synaptic Location and Function of the {alpha}5 GABAA Receptor Subunit in the Mouse CA1 Hippocampal Neurons</a></h4>

<p>Hippocampus-dependent learning processes are coordinated via a large diversity of GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms. The α5 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R) is abundantly expressed in the hippocampus populating primarily the extrasynaptic domain of CA1 pyramidal cells, where it mediates tonic inhibitory conductance and may cause functional deficits in synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory. However, little is known about synaptic expression of the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R and, accordingly, its location site-specific function. We examined the cell- and synapse-specific distribution of the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R in the CA1 stratum oriens/alveus (O/A) using a combination of immunohistochemistry, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and optogenetic stimulation in hippocampal slices obtained from mice of either sex. In addition, the input-specific role of the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R in spatial learning and anxiety-related behavior was studied using behavioral testing and chemogenetic manipulations. We demonstrate that α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R is preferentially targeted to the inhibitory synapses made by the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)- and calretinin-positive terminals onto dendrites of somatostatin-expressing interneurons. In contrast, synapses made by the parvalbumin-positive inhibitory inputs to O/A interneurons showed no or little α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R. Inhibiting the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R in control mice <i>in vivo</i> improved spatial learning but also induced anxiety-like behavior. Inhibiting the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R in mice with inactivated CA1 VIP input could still improve spatial learning and was not associated with anxiety. Together, these data indicate that the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated phasic inhibition via VIP input to interneurons plays a predominant role in the regulation of anxiety while the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R tonic inhibition via this subunit may control spatial learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit exhibits high expression in the hippocampus, and regulates the induction of synaptic plasticity and the hippocampus-dependent mnemonic processes. In CA1 principal cells, this subunit occupies mostly extrasynaptic sites and mediates tonic inhibition. Here, we provide evidence that, in CA1 somatostatin-expressing interneurons, the α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit is targeted to synapses formed by the VIP- and calretinin-expressing inputs, and plays a specific role in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, I arrived in Puerto Rico from New York City to establish a neuroscience laboratory and research program on extinction of conditioned fear. The lab's first research paper appeared in the <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i> (Quirk et al., 2000) and has been cited &gt;900 times. The success of this project in Puerto Rico far surpassed my original expectations. Therefore, I thought it might be useful to identify the factors responsible for this success, with the hope of facilitating the development of laboratories in diverse settings. A description of our lab practices is interspersed with personal statements from trainees hailing from Puerto Rico and other parts of Latin America. Creating an effective research and training environment depends less on the director's personality and more on the proper practice of activities that foster intellectual growth, such as journal clubs, lab meetings, and philosophy of science retreats. On a personal level, this project has been enormously gratifying. The unique environment in Puerto Rico fostered my best work, and I am very happy to have established my laboratory here.</p>

<p>We consider the problem of predicting eye movement goals from local field
potentials (LFP) recorded through a multielectrode array in the macaque
prefrontal cortex. The monkey is tasked with performing memory-guided saccades
to one of eight targets during which LFP activity is recorded and used to train
a decoder. Previous reports have mainly relied on the spectral amplitude of the
LFPs as a feature in the decoding step to limited success, while neglecting the
phase without proper theoretical justification. This paper formulates the
problem of decoding eye movement intentions in a statistically optimal
framework and uses Gaussian sequence modeling and Pinsker's theorem to generate
minimax-optimal estimates of the LFP signals which are later used as features
in the decoding step. The approach is shown to act as a low-pass filter and
each LFP in the feature space is represented via its complex Fourier
coefficients after appropriate shrinking such that higher frequency components
are attenuated; this way, the phase information inherently present in the LFP
signal is naturally embedded into the feature space. The proposed complex
spectrum-based decoder achieves prediction accuracy of up to $94\%$ at
superficial electrode depths near the surface of the prefrontal cortex, which
marks a significant performance improvement over conventional power
spectrum-based decoders.

<p>We conduct a novel imaging genetics study of the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative based on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and genetic data
obtained from 112 subjects, where each subject is classified as either
cognitively normal (CN), as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or as
having Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) is fit to the
rs-fMRI time series in order to estimate a directed network representing
effective brain connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), a key
network commonly known to be active when the brain is at rest. These networks
are then related to genetic data and Alzheimer's disease in the first
genome-wide association study to use DCM as a neuroimaging phenotype.
</p>
<p>Our proposed pipeline is comprised of four sequential analyses linked
together with the objective of shedding light on the relationship between brain
connectivity and genetics in relation to disease. In the first stage, we
examine differences in effective brain connectivity across disease groups. In
the second analysis we relate the probability of disease to genetics and obtain
a set of priority single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) potentially related to
disease. In the third analysis we investigate how effective brain connectivity
is related to the set of priority SNPs obtained in the second study. In the
fourth and final analysis we examine longitudinal data on changes with respect
to MCI and AD through a classifier in order to determine how well disease
progression can be predicted from the combination of effective brain
connectivity and genetic data. Our new pipeline for connectome genetics has
general applicability and its specific application to the ADNI study motivates
a number of future studies in this nascent area.

<p>A growing number of neuromorphic spiking neural network processors that
emulate biological neural networks create an imminent need for methods and
tools to enable them to solve real-world signal processing problems. Like
conventional neural networks, spiking neural networks are particularly
efficient when trained on real, domain specific data. However, their training
requires overcoming a number of challenges linked to their binary and dynamical
nature. This tutorial elucidates step-by-step the problems typically
encountered when training spiking neural networks, and guides the reader
through the key concepts of synaptic plasticity and data-driven learning in the
spiking setting. To that end, it gives an overview of existing approaches and
provides an introduction to surrogate gradient methods, specifically, as a
particularly flexible and efficient method to overcome the aforementioned
challenges.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>SLC13A3</i> encodes the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/dicarboxylate cotransporter 3, which imports inside the cell 4 to 6 carbon dicarboxylates as well as N‐acetylaspartate (NAA). SLC13A3 is mainly expressed in kidney, in astrocytes, and in the choroid plexus. We describe two unrelated patients presenting with acute, reversible (and recurrent in one) neurological deterioration during a febrile illness. Both patients exhibited a reversible leukoencephalopathy and a urinary excretion of α‐ketoglutarate (αKG) that was markedly increased and persisted over time. In one patient, increased concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid NAA and dicarboxylates (including αKG) were observed. Extensive workup was unsuccessful, and a genetic cause was suspected.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. Our teams were connected through GeneMatcher.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>WES analysis revealed variants in <i>SLC13A3</i>. A homozygous missense mutation (p.Ala254Asp) was found in the first patient. The second patient was heterozygous for another missense mutation (p.Gly548Ser) and an intronic mutation affecting splicing as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction performed in muscle tissue (c.1016 + 3A &gt; G). Mutations and segregation were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Functional studies performed on HEK293T cells transiently transfected with wild‐type and mutant SLC13A3 indicated that the missense mutations caused a marked reduction in the capacity to transport αKG, succinate, and NAA.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SLC13A3 deficiency causes acute and reversible leukoencephalopathy with marked accumulation of αKG. Urine organic acids (especially αKG and NAA) and <i>SLC13A3</i> mutations should be screened in patients presenting with unexplained reversible leukoencephalopathy, for which SLC13A3 deficiency is a novel differential diagnosis.</p>

Abstract<p>Estradiol potentiates behavioral sensitization to cocaine as well as self-administration of cocaine and other drugs of abuse in female rodents. Furthermore, stimulated dopamine (DA) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is rapidly enhanced by estradiol, and it is hypothesized that this enhanced DA release mediates the more rapid escalation of drug taking seen in females, compared with males. The mechanisms mediating the effect of estradiol to enhance stimulated DA release was investigated in this study. Using in vivo microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, we first examined the effect of estradiol on amphetamine-induced DA increase in the DLS of ovariectomized rats. We then tested if the potentiation of this DA increase could be blocked by the estradiol receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780 (ICI), or an antagonist to the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5), 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP). There is evidence that estradiol receptors collaborate with mGlu5 within caveoli in DLS and mGlu5 is hypothesized to mediate many of the effects of estradiol in the addiction processes in females. Our data show that estradiol enhances the DA response to amphetamine. Either ICI or MPEP prevented the effect of estradiol to enhance DA release. Importantly, our results also showed neither ICI or MPEP alone is able to influence the DA response to amphetamine when estradiol is not administrated, suggesting that ICI and MPEP act via estradiol receptors. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that estradiol potentiates amphetamine-stimulated DA release in the DLS and this effect requires both estradiol receptors and mGlu5.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The present study provides important information on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the exacerbating effects of E2 on addictive behavior by showing blockage of E2 receptors or mGlu5 reduces E2-induced potentiation of DA release in the rat striatum following by amphetamine injections. Our data suggest targeting E2 receptors or mGluRs could have treatment potentials for E2-related disorders in areas such as, but not limited to, drug addiction.</p>

Abstract
<p>The primary sensory cortex processes competitive sensory inputs. Ablation of these competitive inputs induces neuroplastic changes in local cortical circuits. However, information concerning cortical plasticity induced by a disturbance of competitive nociceptive inputs is limited. Nociceptive information from the maxillary and mandibular molar pulps converges at the border between the ventral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR); therefore, S2/IOR is a suitable target for examining the cortical changes induced by a disturbance of noxious inputs, which often causes neuropathic pain and allodynia. We focused on the plastic changes in S2/IOR excitation in a model of rats subjected to inferior alveolar nerve transection (IANX). Our optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) revealed that the maxillary molar pulp stimulation-induced excitatory propagation was expanded one to two weeks after IANX at the macroscopic level. At the cellular level, based on Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using two-photon microscopy, the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and the number of responding neurons in S2/IOR increased in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The <i>in vitro</i> laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) revealed that Layer II/III pyramidal and GABAergic fast-spiking neurons in S2/IOR received larger excitatory inputs from Layer IV in the IANX models, which supports the findings obtained by the macroscopic and microscopic optical imaging. Furthermore, the inhibitory postsynaptic inputs to the pyramidal neurons were decreased in the IANX models, suggesting suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission onto excitatory neurons. These results suggest that IANX induces plastic changes in S2/IOR by changing the local excitatory and inhibitory circuits.</p>

Abstract
<p>Memory of a recently eaten meal can serve as a powerful mechanism for controlling future eating behavior because it provides a record of intake that likely outlasts most physiological signals generated by the meal. In support, impairing the encoding of a meal in humans increases the amount ingested at the next eating episode. However, the brain regions that mediate the inhibitory effects of memory on future intake are unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that dorsal hippocampal (dHC) and ventral hippocampal (vHC) glutamatergic pyramidal neurons play a critical role in the inhibition of energy intake during the postprandial period by optogenetically inhibiting these neurons at specific times relative to a meal. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given viral vectors containing CaMKIIα-eArchT3.0-eYFP or CaMKIIα-GFP and fiber optic probes into dHC of one hemisphere and vHC of the other. Compared to intake on a day in which illumination was not given, inhibition of dHC or vHC glutamatergic neurons after the end of a chow, sucrose, or saccharin meal accelerated the onset of the next meal and increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. Inhibition given during a meal did not affect the amount consumed during that meal or the next one but did hasten meal initiation. These data show that dHC and vHC glutamatergic neuronal activity during the postprandial period is critical for limiting subsequent ingestion and suggest that these neurons inhibit future intake by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.</p>

Abstract
<p>The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and communication, but precisely which AVP cell groups are involved is largely unknown. To address whether the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct in AVP-iCre-positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and increased urine marking (UM) in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex differences in social behavioral function.</p>

Abstract
<p>Preclinical and clinical research has shown that females are more vulnerable to the rewarding effects of stimulants, and it has been proposed that estrogens may play a role in this enhanced sensitivity; however sex differences in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neuroplasticity have not been explored. To address this gap in knowledge, we recorded from the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC) of male and female rats following long access METH self-administration (SA) and investigated the resulting long-term synaptic neuroadaptations. Males and females took similar amounts of METH during SA; however, female rats exhibit significant synaptic baseline differences when compared to males. Furthermore, females exhibited a significant increase in evoked excitatory currents. This increase in evoked glutamate was correlated with increases in NMDA currents and was not affected by application of a GluN2B selective blocker. We propose that METH SA selectively upregulates GluN2B-lacking NMDA receptors (NMDAR) in the PFC of female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females.</p>

<p>Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are believed to form synchronous cell assemblies that modulate the striatal microcircuitry and possibly orchestrate local dopamine release. We expressed GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECIs), selectively in CINs, and used microendoscopes to visualize the putative CIN assemblies in the dorsal striatum of freely moving mice. The GECI fluorescence signal from the dorsal striatum was composed of signals from individual CIN somata that were engulfed by a widespread fluorescent neuropil. Bouts of synchronous activation of the cholinergic neuropil revealed patterns of activity that preceded the signal from individual somata. To investigate the nature of the neuropil signal and why it precedes the somatic signal, we target-patched GECI-expressing CINs in acute striatal slices in conjunction with multiphoton imaging or wide-field imaging that emulates the microendoscopes’ specifications. The ability to detect fluorescent transients associated with individual action potential was constrained by the long decay constant of GECIs (relative to common inorganic dyes) to slowly firing (&lt;2 spikes/s) CINs. The microendoscopes’ resolving power and sampling rate further diminished this ability. Additionally, we found that only back-propagating action potentials but not synchronous optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs elicited observable calcium transients in CIN dendrites. Our data suggest that only bursts of CIN activity (but not their tonic firing) are visible using endoscopic imaging, and that the neuropil patterns are a physiological measure of the collective recurrent CIN network spiking activity.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Transthyretin (TTR)‐related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in <i>TTR</i>. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR‐FAP Val30Met families.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at <i>ATXN1</i>, <i>ATXN2</i>, <i>ATXN3</i>, <i>ATXN7</i>, <i>TBP, ATN1</i>, <i>HTT</i>, <i>JPH3</i>, <i>AR</i>, and <i>DMPK</i>) was assessed by single and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family‐centered approach, and generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between family members.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>For <i>ATXN2</i>, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR‐FAP Val30Met, decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = −8.81 to −2.19, <i>p</i> = 0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Length of normal repeats at <i>ATXN2</i> may modify AO in TTR‐FAP Val30Met and may function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of <i>ATXN2</i> in RNA metabolism and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow‐up of presymptomatic carriers. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251–258.</b></p>

<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases risk of dementia, a relationship that may be mediated by amyloid‐β (Aβ) and downstream Alzheimer disease pathology. We previously showed that OSA may impair Aβ clearance and affect the relationship between slow wave activity (SWA) and Aβ. In this study, SWA and CSF Aβ were measured in participants with OSA before and 1 to 4 months after treatment. OSA treatment increased SWA, and SWA was significantly correlated with lower Aβ after treatment. Greater improvement in OSA was associated with greater decreases in Aβ. We propose a model whereby OSA treatment may affect both Aβ release and clearance. Ann Neurol 2018 <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:291–295.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the rate of tau accumulation in healthy older adults (OA) and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), as well as the relationship of tau accumulation to cortical atrophy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 42 OA (21 Pittsburg compound B [PiB]<sup>+</sup>, age = 77.6 ± 4.6 years, 25 female [F]/17 male [M]) and 19 PiB<sup>+</sup> patients with AD (age = 63.1 ± 10.3 years, 12 F/7 M) over 1 to 3 years of follow‐up. FTP change, structural MRI measures of atrophy, and cross‐modal correlations were examined on a voxelwise level. Regional annual percentage change in FTP was also calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest increases in lateral and medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same interval was more widespread and included posteromedial cortical areas, where tau accumulation rates were lower. In OA, FTP binding increased in bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex, accompanied by atrophy in the same regions. There were no associations between voxelwise change in FTP and sex, PiB, or <i>APOE</i>. Regional FTP significantly increased at follow‐up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects models showed greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences within OA based on PiB status.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that tau accumulates even in amyloid‐negative healthy OA and this process can be measured with in vivo tau‐PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share a similar topography. In AD, tau increases more rapidly and accumulation occurs in frontal regions that are not yet undergoing significant atrophy.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated the relationship between the interictal metabolic patterns, the extent of resection of <sup>18</sup>F‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>FDG‐PET) hypometabolism, and seizure outcomes in patients with unilateral drug‐resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) following anterior temporal lobe (TL) resection.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eighty‐two patients with hippocampal sclerosis or normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, concordant <sup>18</sup>FDG‐PET hypometabolism, and at least 2 years of postoperative follow‐up were included in this 2‐center study. The hypometabolic regions in each patient were identified with reference to 20 healthy controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005). The resected TL volume and the volume of resected TL PET hypometabolism (TLH) were calculated from the pre‐ and postoperative MRI scans coregistered with interictal <sup>18</sup>FDG‐PET.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Striking differences in metabolic patterns were observed depending on the lateralization of the epileptogenic TL. The extent of the ipsilateral TLH was significantly greater in left MTLE patients <i>(p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereas right MTLE patients had significantly higher rates of contralateral (CTL) TLH (<i>p =</i> 0.016). In right MTLE patients, CTL hypometabolism was the strongest predictor of an unfavorable seizure outcome, associated with a 5‐fold increase in the likelihood of seizure recurrence (odds ratio [OR] = 4.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–22.39, <i>p</i> = 0.04). In left MTLE patients, greater extent of resection of ipsilateral TLH was associated with lower rates of seizure recurrence (<i>p</i> = 0.004) in univariate analysis; however, its predictive value did not reach statistical significance (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.90–1.02, <i>p</i> = 0.19).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The difference in metabolic patterns depending on the lateralization of MTLE may represent distinct epileptic networks in patients with right versus left MTLE, and can guide preoperative counseling and surgical planning. Ann Neurol 2019; 1–10 <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:241–250.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Surgical specimens from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) show abnormalities in tissue concentrations of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5). To clarify whether these abnormalities are specific to the epileptogenic zone (EZ), we characterized in vivo whole‐brain mGluR5 availability in MTLE patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688, a radioligand that binds specifically to the mGluR5 allosteric site.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty‐one unilateral MTLE patients and 30 healthy controls underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 PET. We compared partial volume corrected [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 nondisplaceable binding potentials (BP<sub>ND</sub>) between groups using region‐of‐interest and whole‐brain voxelwise analyses. [<sup>18</sup>F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET was acquired in 15 patients, for whom we calculated asymmetry indices of [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake to compare lateralization and localization differences.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>[<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> was focally reduced in the epileptogenic hippocampal head and amygdala (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Patients with hippocampal atrophy showed more extensive abnormalities, including the ipsilateral temporal neocortex (<i>p</i> = 0.006). [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> showed interhemispheric differences of higher magnitude and discriminated the epileptogenic structures more accurately when compared to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake, which showed more widespread hypometabolism. Among 23 of 25 operated patients with &gt;1 year of follow‐up, 13 were seizure‐free (Engel Ia) and showed significantly lower [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> in the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>[<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 PET provides a focal biomarker for the EZ in MTLE with higher spatial accuracy compared to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET. Focally reduced mGluR5 availability in the EZ might reflect receptor internalization or conformational changes in response to excessive extracellular glutamate, supporting a potential role for mGluR5 as therapeutic target in human MTLE.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dysregulation of γ‐aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) transmission has been reported in lesional acquired epilepsies (gliomas, hippocampal sclerosis). We investigated its involvement in a developmental disorder, human focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), focusing on chloride regulation driving GABAergic signals.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In vitro recordings of 47 human cortical acute slices from 11 pediatric patients who received operations for FCD were performed on multielectrode arrays. GABAergic receptors and chloride regulators were pharmacologically modulated. Immunostaining for chloride cotransporter KCC2 and interneurons were performed on recorded slices to correlate electrophysiology and expression patterns.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>FCD slices retain intrinsic epileptogenicity. Thirty‐six of 47 slices displayed spontaneous interictal discharges, along with a pattern specific to the histological subtypes. Ictal discharges were induced in proepileptic conditions in 6 of 8 slices in the areas generating spontaneous interictal discharges, with a transition to seizure involving the emergence of preictal discharges. Interictal discharges were sustained by GABAergic signaling, as a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker stopped them in 2 of 3 slices. Blockade of NKCC1 Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporters further controlled interictal discharges in 9 of 12 cases, revealing a Cl<sup>−</sup> dysregulation affecting actions of GABA. Immunohistochemistry highlighted decreased expression and changes in KCC2 subcellular localization and a decrease in the number of GAD67‐positive interneurons in regions generating interictal discharges.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Altered chloride cotransporter expression and changes in interneuron density in FCD may lead to paradoxical depolarization of pyramidal cells. Spontaneous interictal discharges are consequently mediated by GABAergic signals, and targeting chloride regulation in neurons may be considered for the development of new antiepileptic drugs.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology frequently co‐occur in older adults. The extent to which cerebrovascular disease influences the progression of AD pathology remains unclear. Leveraging newly available positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we examined whether a well‐validated measure of systemic vascular risk and <b>β</b>‐amyloid (A<b>β</b>) burden have an interactive association with regional tau burden.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Vascular risk was quantified at baseline in 152 clinically normal older adults (mean age = 73.5 ± 6.1 years) with the office‐based Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (FHS‐CVD). We acquired A<b>β</b> (<sup>11</sup>C‐Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F‐flortaucipir) PET imaging on the same participants. A<b>β</b> PET was performed at baseline; tau PET was acquired on average 2.98 ± 1.1 years later. Tau was measured in the entorhinal cortex (EC), an early site of tau deposition, and in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an early site of neocortical tau accumulation associated with AD. Linear regression models examined FHS‐CVD and A<b>β</b> as interactive predictors of tau deposition, adjusting for age, sex, <i>APOE</i> ε4 status, and the time interval between baseline and the tau PET scan.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant interaction between FHS‐CVD and A<b>β</b> burden on subsequently measured ITC tau (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereby combined higher FHS‐CVD and elevated A<b>β</b> burden was associated with increased tau. The interaction was not significant for EC tau (<i>p</i> = 0.16).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elevated vascular risk may influence tau burden when coupled with high A<b>β</b> burden. These results suggest a potential link between vascular risk and tau pathology in preclinical AD. Ann Neurol 2019; 1–8 <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:272–279.</b></p>

<p>We investigated changes of after‐image duration in migraineurs and healthy controls (HCs) and throughout the migraine cycle to depict changes in the excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium within the visual cortex. Forty‐seven episodic (EMs) and 39 chronic migraineurs (CMs; interictal) were compared to 34 HCs for visual after‐image duration. Additionally, seven EMs were investigated every consecutive day over 20 to 32 days using the identical paradigm throughout the migraine cycle. Interictally, the after‐image duration was shorter compared to HCs, but significantly longer in the ictal compared to interictal phase. These data suggest an altered excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium in migraineurs, which oscillates over the migraine cycle. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:280–283.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are linked to vascular risk factors and increase the risk of cognitive decline, dementia, and stroke. We here aimed to determine whether obesity contributes to regional WMHs using a whole‐brain approach in a well‐characterized population‐based cohort.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), systolic/diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes and smoking status, blood glucose and inflammatory markers, as well as distribution of WMH were assessed in 1,825 participants of the LIFE‐adult study (age, 20–82 years; BMI, 18.4–55.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) using high‐resolution 3‐Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel‐wise analyses tested if obesity predicts regional probability of WMH. Additionally, mediation effects of high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein and interleukin‐6 (IL6) measured in blood were related to obesity and WMH using linear regression and structural equation models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>WHR related to higher WMH probability predominantly in the deep white matter, even after adjusting for effects of age, sex, and systolic blood pressure (mean ß = 0.0043 [0.0008 SE], 95% confidence interval, [0.00427, 0.0043]; threshold‐free cluster enhancement, family‐wise error‐corrected <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Conversely, higher systolic blood pressure was associated with WMH in periventricular white matter regions. Mediation analyses indicated that both higher WHR and higher BMI contributed to increased deep‐to‐periventricular WMH ratio through elevated IL6.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results indicate an increased WMH burden selectively in the deep white matter in obese subjects with high visceral fat accumulation, independent of common obesity comorbidities such as hypertension. Mediation analyses proposed that visceral obesity contributes to deep white matter lesions through increases in proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a pathomechanistic link. Longitudinal studies need to confirm this hypothesis. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:194–203.</b></p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Amyloid‐beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies are commonly observed among clinically normal older individuals at postmortem and can now be detected with <i>in vivo</i> neuroimaging. The association and interaction of these proteinopathies with prospective cognitive decline in normal aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be fully elucidated.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred thirty‐seven older individuals (age = 76.3 ± 6.22 years) participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study underwent Aβ (<sup>11</sup>C‐Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F‐flortaucipir) positron emission tomography (PET) with prospective neuropsychological assessments following PET imaging (mean number of cognitive visits = 2.8 ± 1.1). Tau and Aβ PET measures were assessed in regions of interest (ROIs) as well as vertex‐wise map analyses. Cognitive change was evaluated with Memory and Executive Function composites.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Higher levels of Aβ and tau were both associated with greater memory decline, but not with change in executive function. Higher cortical Aβ was associated with higher tau levels in all ROIs, independent of age, and very elevated levels of tau were observed primarily in clinically normal with elevated Aβ. A significant interaction between tau and Aβ was observed in both ROI and map‐level analyses, such that rapid prospective memory decline was observed in participants who had high levels of both pathologies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results are consistent with the supposition that both Aβ and tau are necessary for memory decline in the preclinical stages of AD. These findings may be relevant for disambiguating aging and early cognitive manifestations of AD, and to inform secondary prevention trials in preclinical AD.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Variant ataxia‐telangiectasia is caused by mutations that allow some retained ataxia telangiectasia‐mutated (ATM) kinase activity. Here, we describe the clinical features of the largest established cohort of individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia and explore genotype‐phenotype correlations.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross‐sectional data were collected retrospectively. Patients were classified as variant ataxia‐telangiectasia based on retained ATM kinase activity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study includes 57 individuals. Mean age at assessment was 37.5 years. Most had their first symptoms by age 10 (81%). There was a diagnostic delay of more than 10 years in 68% and more than 20 years in one third of probands. Disease severity was mild in one third of patients, and 43% were still ambulant 20 years after disease onset. Only one third had predominant ataxia, and 18% had a pure extrapyramidal presentation. Individuals with extrapyramidal presentations had milder neurological disease severity. There were no significant respiratory or immunological complications, but 25% of individuals had a history of malignancy. Missense mutations were associated with milder neurological disease severity, but with a higher risk of malignancy, compared to leaky splice site mutations.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia require malignancy surveillance and tailored management. However, our data suggest the condition may sometimes be mis‐ or underdiagnosed because of atypical features, including exclusive extrapyramidal symptoms, normal eye movements, and normal alpha‐fetoprotein levels in some individuals. Missense mutations are associated with milder neurological presentations, but a particularly high malignancy risk, and it is important for clinicians to be aware of these phenotypes. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:170–180.</b></p>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Diane Lipscombe, Eduardo Javier Lopez Soto</p><div><p>Dynamic changes in alternative splicing during the life cycle of neurons support development and plasticity, and are implicated in disease pathology. Cell-specific alternative splicing programs coordinate exon selection across networks of functionally connected genes. In this opinion piece, we highlight recent publications that identify some of the molecular mechanisms—RNA and DNA binding proteins and epigenetic modifications—which direct cell-specific exon selection during pre-mRNA splicing. Aberrant splicing patterns are signature features of a growing number of diseases of the nervous system. Recent publications demonstrate the value of delineating basic mechanisms that dictate exon choice to inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that correct or compensate for damaging deficits in alternative splicing.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Alexander Shakeel Bates, Jasper Janssens, Gregory SXE Jefferis, Stein Aerts</p><div><p>At around 150 000 neurons, the adult <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> central nervous system is one of the largest species, for which a complete cellular catalogue is imminent. While numerically much simpler than mammalian brains, its complexity is still difficult to parse without grouping neurons into consistent types, which can number 1–1000 cells per hemisphere. We review how neuroanatomical and gene expression data are being used to discover neuronal types at scale. The correlation among multiple co-varying neuronal properties, including lineage, gene expression, morphology, connectivity, response properties and shared behavioral significance is essential to the definition of neuronal cell type. Initial studies comparing morphological and transcriptomic definitions of neuronal type suggest that these are highly consistent, but there is much to do to match these approaches brain-wide. Matched single-cell transcriptomic and morphological data provide an effective reference point to integrate other data types, including connectomics data. This will significantly enhance our ability to make functional predictions from brain wiring diagrams as well facilitating molecular genetic manipulation of neuronal types.</p></div>

Tang et al. address the importance of the precise positioning of neural progenitors during cortical development. They show that misposition of intermediate progenitors during early cortical development can lead to dramatic cortical malformation.

Direction-selective retinal ganglion cells encode visual motion but also respond to luminance changes. Kühn and Gollisch report that this dual-feature sensitivity creates ambiguities for decoding complex motion stimuli. Population decoding resolves these ambiguities and provides a synergistic motion readout.

<p>by Margot C. Bjoring, C. Daniel Meliza</p>

Birdsong is a complex vocal communication signal, and like humans, birds need to discriminate between similar sequences of sound with different meanings. The caudal mesopallium (CM) is a cortical-level auditory area implicated in song discrimination. CM neurons respond sparsely to conspecific song and are tolerant of production variability. Intracellular recordings in CM have identified a diversity of intrinsic membrane dynamics, which could contribute to the emergence of these higher-order functional properties. We investigated this hypothesis using a novel linear-dynamical cascade model that incorporated detailed biophysical dynamics to simulate auditory responses to birdsong. Neuron models that included a low-threshold potassium current present in a subset of CM neurons showed increased selectivity and coding efficiency relative to models without this current. These results demonstrate the impact of intrinsic dynamics on sensory coding and the importance of including the biophysical characteristics of neural populations in simulation studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JCcLbdK_z5k" width="1" />

Genome data, with underlying new knowledge, are accumulating at exponential rate thanks to ever-improving sequencing technologies and the parallel development of dedicated efficient Bioinformatics methods and tools. Advanced Education in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses is to a large extent not accessible to students in developing countries where endeavors to set up Bioinformatics courses concern most often only basic levels. Here, we report a pioneering pilot experience concerning the design and implementation, from scratch, of a three-months advanced and extensive course in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses in the Institut Pasteur de Tunis. Most significantly the outcome of the course was upgrading the participants’ skills in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses to recognized international standards. Here we detail the different steps involved in the implementation of this course as well as the topics covered in the program. The description of this pilot experience might be helpful for the implementation of other similar educational projects, notably in developing countries, aiming to go beyond basics and providing young researchers with high-level skills.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jk3OXkDl4KM" width="1" />

<p>by Timothy D. Majarian, Robert F. Murphy, Seema S. Lakdawala</p>

Within influenza virus infected cells, viral genomic RNA are selectively packed into progeny virions, which predominantly contain a single copy of 8 viral RNA segments. Intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions are thought to mediate selective packaging of each viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP). Clear evidence of a specific interaction network culminating in the full genomic set has yet to be identified. Using multi-color fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization to visualize four vRNP segments within a single cell, we developed image-based models of vRNP-vRNP spatial dependence. These models were used to construct likely sequences of vRNP associations resulting in the full genomic set. Our results support the notion that selective packaging occurs during cytoplasmic transport and identifies the formation of multiple distinct vRNP sub-complexes that likely form as intermediate steps toward full genomic inclusion into a progeny virion. The methods employed demonstrate a statistically driven, model based approach applicable to other interaction and assembly problems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/99ZwYvNlJkU" width="1" />

Abstract<p>The inter-regional connectivity of sensory structures in the brain allows for the modulation of sensory processing in manners important for perception. In the olfactory system, odor representations in the olfactory bulb (OB) are modulated by feedback centrifugal innervation from several olfactory cortices, including the piriform cortex and anterior olfactory nucleus. Previous studies reported that an additional olfactory cortex, the olfactory tubercle, also centrifugally innervates the OB and may even shape the activity of OB output neurons. In an attempt to identify the cell-types of this centrifugal innervation, we performed retrograde tracing experiments in mice utilizing three unique strategies, including retrobeads, retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV) driving a fluorescent reporter, and retrograde AAV driving Cre-expression in the Ai9 floxed transgenic reporter line. Our results replicated the standing literature and uncovered robustly labeled neurons in the ipsilateral piriform cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, and numerous other structures known to innervate the OB. Surprisingly, consistent throughout all of our approaches, no labeled soma were observed in the olfactory tubercle. These findings indicate that the olfactory tubercle is unique among other olfactory cortices in that it does not innervate the OB, which refines our understanding of the centrifugal modulation of the OB.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The perception of our environment relies upon the distribution of sensory information throughout brain regions. This is true in the olfactory system wherein projections between olfactory centers, including feedback centrifugal input to the olfactory bulb, provide the basis for olfactory perception. Here, we show that one olfactory cortical structure, the olfactory tubercle, is unique among olfactory cortices in that it lacks feedback projections to the olfactory bulb. This ‘negative result’ is important in that it refines current models for the circuitry of our olfactory system and challenges previous literature reporting such a pathway in fact exists.</p>

Abstract<p>Stress causes divergent patterns of structural and physiological plasticity in the hippocampus versus amygdala. However, a majority of earlier studies focused primarily on neurons. Despite growing evidence for the importance of glia in health and disease, relatively little is known about how stress affects astrocytes. Further, previous work focused on hippocampal astrocytes. Hence, we examined the impact of chronic immobilization stress (2 h/day, 10 days), on the number and structure of astrocytes in the rat hippocampus and amygdala. We observed a reduction in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes in the basal amygdala (BA), a day after the end of 10 days of chronic stress. Detailed morphometric analysis of individual dye-filled astrocytes also revealed a decrease in the neuropil volume occupied by these astrocytes in the BA, alongside a reduction in the volume fraction of fine astrocytic protrusions rather than larger dendrite-like processes. By contrast, the same chronic stress had no effect on the number or morphology of astrocytes in hippocampal area CA3. We also confirmed previous reports that chronic stress triggers dendritic hypertrophy in dye-filled BA principal neurons that were located adjacent to astrocytes that had undergone atrophy. Thus, building on earlier evidence for contrasting patterns of stress-induced plasticity in neurons across brain areas, our findings offer new evidence that the same stress can also elicit divergent morphological effects in astrocytes in the hippocampus versus the amygdala.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Despite accumulating evidence on the role of astrocytes in health and disease, relatively little is known about the effects of stress on these cells. We report here, for the first time, that the divergent effects of chronic immobilization stress on the morphological properties of neurons in hippocampus and amygdala also extend to astrocytes in the rat brain. Chronic stress reduces the number of astrocytes in the amygdala, without affecting them in the hippocampus. Strikingly, the same stress elicits divergent morphological effects – neuronal hypertrophy versus atrophy of astrocytes – in the amygdala. These findings underscore the need to further examine non-cell autonomous, astroglial mediated effects elicited by stress, and how these vary across brain regions.</p>

Abstract<p>Cognitive decline with aging is often due to altered levels of protein expression. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) and the complex of proteins surrounding the receptor are susceptible to age-related changes in expression. In the frontal cortex of aged mice, there is significant loss of expression of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAr, an increase in Fyn expression, and no change in PSD-95. Studies have also found that, in the frontal cortex, phosphorylation of GluN2B subunits and palmitoylation of GluN2 subunits and NMDAr complex proteins are affected by age. In this study, we examined some of the factors that may lead to the differences in the palmitoylation levels of NMDAr complex proteins in the frontal cortex of aged animals. The Morris water maze was used to test spatial learning in 3 and 24-month-old mice. The acyl-biotinyl exchange (ABE) method was used to precipitate palmitoylated proteins from the frontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. Additionally, brain lysates from old and young mice were probed for expression of fatty acid transporter proteins.</p><p>An age-related increase of palmitoylated GluN2A, GluN2B, Fyn, PSD-95, and APT1 in the frontal cortex was associated with poorer reference memory and/or executive functions. These data suggest that there may be a perturbation in the palmitoylation cycle in the frontal cortex of aged mice that contributes to age-related cognitive declines.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Cognitive decline due to aging significantly impacts the quality of life of those affected, as well as their families. Although data has shown that there isn’t a dramatic loss of neurons in the aged brain, the expression of some proteins essential for memory dwindle with advanced age. However, other proteins remain constant or increase with age. Posttranslational modification of proteins via palmitoylation significantly alters the function of signaling molecules in the brain. We found an age-related increase in the percentage of NMDA receptor-associated proteins that were palmitoylated in the frontal cortex of mice, which were associated with age-related deficits in memory and executive functions. This finding may point to a previously unexplored mechanism of cognitive decline in older individuals.</p>

<p>Modern neuroscience is currently limited in its capacity to perform long
term, wide-field measurements of neuron electromagnetics with nanoscale
resolution. Quantum microscopy using the nitrogen vacancy centre (NV) can
provide a potential solution to this problem with electric and magnetic field
sensing at nano-scale resolution and good biocompatibility. However, the
performance of existing NV sensing technology does not allow for studies of
small mammalian neurons yet. In this paper, we propose a solution to this
problem by engineering NV quantum sensors in diamond nanopillar arrays. The
pillars improve light collection efficiency by guiding excitation/emission
light, which improves sensitivity. More importantly, they also improve the size
of the signal at the NV by removing screening charges as well as coordinating
the neuron growth to the tips of the pillars where the NV is located. Here, we
provide a growth study to demonstrate coordinated neuron growth as well as the
first simulation of nano-scopic neuron electric and magnetic fields to assess
the enhancement provided by the nanopillar geometry.

<p>Ablation studies have been widely used in the field of neuroscience to tackle
complex biological systems such as the extensively studied Drosophila central
nervous system, the vertebrate brain and more interestingly and most
delicately, the human brain. In the past, these kinds of studies were utilized
to uncover structure and organization in the brain, i.e. a mapping of features
inherent to external stimuli onto different areas of the neocortex. considering
the growth in size and complexity of state-of-the-art artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and the corresponding growth in complexity of the tasks that
are tackled by these networks, the question arises whether ablation studies may
be used to investigate these networks for a similar organization of their inner
representations. In this paper, we address this question and performed two
ablation studies in two fundamentally different ANNs to investigate their inner
representations of two well-known benchmark datasets from the computer vision
domain. We found that features distinct to the local and global structure of
the data are selectively represented in specific parts of the network.
Furthermore, some of these representations are redundant, awarding the network
a certain robustness to structural damages. We further determined the
importance of specific parts of the network for the classification task solely
based on the weight structure of single units. Finally, we examined the ability
of damaged networks to recover from the consequences of ablations by means of
recovery training. We argue that ablations studies are a feasible method to
investigate knowledge representations in ANNs and are especially helpful to
examine a networks robustness to structural damages, a feature of ANNs that
will become increasingly important for future safety-critical applications.

<p>Extended Kalman filter (EKF) does not guarantee consistent mean and
covariance under linearization, even though it is the main framework for
robotic localization. While Lie group improves the modeling of the state space
in localization, the EKF on Lie group still relies on the arbitrary Gaussian
assumption in face of nonlinear models. We instead use von Mises filter for
orientation estimation together with the conventional Kalman filter for
position estimation, and thus we are able to characterize the first two moments
of the state estimates. Since the proposed algorithm holds a solid
probabilistic basis, it is fundamentally relieved from the inconsistency
problem. Furthermore, we extend the localization algorithm to fully circular
representation even for position, which is similar to grid patterns found in
mammalian brains and in recurrent neural networks. The applicability of the
proposed algorithms is substantiated not only by strong mathematical foundation
but also by the comparison against other common localization methods.

<p>by Joseph D. Monaco, Rose M. De Guzman, Hugh T. Blair, Kechen Zhang</p>

During spatial navigation, the frequency and timing of spikes from spatial neurons including place cells in hippocampus and grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are temporally organized by continuous theta oscillations (6–11 Hz). The theta rhythm is regulated by subcortical structures including the medial septum, but it is unclear how spatial information from place cells may reciprocally organize subcortical theta-rhythmic activity. Here we recorded single-unit spiking from a constellation of subcortical and hippocampal sites to study spatial modulation of rhythmic spike timing in rats freely exploring an open environment. Our analysis revealed a novel class of neurons that we termed ‘phaser cells,’ characterized by a symmetric coupling between firing rate and spike theta-phase. Phaser cells encoded space by assigning distinct phases to allocentric isocontour levels of each cell’s spatial firing pattern. In our dataset, phaser cells were predominantly located in the lateral septum, but also the hippocampus, anteroventral thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens. Unlike the unidirectional late-to-early phase precession of place cells, bidirectional phase modulation acted to return phaser cells to the same theta-phase along a given spatial isocontour, including cells that characteristically shifted to later phases at higher firing rates. Our dynamical models of intrinsic theta-bursting neurons demonstrated that experience-independent temporal coding mechanisms can qualitatively explain (1) the spatial rate-phase relationships of phaser cells and (2) the observed temporal segregation of phaser cells according to phase-shift direction. In open-field phaser cell simulations, competitive learning embedded phase-code entrainment maps into the weights of downstream targets, including path integration networks. Bayesian phase decoding revealed error correction capable of resetting path integration at subsecond timescales. Our findings suggest that phaser cells may instantiate a subcortical theta-rhythmic loop of spatial feedback. We outline a framework in which location-dependent synchrony reconciles internal idiothetic processes with the allothetic reference points of sensory experience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zGh30KsIyYw" width="1" />

<p>Using a novel network analysis of spontaneous low-frequency functional MRI
data recorded at rest, we study the functional network that describes the
extent of synchronization among different areas of the brain. Comparing
forty-four medicated patients and forty healthy subjects, we detected
significant differences in the robustness of these functional networks. Such
differences resulted in a larger resistance to edge removal (disconnection) in
the graph of schizophrenic patients as compared to healthy controls. This paper
shows that the distribution of connectivity strength among brain regions is
spatially more homogeneous in schizophrenic patients with respect to healthy
ones. As a consequence, the precise hierarchical modularity of healthy brains
is crumbled in schizophrenic ones, making possible a peculiar arrangement of
region-to-region interaction that, in turns, produces several topologically
equivalent backbones of the whole functional brain network. We hypothesize that
the manifold nature of the basal scheme of functional organization within the
brain, together with its altered hierarchical modularity, contributes to
positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Our work also fits the disconnection
hypothesis that describes schizophrenia as a brain disorder, characterized by
abnormal functional integration among brain regions.

<p>The cortex exhibits self-sustained highly-irregular activity even under
resting conditions, whose origin and function need to be fully understood. It
is believed that this can be described as an "asynchronous state" stemming from
the balance between excitation and inhibition, with important consequences for
information-processing, though a competing hypothesis claims it stems from
critical dynamics. By analyzing a parsimonious neural-network model with
excitatory and inhibitory interactions, we elucidate a noise-induced mechanism
called "Jensen's force" responsible for the emergence of a novel phase of
arbitrarily-low but self-sustained activity, which reproduces all the
experimental features of asynchronous states. The simplicity of our framework
allows for a deep understanding of asynchronous states from a broad
statistical-mechanics perspective and of the phase transitions to other
standard phases it exhibits, opening the door to reconcile, asynchronous-state
and critical-state hypotheses. We argue that Jensen's forces are measurable
experimentally and might be relevant in contexts beyond neuroscience.

<p>Most of mathematic forgetting curve models fit well with the forgetting data
under the learning condition of one time rather than repeated. In the paper, a
convolution model of forgetting curve is proposed to simulate the memory
process during learning. In this model, the memory ability (i.e. the central
procedure in the working memory model) and learning material (i.e. the input in
the working memory model) is regarded as the system function and the input
function, respectively. The status of forgetting (i.e. the output in the
working memory model) is regarded as output function or the convolution result
of the memory ability and learning material. The model is applied to simulate
the forgetting curves in different situations. The results show that the model
is able to simulate the forgetting curves not only in one time learning
condition but also in multi-times condition. The model is further verified in
the experiments of Mandarin tone learning for Japanese learners. And the
predicted curve fits well on the test points.

<p>Multimodal behavior involves multiple processing stations distributed across
distant brain regions, but our understanding of how such distributed processing
is coordinated in the brain is limited. Here we take a decoding approach to
this problem, aiming to quantify how temporal aspects of brain-wide neural
activity may be used to infer specific multimodal behaviors. Using high
temporal resolution measurements by MEG, we detect bursts of activity from
hundreds of locations across the surface of the brain at millisecond
resolution. We then compare decoding using three characteristics of neural
activity bursts, decoding with event counts, with latencies and with time
differences between pairs of events. Training decoders in this regime is
particularly challenging because the number of samples is smaller by orders of
magnitude than the input dimensionality. We develop a new decoding approach for
this regime that combines non-parametric modelling with aggressive feature
selection. Surprisingly, we find that decoding using time-differences, based on
thousands of region pairs, is significantly more accurate than using other
activity characteristics, reaching 90% accuracy consistently across subjects.
These results suggest that relevant information about multimodal brain function
is provided by subtle time differences across remote brain areas.

<p>by Debolina Sarkar, Thomas J. Mueller, Deng Liu, Himadri B. Pakrasi, Costas D. Maranas</p>

Phototrophic organisms such as cyanobacteria utilize the sun’s energy to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon, resulting in diurnal variations in the cell’s metabolism. Flux balance analysis is a widely accepted constraint-based optimization tool for analyzing growth and metabolism, but it is generally used in a time-invariant manner with no provisions for sequestering different biomass components at different time periods. Here we present CycleSyn, a periodic model of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 metabolism that spans a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle by segmenting it into 12 Time Point Models (TPMs) with a uniform duration of two hours. The developed framework allows for the flow of metabolites across TPMs while inventorying metabolite levels and only allowing for the utilization of currently or previously produced compounds. The 12 TPMs allow for the incorporation of time-dependent constraints that capture the cyclic nature of cellular processes. Imposing bounds on reactions informed by temporally-segmented transcriptomic data enables simulation of phototrophic growth as a single linear programming (LP) problem. The solution provides the time varying reaction fluxes over a 24-hour cycle and the accumulation/consumption of metabolites. The diurnal rhythm of metabolic gene expression driven by the circadian clock and its metabolic consequences is explored. Predicted flux and metabolite pools are in line with published studies regarding the temporal organization of phototrophic growth in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 paving the way for constructing time-resolved genome-scale models (GSMs) for organisms with a circadian clock. In addition, the metabolic reorganization that would be required to enable <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 to temporally separate photosynthesis from oxygen-sensitive nitrogen fixation is also explored using the developed model formalism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TnrMxUFOeR0" width="1" />

<p>by Xiaohu Hu, Yibo Wang, Amanda Hunkele, Davide Provasi, Gavril W. Pasternak, Marta Filizola</p>

The differential modulation of agonist and antagonist binding to opioid receptors (ORs) by sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) has been known for decades. To shed light on the molecular determinants, thermodynamics, and kinetics of Na<sup>+</sup> translocation through the μ-OR (MOR), we used a multi-ensemble Markov model framework combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Na<sup>+</sup> binding to MOR active or inactive crystal structures embedded in an explicit lipid bilayer. We identify an energetically favorable, continuous ion pathway through the MOR active conformation only, and provide, for the first time: i) estimates of the energy differences and required timescales of Na<sup>+</sup> translocation in inactive and active MORs, ii) estimates of Na<sup>+</sup>-induced changes to agonist binding validated by radioligand measurements, and iii) testable hypotheses of molecular determinants and correlated motions involved in this translocation, which are likely to play a key role in MOR signaling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vAvW0Pod-dQ" width="1" />

Conflicting reports about whether adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in humans raise questions about its significance for human health and the relevance of animal models. Drawing upon published data, I review species’ neurogenesis rates across the lifespan and propose that accelerated neurodevelopmental timing is consistent with lower rates of neurogenesis in adult primates and humans. Nonetheless, protracted neurogenesis may produce populations of neurons that retain plastic properties for long intervals, and have distinct functions depending on when in the lifespan they were born.

Witte et al. identify cytoplasmic calcium accumulations as a key driver of axon degeneration in a model of multiple sclerosis. Calcium accumulates in the axoplasm because nanoscale ruptures of the axonal plasma membrane provide an entry path for extracellular calcium.

Although the basic cellular organization of the cortex is conserved across mammals, cells have diversified during evolution. An increasingly integrated taxonomy of cell types, especially with the advent of single-cell transcriptomic data, has revealed an unprecedented variety of human cortical cell subtypes. Here, we broadly review the cellular composition and diversity of the mammalian brain, and how progenitor pools generate cell subtypes during development. We then discuss human cortical cells that are distinct from rodent cells, as well as the challenges and advantages of using model systems to study human cell types in health and disease.</p></div>

Advances in proteomics and mass spectrometry, which now enable comprehensive lifetime estimations for thousands of proteins, suggest that neuronal and synaptic protein lifetimes are unusually long, with half-lives typically ranging from days to weeks, even months and beyond for certain protein families. Half-lives <em>in vivo</em> are several-fold longer than those in cell culture, tend to cluster for proteins belonging to multimolecular complexes, are affected by developmental stage, and possibly by environmental conditions and activity levels.</p></div>

<p>Dozens of genes have been implicated in late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but none has a defined mechanism of action in neurons. Here, we show that the risk factor Pyk2 (PTK2B) localizes specifically to neurons in adult brain. Absence of Pyk2 has no major effect on synapse formation or the basal parameters of synaptic transmission in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway. However, the induction of synaptic LTD is suppressed in Pyk2-null slices. In contrast, deletion of Pyk2 expression does not alter LTP under control conditions. Of relevance for AD pathophysiology, Pyk2<sup>–/–</sup> slices are protected from amyloid-β-oligomer (Aβo)-induced suppression of LTP in hippocampal slices. Acutely, a Pyk2 kinase inhibitor also prevents Aβo-induced suppression of LTP in WT slices. Female and male transgenic AD model mice expressing APPswe/PSEN1E9 require Pyk2 for age-dependent loss of synaptic markers and for impairment of learning and memory. However, absence of Pyk2 does not alter Aβ accumulation or gliosis. Therefore, the Pyk2 risk gene is directly implicated in a neuronal Aβo signaling pathway impairing synaptic anatomy and function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Genetic variation at the Pyk2 (PTK2B) locus is a risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the pathophysiological role of Pyk2 is not clear. Here, we studied Pyk2 neuronal function in mice lacking expression with and without transgenes generating amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque pathology. Pyk2 is not required for basal synaptic transmission or LTP, but participates in LTD. Hippocampal slices lacking Pyk2 are protected from AD-related Aβ oligomer suppression of synaptic plasticity. In transgenic AD model mice, deletion of Pyk2 rescues synaptic loss and learning/memory deficits. Therefore, Pyk2 plays a central role in AD-related synaptic dysfunction mediating Aβ-triggered dysfunction.</p>

<p>Recent evidence suggests that blood–brain barrier (BBB) recovery and reestablishment of BBB impermeability after stroke is incomplete. This could influence stroke recovery, increase the risk of repeat stroke, and be a solid substrate for developing vascular dementia. Although accumulating evidence has defined morphological alterations and underlying mechanisms of tight junction (TJ) changes during BBB breakdown in acute stroke, very little is known about the type of alterations and mechanisms in BBB "leakage" found subacutely or chronically. The current study examined BBB structural alterations during the "BBB leakage" associated with the chronic phase of stroke in male mice and both genders of humans. We found significant upregulation of claudin-1 mRNA and protein, a nonspecific claudin for blood vessels, and downregulation in claudin-5 expression. Morphological and biochemical as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of postischemic brain endothelial cells and cells overexpressing claudin-1 indicated that newly synthesized claudin-1 was present on the cell membrane (~45%), was incorporated into the TJ complex with established interaction with zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and was building homophilic <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-interactions. The appearance of claudin-1 in the TJ complex reduced claudin-5 strands (homophilic claudin-5 <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-interactions) and claudin-5/ZO-1 interaction affecting claudin-5 incorporation into the TJ complex. Moreover, claudin-1 induction was associated with an endothelial proinflammatory phenotype. Targeting claudin-1 with a specific C1C2 peptide improved brain endothelial barrier permeability and functional recovery in chronic stroke condition. This study highlights a potential "defect" in postischemic barrier formation that may underlie prolonged vessel leakiness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although rarely expressed at the normal blood–brain barrier (BBB), claudin-1 is expressed in pathological conditions. Analyzing poststroke human and mouse blood microvessels we have identified that claudin-1 is highly expressed in leaky brain microvessels. Our results reveal that claudin-1 is incorporated in BBB tight junction complex, impeding BBB recovery and causing BBB leakiness during poststroke recovery. Targeting claudin-1 with a claudin-1 peptide improves brain endothelial barrier permeability and consequently functional neurological recovery after stroke.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/727?rss=1">Conditional Knock-out of mGluR5 from Astrocytes during Epilepsy Development Impairs High-Frequency Glutamate Uptake</a></h4>

<p>Astrocyte expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is consistently observed in resected tissue from patients with epilepsy and is equally prevalent in animal models of epilepsy. However, little is known about the functional signaling properties or downstream consequences of astrocyte mGluR5 activation during epilepsy development. In the rodent brain, astrocyte mGluR5 expression is developmentally regulated and confined in expression/function to the first weeks of life, with similar observations made in human control tissue. Herein, we demonstrate that mGluR5 expression and function dramatically increase in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Interestingly, in both male and female mice, mGluR5 function persists in the astrocyte throughout the process of epileptogenesis following status epilepticus. However, mGluR5 expression and function are transient in animals that do not develop epilepsy over an equivalent time period, suggesting that patterns of mGluR5 expression may signify continuing epilepsy development or its resolution. We demonstrate that, during epileptogenesis, astrocytes reacquire mGluR5-dependent calcium transients following agonist application or synaptic glutamate release, a feature of astrocyte-neuron communication absent since early development. Finally, we find that the selective and conditional knock-out of mGluR5 signaling from astrocytes during epilepsy development slows the rate of glutamate clearance through astrocyte glutamate transporters under high-frequency stimulation conditions, a feature that suggests astrocyte mGluR5 expression during epileptogenesis may recapitulate earlier developmental roles in regulating glutamate transporter function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In development, astrocyte mGluR5 signaling plays a critical role in regulating structural and functional interactions between astrocytes and neurons at the tripartite synapse. Notably, mGluR5 signaling is a positive regulator of astrocyte glutamate transporter expression and function, an essential component of excitatory signaling regulation in hippocampus. After early development, astrocyte mGluR5 expression is downregulated, but reemerges in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) development and patient epilepsy samples. We explored the hypothesis that astrocyte mGluR5 reemergence recapitulates earlier developmental roles during TLE acquisition. Our work demonstrates that astrocytes with mGluR5 signaling during TLE development perform faster glutamate uptake in hippocampus, revealing a previously unexplored role for astrocyte mGluR5 signaling in hypersynchronous pathology.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/718?rss=1">Hard Decisions Shape the Neural Coding of Preferences</a></h4>

<p>Hard decisions between equally valued alternatives can result in preference changes, meaning that subsequent valuations for chosen items increase and decrease for rejected items. Previous research suggests that this phenomenon is a consequence of cognitive dissonance reduction after the decision, induced by the mismatch between initial preferences and decision outcomes. In contrast, this functional magnetic resonance imaging and eye-tracking study with male and female human participants found that preferences are already updated online during the process of decision-making. Preference changes were predicted from activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and precuneus while making hard decisions. Fixation durations during this phase predicted both choice outcomes and subsequent preference changes. These preference adjustments became behaviorally relevant only for choices that were remembered and were in turn associated with hippocampus activity. Our results suggest that preferences evolve dynamically as decisions arise, potentially as a mechanism to prevent stalemate situations in underdetermined decision scenarios.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most theories of decision-making assume that we always choose the best option available, based on a set of stable preferences. However, what happens for hard decisions when the available options are preferred equally? We show that in such stalemate situations, decision-makers adjust their preferences dynamically during the process of decision-making, and these preference adjustments are predicted by a left prefrontal-parietal network. We also show that eye movements during decision-making are predictive of the magnitude of the upcoming value change. Our results suggest that preferences are dynamic, adjusted every time a hard decision is made, prompting a re-evaluation of existing frameworks of decision-making.</p>

Tan et al. reveal a key mechanism that underlies signaling from endothelial cells to neurons in the brain. They identify that the endothelium-secreted protein semaphorin 3G (Sema3G) regulates synaptic structure and plasticity in hippocampal neurons through its neuronal neuropilin-2/PlexinA4 holoreceptor.

Microglia provide immune surveillance of the CNS. They display diverse behaviors, including nondirectional and directed motility of their processes, phagocytosis of targets such as dying neurons or superfluous synapses, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines. Many of these functions are mediated by ion channels and cell surface receptors, the expression of which varies with the many morphological and functional states that microglial cells can adopt. Recent progress in understanding microglial function has been facilitated by applying classical cell physiological techniques in situ, such as patch-clamping and live imaging, and cell-specific transcriptomic analyses.

The combinatorial olfactory code conveys odor stimulus features in an entangled manner. Si et al. uncover structure and statistical properties in ORN responses that allow separated representations of odor features and shine light on the mechanism of molecular recognition by olfactory receptors.

Humans often need to maintain equilibrium between competing goals. Juechems et al. show that a region in the rostral ACC monitors this equilibrium, whereas the vmPFC encodes the redress in imbalance between goals incurred by choice.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Differences in brain networks and underlying white matter abnormalities have been suggested to underlie symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, robustly characterizing microstructural white matter differences has been challenging. In the present study, we applied an analytic technique that calculates structural metrics specific to differently-oriented fiber bundles within a voxel, termed “fixels”. Fixel-based analyses were used to compare diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from 25 individuals with ASD (mean age = 16.8 years) and 27 typically developing age-matched controls (mean age = 16.9 years). Group comparisons of fiber density (FD) and bundle morphology were run on a fixel-wise, tract-wise, and global white matter (GWM) basis. We found that individuals with ASD had reduced FD, suggestive of decreased axonal count, in several major white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, right arcuate fasciculus, and right uncinate fasciculus, as well as a GWM reduction. Secondary analyses assessed associations with social impairment in participants with ASD, and showed that lower FD in the splenium of the CC was associated with greater social impairment. Our findings suggest that reduced FD could be the primary microstructural white matter abnormality in ASD.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Optic nerve (ON) injury is an established model of axonal injury which results in retrograde degeneration and death of retinal ganglion cells as well anterograde loss of transmission and Wallerian degeneration of the injured axons. While the local impact of ON crush has been extensively documented we know comparatively little about the functional changes that occur in higher visual structures such as primary visual cortex (V1). We explored the extent of adult cortical plasticity using ON crush in aged mice. V1 function of the contralateral hemisphere was assessed longitudinally by intrinsic signal imaging and 2-photon calcium imaging before and after ON crush. Functional imaging demonstrated an immediate shift in V1 ocular dominance towards the ipsilateral, intact eye, due to the expected almost complete loss of responses to contralateral eye stimulation. Surprisingly, within 2 weeks we observed a delayed increase in ipsilateral eye responses. Additionally, spontaneous activity in V1 was reduced, similar to the lesion projection zone after retinal lesions. The observed changes in V1 activity indicate that severe ON injury in adulthood evokes cortical plasticity not only cross-modally but also within the visual cortex; this plasticity may be best compared with that seen after retinal lesions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The primate visual system contains myriad feedback projections from higher- to lower-order cortical areas, an architecture that has been implicated in the top-down modulation of early visual areas during working memory and attention. Here we tested the hypothesis that these feedback projections also modulate early visual cortical activity during the planning of visually guided actions. We show, across three separate human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies involving object-directed movements, that information related to the motor effector to be used (i.e., limb, eye) and action goal to be performed (i.e., grasp, reach) can be selectively decoded—prior to movement—from the retinotopic representation of the target object(s) in early visual cortex. We also find that during the planning of sequential actions involving objects in two different spatial locations, that motor-related information can be decoded from both locations in retinotopic cortex. Together, these findings indicate that movement planning selectively modulates early visual cortical activity patterns in an effector-specific, target-centric, and task-dependent manner. These findings offer a neural account of how motor-relevant target features are enhanced during action planning and suggest a possible role for early visual cortex in instituting a sensorimotor estimate of the visual consequences of movement.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (<span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span>) gene, rs3918242, has been shown to affect <span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span> expression in macrophages and was associated with schizophrenia by two independent groups. However, rs3918242's effects on <span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span> expression were not replicable in cell lines or brain tissue. Additionally, publically available data indicate that rs3918242 genotype is related not to <span style="font-style: italic;">MMP9</span> expression, but rather to expression of <span style="font-style: italic;">SLC12A5</span>, a nearby gene coding for a K+/Cl- cotransporter, whose expression has also been related to schizophrenia. Here, we studied brain structure and function in healthy participants stratified by rs3918242 genotype using structural MRI (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 298), functional MRI during an N-back working memory task (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 554), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during the same task (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 190). We found rs3918242 was associated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally, closely replicated in discovery and replication samples; and with inferior parietal lobule (IPL) GMV when the samples were meta-analytically combined. Additionally, using both fMRI and MEG, rs3918242 was associated with right IPL working memory-related activation, replicated in two cohorts and across imaging modalities. These convergent results provide further impetus for examinations of the relationship of <span style="font-style: italic;">SLC12A5</span> with brain structure and function in neuropsychiatric disease.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Functional connectivity is defined as the statistical dependency of neurophysiological activity between 2 separate brain areas. To investigate the biological characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)—and in particular the significance of connection-wise variation in time-series correlations—rsFC was compared with strychnine-based connectivity measured in the macaque. Strychnine neuronography is a historical technique that induces activity in cortical areas through means of local administration of the substance strychnine. Strychnine causes local disinhibition through GABA suppression and leads to subsequent activation of functional pathways. Multiple resting-state fMRI recordings were acquired in 4 macaques (examining in total 299 imaging runs) from which a group-averaged rsFC matrix was constructed. rsFC was observed to be higher (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.0001) between region-pairs with a strychnine-based connection as compared with region-pairs with no strychnine-based connection present. In particular, higher resting-state connectivity was observed in connections that were relatively stronger (weak &lt; moderate &lt; strong; <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.01) and in connections that were bidirectional (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.0001) instead of unidirectional in strychnine-based connectivity. Our results imply that the level of correlation between brain areas as extracted from resting-state fMRI relates to the strength of underlying interregional functional pathways.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The spontaneous activity of the brain is characterized by an elaborate temporal structure with scale-free properties as indexed by the power law exponent (PLE). We test the hypothesis that spontaneous brain activity modulates task-evoked activity during interactions with animate versus inanimate stimuli. For this purpose, we developed a paradigm requiring participants to actively touch either animate (real hand) or inanimate (mannequin hand) stimuli. Behaviorally, participants perceived the animate target as closer in space, temporally more synchronous with their own self, and more personally relevant, compared with the inanimate. Neuronally, we observed a modulation of task-evoked activity by animate versus inanimate interactions in posterior insula, in medial prefrontal cortex, comprising anterior cingulate cortex, and in medial superior frontal gyrus. Among these regions, an increased functional connectivity was shown between posterior insula and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) during animate compared with inanimate interactions and during resting state. Importantly, PLE during spontaneous brain activity in PACC correlated positively with PACC task-evoked activity during animate versus inanimate stimuli. In conclusion, we demonstrate that brain spontaneous activity in PACC can be related to the distinction between animate and inanimate stimuli and thus might be specifically tuned to align our brain with its animate environment.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Manual interactions with objects require precise and rapid feedback about contact events. These tactile signals are integrated with motor plans throughout the neuraxis to achieve dexterous object manipulation. To better understand the role of somatosensory cortex in interactions with objects, we measured, using chronically implanted arrays of electrodes, the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons to skin indentations designed to simulate the initiation, maintenance, and termination of contact with an object. First, we find that the responses of somatosensory neurons to contact onset and offset dwarf their responses to maintenance of contact. Second, we show that these responses rapidly and reliably encode features of the simulated contact events—their timing, location, and strength—and can account for the animals’ performance in an amplitude discrimination task. Third, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the population response in cortex mirror those of the population response in the nerves. We conclude that the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons are well suited to encode contact transients and are consistent with a role of somatosensory cortex in signaling transitions between task subgoals.</span>

In nonlinear systems, converging oscillatory inputs undergo frequency mixing, resulting in additional oscillations in the system’s response. Neural recordings exhibit spectral properties predicted by this process suggesting that not all oscillations originate from synaptic inputs rhythmically active at corresponding frequencies.

This study tests the E-I ratio hypothesis of autism in four mouse models. All show increased E-I ratio, but E-I changes are precisely coordinated to stabilize synaptic depolarization and spiking, not increase them. E-I changes therefore appear compensatory in autism.

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Andrew C Halley, Leah Krubitzer</p><div><p>A central question in comparative neurobiology concerns how evolution has produced brains with expanded neocortices, composed of more areas with unique connectivity and functional properties. Some mammalian lineages, such as primates, exhibit exceptionally large cortices relative to the amount of sensory inputs from the dorsal thalamus, and this expansion is associated with a larger number of distinct cortical areas, composing a larger proportion of the cortical sheet. We propose a link between the organization of the neocortex and its expansion relative to the size of the dorsal thalamus, based on a combination of work in comparative neuroanatomy and experimental research.</p></div>

In the inner ear, the deflection of hair bundles, the sensory organelles of hair cells, activates mechanically-gated channels (MGCs). Hair bundles monitor orientation of the head, its angular and linear acceleration, and detect sound. Force applied to MGCs is shaped by intrinsic hair-bundle properties, by the mechanical load on the bundle, and by the filter imparted by the environment of the hair bundle. Channel gating and adaptation, the ability of the bundle to reset its operating point, contribute to hair-bundle mechanics.

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Fabian Rentzsch, Celina Juliano, Brigitte Galliot</p><div><p>Cnidarians shared a common ancestor with bilaterians more than 600 million years ago. This sister group relationship gives them an informative phylogenetic position for understanding the fascinating morphological and molecular cell type diversity of bilaterian nervous systems. Moreover, cnidarians display novel features such as endodermal neurogenesis and independently evolved centralizations, which provide a platform for understanding the evolution of nervous system innovations. In recent years, the application of modern genomic tools has significantly advanced our understanding of cnidarian nervous system structure and function. For example, transgenic reporter lines and gene knockdown experiments in several cnidarian species reveal a significant degree of conservation in the neurogenesis gene regulatory program, while single cell RNA sequencing projects are providing a much deeper understanding of cnidarian neural cell type diversity. At the level of neural function, the physiological properties of ion channels have been described and calcium imaging of the nervous system in whole animals has allowed for the identification of neural circuits underlying specific behaviours. Cnidarians have arrived in the modern era of molecular neurobiology and are primed to provide exciting new insights into the early evolution of nervous systems.</p></div>
