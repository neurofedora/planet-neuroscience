              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Temporal pole volume is associated with episodic autobiographical memory in healthy older adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recollection of personal past events differs across the lifespan. Older individuals recall fewer episodic details and convey more semantic information than young. Here we examine how gray matter volumes in temporal lobe regions integral to episodic and semantic memory (hippocampus and temporal poles, respectively) are related to age differences in autobiographical recollection. Gray matter volumes were obtained in healthy young (<i>n</i> = 158) and old (<i>n</i> = 105) adults. The temporal pole was demarcated and hippocampus segmented into anterior and posterior regions to test for volume differences between age groups. The Autobiographical Interview was administered to measure episodic and semantic autobiographical memory. Volume associations with episodic and semantic autobiographical memory were then assessed. Brain volumes were smaller for older adults in the posterior hippocampus. Autobiographical memory was less episodic and more semanticized for older versus younger adults. Older adults also showed positive associations between temporal pole volumes and episodic autobiographical recall; in the young, temporal pole volume was positively associated with performance on standard laboratory measures of semantic memory. Exploratory analyses revealed that age-related episodic autobiographical memory associations with anterior hippocampal volumes depended on sex. These findings suggest that age differences in brain structures implicated in episodic and semantic memory may portend reorganization of neural circuits to support autobiographical memory in later life.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental changes in cerebral NAD and neuroenergetics of an antioxidant compromised mouse model of schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Defects in essential metabolic regulation for energy supply, increased oxidative stress promoting excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and phospholipid membrane dysfunction have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ). The knowledge about the developmental trajectory of these key pathophysiological components and their interplay is important to develop new preventive and treatment strategies. However, this assertion is so far limited. To investigate the developmental regulations of these key components, we assessed, for the first time, in vivo redox state from the oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH) form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD), energy and membrane metabolites, neurotransmitters ({gamma}-aminobutyrate and glutamate) by 31P and 1H MRS during the neurodevelopment of a SZ animal model with genetically compromised glutathione synthesis (gclm-KO mice). When compared to age-matched wild type (WT), an increase in NAD+/NADH redox ratio was found in gclm-KO mice until early adulthood, followed by a decrease in full adults as observed in patients. Especially, in early postnatal life (P20, corresponding to childhood), levels of several metabolites were altered in gclm-KO mice, including NAD+, ATP, phosphocreatine, intracellular pH, glutamine + glutamate and membrane phospholipids components, suggesting an interactive compensation for redox dysregulation between NAD, energy metabolism, and neurotransmission. The identified temporal neurometabolic regulations provide insights in preventive treatment targets for at-risk individuals, and other neurodevelopmental disorders involving oxidative stress and energetic dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A-type FHFs mediate resurgent currents through TTX-resistant voltage-gated sodium channels</a></h4>

              
                Resurgent currents (INaR) produced by voltage-gated sodium channels are required for many neurons to maintain high-frequency firing, and contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and disease pathophysiology. Here we show, for the first time, that INaR can be reconstituted in a heterologous system by co-expression of sodium channel -subunits and A-type fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs). Specifically, A-type FHFs induces INaR from Nav1.8, Nav1.9 tetrodotoxin-resistant neuronal channels and, to a lesser extent, neuronal Nav1.7 and cardiac Nav1.5 channels. Moreover, we identified the N-terminus of FHF as the critical molecule responsible for A-type FHFs-mediated INaR. Among the FHFs, FHF4A is the most important isoform for mediating Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 INaR. In nociceptive sensory neurons, FHF4A knockdown significantly reduces INaR amplitude and the percentage of neurons that generate INaR, substantially suppressing excitability. Thus, our work reveals a novel molecular mechanism underlying TTX-resistant INaR generation and provides important potential targets for pain treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Design of the mammalian cone photoreceptor to Off bipolar cell synapse</a></h4>

              
                Graded synapses in sensory systems reliably transmit small signals in the presence of continuous quantal noise. To understand how signaling is optimized during graded transmission, we counted the number of vesicles released by a mammalian cone terminal and compared it to the simultaneous responses in each Off bipolar cell type. Off bipolar cells contacting the terminal base comprised two groups depending on how they sampled transmitter release. In both groups, responses initially grew non-linearly with the number of released vesicles implicating a role for cooperativity during sparse release. One group sampled release from most of a cones approximately 20 ribbons and can exploit averaging to improve signal reliability. The other, less-sensitive group made 1-3 contacts at the terminal center and responded to pooled transmitter, a consequence of membrane depolarization, using an insensitive kainate receptor. Off bipolar cells use different strategies to minimize transmission noise and encode cone output over different ranges.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential effects of group III metabotropic glutamate receptors on spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents in spine-innervating double bouquet and parvalbumin-expressing dendrite-targeting GABAergic interneurons in human neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Diverse neocortical GABAergic neurons specialise in synaptic targeting and their effects are modulated by presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) suppressing neurotransmitter release in rodents, but their effects in human neocortex are unknown. We tested whether activation of group III mGluRs by L-AP4 changes GABAA receptor-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in two distinct dendritic spine-innervating GABAergic interneurons recorded in vitro in human neocortex. Calbindin-positive double bouquet cells (DBC) had columnar 'horsetail' axons descending through layers II-V innervating dendritic spines (48%) and shafts, but not somata of pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons. Parvalbumin-expressing dendrite-targeting cell (PV-DTC) axons extended in all directions innervating dendritic spines (22%), shafts (65%) and somata (13%). As measured, 20% of GABAergic neuropil synapses innervate spines, hence DBCs, but not PV-DTCs, preferentially select spine targets. Group III mGluR activation paradoxically increased the frequency of sIPSCs in DBCs (to median 137% of baseline), but suppressed it in PV-DTCs (median 92%), leaving the amplitude unchanged. The facilitation of sIPSCs in DBCs may result from their unique GABAergic input being disinhibited via network effect. We conclude that dendritic spines receive specialized, diverse GABAergic inputs, and group III mGluRs differentially regulate GABAergic synaptic transmission to distinct GABAergic cell types in human cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The onset of hearing triggers nuclear translocation in inner hair cells</a></h4>

              
                Nuclear position is precisely orchestrated during cell division, migration, and maturation of cells and tissues. Here we report a previously unrecognized, programmed movement of the nucleus in rat cochlear inner hair cells. This cell-type specific nuclear movement among hair cells of the inner ear offers a new glimpse into the cellular mechanisms involved in the functional maturation of inner hair cells. In early post-natal days, the nucleus sits at the very basal pole of the hair cell, far from the apically located mechano-transducing stereocilia, but close to where synapses with primary afferent and efferent neurons are forming. By maturity, the nucleus moves to occupy a new position half-way along the length of the cell. Remarkably, nuclear translocation happens quickly over the course of 1-2 post-natal days, coinciding with the onset of hearing. The movement of the nucleus likely signals the closing of a critical period correlated with the forming and refining of synapses at the onset of hearing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual Perception of 3D Space and Shape in Time - Part I: 2D Space Perception by 2D Linear Translation</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception plays a critical role in navigating space and extracting useful semantic information crucial to survival. To identify distant landmarks, we constantly shift gaze vectors through saccades, while still maintaining the visual perception of stable allocentric space. How can we sustain stable allocentric space so effortlessly? To solve this question, we have developed a new concept of NHT (Neural Holography Tomography). This model states that retinotopy is invisible (not available to consciousness) and must be converted to a time code by traveling alpha brainwaves to perceive objects consciously. According to this framework, if identical alpha phases are continually assigned to a landmark, we perceive its exact and consistent allocentric location. To test this hypothesis, we designed reaction time (RT) experiments to observe evidence of the predicted space-to-time conversion. Various visual stimuli were generated at a wide range of eccentricities either on a large TV (up to 40{degrees}) or by LED strips on a hemispherical dome (up to 60{degrees}). Participants were instructed to report the observed patterns promptly under either covert (no eye movement) or overt (with eye movement) conditions. As predicted, stimuli presented at the center of fixation always produced the fastest RTs. The additional RT delay was precisely proportional to the eccentricity of the peripheral stimulus presentation. Furthermore, both covert and overt attention protocols created the same RT delays, and trajectories of saccadic eye motions were in parallel to the overt RT vs. eccentricity. These findings strongly support our NHT model, in which the observed RT-eccentricity dependence is indicative of the spatiotemporal conversion required for maintaining a stable allocentric frame of reference. That is, we perceive space by time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural representations of vicarious rewards are linked to interoception and prosocial behaviour</a></h4>

              
                From likes on social media, to seeing other people eat in a restaurant, every day we constantly observe other people receiving rewards. Theoretical accounts posit that vicarious processing of these rewards might be linked to people sensitivity to internal body states (interoception) and facilitates a tendency to act prosocially to obtain positive outcomes for others. However, the neural processes underlying the links between vicarious reward processing, interoception and prosocial behaviour are poorly understood. Previous research has linked vicarious reward processing to the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACCg) and the anterior insula (AI). Can we predict someone tendency to be prosocial, or their propensity to be aware of interoceptive signals, from variability in how the ACCg and AI process other people rewards? Here, participants monitored rewards being delivered to themselves or an anonymous stranger during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a separate session, they performed a task measuring their willingness to be prosocial and exert effort to obtain rewards for others, and a task measuring their propensity to be aware and use interoceptive signals. Using multivariate similarity analysis, we show that people willingness to be prosocial is predicted by greater similarity between self and other representations in the ACCg. Moreover, greater dissimilarity in self-other representations in the AI is linked to a greater interoceptive propensity. These findings highlight that vicarious reward representations are linked to bodily signals in AI, and foster prosocial tendencies through the ACCg, with such information represented when simply seeing stimuli that indicate other people rewards.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pinch2 is a novel regulator of myelination in the Central Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                The extensive morphological changes of oligodendrocytes during axon ensheathment and myelination involve assembly of the Ilk-Parvin-Pinch (IPP) heterotrimeric complex of proteins to relay essential mechanical and biochemical signals between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. Binding of Pinch 1 and 2 isoforms to Ilk is mutually exclusive and allows the formation of distinct IPP complexes with specific signaling properties. Using tissue-specific conditional gene ablation in mice, we reveal an essential role for Pinch2 during central nervous system myelination. Unlike Pinch1-gene ablation, loss of Pinch2 in oligodendrocytes results in hypermyelination and in the formation of pathological myelin outfoldings in white matter regions. These structural changes concurred with inhibition of Rho GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 activities and phenocopied aspects of myelin pathology observed in corresponding mouse mutants. We propose a dual role for Pinch2 in preventing excess of myelin wraps through RhoA-dependent control of membrane growth and in fostering myelin stability via Cdc42-dependent organization of cytoskeletal septins. Together, these findings indicate that IPP-containing Pinch2 is a novel critical cell-autonomous molecular hub ensuring synchronous control of key signaling networks during developmental myelination.

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has posed challenges to maintaining medical care for patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). The Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease during the COVID-19 Pandemic (ParCoPa) survey was conducted as an online, nationwide, cross-sectional survey from December 2020 to March 2021 and aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the medical care of PD patients from the physicians&amp;amp;rsquo; perspective. Invitations containing a randomly generated registration code were mailed to healthcare professionals from sixty-seven specialty centers in Germany. Confounders for the worsening of subjective treatment quality, perceived health risk due to the profession, and adequate protective measures against SARS-CoV-2 were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Of all forty physicians who responded, 87.5% reported a worsening of motor and nonmotor symptoms in their patients, 97.5% experienced cancellation of appointments, and difficulties in organizing advanced and supplementary therapies were reported by over 95%. Participants offered alternative consultation options, mostly in the form of telephone (77.5%) or online (64.1%) consultations, but telephone consultations were the most accepted by patients (&amp;amp;ldquo;broadly accepted&amp;amp;rdquo;, 40.0%). We identified pandemic-related deficits in providing care for patients with PD and areas of improvement to ensure continued care for this vulnerable patient population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Reward Value Enhances Sequence Monitoring Ramping Dynamics as Ending Rewards Approach in the Rostrolateral Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Many fundamental human behaviors contain multiple sequences performed to reach a desired outcome, such as cooking. Reward is inherently associated with sequence completion and has been shown to generally enhance cognitive control. However, the impact of reward on cognitive sequence processing remains unexplored. To address this key question, we focused on the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC). This area is necessary and exhibits increasing ("ramping") activation during sequences, a dynamic that may be related to reward processing in other brain regions. To separate these dynamics, we designed a task where reward was only provided after multiple four-item sequences ("iterations"), rather than each individual sequence. Using fMRI in humans, we investigated three possible interactions of reward and sequential control signals in RLPFC: (1) with the visibility of sequential cues, i.e., memory; (2) equally across individual sequence iterations; and (3) differently across individual sequence iterations (e.g., increasing as reward approaches). Evidence from previous, nonsequential cognitive control experiments suggested that reward would uniformly change RLPFC activity across iterations and may depend on the visibility of cues. However, we found the influence of reward on RLPFC ramping increased across sequence iterations and did not interact with memory. These results suggest an active, predictive, and distinctive role for RLPFC in sequence monitoring and integration of reward information, consistent with extant literature demonstrating similar accelerating reward-related dopamine dynamics in regions connected to RLPFC. These results have implications for understanding sequential behavior in daily life, and when they go awry in disorders such as addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence for Paracrine Protective Role of Exogenous {alpha}A-Crystallin in Retinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Expression and secretion of neurotrophic factors have long been known as a key mechanism of neuroglial interaction in the central nervous system. In addition, several other intrinsic neuroprotective pathways have been described, including those involving small heat shock proteins such as &alpha;-crystallins. While initially considered as a purely intracellular mechanism, both &alpha;A-crystallins and &alpha;B-crystallins have been recently reported to be secreted by glial cells. While an anti-apoptotic effect of such secreted &alpha;A-crystallin has been suggested, its regulation and protective potential remain unclear. We recently identified residue threonine 148 (T148) and its phosphorylation as a critical regulator of &alpha;A-crystallin intrinsic neuroprotective function. In the current study, we explored how mutation of this residue affected &alpha;A-crystallin chaperone function, secretion, and paracrine protective function using primary glial and neuronal cells. After demonstrating the paracrine protective effect of &alpha;A-crystallins secreted by primary Mu&#x0308;ller glial cells (MGCs), we purified and characterized recombinant &alpha;A-crystallin proteins mutated on the T148 regulatory residue. Characterization of the biochemical properties of these mutants revealed an increased chaperone activity of the phosphomimetic T148D mutant. Consistent with this observation, we also show that exogeneous supplementation of the phosphomimetic T148D mutant protein protected primary retinal neurons from metabolic stress despite similar cellular uptake. In contrast, the nonphosphorylatable mutant was completely ineffective. Altogether, our study demonstrates the paracrine role of &alpha;A-crystallin in the central nervous system as well as the therapeutic potential of functionally enhanced &alpha;A-crystallin recombinant proteins to prevent metabolic-stress induced neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Antidiabetic Drug Metformin Regulates Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel NaV1.7 via the Ubiquitin-Ligase NEDD4-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>The antidiabetic drug metformin has been shown to reduce pain hypersensitivity in preclinical models of chronic pain and in neuropathic pain in humans. Multiple intracellular pathways have been described as metformin targets. Among them, metformin is an activator of the adenosine 5'-monophosphate protein kinase that can in turn modulate the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2 and thus post-translational expression of voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<SUB>V</SUB>s). In this study, we found that the bulk of the effect of metformin on Na1.7 is dependent on NEDD4-2. In HEK cells, the expression of Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7 at the membrane fraction, obtained by a biotinylation approach, is only reduced by metformin when cotransfected with NEDD4-2. Similarly, in voltage-clamp recordings, metformin significantly reduced Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7 current density when cotransfected with NEDD4-2. In mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, without changing the biophysical properties of Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7, metformin significantly decreased Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7 current densities, but not in <I>Nedd4L</I> knock-out mice (<I>SNS-Nedd4L</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>). In addition, metformin induced a significant reduction in NEDD4-2 phosphorylation at the serine-328 residue in DRG neurons, an inhibitory phosphorylation site of NEDD4-2. In current-clamp recordings, metformin reduced the number of action potentials elicited by DRG neurons from <I>Nedd4L<sup>fl/fl</sup></I>, with a partial decrease also present in <I>SNS-Nedd4L</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, suggesting that metformin can also change neuronal excitability in an NEDD4-2-independent manner. We suggest that NEDD4-2 is a critical player for the effect of metformin on the excitability of nociceptive neurons; this action may contribute to the relief of neuropathic pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Economic burden of out-of-pocket expenditure, productivity cost during pregnancy and COVID-19 impact on household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka; A study protocol [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservat</a></h4>

              
                Background: Investigating the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) associated with maternal health is important since OOPE directly affects the affordability of health services. Global evidence suggests the importance of capturing the productivity cost during pregnancy in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism. Furthermore, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the household economy needs to be further evaluated as pregnant women are one of the most vulnerable groups. This study aims at determining the economic burden of OOPE, productivity cost, and COVID-19 impact on pregnant women's household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka. Methods: The study setting is all 22 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. The study has three components; a follow-up study of a cohort of pregnant women to assess the magnitude and associated factors of OOPE and to assess the productivity cost (Component 1), a qualitative case study to explore the impact and causes of the OOPE under free health services (Component 2) and a cross-sectional study to describe the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on household economy (Component 3). The study samples consist of 1,573 and 1,460 participants for components one and three, respectively, and 25 pregnant women will be recruited for component two. The data will be analyzed using descriptive, parametric, and non-parametric statistics for the first and third components and thematic analysis for the second component. Discussion: With the lack of evidence on OOPE, productivity loss/cost in terms of maternal health, and COVID-19 impact on household economy in Sri Lanka, the evidence generated from this study would be valuable for policymakers, health care administrators, and health care practitioners globally, regionally, and locally to plan for future measures for reducing the OOPE, productivity loss/cost, and minimizing the economic hardship of the COVID-19 outbreak during pregnancy.

                Background:  India is endemic for Plasmodium vivax (Pv) malaria. Despite a decrease in incidence, its elimination is hampered by recurrences. This study aimed to characterize recurrences in Pv malaria and study its association with primaquine (PQ) usage. Methods:  Symptomatic adult Pv patients were followed-up for up to 23 months for recurrences. The time to recurrence was compared by the PQ dosage they received using a log-rank test. Results: Of the 294 malaria patients, 206 (70%) patients had Pv infection during the study period. A total of 20 (9.7%) recurrences were seen in 17 (8.2%) patients of Pv. The percentage of first-time recurrences were highest in the no PQ group (25%), followed by the weekly PQ group (20%), low dose daily PQ (8.2%) group, and high dose daily PQ group (3.1%). Conclusions: Recurrence in Pv malaria is common, especially in those who receive an inappropriate prescription of primaquine.

                Background: The present study was designed to isolate and identify the phyto-pathogen responsible for black rot of Citrus sinensis, and to determine its biological control measures. Methods: The pathogen was isolated from infected oranges and cultured on Luria-Bertani medium. Gram staining method was used to identify the morphological characteristics of the causal agents of the black rot. Advanced molecular technique was applied to facilitate proper detection of the isolated bacteria. Phylogenetic trees were analyzed using the Neighbor-Joining method. Antimicrobial screening was conducted by disc diffusion method. Antagonistic activity was evaluated by well diffusion method. Results: Gram staining of the causal agent showed rod shaped, small and pink bacteria. Polymerase chain reaction of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplified an approximately 1465 bp product. The nucleotide sequences of the isolated bacterial sample 1 (BS1) and bacterial sample 2 (BS2) had 99.34% and 99.45% similarities with the reference of Serratia marcescens sequence in NCBI GenBank. The obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank. Two isolates showed virulence capability on some fresh fruits, which confirmed the stain detection and Koch’s postulates. Allium sativum extract showed the largest (27.33±1.5 mm) diameter of zone of inhibition against BS1, at 30µg/disc concentration. In the antagonistic assay, Rhizobium leguminosarum showed largest (19±1 mm) zone of inhibition against BS1. Conclusions: Findings of the current investigations are constructive for identification of causative pathogens in Citrus sinensis black rot disease and their biological control measures.

                Sustainability of research infrastructures (RIs) is a big challenge for funders, stakeholders and operators, and the development and adoption of adequate management tools is a major concern, namely tools for monitoring and evaluating their performance and impact. BioData.pt is the Portuguese Infrastructure of Biological and Portuguese node of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures "Landmark" ELIXIR. The foundations of this national research infrastructure were laid under the “Building BioData.pt” project, for four years. During this period, performance and impact indicators were collected and analysed under the light of international guidelines for assessing the performance and impact of European research infrastructures produced by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the EU-funded RI-PATHS project. The exercise shared herein showed that these frameworks can be adopted by national RIs, with the necessary adaptations, namely to reflect the national landscape and specificity of activities, and can be powerful tools in supporting the management of RIs. “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted, counts”.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of risk factors for obesity, diabetes mellitus and hypertension in high school children and screening of high-risk children for glycosuria: A cross-sectional study in Dharwad District, India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: India is currently undergoing a demographic and epidemiological transition leading to the occurrence of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, which were once considered as disease of the elderly among the adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Dharwad district, Karnataka, including 1600 students between 11–17 years age group, across both private and government schools located in both rural and urban areas; information on socio-demographic variables, physical activity, dietary habits, substance abuse, and family history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and level of stress among participants was collected. Anthropometric measurements were taken, blood pressure was measured, general physical examination was done to look for signs of insulin resistance. Urine was examined for the presence of glucose using urine glucose strips in overweight children with ≥2 risk factors (American Diabetes Association criteria for children). Results: Prevalence of overweight/obesity was 4.6% and hypertension was 14.8%. Multivariate logistic regression done for variables found significant in univariate analysis on comparison of risk factors between overweight and normal children showed higher odds for family h/o diabetes (OR = 1.14, CI: 0.58–2.23), private school (OR = 1.5, CI: 0.75–2.96), high socio-economic status (OR = 2.0, CI: 0.95–4.30), hypertension (OR = 2.0, CI: 0.95–4.30) and acanthosis nigricans (OR = 219, CI: 71.49–672.42) among overweight and for variables found significant in univariate analysis on comparison of risk factors between hypertensives and normotensives showed higher odds for inadequate sleep (OR = 1.4, CI: 1.00–1.87), private school (OR = 1.32, CI: 0.96–1.81), high SES (OR = 1.43, CI: 0.95–2.14), psychological stress (OR = 1.97, CI: 1.42–2.73) and obesity (OR = 6.98, CI: 3.75–12.98). Conclusions: Health education on healthy diet consumption and physical activity, BMI calculation and tracking of blood pressure should be integrated into school health programs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stimulating at the right time to recover network states in a model of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit</a></h4>

Synchronization of neural oscillations is thought to facilitate communication in the brain. Neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) can result in synaptic reorganization of the motor circuit, leading to altered neuronal dynamics and impaired neural communication. Treatments for PD aim to restore network function via pharmacological means such as dopamine replacement, or by suppressing pathological oscillations with deep brain stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that brain stimulation can operate beyond a simple “reversible lesion” effect to augment network communication. Specifically, we examined the modulation of beta band (14–30 Hz) activity, a known biomarker of motor deficits and potential control signal for stimulation in Parkinson’s. To do this we setup a neural mass model of population activity within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuit with parameters that were constrained to yield spectral features comparable to those in experimental Parkinsonism. We modulated the connectivity of two major pathways known to be disrupted in PD and constructed statistical summaries of the spectra and functional connectivity of the resulting spontaneous activity. These were then used to assess the network-wide outcomes of closed-loop stimulation delivered to motor cortex and phase locked to subthalamic beta activity. Our results demonstrate that the spatial pattern of beta synchrony is dependent upon the strength of inputs to the STN. Precisely timed stimulation has the capacity to recover network states, with stimulation phase inducing activity with distinct spectral and spatial properties. These results provide a theoretical basis for the design of the next-generation brain stimulators that aim to restore neural communication in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Global dynamics of microbial communities emerge from local interaction rules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simon van Vliet, Christoph Hauert, Kyle Fridberg, Martin Ackermann, Alma Dal Co</p>

Most microbes live in spatially structured communities (e.g., biofilms) in which they interact with their neighbors through the local exchange of diffusible molecules. To understand the functioning of these communities, it is essential to uncover how these local interactions shape community-level properties, such as the community composition, spatial arrangement, and growth rate. Here, we present a mathematical framework to derive community-level properties from the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell-cell interactions for systems consisting of two cell types. Our framework consists of two parts: a biophysical model to derive the local interaction rules (i.e. interaction range and strength) from the molecular parameters underlying the cell-cell interactions and a graph based model to derive the equilibrium properties of the community (i.e. composition, spatial arrangement, and growth rate) from these local interaction rules. Our framework shows that key molecular parameters underlying the cell-cell interactions (e.g., the uptake and leakage rates of molecules) determine community-level properties. We apply our model to mutualistic cross-feeding communities and show that spatial structure can be detrimental for these communities. Moreover, our model can qualitatively recapitulate the properties of an experimental microbial community. Our framework can be extended to a variety of systems of two interacting cell types, within and beyond the microbial world, and contributes to our understanding of how community-level properties emerge from microscopic interactions between cells.

                Possession of a firearm without a certified valid license is against Nepalese law. Following a decade-long civil war, Nepal government issued stringent laws not allowing public to possess firearms without a valid reason, despite bearing a license. However, there are people who possess and use firearms for hunting purposes. The present case reports an accidental death of a teenage boy who used a musket for hunting. The present case highlights the fact that despite these stringent laws, illegal possession of arms for trophy hunting is still prevalent in rural Nepal. Furthermore, this study aims to highlight the importance of paramedics in early intervention, stabilization and transport of the sick and injured to the hospital in emergency situations. Also, recruitment of paramedics in the ambulance service might have prevented untimely death in this particular case.

                Background: Monetary and other incentives may increase recruitment to randomised controlled trials. Methods: 2x2 factorial ‘study within a trial’ of including a pen and/or £5 (GBP) in cash with a postal recruitment pack to increase the number of participants randomised into the host trial (‘Gentle Years Yoga’) for older adults with multimorbidity. Secondary outcomes: return, and time to return, of screening form, and the cost per additional participant randomised. Binary data were analysed using logistic regression and time to return using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results: 818 potential host trial participants were included. Between those sent a pen (n=409) and not sent a pen (n=409), there was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of participants randomised (15 (3.7%) versus 11 (2.7%); OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.63–3.04), in returning a screening form (66 (16.1%) versus 61 (14.9%); OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75–1.61) nor in time to return the screening form (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.77–1.55). Between those sent £5 (n=409) and not sent £5 (n=409), there was no evidence of increased randomisation (14 (3.4%) versus 12 (2.9%); OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.54–2.57), but more screening forms were returned (77 (18.8%) versus 50 (12.2%); OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.13–2.45) and there was decreased time to return screening form (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.09–2.22). No significant interaction between the interventions was observed. The cost per additional participant randomised was £32 and £1000 for the pen and £5, respectively. Conclusion: A small, monetary incentive did not result in more participants being randomised into the host trial but did encourage increased and faster response to the recruitment invitation. Since it is relatively costly, we do not recommend this intervention for use to increase recruitment in this population. Pens were cheaper but did not provide evidence of benefit.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A predictive model for daily cumulative COVID-19 cases in Ghana [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected the daily life, governments and economies of many countries all over the globe. Ghana is currently experiencing a surge in the number of cases with a corresponding increase in the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths. The surge in cases and deaths clearly shows that the preventive and management measures are ineffective and that policy makers lack a complete understanding of the dynamics of the disease. Most of the deaths in Ghana are due to lack of adequate health equipment and facilities for managing the disease. Knowledge of the number of cases in advance would aid policy makers in allocating sufficient resources for the effective management of the cases. Methods: A predictive tool is necessary for the effective management and prevention of cases. This study presents a predictive tool that has the ability to accurately forecast the number of cumulative cases. The study applied polynomial and spline models on the COVID-19 data for Ghana, to develop a generalized additive model (GAM) that accurately captures the growth pattern of the cumulative cases. Results: The spline model and the GAM provide accurate forecast values. Conclusion: Cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Ghana are expected to continue to increase if appropriate preventive measures are not enforced. Vaccination against the virus is ongoing in Ghana, thus, future research would consider evaluating the impact of the vaccine.

                Background: Excessive trace element exposure has been linked to a variety of harmful health impacts. The goal of this study was to track the amounts of several trace elements in boneless whole chicken samples collected from various shops in Amman, Jordan. Methods: Using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), 30 samples were collected and examined for aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chrome (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). The calculated health risk in Jordanians was based on the measured concentrations of these elements. Results: The element concentrations were such that Fe > Zn > Al > Mn > Cu > Cr > As > Pb > Cd > Hg, with As, Cu, Mn, and Zn exceeding the maximum allowable levels. The combined THQs for these trace elements, on the other hand, were 25.22, a value > 1, indicating a non-carcinogenic effects in adult population. As, Cd, and Cr had cancer risk factors that were 46.80, 8.81, and 41.42 times higher than the acceptable lifetime carcinogenic risk (10-5), respectively. Conclusions: Current research shows that Jordanian consumers are at risk of eating boneless whole chicken.

     alt="Gray matter volume reduction in the emotional brain networks in adults with anosmia"/>
<p>In our study, we examined the network-level changes of the gray matter volumes in anosmia. Patients with anosmia had the lower gray matter volumes in the emotional brain networks relative to healthy controls. Based on a significant association between the gray matter volume loss and lower olfactory-specific quality of life, we assume that these morphometric network changes may be closely related to emotional dysfunctions in anosmia.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Loss of olfaction, or anosmia, frequently accompanies emotional dysfunctions, partly due to the overlapping brain regions between the olfactory and emotional processing centers. Here, we investigated whether anosmia was associated with gray matter volume alterations at a network level, and whether these alterations were related to the olfactory-specific quality of life (QOL) and depressive symptoms. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 22 individuals with postinfectious or idiopathic anosmia (the anosmia group) and 30 age- and sex-matched controls (the control group). Using independent component analysis on the gray matter volumes, we identified 10 morphometric networks. The gray matter volumes of these networks were compared between the two groups. Olfactory-specific QOL and depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaires and clinician-administered interviews, respectively. The anosmia group showed lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala and the precuneus networks, relative to the control group. Lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala network were also linearly associated with lower olfactory-specific QOL and higher depressive symptom scores. These findings suggest a close relationship between anosmia and gray matter volume alterations in the emotional brain networks, albeit without determined causal relations.</p>

                Sustained exposure to a young systemic environment rejuvenates aged organisms and promotes cellular function. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of tissues it remains challenging to pinpoint niche-independent effects of circulating factors on specific cell populations. Here we describe a method for the encapsulation of human and mouse skeletal muscle progenitors in diffusible polyethersulfone hollow fiber capsules that can be used to profile systemic aging <i>in vivo</i> independent of heterogeneous short-range tissue interactions. We observed that circulating long-range signaling factors in the old systemic environment lead to an activation of Myc and E2F transcription factors, induce senescence and suppress myogenic differentiation. Importantly, <i>in vitro </i>profiling using young and old serum in 2D culture does not capture all pathways deregulated in encapsulated cells in aged mice. Thus, <i>in vivo</i> transcriptomic profiling using cell encapsulation allows for the characterization of effector pathways of systemic aging with unparalleled accuracy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The TRRAP transcription cofactor represses interferon-stimulated genes in colorectal cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Transcription is essential for cells to respond to signaling cues and involves factors with multiple distinct activities. One such factor, TRRAP, functions as part of two large complexes, SAGA and TIP60, which have crucial roles during transcription activation. Structurally, TRRAP belongs to the PIKK family but is the only member classified as a pseudokinase. Recent studies established that a dedicated HSP90 co-chaperone, the TTT complex, is essential for PIKK stabilization and activity. Here, using endogenous auxin-inducible degron alleles, we show that the TTT subunit TELO2 promotes TRRAP assembly into SAGA and TIP60 in human colorectal cancer cells (CRC). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TELO2 contributes to TRRAP regulatory roles in CRC cells, most notably of MYC target genes. Surprisingly, TELO2 and TRRAP depletion also induced the expression of type I interferon genes. Using a combination of nascent RNA, antibody-targeted chromatin profiling (CUT&amp;RUN), ChIP, and kinetic analyses, we propose a model by which TRRAP directly represses the transcription of <i>IRF9</i>, which encodes a master regulator of interferon stimulated genes. We have therefore uncovered an unexpected transcriptional repressor role for TRRAP, which we propose contributes to its tumorigenic activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Assembly of recombinant tau into filaments identical to those of Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Abundant filamentous inclusions of tau are characteristic of more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases that are collectively termed tauopathies. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of tau amyloid filaments from human brain revealed that distinct tau folds characterise many different diseases. A lack of laboratory-based model systems to generate these structures has hampered efforts to uncover the molecular mechanisms that underlie tauopathies. Here, we report <i>in vitro </i>assembly conditions with recombinant tau that replicate the structures of filaments from both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), as determined by cryo-EM. Our results suggest that post-translational modifications of tau modulate filament assembly, and that previously observed additional densities in AD and CTE filaments may arise from the presence of inorganic salts, like phosphates and sodium chloride. <i>In vitro </i>assembly of tau into disease-relevant filaments will facilitate studies to determine their roles in different diseases, as well as the development of compounds that specifically bind to these structures or prevent their formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Detection of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in patients with neurofibromatosis using aneuploidy and mutation identification in plasma</a></h4>

              
                Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are the deadliest cancer that arises in individuals diagnosed with neurofibromatosis and account for nearly 5% of the 15,000 soft tissue sarcomas diagnosed in the United States each year. Comprised of neoplastic Schwann cells, primary risk factors for developing MPNST include existing plexiform neurofibromas (PN), prior radiotherapy treatment, and expansive germline mutations involving the entire <i>NF1</i> gene and surrounding genes. PN develop in nearly 30-50% of patients with NF1 and most often grow rapidly in the first decade of life. One of the most important aspects of clinical care for NF1 patients is monitoring PN for signs of malignant transformation to MPNST that occurs in 10-15% of patients. We perform aneuploidy analysis on ctDNA from 883 ostensibly healthy individuals and 28 patients with neurofibromas, including 7 patients with benign neurofibroma, 9 patients with PN and 12 patients with MPNST. Overall sensitivity for detecting MPNST using genome wide aneuploidy scoring was 33%, and analysis of sub-chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) improved sensitivity to 50% while retaining a high specificity of 97%. In addition, we performed mutation analysis on plasma cfDNA for a subset of patients and identified mutations in <i>NF1</i>, <i>NF2</i>, <i>RB1</i>, <i>TP53BP2</i>, and <i>GOLGA2</i>. Given the high throughput and relatively low sequencing coverage required by our assay, liquid biopsy represents a promising technology to identify incipient MPNST.

                Failures of neural tube closure are common and serious birth defects, yet we have a poor understanding of the interaction of genetics and cell biology during neural tube closure. Additionally, mutations that cause neural tube defects (NTDs) tend to affect anterior or posterior regions of the neural tube but rarely both, indicating a regional specificity to NTD genetics. To better understand the regional specificity of cell behaviors during neural tube closure, we analyzed the dynamic localization of actin and N-cadherin via high-resolution tissue-level time-lapse microscopy during <i>Xenopus</i> neural tube closure. To investigate the regionality of gene function, we generated mosaic mutations in <i>shroom3</i>, a key regulator or neural tube closure. This new analytical approach elucidates several differences between cell behaviors during cranial/anterior and spinal/posterior neural tube closure, provides mechanistic insight into the function of <i>shroom3 </i>and demonstrates the ability of tissue-level imaging and analysis to generate cell-biological mechanistic insights into neural tube closure.

                The establishment of pregnancy in human necessitates appropriate decidualization of stromal cells, which involves steroids regulated periodic transformation of endometrial stromal cells during menstrual cycle. However, the potential molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the initiation and maintenance of decidualization in humans is yet to be fully elucidated. In this investigation, we document that SOX4 is a key regulator of human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) decidualization by directly regulating FOXO1 expression as revealed by whole genomic binding of SOX4 assay and RNA-Seq. Besides, our immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry results unravel that SOX4 modulates progesterone receptor (PGR) stability through repressing E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC4 mediated degradation. More importantly, we provide evidence that dysregulated SOX4-HERC4-PGR axis is a potential cause of defective decidualization and recurrent implantation failure (RIF) in IVF patients. In summary, this study evidences that SOX4 is a new and critical regulator for human endometrial decidualization, and provides insightful information for the pathology of decidualization-related infertility and will pave the way for pregnancy improvement.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cellular assays identify barriers impeding iron-sulfur enzyme activity in a non-native prokaryotic host</a></h4>

              
                Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are ancient and ubiquitous protein cofactors and play irreplaceable roles in many metabolic and regulatory processes. Fe-S clusters are built and distributed to Fe-S enzymes by dedicated protein networks. The core components of these networks are widely conserved and highly versatile. However, Fe-S proteins and enzymes are often inactive outside their native host species. We sought to systematically investigate the compatibility of Fe-S networks with non-native Fe-S enzymes. By using collections of Fe-S enzyme orthologs representative of the entire range of prokaryotic diversity, we uncovered a striking correlation between phylogenetic distance and probability of functional expression. Moreover, coexpression of a heterologous Fe-S biogenesis pathway increases the phylogenetic range of orthologs that can be supported by the foreign host. We also find that Fe-S enzymes that require specific electron carrier proteins are rarely functionally expressed unless their taxon-specific reducing partners are identified and co-expressed. We demonstrate how these principles can be applied to improve the activity of a radical <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine(rSAM) enzyme from a <i>Streptomyces</i> antibiotic biosynthesis pathway in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Our results clarify how oxygen sensitivity and incompatibilities with foreign Fe-S and electron transfer networks each impede heterologous activity. In particular, identifying compatible electron transfer proteins and heterologous Fe-S biogenesis pathways may prove essential for engineering functional Fe-S enzyme-dependent pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural dynamics determine voltage and pH gating in human voltage-gated proton channel</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated ion channels are key players of electrical signaling in cells. As a unique subfamily, voltage-gated proton (Hv) channels are standalone voltage sensors without separate ion conductive pores. Hv channels are gated by both voltage and transmembrane proton gradient (i.e ∆pH), serving as acid extruders in most cells. Amongst their many functions, Hv channels are known for regulating the intracellular pH of human spermatozoa and compensating for the charge and pH imbalances caused by NADPH oxidases in phagocytes. Like the canonical voltage sensors, Hv channels are a bundle of 4 helices (named S1 through S4), with the S4 segment carrying 3 positively charged Arg residues. Extensive structural and electrophysiological studies on voltage-gated ion channels, in general, agree on an outwards movement of the S4 segment upon activating voltage, but the real-time conformational transitions are still unattainable. With purified human voltage-gated proton (hHv1) channels reconstituted in liposomes, we have examined its conformational dynamics, including the S4 segment at different voltage and pHs using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). Here, we provide the first glimpse of real-time conformational trajectories of the hHv1 voltage sensor and show that both voltage and pH gradient shift the conformational dynamics of the S4 segment to control channel gating. Our results indicate that the S4 segment transits among 3 major conformational states and kinetic analysis suggest that only the transitions between the inward and outward conformations are highly dependent on voltage and pH changes. Our smFRET studies uncover the stochastic conformational dynamics of S4 and demonstrate how voltage and pH shift its conformational distributions to regulate channel gating. Altogether, we propose a kinetic model that explains the mechanisms underlying voltage and pH gating in Hv channels, which may also serve as a general framework for understanding the voltage sensing and gating in other voltage-gated ion channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fracture healing is delayed in the absence of gasdermin - interleukin-1 signaling</a></h4>

              
                Amino-terminal fragments from proteolytically cleaved gasdermins (GSDMs) form plasma membrane pores that enable the secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Excessive GSDM-mediated pore formation can compromise the integrity of the plasma membrane thereby causing the lytic inflammatory cell death, pyroptosis. We found that GSDMD and GSDME were the only GSDMs that were readily expressed in bone microenvironment. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that GSDMD and GSDME are implicated in fracture healing owing to their role in the obligatory inflammatory response following injury. We found that bone callus volume and biomechanical properties of injured bones were significantly reduced in mice lacking either GSDM compared with wild-type (WT) mice, indicating that fracture healing was compromised in mutant mice. However, compound loss of GSDMD and GSDME did not exacerbate the outcomes, suggesting shared actions of both GSDMs in fracture healing. Mechanistically, bone injury induced IL-1β and IL-18 secretion <i>in vivo</i>, a response that was mimicked <i>in vitro</i> by bone debris and ATP, which function as inflammatory danger signals. Importantly, the secretion of these cytokines was attenuated in conditions of GSDMD deficiency. Finally, deletion of IL-1 receptor reproduced the phenotype of <i>Gsdmd</i> or <i>Gsdme</i> deficient mice, implying that inflammatory responses induced by the GSDM-IL-1 axis promote bone healing after fracture.

                Stereopsis is traditionally measured with noise-based stereo tests while the observer views the test in primary gaze. We investigated the effect of stimulus sparseness and axial variations of interocular disparity induced via head rotations. First, we measured stereoacuity using a 4-Alternative-Forced-Choice (4-AFC) task with three uncrossed and one crossed disparity bandpass-filtered circles on a passive-3-D-monitor. Ten binocularly-normal adults fixated a central cross and clicked on the circle withcrossed disparity for forty trials/condition. Observers adopted head tilts of 0{degrees} or {+/-}20{degrees} pitch, roll, or yaw, enforced with an innertial measurement unit and fixation enforced with an eye tracker. Next, we measured stereoacuity in 8 adults while either the head (H), monitor (M), or both (B) were tilted 0{degrees}, {+/-}22.5{degrees}, or {+/-}45{degrees} roll in random order (eighty trials/condition) using a 4-AFC task and random-dot stimuli. Head tilts did not signifcantly alter stereoacuity using narrow-band stimuli(p>0.05), despite that IPDs and the axis of disparity were differentially affected by the tilts. However, for random dot stimuli, stereoacuity decreased with increasing orientation difference between the head and monitor (H and M: p<0.05; B: p>0.05].  Head tilt decreases IPD and rotates the axis of interocular disparity, however, these manipulations affect stereoacuity when measured with noise stimuli but not with sparse stimuli. The results are consistent with a vestibular input to stereoscopic disparity processing that can be detected by sparse stimuli but is masked by dense stimuli. The results have implications for natural vision and for clinical screening in patients with abnormal head posture.

                The ability to sense Earth's gravitational pull is essential for orientation, navigation, and proprioception in most organisms. Here, we demonstrate that C. elegans adults and dauers exhibit negative gravitaxis and that this behavior is modulated by other environmental inputs such as light and electromagnetic fields. We found that components of the DEG/ENaC pathway involved in gentle touch sensation - specifically the neuronally-enriched microtubule subunits MEC-7 and MEC-12, but not the related MEC-4 and MEC-10 mechanosensory subunits - are required for negative gravitaxis. In addition, we found that TRPA-1, a receptor protein associated with cold and mechanosensation in both mammals and invertebrates, is critical for this behavior. Finally, we show that PVD neurons, which utilize TRPA-1 to detect harsh cold, are also essential for gravity sensation. Conversely, TRNs are not required for this behavior. These findings implicate a complex, interconnected mechanism for gravity sensation involving an ion channel that is also present in the mammalian vestibular system.

                Background and Objectives: Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is a well-defined developmental disorder characterized by failed neuronal migration, which forms ectopic neuronal nodules along the ventricular walls. Previous studies mainly focus on clinical symptoms caused by the PVNH tissue, such as seizures. However, little is known about whether and how neurons in the PVNH tissue functionally communicate with neurons in the neocortex. Methods: To probe this, we applied magnetoencephalography (MEG) and stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) recordings to patients with PVNH during resting and task states. Results: By estimating frequency-resolved phase coupling strength of the source-reconstructed neural activities, we found that the PVNH tissue was spontaneously coupled with the neocortex in the  to {beta} frequency range, which was consistent with the synchronization pattern within the neocortical network. Furthermore, the coupling strength between PVNH and sensory areas effectively modulated the local neural activity in sensory areas. In both MEG and sEEG visual experiments, the PVNH tissue exhibited visual evoked responses, with a similar pattern and latency as the ipsilateral visual cortex. Discussion: These findings demonstrate that PVNH is functionally integrated into cognition-related cortical circuits, suggesting a co-development perspective of ectopic neurons after their migration failure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic causal modelling shows a prominent role of local inhibition in alpha power modulation in higher visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                During resting-state EEG recordings, alpha activity is more prominent over the posterior cortex in eyes-closed (EC) conditions compared to eyes-open (EO). In this study, we characterized the difference in spectra between EO and EC conditions using dynamic causal modelling. Specifically, we investigated the role of intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity--within the visual cortex--in generating EC-EO alpha power differences over posterior electrodes. The primary visual cortex (V1) and the bilateral middle temporal visual areas (V5) were equipped with bidirectional extrinsic connections using a canonical microcircuit. The states of four intrinsically coupled subpopulations--within each occipital source--were also modelled. Using Bayesian model selection, we tested whether modulations of the intrinsic connections in V1, V5 or extrinsic connections (or a combination thereof) provided the best evidence for the data. In addition, using parametric empirical Bayes (PEB), we estimated group averages under the winning model. Bayesian model selection showed that the winning model contained both extrinsic connectivity modulations, as well as intrinsic connectivity modulations in all sources. The PEB analysis revealed increased extrinsic connectivity during EC. Overall, we found a reduction in the inhibitory intrinsic connections during EC. The results suggest that the intrinsic modulations in V5 played the most important role in producing EC-EO alpha differences, suggesting an intrinsic disinhibition in higher order visual cortex, during EC resting state.

                The human brain can infer temporal regularities across cardiac and auditory inputs. Here, we investigated whether cardio-audio regularity processing occurs during sleep, when the balance between bodily and environmental stimulus processing may be altered. Using electroencephalography and electrocardiography in healthy volunteers (N=26) during wakefulness and sleep, we measured the response to unexpected sound omissions within three regularity conditions: synchronous, where sound and heartbeat are temporally coupled, isochronous, with fixed sound-to-sound intervals, and a third control condition without specific regularity. The synchronous and isochronous sequences induced a modulation of the omission-evoked neural response in wakefulness and N2 sleep, the latter accompanied by a reorganization of the background oscillatory activity. Cardio-audio regularity encoding was further demonstrated by a heartbeat deceleration upon omissions in all vigilance states, higher in the synchronous compared to the other regularity types. The human brain processes cardio-audio temporal relationships to predict future auditory events across distinct vigilance stages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mesoscale corticocortical connectivity corresponds with intracortical microstimulation-evoked neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cortical stimulation has been a versatile technique for examining the structure and function of cortical regions as well as for implementing novel therapies. While stimulation has been used to examine the local spread of neural activity, it may also enable longitudinal examination of mesoscale interregional connectivity. Recent studies have used focal intracortical microstimulation with optical imaging to show cross-region spread of neural activity, but the exact neural mechanisms elucidated by these modalities is uncertain. Objective: Here, we sought to use intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with recordings of multi-unit action potentials to assess the mesoscale effective connectivity within sensorimotor cortex. Methods: Neural recordings were made from multielectrode arrays placed into sensory, motor, and premotor regions during surgical experiments in three squirrel monkeys. During each recording, single-pulse ICMS was repeatably delivered to a single region. Mesoscale effective connectivity was calculated from ICMS-evoked changes in multi-unit firing. Results: Multi-unit action potentials were able to be detected on the order of 1 ms after each ICMS pulse. Across sensorimotor regions, short-latency (<2.5 ms) ICMS-evoked neural activity strongly correlated with known anatomic connections. Additionally, ICMS-evoked responses remained stable across the experimental period, in spite of small changes in electrode locations and anesthetic state. Conclusions: These results show that monitoring ICMS-evoked neural activity is a viable way to longitudinally assess effective connectivity, enabling studies comparing the time course of connectivity changes with the time course of changes in behavioral function.

                In neurons, many membrane proteins, synthesized in cell bodies, must be efficiently delivered to axons to influence neuronal connectivity, synaptic communication, and repair. Previously, we found that axonal targeting of TrkA neurotrophin receptors in sympathetic neurons occurs via an atypical transport mechanism called transcytosis, which relies on TrkA interactions with PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Here, we generated TrkAR685A mice, where TrkA receptor signaling is preserved, but its PTP1B-dependent transcytosis is disrupted, to show that this mode of axonal transport is essential for sympathetic neuron development and autonomic function. TrkAR685A mice have decreased axonal TrkA levels in vivo, developmental loss of sympathetic neurons, and reduced innervation of targets. Postnatal TrkAR685A mice exhibit reduced pupil size and eyelid ptosis, indicative of sympathetic dysfunction. These findings establish the necessity of transcytosis in supplying TrkA receptors to sympathetic axons and highlight the physiological relevance of this axon targeting mechanism in the nervous system.

                A learned sensory-motor behavior engages multiple brain regions, including the neocortex and the basal ganglia. How these brain regions coordinate to affect sensory selection (for target stimuli) and inhibition (for distractor stimuli) remains unknown. Here, we performed laminar electrophysiological recordings and muscimol inactivation in frontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum to determine the representations within and functions of each region during selective detection performance. From the recording experiments, in deep layers of frontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum we observed similar encoding of sensory and motor features. However, muscimol inactivation of each region resulted in drastically different outcomes. Inactivation of target-aligned striatum substantially reduced behavioral responses to all task stimuli without disrupting the ability to respond, suggesting essential roles in sensory selection. In contrast, inactivation of distractor-aligned frontal cortex increased responses to distractor stimuli, indicating essential roles in distractor inhibition. Overall, these data suggest distinct functions of frontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum in this task, despite having similar neuronal representations.

                Our daily behaviour requires a flexible arbitration between actions we do out of habit and actions that are directed towards a specific goal. Drugs that target opioid and dopamine receptors are notorious for inducing maladaptive habitual drug consumption, yet how the opioidergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems contribute to the arbitration between habitual and goal-directed behaviour is poorly understood. By combining pharmacological challenges with a well-established decision-making task and a novel computational model, we show that the administration of the D2 dopamine receptor antagonist amisulpride led to an increase in goal-directed or "model-based" relative to habitual or "model-free" behaviour, whereas the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone had no appreciable effect. These findings highlight the distinct functional contributions of dopamine and opioid receptors to goal-directed and habitual behaviour and support the notion that D2 receptor antagonists promote stabilisation of goal-relevant information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ultrastructural analysis of wildtype and RIM1α knock-out active zones in a large cortical synapse</a></h4>

              
                Rab3A-interacting molecule (RIM) is crucial for fast Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle (SV) release in presynaptic active zones (AZ). While loss of RIM1 impairs long-term plasticity at hippocampal giant mossy fiber boutons (MFB), it remains unclear how AZ ultrastructure is altered. We investigated MFB AZ architecture in 3D using electron tomography of rapid cryo-immobilized acute brain slices in RIM1-/- and wild-type mice. In RIM1-/-, AZs are larger with increased synaptic cleft heights and with a three-fold reduced number of tightly docked SVs (0-2nm). The distance of tightly docked SVs to the AZ center is increased from 110 to 195 nm, and the width of their electron dense material between outer SV membrane and AZ membrane is reduced. Furthermore, the SV pool in RIM1-/- is more heterogeneous. Thus, RIM1, beside its role in tight SV docking, is crucial for synaptic architecture and vesicle pool organization in MFBs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced childhood social attention in an autism model marmoset predicts impaired social skills and inflexible behavior in adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social and communication impairments and restricted and repetitive behavior. Although currently no established cure exists for ASD, early intervention to the deficits of attention to other individuals is expected to reduce the progression of ASD symptoms in later life. In order to confirm this hypothesis and improve early therapeutic interventions, it is desirable to develop an animal model of ASD in which social attention is impaired in childhood and ASD-like social behavior is observed in adulthood. However, rodent models of ASD have difficulty in recapitulating the deficit of gaze-based social attention. In this study, we examined the direction of gaze towards other conspecifics during childhood and puberty in a three-chamber test setting using an ASD model of marmoset produced by maternal exposure to valproic acid (VPA). We also conducted a reversal learning test in an adult VPA-exposed marmoset as an indicator of perseveration, a core symptom of ASD that has not previously been investigated in this model. The results showed that time spent gazing at other conspecifics was reduced in VPA-exposed marmosets in childhood, and adults displayed rigidity of response. In a longitudinal study using the same animals, deficits in social attention in childhood correlated well with ASD-like social disturbance (inequity aversion and third-party reciprocity) and inflexible behavior in adulthood. Since VPA-exposed marmosets exhibit these diverse ASD-like behaviors that are coherent from childhood to adulthood, VPA-exposed marmosets will provide a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms for early intervention and contribute to the development of early therapies.

                Leading theories of consciousness make diverging predictions for where and how neural activity gives rise to subjective experience. The Global Neuronal Workspace theory (GNW) states that consciousness is instantiated through global broadcasting of information across the prefrontal-parietal regions, whereas the integrated information theory (IIT) postulates that consciousness requires the posterior cortex to produce maximally irreducible integrated information. As both theories seem to partially agree on that the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) require globally integrated brain activity across a network of functionally specialized modules, it is not known yet whether brain regions with such functional configurations would align with the NCC distribution predicted by the GNW or the IIT. We scanned resting-state fMRI data from 21 subjects during wakefulness, propofol-induced sedation and anesthesia. Graph-theoretical analysis were conducted on awake fMRI data to search for the NCC candidates as brain regions that exhibit both high rich-clubness and high modular variability. Another independent dataset of 10 highly-sampled subjects were used to validate the NCC distribution at individual-level. Brain module-based dynamic analysis was conducted to estimate temporal stability of the NCC candidates. Alterations in functional connectivity and modular variability from awake to propofol-induced anesthesia were assessed to test the involvement of the NCC candidates in conscious processing. NCC candidates that are characterized by both high functional interconnectivity and high modular variability were identified to locate in prefrontal and temporoparietal cortices, which covered brain structures predicted by the GNW as well as the IIT. The identified NCC was found to mainly attributed to higher-order cognitive functions, and associated with genes enriched in synaptic transmission. Dynamic analysis revealed two discrete reoccurring brain states, which were characterized by their difference in temporal stability, that is the state dominated by the NCC candidates appearred to be temporally more stable than the other state predominately composed of primary sensory/motor regions, suggesting that the identified NCC members could sustain conscious contents as metastable network representations. Finally, we showed that the prefrontal GNW regions and posterior IIT regions within the identified NCC was differentially modulated in terms of functional connectedness and modular variability in response to loss of consciousness induced by propofol anesthesia. This work offers a framework to search for neural correlates of consciousness by charting the brain network topology, and provides new insights in understanding the distinct roles of the frontoparietal and posterior network in underpinning human consciousness.

                {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type A receptors that incorporate 5 subunits (5-GABAARs) are highly enriched in the hippocampus and they are strongly implicated in the control of learning and memory. Receptors located on pyramidal neuron dendrites have long been considered responsible, but here we report that selective elimination of 5-GABAARs from either interneurons or pyramidal cells prevented the general anesthetic etomidate from suppressing contextual learning. Using Ca2+ imaging of hippocampal neuronal activity in freely exploring mice, we also found that etomidate interfered with the development of place cells and spatial engrams in wild type mice but not in interneuron-specific 5-GABAAR knockout mice. These findings show that 5-GABAARs on interneurons as well as pyramidal neurons mediate etomidate-induced amnesia.

                The need for reproducible, credible, multiscale biological modeling has led to the development of standardized simulation platforms, such as the widely-used NEURON environment for computational neuroscience. Developing and maintaining NEURON over several decades has required attention to the competing needs of backwards compatibility, evolving computer architectures, the addition of new scales and physical processes, accessibility to new users, and efficiency and flexibility for specialists. In order to meet these challenges, we have now substantially modernized NEURON, providing continuous integration, an improved build system and release workflow, and better documentation. With the help of a new source-to-source compiler of the NMODL domain-specific language we have enhanced NEURON's ability to run efficiently, via the CoreNEURON simulation engine, on a variety of hardware platforms, including GPUs. Through the implementation of an optimized in-memory transfer mechanism this performance optimized backend is made easily accessible to users, providing training and model-development paths from laptop to workstation to supercomputer and cloud platform. Similarly, we have been able to accelerate NEURON's reaction-diffusion simulation performance through the use of just-in-time compilation. We show that these efforts have led to a growing developer base, a simpler and more robust software distribution, a wider range of supported computer architectures, a better integration of NEURON with other scientific workflows, and substantially improved performance for the simulation of biophysical and biochemical models.

                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition in which the mechanisms underlying its core symptomatology are largely unknown. Studying animal models of monogenic syndromes associated with ASD, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), can offer insights into its aetiology. Here, we show that loss of function of the Drosophila NF1 ortholog results in larval tactile hypersensitivity, paralleling the sensory abnormalities observed in individuals with ASD. Mutant larvae also exhibit synaptic transmission deficits at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ), with increased spontaneous but reduced evoked release. Diminished expression of NF1 specifically within central cholinergic neurons induces both excessive neuronal firing and tactile hypersensitivity, suggesting the two may be linked. Furthermore, both impaired synaptic transmission and behavioural deficits are fully rescued via knockdown of Ras proteins. These findings validate NF1-/- Drosophila as a tractable model of ASD with the potential to elucidate important pathophysiological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">What the flip? What the P-N flip can tell us about proactive suppression</a></h4>

              
                It has been debated whether salient distractors in visual search can be proactively suppressed to completely prevent attentional capture, as the occurrence of proactive suppression implies that the initial shift of attention is not entirely driven by physical salience. While the presence of a Pd component in the EEG (associated with suppression) without a preceding N2pc component (associated with selection) has been used as evidence for proactive suppression, the link between these ERPs and the underlying mechanisms is not always clear. This is exemplified in two recent papers that observed the same waveform pattern, where an early Pd-like component flipped to a N2pc-like component, but provided very different interpretations (Drisdelle & Eimer, Psychophysiology, 58(9), 1-12, 2021; Kerzel & Burra, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 32(6), 1170-1183, 2020). Using RAGNAROC (Wyble et al., Psychological Review, 127(6), 1163-1198, 2020), a computational model of reflexive attention, we successfully simulated this ERP pattern with minimal changes to its existing architecture, providing a parsimonious and mechanistic explanation for this flip in the EEG that is unique from both of the previous interpretations. Our account supports the occurrence of proactive suppression and demonstrates the benefits of incorporating computational modelling into theory building.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The tail domain of neurofilament light chain accumulates in neuronal nuclei during oxidative injury</a></h4>

              
                Neurofilament light chain (NFL), one of the major subunits of neuron-specific intermediate filaments, is an important component of the neuronal cytoskeleton. Mutations in the NEFL gene and disturbances of NFL turnover or transport are associated with the pathophysiology of various diseases of the nervous system. Also, NFL is released from neurons as a result of neuroaxonal damage and NFL levels in cerebrospinal fluid and blood have emerged as a biomarker of the progression of numerous neurological diseases. One common underlying factor in these diseases is oxidative stress. Although both NFL and oxidative injury play a role in the development of neurological diseases, the effect of oxidative stress on NFL at the cellular level has not been extensively studied. Here, by investigating the response of neurofilaments to in vitro oxidative injury, we discovered that NFL localizes in the nuclei of primary neurons. We show that this depends on calpain activity and determine that a proteolytic fragment of the tail domain, not the full-length NFL, is that which accumulates in the nuclei. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the recombinant NFL tail domain accumulates in the nuclei of neurons and neuroblastoma cells, even in the absence of oxidative injury. Finally, we show that the tail domain of NFL interacts with the DNA in the nuclei of living cells, suggesting that NFL plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in response to oxidative injury.

                Maternal immune activation (MIA) is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing mental illness in adulthood, which often co-occurs with alcohol misuse. The current study aimed to begin to determine whether MIA, combined with adolescent alcohol exposure (AE), could be used as a model with which we could study the neurobiological mechanisms behind such co-occurring disorders. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with PolyI:C or saline on gestational day 15. Half of the offspring were given continuous access to alcohol during adolescence, leading to four experimental groups: controls, MIA, AE, and Dual (MIA + AE). We then evaluated whether MIA and/or AE alters: 1) alcohol consumption; and 2) cortical-striatal-hippocampal oscillations in adult offspring. Dual rats, particularly females, drank significantly more alcohol in adulthood compared to all other groups. Using machine learning to build predictive models from oscillations, we were able to differentiate Dual rats from control rats and AE rats in both sexes, and Dual rats from MIA rats in females. The current data suggest that MIA+AE (Dual hits) is a valuable model that we can use to study the neurobiological underpinnings of co-occurring disorders. Our future work aims to extend these findings to other addictive substances to enhance the translational relevance of this model.

                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) strictly regulates the exchange of ions and molecules between the blood and the central nervous system. The tight junctions (TJs) are multimeric structures that control the transport through the paracellular spaces between adjacent brain endothelial cells of the BBB. Claudin-5 (Cldn5) proteins are essential for the TJ formation. They assemble into multi-protein complexes via cis- interactions within the same cell membrane, and trans-interactions across two contiguous cells. Despite the barrier function of Cldn5 proteins and their role as targets of brain drug delivery strategies, the molecular details of their assembly within TJs are still unclear. Two different structural models have been recently introduced, in which Cldn5 dimers belonging to opposite cells join together to generate paracellular pores. However, a comparison of these models in terms of ionic transport features is still lacking. In this work, we used extended molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to assess the two Cldn5 pore models and investigate the thermodynamic properties of water and physiological ions permeation through them. Despite different FE profiles, both structures present single or multiple FE barriers to ionic permeation, while being permissive to water flux. These results reveal that both models are compatible with the physiological role of Cldn5 TJ strands. By identifying the protein-protein surface at the core of TJ Cldn5 assemblies, our computational investigation provides a basis for the rational design of synthetic peptides and other molecules capable of opening paracellular pores in the BBB.

Here, we report that Emx1-Cre is expressed in nodose ganglion cells whose axon travel within afferent vagal nerves and terminate in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), a critical central autonomic regulatory pathway located in the dorsal medulla. Optogenetic stimulation of Emx1-Cre+ fibers reliably evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in the NTS in vitro and evoked a parasympathetic bradycardia reflex occasionally with irregular respirations in anesthetized mice in vivo. Our study clearly demonstrates that Emx1-IRES-Cre is expressed in the vagal nerve fibers traveling within the central autonomic system involving autonomic cardiorespiratory regulation. These results raise caution when interpreting the systemic phenotypes of Emx1-IRES-Cre conditional recombinant mice, and also suggest the utility of this line to investigate the modulators of afferent vagal system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The predictive power of mRNA mapping for Cannabinoid 1 receptor protein in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor is expressed in cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Recently, with the help of the Allen Human Brain Atlas, genomic maps visualize not only the gene expression across whole brain regions, but also the functional profile of brain structures. Therefore, it is more timely than ever to integrate genomic mapping from brain mRNA atlas with the protein expression from positron emission tomography (PET) scans for better understanding of CB1 receptor of the human brain. F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans were retrieved from the AIVO neuroinformatics project. Autoradiography data were based on the study with H3-CP55940. mRNA expressions of CNR1 gene (Cannabinoid receptor 1) were downloaded from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Volume of distribution (VT) from F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans, CNR1 gene expression, and H3-CP55940 binding were calculated and Spearman correlation analysis was performed. Also, a meta-analysis was done to investigate the association between protein expression from PET and mRNA expression from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Between VT of F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and CNR1 mRNA expression, moderate strength of correlation was observed (rho = 0.5026, p = 0.0354). Strong positive correlation was also found between CNR1 mRNA expression and H3-CP55940 binding (rho = 0.6727, p = 0.0281), validating the finding between F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and CNR1 mRNA. From the meta-analysis, the correlation coefficient ranged from -0.46 to 0.99, with a pooled effect of 0.58. In conclusion, the moderate to strong associations between gene and protein expression for CB1 receptor in the human brain were observed that CNR1 mRNA mapping might have the predictive power for in vivo CB1 receptor protein expression. From the meta-analysis, the moderate to strong correlation was observed between mRNA expression and protein expressions across multiple genes, showing the predictive power of genes to estimate protein levels of human brains.

                Nogo-A protein is a key myelin-associated inhibitor for axonal growth, regeneration, and plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). Regulation of the Nogo-A/NgR1 pathway facilitates functional recovery and neural repair after spinal cord trauma and ischemic stroke. MicroRNAs are described as effective tools for the regulation of important processes in CNS such as neuronal differentiation, neuritogenesis, and plasticity. Our results showed that miR-182-5p mimic specifically downregulates the expression of the luciferase reporter gene fused to the mouse Nogo-A 3'UTR, and Nogo-A protein expression in Neuro-2a and C6 cells. Finally, we observed that when rat primary hippocampal neurons are co-cultured with C6 cells transfected with miR-182-5p mimic, there is a promotion of the outgrowth of neuronal neurites in length. From all these data we suggest that miR-182-5p may be a potential therapeutic tool for the promotion of axonal regeneration in different diseases of the CNS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simulating semantic dementia in a brain-constrained model of action and object words learning</a></h4>

              
                The nature of semantic knowledge - conceptual information stored in the brain - is highly debated in the field of cognitive science. Experimental and clinical data specify various cortical regions involved in the processing of meaning. Those include semantic hubs that take part in semantic processing in general as well as sensorimotor areas that process specific conceptual categories according to their modality. Biologically inspired neurocomputational models can help adjudicate between different theories about the exact roles of those regions in the functioning of the semantic system. Here, we used an existing neuroanatomically constrained model of frontotemporal brain areas implicated in language acquisition and grounding and adapted it to replicate and explain the effects of semantic dementia (SD) on word processing abilities. SD is a disease characterized by semantic knowledge deterioration that correlates with neural damage in the anterior temporal lobe. The behavior of our model is in accordance with clinical data - namely, word recognition performance decreases as SD lesions progress, whereas word repetition abilities remain preserved, or are less affected. Furthermore, our model makes novel predictions about category-specific effects of SD - namely, our simulation results indicate that word processing should be more impaired for object- than for action-related words, and that white matter degradation should lead to more severe consequences than the same proportion of grey matter degradation. The present results provide a mechanistic, cortical-level explanatory account of a range of language impairments as observed in clinical populations during the onset and progress of semantic dementia.

                This study aimed to investigate whether instrumental reward learning is affected by the cardiac cycle. To this end, we examined the effects of the cardiac cycle (systole or diastole) on the computational processes underlying the participants' choices in the instrumental learning task. In the instrumental learning task, participants were required to select one of two discriminative stimuli (neutral visual stimuli) and immediately receive reward/punishment feedback depending on the probability assigned to the chosen stimuli. To manipulate the cardiac cycle, the presentation of discriminative stimuli was timed to coincide with either cardiac systole or diastole. We fitted the participants' choices in the task with reinforcement learning (RL) models and estimated parameters involving instrumental learning (i.e., learning rate and inverse temperature) separately in the systole and diastole trials. Model-based analysis revealed that the learning rate for positive prediction errors was higher than that for negative prediction errors in the systole trials; however, learning rates did not differ between positive and negative prediction errors in the diastole trials. These results demonstrate that the natural fluctuation of cardiac afferent signals can affect asymmetric value updating in instrumental reward learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibition is a prevalent mode of activity in the neocortex around awake hippocampal ripples</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated peri-ripple activity in the hippocampal-neocortical network is essential for mnemonic information processing in the brain. Hippocampal ripples likely serve different functions in sleep and awake states. Thus, the corresponding neocortical activity patterns may differ in important ways. We addressed this possibility by conducting voltage and glutamate wide-field imaging of the neocortex with concurrent hippocampal electrophysiology in awake mice. Contrary to our previously published sleep results, deactivation and activation were dominant in post-ripple neocortical voltage and glutamate activity, respectively, especially in the agranular retrosplenial cortex (aRSC). Additionally, the spiking activity of aRSC neurons, estimated by two-photon calcium imaging, revealed the existence of two subpopulations of excitatory neurons with opposite peri-ripple modulation patterns: one increases and the other decreases firing rate. These differences in peri-ripple spatiotemporal patterns of neocortical activity in sleep versus awake states might underlie the reported differences in the function of sleep versus awake ripples.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Arrayed Genome-Wide Perturbation Screen Identifies the Ribonucleoprotein hnRNP K As Rate-Limiting for Prion Propagation</a></h4>

              
                A defining characteristic of mammalian prions is their capacity for self-sustained propagation. Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence suggest that prion propagation is modulated by cell-autonomous and non-autonomous modifiers. Using a novel quantitative phospholipase protection assay (QUIPPER) for high-throughput prion measurements, we performed an arrayed genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen aimed at detecting modifiers of prion propagation. We exposed prion-infected cells in high-density microplates to 35.364 ternary pools of 52.746 siRNAs targeting 17.582 genes representing the mouse protein-coding transcriptome. We identified 1191 modulators of prion propagation. While 1151 of these modified the expression of both the pathological prion protein, PrPSc, and its cellular counterpart PrPC, 40 genes affected selectively PrPSc. Of the latter, 20 genes augmented prion production when suppressed. A prominent limiter of prion propagation was the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Hnrnpk. Psammaplysene A (PSA), which binds Hnrnpk, reduced prion levels in cultured cells and protected them from cytotoxicity. PSA also reduced prion levels in infected cerebellar organotypic slices and alleviated locomotor deficits in prion-infected Drosophila melanogaster expressing ovine PrPC. Hence, genome-wide QUIPPER-based perturbations can discover actionable cellular pathways involved in prion propagation. Finally, the unexpected identification of a prion-controlling ribonucleoprotein suggests a role for RNA in the generation of infectious prions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An innovative hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy approach benefits CLN1 disease in the mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can lead to the establishment of a long-lasting microglia-like progeny in the brain of properly myeloablated hosts. We exploited this approach to treat the severe CLN1 neurodegenerative disorder, which is the most aggressive form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, due to deficiency of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (hPPT1). We here provide first evidence that: i) transplantation of wild type HSPCs exerts a partial but long-lasting mitigation of the symptoms; ii) transplantation of HSPCs over-expressing hPPT1 by lentiviral gene transfer enhances therapeutic benefit as compared to wild type cell transplant, with first demonstration of such a dose-effect benefit for a purely neurodegenerative condition like CLN1 disease; iii) transplantation of hPPT1 over-expressing HSPCs by a novel intracerebroventricular (ICV) approach is sufficient to transiently ameliorate CLN1 disease symptomatology in the absence of hematopoietic tissue engraftment of the transduced cells; and iv) the combinatorial transplantation of transduced HSPCs intravenously and ICV results in the most robust therapeutic benefit among the tested approaches on both pre-symptomatic as well as symptomatic animals. Overall, these findings provide first evidence of the efficacy and feasibility of this novel approach to treat CLN1 disease and possibly other neurodegenerative conditions, paving the way for its future clinical application.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG Responses to Auditory Figure-Ground Perception</a></h4>

              
                Speech-in-noise difficulty is commonly reported among hearing-impaired individuals. Recent work has established generic behavioural measures of sound segregation and grouping that are related to speech-in-noise processing but do not require language. In this study, we assessed potential clinical electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of central auditory grouping (stochastic figure-ground test) and speech-in-noise perception (speech-in-babble test) with and without relevant tasks. Auditory targets were presented within background noise (16 talker-babble or randomly generated pure-tones) in 50% of the trials and composed either a figure (pure-tone frequency chords repeating over time) or speech (English names). EEG was recorded while participants were presented with the target stimuli (figure or speech) under different attentional states (relevant task or visual-distractor task). EEG time-domain analysis demonstrated enhanced negative responses during detection of both types of auditory targets within the time window 650-850 ms but only figure detection produced significantly enhanced responses under the distracted condition. Further single-channel analysis showed that simple vertex-to-mastoid acquisition defines a very similar response to more complex arrays based on multiple channels. Evoked-potentials to the generic figure-ground task therefore represent a potential clinical measure of grouping relevant to real-world listening that can be assessed irrespective of language knowledge and expertise even without a relevant task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concurrent TMS-fMRI to determine adaptive brain changes to virtual lesions interfering with visual processing</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Understanding the causal relationship between a focal lesion and brain network (re)organization is a crucial step in order to accurately predict the resulting symptoms of the lesion and implement personalized rehabilitation strategies. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to create local and transient neural perturbations, the so-called virtual lesion approach. In this study, we tested how a virtual lesion applied to the Early Visual Areas (EVA) or the extrastriate, motion-sensitive, medio-temporal area (hMT+/V5) in different contexts affects behavior and changes neuronal network activity and organisation, assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: We applied short trains of 10 Hz TMS to healthy participants over the EVA or hMT+/MT. This was done both at rest and at relevant times during a motion discrimination task, while concurrent fMRI was performed. Regional BOLD activity was analysed using a general linear model (GLM) and functional brain networks were assessed using independent component analysis (ICA). Motion direction discrimination and motion awareness were related to the imaging data. Results: TMS applied over the EVA and hMT+/V5 induced transient modulation of motion perception and discrimination. Comparing resting versus active states, both TMS sites showed a common suppression of local and remote brain activity at rest while an over-activation of the stimulated areas and related networks were found during the task. More subtly, distinct dynamic and topological TMS-induced networks properties could be revealed depending on the exact visual processing stages TMS was applied at. In particular, brain networks associated with EVA stimulation showed a clear context-dependency and were spatially more restricted than for hMT+/V5 stimulation. Discussion: The present findings highlight the possibility of interfering with distinct visual processing stages and the possibility of imaging the local and remote neural correlates of the behavioral impact. They also confirm the complexity of TMS effects on BOLD activity, switching from signal suppression at rest to irrelevant neural noise addition during active visual processing, even differing throughout the time course of information processing. Moreover, the networks analyses suggest that the EVA might be more resilient to focal perturbations by means of a virtual lesion than hMT+/V5. As a critical processing center, the EVA may be important for maintaining stability in the visual network, whereas the perturbation of a more specialized region such as hMT+/V5 has greater impact on local and network activity, as well as on behavior. These findings add to the understanding of visual motion processing and especially to the impact and potential mechanism of focal lesions in this system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subgroups of eating behavior traits independent of obesity defined using functional connectivity and feature representation learning</a></h4>

              
                Eating behavior is highly heterogeneous across individuals, and thus, it cannot be fully explained using only the degree of obesity. We utilized unsupervised machine learning and functional connectivity measures to explore the heterogeneity of eating behaviors. This study was conducted on 424 healthy adults. We generated low-dimensional representations of functional connectivity defined using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and calculated latent features using the feature representation capabilities of an autoencoder by nonlinearly compressing the functional connectivity information. The clustering approaches applied to latent features identified three distinct subgroups. The subgroups exhibited different disinhibition and hunger traits; however, their body mass indices were comparable. The model interpretation technique of integrated gradients revealed that these distinctions were associated with the functional reorganization in higher-order associations and limbic networks and reward-related subcortical structures. The cognitive decoding analysis revealed that these systems are associated with reward- and emotion-related systems. We replicated our findings using an independent dataset, thereby suggesting generalizability. Our findings provide insights into the macroscopic brain organization of eating behavior-related subgroups independent of obesity.

	<p>Perturbations in dopamine system function may increase risk of substance use disorder (SUD). We recently demonstrated that neuromelanin (NM) MRI signal in the substantia nigra, a non-invasive index of dopamine system function, is elevated in long term cocaine users (Cassidy et al., 2020). However, it is unclear whether elevated NM-MRI signal is linked to risk of SUD, or is a byproduct of long-term drug use. Our prior work failed to show relations between NM-MRI signal and functional engagement of ventral striatum during a monetary reward task. However, social experiences are commonly linked to drug use and relapse. Given that, NM-MRI signal may be more closely linked to ventral striatal engagement during social, rather than monetary reward processing. Emerging adults (n = 33, 21.88 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.35 years) with varying levels of substance abuse, but without SUD, underwent NM-MRI and fMRI during social and monetary reward processing tasks. Voxelwise analysis within the substantia nigra (SN) demonstrated lower NM-MRI signal was associated with more severe substance abuse. Lower right ventral striatal engagement to social reward was also associated with more severe substance abuse. This relation was moderated by SN NM-MRI signal such that diminished striatal response to reward was associated with greater substance abuse among those with low NM-MRI signal, but lower substance abuse among those with high NM-MRI signal. Unexpectedly, higher right ventral striatal engagement during monetary reward was associated with more severe substance abuse. This relation was moderated by SN NM-MRI signal such that greater striatal response to reward was associated with greater substance abuse among those with low NM-MRI signal. Taken together, we provide preliminary evidence that, in emerging adults, low rather than high dopamine system function may increase risk of substance abuse, and strengthen the association between substance use and the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s sensitivity to social and monetary outcomes in different ways.</p>

	<p>Deficits in the executive control of attention greatly impact the quality of life of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, attentional deficits are often underemphasized in clinical contexts compared with mood-based symptoms, and a comprehensive approach for specifically evaluating and treating them has yet to be developed. The present study evaluates the efficacy of bifrontal electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) combined with drug therapy (DT) in alleviating mood-related symptomatology and executive control deficits in drug-refractory MDD patients and compares these effects with those observed in MDD patients undergoing DT only. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Lateralized Attentional Network Test-Revised were administered across two test sessions to assess treatment-related changes in mood-based symptoms and conflict processing, respectively, in patients undergoing ECT + DT (n = 23), patients undergoing DT (n = 33), and healthy controls (n = 40). Although both groups showed an improvement in mood-based symptoms following treatment and a deficit in conflict processing estimated on error rate, a post-treatment reduction of an executive control deficit estimated on RT was solely observed in the ECT + DT patient group. Furthermore, Bayesian correlational analyses confirmed the dissociation of mood-related symptoms and of executive control measures, supporting existing literature proposing that attentional deficits and mood symptoms are independent aspects of MDD. The cognitive profile of MDD includes executive control deficits, and while both treatments improved mood-based symptoms, only ECT + DT exerted an effect on both measures of the executive control deficit. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the improvement in both mood and cognitive deficits when determining the efficacy of therapeutic approaches for MDD.</p>

	<p>Striatal dopamine dysfunction is associated with the altered top-down modulation of pain processing. The dopamine D2-like receptor family is a potential substrate for such effects due to its primary expression in the striatum, but evidence for this is currently lacking. Here, we investigated the effect of pharmacologically manipulating striatal dopamine D2 receptor activity on the anticipation and perception of acute pain stimuli in humans. Participants received visual cues that induced either certain or uncertain anticipation of two pain intensity levels delivered via a CO2 laser. Rating of the pain intensity and unpleasantness was recorded. Brain activity was recorded with EEG and analysed via source localisation to investigate neural activity during the anticipation and receipt of pain. Participants completed the experiment under three conditions, control (Sodium Chloride), D2 receptor agonist (Cabergoline), and D2 receptor antagonist (Amisulpride), in a repeated-measures, triple-crossover, double-blind study. The antagonist reduced an individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to distinguish between low and high pain following uncertain anticipation. The EEG source localisation showed that the agonist and antagonist reduced neural activations in specific brain regions associated with the sensory integration of salient stimuli during the anticipation and receipt of pain. During anticipation, the agonist reduced activity in the right mid-temporal region and the right angular gyrus, whilst the antagonist reduced activity within the right postcentral, right mid-temporal, and right inferior parietal regions. In comparison to control, the antagonist reduced activity within the insula during the receipt of pain, a key structure involved in the integration of the sensory and affective aspects of pain. Pain sensitivity and unpleasantness were not changed by D2R modulation. Our results support the notion that D2 receptor neurotransmission has a role in the top-down modulation of pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Contributions of Distinct Auditory Cortical Inhibitory Neuron Types to the Detection of Sounds in Background Noise</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to separate background noise from relevant acoustic signals is essential for appropriate sound-driven behavior in natural environments. Examples of this separation are apparent in the auditory system, where neural responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli become increasingly noise invariant along the ascending auditory pathway. However, the mechanisms that underlie this reduction in responses to background noise are not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we first evaluated the effects of auditory cortical inactivation on mice of both sexes trained to perform a simple auditory signal-in-noise detection task and found that outputs from the auditory cortex are important for the detection of auditory stimuli in noisy environments. Next, we evaluated the contributions of the two most common cortical inhibitory cell types, parvalbumin-expressing (PV<sup>+</sup>) and somatostatin-expressing (SOM<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, to the perception of masked auditory stimuli. We found that inactivation of either PV<sup>+</sup> or SOM<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in a reduction in the ability of mice to determine the presence of auditory stimuli masked by noise. These results indicate that a disruption of auditory cortical network dynamics by either of these two types of inhibitory cells is sufficient to impair the ability to separate acoustic signals from noise.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">NPRL2 Inhibition of mTORC1 Controls Sodium Channel Expression and Brain Amino Acid Homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Genetic mutations in nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2) are associated with a wide spectrum of familial focal epilepsies, autism, and sudden unexpected death of epileptics (SUDEP), but the mechanisms by which NPRL2 contributes to these effects are not well known. NPRL2 is a requisite subunit of the GAP activity toward Rags 1 (GATOR1) complex, which functions as a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase when intracellular amino acids are low. Here, we show that loss of NPRL2 expression in mouse excitatory glutamatergic neurons causes seizures before death, consistent with SUDEP in humans with epilepsy. Additionally, the absence of NPRL2 expression increases mTORC1-dependent signal transduction and significantly alters amino acid homeostasis in the brain. Loss of NPRL2 reduces dendritic branching and increases the strength of electrically stimulated action potentials (APs) in neurons. The increased AP strength is consistent with elevated expression of epilepsy-linked, voltage-gated sodium channels in the NPRL2-deficient brain. Targeted deletion of NPRL2 in primary neurons increases the expression of sodium channel <I>Scn1A</I>, whereas treatment with the pharmacological mTORC1 inhibitor called rapamycin prevents <I>Scn1A</I> upregulation. These studies demonstrate a novel role of NPRL2 and mTORC1 signaling in the regulation of sodium channels, which can contribute to seizures and early lethality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Brain Dynamics of Action Monitoring in Higher-Order Motor Control Disorders: The Case of Apraxia</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Limb apraxia (LA) refers to a high-order motor disorder characterized by the inability to reproduce transitive actions on commands or after observation. Studies demonstrate that action observation and action execution activate the same networks in the human brain, and provides an onlooker&rsquo;s motor system with appropriate cognitive, motor and sensory-motor cues to flexibly implementing action-sequences and gestures. Tellingly, the temporal dynamics of action monitoring has never been explored in people suffering from LA. To fill this gap, we studied the electro-cortical signatures of error observation in human participants suffering from acquired left-brain lesions with (LA+) and without (LA&ndash;) LA, and in a group of healthy controls (H). EEG was acquired while participants observed from a first-person perspective (1PP) an avatar performing correct or incorrect reach-to-grasp a glass action in an immersive-virtual environment. Alterations of typical EEG signatures of error observation in time (early error positivity; Pe) and time-frequency domain (theta band-power) were found reduced in LA+ compared with H. Connectivity analyses showed that LA+ exhibited a decreased theta phase synchronization of both the frontoparietal and frontofrontal network, compared with H and LA&ndash;. Moreover, linear regression analysis revealed that the severity of LA [test of upper LA (TULIA) scores] was predicted by mid-frontal error-related theta activity, suggesting a link between error monitoring capacity and apraxic phenotypes. These results provide novel neurophysiological evidence of altered neurophysiological dynamics of action monitoring in individuals with LA and shed light on the performance monitoring changes occurring in this disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neurophysiological Evidence for Cognitive Map Formation during Sequence Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Humans deftly parse statistics from sequences. Some theories posit that humans learn these statistics by forming cognitive maps, or underlying representations of the latent space which links items in the sequence. Here, an item in the sequence is a node, and the probability of transitioning between two items is an edge. Sequences can then be generated from walks through the latent space, with different spaces giving rise to different sequence statistics. Individual or group differences in sequence learning can be modeled by changing the time scale over which estimates of transition probabilities are built, or in other words, by changing the amount of temporal discounting. Latent space models with temporal discounting bear a resemblance to models of navigation through Euclidean spaces. However, few explicit links have been made between predictions from Euclidean spatial navigation and neural activity during human sequence learning. Here, we use a combination of behavioral modeling and intracranial encephalography (iEEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity might support the formation of space-like cognitive maps through temporal discounting during sequence learning. Specifically, we acquire human reaction times from a sequential reaction time task, to which we fit a model that formulates the amount of temporal discounting as a single free parameter. From the parameter, we calculate each individual&rsquo;s estimate of the latent space. We find that neural activity reflects these estimates mostly in the temporal lobe, including areas involved in spatial navigation. Similar to spatial navigation, we find that low-dimensional representations of neural activity allow for easy separation of important features, such as modules, in the latent space. Lastly, we take advantage of the high temporal resolution of iEEG data to determine the time scale on which latent spaces are learned. We find that learning typically happens within the first 500 trials, and is modulated by the underlying latent space and the amount of temporal discounting characteristic of each participant. Ultimately, this work provides important links between behavioral models of sequence learning and neural activity during the same behavior, and contextualizes these results within a broader framework of domain general cognitive maps.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Biophysical Modeling of Dopaminergic Denervation Landscapes in the Striatum Reveals New Therapeutic Strategy</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) results from a loss of dopaminergic neurons. What triggers the break-down of neuronal signaling, and how this might be compensated, is not understood. The age of onset, progression and symptoms vary between patients, and our understanding of the clinical variability remains incomplete. In this study, we investigate this, by characterizing the dopaminergic landscape in healthy and denervated striatum, using biophysical modeling. Based on currently proposed mechanisms, we model three distinct denervation patterns, and show how this affect the dopaminergic network. Depending on the denervation pattern, we show how local and global differences arise in the activity of striatal neurons. Finally, we use the mathematical formalism to suggest a cellular strategy for maintaining normal dopamine (DA) signaling following neuronal denervation. This strategy is characterized by dual enhancement of both the release and uptake capacity of DA in the remaining neurons. Overall, our results derive a new conceptual framework for the impaired dopaminergic signaling related to PD and offers testable predictions for future research directions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Dopamine D4 Receptor Regulates Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Excitability in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-secreting neurons control fertility. The release of GnRH peptide regulates the synthesis and release of both luteinizing  hormone (LH) and Follicle stimulation hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. While it is known that dopamine regulates GnRH neurons, the specific dopamine receptor subtype(s) involved remain unclear. Previous studies in adult rodents have reported juxtaposition of fibers containing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of catecholaminergic cells, onto GnRH neurons and that exogenous dopamine inhibits GnRH neurons postsynaptically through dopamine D1-like and/or D2-like receptors. Our microarray data from GnRH neurons revealed a high level of <I>Drd4</I> transcripts [i.e., dopamine D4 receptor (D4R)]. Single-cell RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry confirmed GnRH cells express the <I>Drd4</I> transcript and protein, respectively. Calcium imaging identified changes in GnRH neuronal activity during application of subtype-specific dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists when GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission was blocked. Dopamine, dopamine with D1/5R-specific or D2/3R-specific antagonists or D4R-specific agonists decreased the frequency of calcium oscillations. In contrast, D1/5R-specific agonists increased the frequency of calcium oscillations. The D4R-mediated inhibition was dependent on G<SUB>&alpha;i/o</SUB> protein coupling, while the D1/5R-mediated excitation required G<SUB>&alpha;s</SUB> protein coupling. Together, these results indicate that D4R plays an important role in the dopaminergic inhibition of GnRH neurons.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>For adaptive goal-directed action, the brain needs to monitor action performance and detect errors. The corresponding information may be conveyed via different sensory modalities; for instance, visual and proprioceptive body position cues may inform about current manual action performance. Thereby, contextual factors such as the current task set may also determine the relative importance of each sensory modality for action guidance. Here, we analyzed human behavioral, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from two virtual reality-based hand&ndash;target phase-matching studies to identify the neuronal correlates of performance monitoring and error processing under instructed visual or proprioceptive task sets. Our main result was a general, modality-independent response of the bilateral frontal operculum (FO) to poor phase-matching accuracy, as evident from increased BOLD signal and increased source-localized gamma power. Furthermore, functional connectivity of the bilateral FO to the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) increased under a visual versus proprioceptive task set. These findings suggest that the bilateral FO generally monitors manual action performance; and, moreover, that when visual action feedback is used to guide action, the FO may signal an increased need for control to visuomotor regions in the right PPC following errors.</p>

                <p>The antigen specificity of Anti-Neuronal Nuclear Antibody-type 3 (ANNA3)-IgG is unknown. We identified Dachshund-homolog 1 (DACH1) as the ANNA3 autoantigen and confirmed it by antigen-specific assays, immunohistochemical colocalization and immune absorption experiments. Patients' median age was 63.5 years (range, 49–88); 67% were female. Neurological manifestations (information available for 30 patients) included one or more of neuropathy, 12; cognitive difficulties, 11; ataxia, 8; dysautonomia, 7. Evidence of a neoplasm was present in 27 of 30 (90%), most of neuroendocrine lineage. DACH1-IgG is rare and represents a novel proposed biomarker of neurological autoimmunity and cancer.

                We present a case of a 36-year-old female patient who presented with subacute liver disease with a history of alcohol abuse. On basic liver function tests (LFT), she had aspartate transaminase / alanine transaminase > 2.2 and alkaline phosphatase / total bilirubin < 4. This pattern in acute liver failure patients signifies Wilson’s disease. Its presence in our patient with subacute liver disease also prompted us to suspect Wilson’s disease and we extended the liver disease screen to include slit lamp eye examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings, serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper level, which led to the diagnosis. She improved clinically and biochemically with zinc acetate therapy.  As screening for rare diseases is not always possible in low-income countries, this case demonstrates the usefulness of the basic LFT as a guide for suspecting Wilson’s disease in patients with liver disease.

                Background: Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a common dermatosis in children, that includes skin architecture defects, immune dysregulation, and changes of skin flora. Several new drugs have been found to reduce the severity of AD. Vitamin D is one of the new therapies that is still controversial. The purpose of this research is to conclude the efficacy of vitamin D on atopic dermatitis severity in children aged 0-18 years old. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on the PubMed, Cochrane, ProQuest, Google Scholar, Clinical Trial website, and university repositories including studies published from January 2010 through October 2020. We compared populations, intervention, study design, and outcomes. Statistical analysis was done with Review Manager 5.4.1. Results: Eight articles met eligibility and inclusion criteria, four articles provided complete data and were analysed. Not all studies demonstrated the efficacy of vitamin D but a meta-analysis of four studies of vitamin D supplementation vs placebo found a mean difference of -0.93 (95%CI -1.76, to -0.11, p<0.001) of patient outcome, but statistically, there was no difference in cure rate (risk ratio 1.46 (95%CI 0.72, to 2.97, p=0.008) in vitamin D supplementation groups compared to placebo groups. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation in paediatric atopic dermatitis patients could offer improvement of disease severity but the recommended dose and duration of administration cannot be concluded yet.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Elections in Nondemocratic Settings: When and Why Do They Help Regime Survival? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Elections in nondemocratic settings are expected to play a regime sustaining role and a regime subverting role. Recent research finds that these two seemingly competing views are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary with each other. This is the case because the regime subverting role of elections is at work in the short run, whereas the regime sustaining role operates in the long term. In this paper, I argue that these effects are conditional on the nature of competition in those elections. Specifically, I contend that these effects that derive from the informational role of elections do not emerge when opposition forces boycott the elections. Methods: Using data from 262 nondemocratic regimes in 116 countries from 1946 to 2007, I examined (1) whether holding multiparty elections with ex ante competition increases the risks of authoritarian breakdowns; (2) whether holding multiparty elections without opposition boycott increases the risks of authoritarian breakdowns in the short term; and (3) whether holding multiparty elections without opposition boycott decreases the likelihood of authoritarian breakdowns in the long run. Results: First, only legislative elections with ex ante competition are found to increase the probability of authoritarian breakdowns. Second, both presidential and legislative elections increase the likelihood of authoritarian breakdowns in the short term only if viable opposition candidates or parties compete. Lastly, both presidential and legislative elections decrease the chances of authoritarian breakdowns in the long run, but this effect is present only when viable opposition do not boycott the elections. Conclusions: The regime subverting role and the regime sustaining role of elections in nondemocratic settings can be contaminated by the absence of opposition forces. This paper suggests a need to further scrutinize the nature and quality of elections when assessing their impact on the survival of nondemocratic regimes.

                Background: Accurate assessment of the welfare of non-human primates (NHPs) used and bred for scientific purposes is essential for effective implementation of obligations to optimise their well-being, for validation of refinement techniques and novel welfare indicators, and for ensuring the highest quality data is obtained from these animals. Despite the importance of welfare assessment in NHP research, there is little consensus on what should be measured. Greater harmonisation of welfare indicators between facilities would enable greater collaboration and data sharing to address welfare-related questions in the management and use of NHPs. Methods: A Delphi consultation was used to survey attendees of the 2019 NC3Rs Primate Welfare Meeting (73 respondents) to build consensus on which welfare indicators for macaques and marmosets are reliable, valid, and practicable, and how these can be measured. Results: Self-harm behaviour, social enrichment, cage dimensions, body weight, a health monitoring programme, appetite, staff training, and positive reinforcement training were considered valid, reliable, and practicable indicators for macaques (≥70% consensus) within a hypothetical scenario context involving 500 animals. Indicators ranked important for assessing marmoset welfare were body weight, NHP induced and environmentally induced injuries, cage furniture, huddled posture, mortality, blood in excreta, and physical enrichment. Participants working with macaques in infectious disease and breeding identified a greater range of indicators as valid and reliable than did those working in neuroscience and toxicology, where animal-based indicators were considered the most important. The findings for macaques were compared with a previous Delphi consultation, and the expert-defined consensus from the two surveys used to develop a prototype protocol for assessing macaque welfare in research settings. Conclusions: Together the Delphi results and proto-protocol enable those working with research NHPs to more effectively assess the welfare of the animals in their care and to collaborate to advance refinement of NHP management and use.

                Appendiceal cancer is rare and is often diagnosed incidentally in patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis. However, patients with appendiceal cancer are at increased risk of synchronous malignancy. In this case report, we present a 58-year-old man initially diagnosed with acute appendicitis after presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain. He had an appendectomy and was discharged the following day. Unexpectedly, the postoperative histopathologic examination showed a primary adenocarcinoma in the appendix. A computed tomography scan showed rectal wall thickening and the patient was referred to colonoscopy where an experienced endoscopist found a rectal tumor during the digital rectal examination prior to the colonoscopy. The tumor was initially missed by the newly qualified doctor who examined the patient during his first admittance to hospital. The patient’s two primary cancers were treated with a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for the appendiceal cancer and a low anterior resection for the rectal cancer. This case supports the importance of a full colorectal workup in patients with appendiceal cancer. It also emphasizes the value of a thorough digital rectal examination and the need for improved focus on teaching and practice of the procedure.

                Background: Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) are very common disorders affecting the population and causing pain. Researchers have reported a high prevalence of TMDs among university students due to increased distress. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of TMDs in Umm al-Qura University (UQU) dental students using the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD), and to examine the relationship between anxiety, bruxism, and TMDs among those students. Methods: The DC/TMD pain screener questionnaire was completed by dental students. Students who reported TMD pain or had at least one positive TMD symptom were invited to the dental clinic for a full TMJ evaluation. History of bruxism was documented and an ultra-brief tool for detecting anxiety and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-4 PHQ) was completed by all students. Results: A total of 240 students responded to the TMD pain screener in which 119 reported at least one TMJ symptom. Only 93 dental students presented to clinical examination in which 64.5% (n=60) of them had temporomandibular joint disorders. Disc displacement with reduction and local myalgia (38.7% & 32.25%, respectively) were the most frequent diagnosis. A total of 29% (n=27) of students had more than one diagnosis. Overall, 41 participants (44.09%) reported a positive response to the anxiety scale and (n=38) 40% of participants reported parafunctional habits. Both the history of bruxism and anxiety were significantly related to TMDs (P=0.0002) and also significantly higher in women of higher academic years (P≤0.01). Conclusions: This study found a high prevalence of TMDs among UQU dental students. Disc displacement with reduction was the most prevalent disorder. Bruxism and anxiety were associated with painful TMDs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Human discrimination and modeling of high-frequency complex tones shed light on the neural codes for pitch</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel R. Guest, Andrew J. Oxenham</p>

Accurate pitch perception of harmonic complex tones is widely believed to rely on temporal fine structure information conveyed by the precise phase-locked responses of auditory-nerve fibers. However, accurate pitch perception remains possible even when spectrally resolved harmonics are presented at frequencies beyond the putative limits of neural phase locking, and it is unclear whether residual temporal information, or a coarser rate-place code, underlies this ability. We addressed this question by measuring human pitch discrimination at low and high frequencies for harmonic complex tones, presented either in isolation or in the presence of concurrent complex-tone maskers. We found that concurrent complex-tone maskers impaired performance at both low and high frequencies, although the impairment introduced by adding maskers at high frequencies relative to low frequencies differed between the tested masker types. We then combined simulated auditory-nerve responses to our stimuli with ideal-observer analysis to quantify the extent to which performance was limited by peripheral factors. We found that the worsening of both frequency discrimination and F0 discrimination at high frequencies could be well accounted for (in relative terms) by optimal decoding of all available information at the level of the auditory nerve. A Python package is provided to reproduce these results, and to simulate responses to acoustic stimuli from the three previously published models of the human auditory nerve used in our analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Autocrine signaling can explain the emergence of Allee effects in cancer cell populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Philip Gerlee, Philipp M. Altrock, Adam Malik, Cecilia Krona, Sven Nelander</p>

In many human cancers, the rate of cell growth depends crucially on the size of the tumour cell population. Low, zero, or negative growth at low population densities is known as the Allee effect; this effect has been studied extensively in ecology, but so far lacks a good explanation in the cancer setting. Here, we formulate and analyze an individual-based model of cancer, in which cell division rates are increased by the local concentration of an autocrine growth factor produced by the cancer cells themselves. We show, analytically and by simulation, that autocrine signaling suffices to cause both strong and weak Allee effects. Whether low cell densities lead to negative (strong effect) or reduced (weak effect) growth rate depends directly on the ratio of cell death to proliferation, and indirectly on cellular dispersal. Our model is consistent with experimental observations from three patient-derived brain tumor cell lines grown at different densities. We propose that further studying and quantifying population-wide feedback, impacting cell growth, will be central for advancing our understanding of cancer dynamics and treatment, potentially exploiting Allee effects for therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How does a small molecule bind at a cryptic binding site?</a></h4>

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are ubiquitous biomolecular processes that are central to virtually all aspects of cellular function. Identifying small molecules that modulate specific disease-related PPIs is a strategy with enormous promise for drug discovery. The design of drugs to disrupt PPIs is challenging, however, because many potential drug-binding sites at PPI interfaces are “cryptic”: When unoccupied by a ligand, cryptic sites are often flat and featureless, and thus not readily recognizable in crystal structures, with the geometric and chemical characteristics of typical small-molecule binding sites only emerging upon ligand binding. The rational design of small molecules to inhibit specific PPIs would benefit from a better understanding of how such molecules bind at PPI interfaces. To this end, we have conducted unbiased, all-atom MD simulations of the binding of four small-molecule inhibitors (SP4206 and three SP4206 analogs) to interleukin 2 (IL2)—which performs its function by forming a PPI with its receptor—without incorporating any prior structural information about the ligands’ binding. In multiple binding events, a small molecule settled into a stable binding pose at the PPI interface of IL2, resulting in a protein–small-molecule binding site and pose virtually identical to that observed in an existing crystal structure of the IL2-SP4206 complex. Binding of the small molecule stabilized the IL2 binding groove, which when the small molecule was not bound emerged only transiently and incompletely. Moreover, free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations successfully distinguished between the native and non-native IL2–small-molecule binding poses found in the simulations, suggesting that binding simulations in combination with FEP may provide an effective tool for identifying cryptic binding sites and determining the binding poses of small molecules designed to disrupt PPI interfaces by binding to such sites.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Encoding time in neural dynamic regimes with distinct computational tradeoffs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shanglin Zhou, Sotiris C. Masmanidis, Dean V. Buonomano</p>

Converging evidence suggests the brain encodes time in dynamic patterns of neural activity, including neural sequences, ramping activity, and complex dynamics. Most temporal tasks, however, require more than just encoding time, and can have distinct computational requirements including the need to exhibit temporal scaling, generalize to novel contexts, or robustness to noise. It is not known how neural circuits can encode time and satisfy distinct computational requirements, nor is it known whether similar patterns of neural activity at the population level can exhibit dramatically different computational or generalization properties. To begin to answer these questions, we trained RNNs on two timing tasks based on behavioral studies. The tasks had different input structures but required producing identically timed output patterns. Using a novel framework we quantified whether RNNs encoded two intervals using either of three different timing strategies: scaling, absolute, or stimulus-specific dynamics. We found that similar neural dynamic patterns at the level of single intervals, could exhibit fundamentally different properties, including, generalization, the connectivity structure of the trained networks, and the contribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Critically, depending on the task structure RNNs were better suited for generalization or robustness to noise. Further analysis revealed different connection patterns underlying the different regimes. Our results predict that apparently similar neural dynamic patterns at the population level (e.g., neural sequences) can exhibit fundamentally different computational properties in regards to their ability to generalize to novel stimuli and their robustness to noise—and that these differences are associated with differences in network connectivity and distinct contributions of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We also predict that the task structure used in different experimental studies accounts for some of the experimentally observed variability in how networks encode time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimates of the basic reproduction number for rubella using seroprevalence data and indicator-based approaches</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Timos Papadopoulos, Emilia Vynnycky</p>

The basic reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) of an infection determines the impact of its control. For many endemic infections, <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> is often estimated from appropriate country-specific seroprevalence data. Studies sometimes pool estimates from the same region for settings lacking seroprevalence data, but the reliability of this approach is unclear. Plausibly, indicator-based approaches could predict <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for such settings. We calculated <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for rubella for 98 settings and correlated its value against 66 demographic, economic, education, housing and health-related indicators. We also trained a random forest regression algorithm using these indicators as the input and <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> as the output. We used the mean-square error to compare the performances of the random forest, simple linear regression and a regional averaging method in predicting <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> using 4-fold cross validation. <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> was <5, 5–10 and >10 for 81, 14 and 3 settings respectively, with no apparent regional differences and in the limited available data, it was usually lower for rural than urban areas. <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> was most correlated with educational attainment, and household indicators for the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients respectively and with poverty-related indicators followed by the crude death rate considering the Maximum Information Coefficient, although the correlation for each was relatively weak (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.4, 95%CI: (0.24,0.48) for educational attainment). A random forest did not perform better in predicting <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> than simple linear regression, depending on the subsets of training indicators and studies, and neither out-performed a regional averaging approach. <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for rubella is typically low and using indicators to estimate its value is not straightforward. A regional averaging approach may provide as reliable an estimate of <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for settings lacking seroprevalence data as one based on indicators. The findings may be relevant for other infections and studies estimating the disease burden and the impact of interventions for settings lacking seroprevalence data.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the limitations of the current scientific publication system, in which serious post-publication concerns are often addressed too slowly to be effective. In this Perspective, we offer suggestions to improve academia’s willingness and ability to correct errors in an appropriate time frame.

Four scientists who have identified issues in published papers struggled to get them amended or retracted; here they present evidence that these struggles are widely shared and that scientific advances are presently critically hindered. They make suggestions for academic actors that would help scientists raise concerns about submissions and improve academia’s correction rate and speed.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Distinct neurocomputational mechanisms support informational and socially normative conformity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ali Mahmoodi, Hamed Nili, Dan Bang, Carsten Mehring, Bahador Bahrami</p>

A change of mind in response to social influence could be driven by <i>informational</i> conformity to increase accuracy, or by <i>normative</i> conformity to comply with social norms such as reciprocity. Disentangling the behavioural, cognitive, and neurobiological underpinnings of informational and normative conformity have proven elusive. Here, participants underwent fMRI while performing a perceptual task that involved both advice-taking and advice-giving to human and computer partners. The concurrent inclusion of 2 different social roles and 2 different social partners revealed distinct behavioural and neural markers for informational and normative conformity. Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) BOLD response tracked informational conformity towards both human and computer but tracked normative conformity only when interacting with humans. A network of brain areas (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ)) that tracked normative conformity increased their functional coupling with the dACC when interacting with humans. These findings enable differentiating the neural mechanisms by which different types of conformity shape social changes of mind.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Lipidomic risk scores are independent of polygenic risk scores and can predict incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in a large population cohort</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chris Lauber, Mathias J. Gerl, Christian Klose, Filip Ottosson, Olle Melander, Kai Simons</p>

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) represent significant disease burdens for most societies and susceptibility to these diseases is strongly influenced by diet and lifestyle. Physiological changes associated with T2D or CVD, such has high blood pressure and cholesterol and glucose levels in the blood, are often apparent prior to disease incidence. Here we integrated genetics, lipidomics, and standard clinical diagnostics to assess future T2D and CVD risk for 4,067 participants from a large prospective population-based cohort, the Malmö Diet and Cancer-Cardiovascular Cohort. By training Ridge regression-based machine learning models on the measurements obtained at baseline when the individuals were healthy, we computed several risk scores for T2D and CVD incidence during up to 23 years of follow-up. We used these scores to stratify the participants into risk groups and found that a lipidomics risk score based on the quantification of 184 plasma lipid concentrations resulted in a 168% and 84% increase of the incidence rate in the highest risk group and a 77% and 53% decrease of the incidence rate in lowest risk group for T2D and CVD, respectively, compared to the average case rates of 13.8% and 22.0%. Notably, lipidomic risk correlated only marginally with polygenic risk, indicating that the lipidome and genetic variants may constitute largely independent risk factors for T2D and CVD. Risk stratification was further improved by adding standard clinical variables to the model, resulting in a case rate of 51.0% and 53.3% in the highest risk group for T2D and CVD, respectively. The participants in the highest risk group showed significantly altered lipidome compositions affecting 167 and 157 lipid species for T2D and CVD, respectively. Our results demonstrated that a subset of individuals at high risk for developing T2D or CVD can be identified years before disease incidence. The lipidomic risk, which is derived from only one single mass spectrometric measurement that is cheap and fast, is informative and could extend traditional risk assessment based on clinical assays.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The microprotein Nrs1 rewires the G1/S transcriptional machinery during nitrogen limitation in budding yeast</a></h4>

Commitment to cell division at the end of G1 phase, termed Start in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, is strongly influenced by nutrient availability. To identify new dominant activators of Start that might operate under different nutrient conditions, we screened a genome-wide ORF overexpression library for genes that bypass a Start arrest caused by absence of the G1 cyclin Cln3 and the transcriptional activator Bck2. We recovered a hypothetical gene <i>YLR053c</i>, renamed <i>NRS1</i> for Nitrogen-Responsive Start regulator 1, which encodes a poorly characterized 108 amino acid microprotein. Endogenous Nrs1 was nuclear-localized, restricted to poor nitrogen conditions, induced upon TORC1 inhibition, and cell cycle-regulated with a peak at Start. <i>NRS1</i> interacted genetically with <i>SWI4</i> and <i>SWI6</i>, which encode subunits of the main G1/S transcription factor complex SBF. Correspondingly, Nrs1 physically interacted with Swi4 and Swi6 and was localized to G1/S promoter DNA. Nrs1 exhibited inherent transactivation activity, and fusion of Nrs1 to the SBF inhibitor Whi5 was sufficient to suppress other Start defects. Nrs1 appears to be a recently evolved microprotein that rewires the G1/S transcriptional machinery under poor nitrogen conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Complementary encoding of spatial information in hippocampal astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sebastiano Curreli, Jacopo Bonato, Sara Romanzi, Stefano Panzeri, Tommaso Fellin</p>

Calcium dynamics into astrocytes influence the activity of nearby neuronal structures. However, because previous reports show that astrocytic calcium signals largely mirror neighboring neuronal activity, current information coding models neglect astrocytes. Using simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging of astrocytes and neurons in the hippocampus of mice navigating a virtual environment, we demonstrate that astrocytic calcium signals encode (i.e., statistically reflect) spatial information that could not be explained by visual cue information. Calcium events carrying spatial information occurred in topographically organized astrocytic subregions. Importantly, astrocytes encoded spatial information that was complementary and synergistic to that carried by neurons, improving spatial position decoding when astrocytic signals were considered alongside neuronal ones. These results suggest that the complementary place dependence of localized astrocytic calcium signals may regulate clusters of nearby synapses, enabling dynamic, context-dependent variations in population coding within brain circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of inspiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle strength, post-operative pulmonary complications and pulmonary function in abdominal surgery- Evidence from systematic reviews. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) following abdominal surgery are common in patients owing to patient-related and procedure-related risk factors. Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) along with various chest physiotherapy manipulations and adjuncts have been proven to reduce PPCs. Current evidence suggests that IMT proves beneficial in reducing PPCs without additional management in varying types of surgeries.  The objective of this review was to synthesize the findings from systematic reviews that evaluate the effectiveness of IMT on abdominal surgery and assess their methodological quality. Methods This review was formed following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO Registration number: CRD42020177876, OSF registry: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/K8NGV). A comprehensive search strategy identifying the effectiveness of IMT on abdominal surgery was developed using electronic databases such as PubMed, Cochrane database of a systematic review, and ClinicalKey. Methodological quality assessment was done using AMSTAR 2 tool. Data on characteristics of intervention and outcome measures were extracted. Results The search yielded 1249 articles, out of which 4 systematic reviews and meta-analysis; reviewing 9 randomized controlled trials; met the inclusion criteria. The most-reported outcome measures were respiratory muscle strength, PPCs, and pulmonary function tests. The overall quality of systematic reviews reported was high. The results for meta-analysis conducted on outcome measure PPCs, i.e., atelectasis and pneumonia reported RR=0.40 (95%CI 0.19 to 0.88), I2=0%, and RR=0.41 (95%CI 0.41 to 1.19), I2=0% respectively and maximum inspiratory pressure was MD=4.97, (95% CI -5.07 to 15.01), I2= 53%. Conclusions The review concluded that IMT is a beneficial intervention when given 2 weeks before surgery for a minimum of 15 minutes in reducing PPCs. However, factors concerning breathing cycles, respiratory flow, and rest interval should be observed for better management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A multi-parameter grading system for optimal fitting of scleral contact lenses [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While scleral lens practise has improved over the years due to factors such as availability of lenses with better materials and designs as well as experience of practitioners, a lack of objectivity appears to remain in terms of assessment of scleral lens fitting. This prospective observational work aimed to achieve standardization on this front through proposing a grading system for scleral lens fitting. Methods: After application of prosthetic replacement of ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE) devices on the participants’ eyes, four fundamental components for understanding scleral lens fitting such as central and limbal corneal clearance, mid-haptic compression, and alignment of lens edge over anterior sclera were assessed through a series of slit-lamp biomicroscopy imaging as well as with anterior segment optical coherence tomography. FitConnect® was used to modify the device parameters to simulate different grading patterns on the proposed scale. Serial imaging was done for all the different lenses to compose the grading scale. Results: A clinically relevant grading scale was constructed that pictorially demonstrated grades for the different aspect of scleral lens fitting. The grades were conveniently scaled within three categories: “optimal”, “acceptable” and “not acceptable”. Conclusion: The gradation of scleral lens fitting parameters would take a step towards objectifying the assessment patterns in practise. This will also help reducing the gap between a novice and an experienced practitioner in terms of understanding of scleral lens fitting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dose response relationship between D-dimer level and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients: a retrospective observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Coagulopathy is one of the most common complications characterized by increased D-dimer level. We aimed to investigate the dose-response relationship between elevated D-dimer level and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study in 259 critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit admission between March and December 2020. We compared the mortality rate between patients with and without elevated D-dimer. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Fagan’s nomogram, and dose-response relationship were performed to determine the association between D-dimer level and mortality. Results: Overall mortality rate was 40.9% (106 patients). Median D-dimer level was higher in non-survivor group (10,170 ng/mL vs 4,050 ng/mL, p=0.028). The association remained significant after multivariate logistic regression analysis (p=0.046). The optimal cut-off for D-dimer level to predict mortality from ROC curve analysis was 9,020 ng/mL (OR (odds ratio) 3.73 [95% CI (confidence interval) 1.91 – 7.28], p<0.001). D-dimer level >9,020 ng/mL confers 67% posterior probability of mortality and D-dimer level <9,020 ng/mL had 35% probability of mortality. Conclusions: There was a non-linear dose-response relationship between D-dimer level and mortality with Pnonlinearity of 0.004. D-dimer level was associated with mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients in the non-linear dose-response relationship.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Probabilistic Mapping Reveals Optimal Stimulation Site in Essential Tremor</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to obtain individual clinical and neuroimaging data of patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor (ET) from 5 different European centers to identify predictors of outcome and to identify an optimal stimulation site.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed retrospectively baseline covariates, pre- and postoperative clinical tremor scores (for 12 months) as well as individual imaging data from 119 patients to obtain individual electrode positions and stimulation volumes. Individual imaging and clinical data were used to calculate a probabilistic stimulation map in normalized space using voxel-wise statistical analysis. Finally, we used this map to train a classifier to predict tremor improvement.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Probabilistic mapping of stimulation effects yielded a statistically significant cluster that was associated with a tremor improvement &gt;50%. This cluster of optimal stimulation extended from the posterior subthalamic area to the ventralis intermedius nucleus and coincided with a normative structural connectivity-based cerebellothalamic tract (CTT). The combined features “distance between the stimulation volume and the significant cluster” and “CTT activation” were used as a predictor of tremor improvement. This correctly classified a &gt;50% tremor improvement with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 57%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our multicenter ET probabilistic stimulation map identified an area of optimal stimulation along the course of the CTT. The results of this study are mainly descriptive until confirmed in independent datasets, ideally through prospective testing. This target will be made openly available and may be used to guide surgical planning and for computer-assisted programming of DBS in the future. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Genetic Architecture of Stroke of Undetermined Source: Overlap with Known Stroke Etiologies and Associations with Modifiable Risk Factors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke etiology remains undetermined in 30% of cases. We explored the genetic architecture of stroke classified as undetermined to test if mechanisms and risk factors underlying large-artery atherosclerotic (LAAS), cardioembolic (CES), and small-vessel stroke (SVS) contribute to its pathogenesis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed genome-wide data from 16,851 ischemic stroke cases and 32,473 controls. Using polygenic risk scores for LAAS, CES, and SVS, we assessed the genetic overlap with stroke of undetermined source and used pairwise genomewide association study (GWAS-PW) to search for shared loci. We then applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify potentially causal risk factors of stroke of undetermined source.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetic risk for LAS, CES, and SVS was associated with stroke of undetermined source pointing to overlap in their genetic architecture. Pairwise analyses revealed 19 shared loci with LAAS, 2 with CES, and 5 with SVS that have been implicated in atherosclerosis-related phenotypes. Genetic liability to both carotid atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation was associated with stroke of undetermined source, but the association with atrial fibrillation was attenuated after excluding cases with incomplete diagnostic workup. MR analyses showed effects of genetically determinants of blood pressure, diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, inflammatory pathways (IL-6 signaling, MCP-1/CCL2 levels), and factor XI levels on stroke of undetermined source.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Stroke of undetermined source shares genetic and vascular risk factors with other stroke subtypes, especially LAAS, thus highlighting the diagnostic limitations of current subtyping approaches. The potentially causal associations with carotid atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic risk factors might have implications for prevention strategies targeting these mechanisms.

     alt="Spatial distribution of beta-klotho mRNA in the mouse hypothalamus, hippocampal region, subiculum, and amygdala"/>
<p>The central expression of beta-klotho (<i>Klb</i>) is essential for the physiological actions of endocrine fibroblast growth factors. <i>Klb</i> mRNA was widely expressed throughout the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala. However, the level of <i>Klb</i> expression varied between cells and contributed to a distinctive pattern of distribution within each brain structure.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Beta-klotho (KLB) is a coreceptor required for endocrine fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15/19 and FGF21 signaling in the brain. <i>Klb</i> is prominent within the hypothalamus, which is consistent with its metabolic functions, but diverse roles for <i>Klb</i> are now emerging. Central <i>Klb</i> expression is low but discrete and may govern FGF-targeted sites. However, given its low expression, it is unclear if <i>Klb</i> mRNA is more widespread. We performed in situ hybridization to label <i>Klb</i> mRNA to generate spatial maps capturing the distribution and levels of <i>Klb</i> within the mouse hypothalamus, hippocampal region, subiculum, and amygdala. Semiquantitative analysis revealed that <i>Klb</i>-labeled cells may express low, medium, or high levels of <i>Klb</i> mRNA. Hypothalamic <i>Klb</i> hybridization was heterogeneous and varied rostrocaudally within the same region. Most <i>Klb</i>-labeled cells were found in the lateral hypothalamic zone, but the periventricular hypothalamic region, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contained the greatest proportion of cells expressing medium or high <i>Klb</i> levels. We also found heterogeneous <i>Klb</i> hybridization in the amygdala and subiculum, where <i>Klb</i> was especially distinct within the central amygdalar nucleus and ventral subiculum, respectively. By contrast, <i>Klb</i>-labeled cells in the hippocampal region only expressed low levels of <i>Klb</i> and were typically found in the pyramidal layer of Ammon's horn or dentate gyrus. The <i>Klb</i>-labeled regions identified in this study are consistent with reported roles of <i>Klb</i> in metabolism, taste preference, and neuroprotection. However, additional identified sites, including within the hypothalamus and amygdala, may suggest novel roles for FGF15/19 or FGF21 signaling.</p>

                Neurons rely heavily on properly regulated mitochondrial and lysosomal homeostasis, with multiple neurodegenerative diseases linked to dysfunction in these two organelles. Interestingly, mitochondria-lysosome membrane contact sites have been identified as a key pathway mediating their crosstalk in neurons. Recent studies have further elucidated the regulation of mitochondria-lysosome contact dynamics via distinct tethering/untethering protein machinery. Moreover, this pathway has been shown to have additional functions in regulating organelle network dynamics and metabolite transfer between lysosomes and mitochondria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recognition of discrete export signals in early flagellar subunits during bacterial Type III secretion</a></h4>

              
                Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS) deliver subunits from the bacterial cytosol to nascent cell surface flagella. Early flagellar subunits that form the rod and hook substructures are unchaperoned and contain their own export signals. A gate recognition motif (GRM) docks them at the FlhBc component of the FlhAB-FliPQR export gate, but the gate must then be opened and subunits must be unfolded to pass through the flagellar channel. This induced us to seek further signals on the subunits. Here, we identify a second signal at the extreme N-terminus of flagellar rod and hook subunits and determine that key to the signal is its hydrophobicity. We show that the two export signal elements are recognised separately and sequentially, as the N-terminal signal is recognised by the flagellar export machinery only after subunits have docked at FlhB<sub>C</sub> <i>via</i> the GRM. The position of the N-terminal hydrophobic signal in the subunit sequence relative to the GRM appeared to be important, as a FlgD deletion variant (FlgD<sub>short</sub>), in which the distance between the N-terminal signal and the GRM was shortened, 'stalled' at the export machinery and was not exported. The attenuation of motility caused by FlgD<sub>short</sub> was suppressed by mutations that destabilised the closed conformation of the FlhAB-FliPQR export gate, suggesting that the hydrophobic N-terminal signal might trigger opening of the flagellar export gate.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nephronectin-Integrin α8 signaling is required for proper migration of periocular neural crest cells during chick corneal development</a></h4>

              
                During development, cells aggregate at tissue boundaries to form normal tissue architecture of organs. However, how cells are segregated into tissue precursors remains largely unknown. Cornea development is a perfect example of this process whereby neural crest cells aggregate in the periocular region prior to their migration and differentiation into corneal cells. Our recent RNA-Seq analysis identified upregulation of Nephronectin (Npnt) transcripts during early stages of corneal development where its function has not been investigated. We found that Npnt mRNA and protein are expressed by various ocular tissues including the migratory periocular neural crest (pNC), which also express the integrin alpha 8 (Itga8) receptor. Knockdown of either <i>Npnt</i> or <i>Itg</i><i>a8</i> attenuated cornea development, whereas overexpression of <i>Npnt</i> resulted in cornea thickening. Moreover, overexpression of Npnt variants lacking RGD binding sites did not affect corneal thickness. Neither the knockdown or augmentation of Npnt caused significant changes in cell proliferation, suggesting that Npnt directs pNC migration into the cornea. <i>In vitro</i> analyses showed that Npnt promotes pNC migration from explanted periocular mesenchyme, which requires Itga8, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rho kinase (ROCK). Combined, these data suggest that Npnt augments cell migration into the presumptive cornea ECM by functioning as a substrate for Itgα8-positive pNC cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Improvement of muscle strength in a mouse model for congenital myopathy treated with HDAC and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                To date there are no therapies for patients with congenital myopathies, muscle disorders causing poor quality of life of affected individuals. In approximately 30% of the cases, patients with congenital myopathies carry either dominant or recessive mutations in the <i>RYR1</i> gene; recessive <i>RYR1</i> mutations are accompanied by reduction of RyR1 expression and content in skeletal muscles and are associated with fiber hypotrophy and muscle weakness. Importantly, muscles of patients with recessive <i>RYR1</i> mutations exhibit increased content of class II histone de-acetylases and of DNA genomic methylation. We recently created a mouse model knocked-in for the p.Q1970fsX16+p.A4329D RyR1 mutations, which are isogenic to those carried by a severely affected child suffering from a recessive form of RyR1-related multi-mini core disease. The phenotype of the RyR1 mutant mice recapitulates many aspects of the clinical picture of patients carrying recessive <i>RYR1</i> mutations. We treated the compound heterozygous mice with a combination of two drugs targeting DNA methylases and class II histone de-acetylases. Here we show that treatment of the mutant mice with drugs targeting epigenetic enzymes improves muscle strength, RyR1 protein content and muscle ultrastructure. This study provides proof of concept for the pharmacological treatment of patients with congenital myopathies linked to recessive <i>RYR1</i> mutations.

                Patients suffering from familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) may have a disproportionally severe outcome after head trauma, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Hence, we subjected knock-in mice carrying the severer S218L or milder R192Q FHM1 gain-of-function missense mutation in the <i>CACNA1A</i> gene that encodes the α<sub>1A </sub>subunit of neuronal voltage-gated Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 (P/Q-type) calcium channels and their wild-type (WT) littermates to experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) by controlled cortical impact (CCI) and investigated cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), lesion volume, brain edema formation, and functional outcome. After TBI, all mutant mice displayed considerably more CSDs and seizures than WT mice, while S218L mutant mice had a substantially higher mortality. Brain edema formation and the resulting increase in intracranial pressure was more pronounced in mutant mice, while only S218L mutant mice had larger lesion volumes and worse functional outcome. Here we show that gain of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel function worsens histopathological and functional outcome after TBI in mice. This phenotype was associated with a higher number of CSDs, increased seizure activity, and more pronounced brain edema formation. Hence, our results suggest increased susceptibility for CSDs and seizures as potential mechanisms for bad outcome after TBI in FHM1 mutation carriers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sampling alternative conformational states of transporters and receptors with AlphaFold2</a></h4>

              
                Equilibrium fluctuations and triggered conformational changes often underlie the functional cycles of membrane proteins. For example, transporters mediate the passage of molecules across cell membranes by alternating between inward-facing (IF) and outward-facing (OF) states, while receptors undergo intracellular structural rearrangements that initiate signaling cascades. Although the conformational plasticity of these proteins has historically posed a challenge for traditional <i>de novo</i> protein structure prediction pipelines, the recent success of AlphaFold2 (AF2) in CASP14 culminated in the modeling of a transporter in multiple conformations to high accuracy. Given that AF2 was designed to predict static structures of proteins, it remains unclear if this result represents an underexplored capability to accurately predict multiple conformations and/or structural heterogeneity. Here, we present an approach to drive AF2 to sample alternative conformations of topologically diverse transporters and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are absent from the AF2 training set. Whereas models of most proteins generated using the default AF2 pipeline are conformationally homogeneous and nearly identical to one another, reducing the depth of the input multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) by stochastic subsampling led to the generation of accurate models in multiple conformations. In our benchmark, these conformations spanned the range between two experimental structures of interest, with models at the extremes of these conformational distributions observed to be among the most accurate (average template modeling (TM)-score of 0.94). These results suggest a straightforward approach to identifying native-like alternative states, while also highlighting the need for the next generation of deep learning algorithms to be designed to predict ensembles of biophysically relevant states.

                Combining multiple Parkinson's disease (PD) relevant cellular phenotypes might increase the accuracy of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) in vitro models. We differentiated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with a LRRK2 G2019S mutation, isogenic control and genetically unrelated iPSCs into mDA neurons. Using automated fluorescence microscopy in 384-well plate format, we identified elevated levels of -synuclein and Serine 129 phosphorylation (pS129), reduced dendritic complexity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Next, we measured additional image-based phenotypes and used machine learning (ML) to accurately classify mDA neurons according to their genotype. Additionally, we show that chemical compound treatments, targeting LRRK2 kinase activity or -synuclein levels, are detectable when using ML classification based on multiple image-based phenotypes. We validated our approach using a second isogenic patient derived SNCA gene triplication mDA neuronal model. This phenotyping and classification strategy improves the exploitability of mDA neurons for disease modelling and the identification of novel PD drug targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regional variation in cholinergic terminal activity determines the non-uniform occurrence of cortical slow-wave activity during REM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sleep consists of two basic stages: non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM sleep is characterized by slow high-amplitude cortical EEG signals, while REM sleep is characterized desynchronized cortical rhythms. While, until recently, it has been widely believed that cortical activity during REM sleep is globally desynchronized, recent electrophysiological studies showed slow waves (SW) in some cortical areas during REM sleep. Electrophysiological techniques, however, have been unable to resolve the regional structure of these activities, due to relatively sparse sampling. We mapped functional gradients in cortical activity during REM sleep using mesoscale imaging in mice, and observed local SW patterns occurring mainly in somatomotor and auditory cortical regions, with minimum presence within the default mode network. The role of the cholinergic system in local desynchronization during REM sleep was also explored by calcium imaging of cholinergic terminal activity within the mouse cortex. Terminal activity was weaker in regions exhibiting SW activity more frequently during REM sleep. We also analyzed Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity dataset and found that these regions have weaker cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PRL1 and CK2 collaborate to time morning and evening phase in short photoperiods</a></h4>

              
                The TIMELESS (TIM) phosphatase, Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver-1 (PRL-1), is required for setting behavioral phase especially under short photoperiod conditions. Yet the circadian clock neurons and underlying mechanisms important for these effects are unknown. Here we demonstrate that PRL-1 function in PDF neurons is necessary and sufficient for timing morning and evening phase under short photoperiod (6:18) conditions. In standard (12:12) photoperiod, we find that PRL-1 rescue or blocking PRL-1 knockdown in PDF neurons restores wild-type morning phase. Expression of the TIM kinase shaggy (sgg) in PDF neurons suppresses in an additive manner PRL-1 period lengthening and delayed morning phase further underscoring the role of PDF neurons. In contrast to knockdown in all clock neurons, knockdown of PRL-1 selectively in PDF clock neurons does not alter the timing of morning or evening phase under standard photoperiod conditions, suggesting PRL-1 function in non-PDF neurons may also be important. In contrast to SGG effects, we find that phase delay of evening onset due to expression of a dominant negative version of the TIM kinase CK2 (CK2alphaTik) requires PRL-1. Given that TIM is a substrate of both the PRL-1 phosphatase and CK2 kinase, we hypothesize that PRL-1 dephosphorylation at specific sites may be necessary for subsequent CK2 phosphorylation to time behavior.

                The axon initial segment (AIS) is a highly specialized neuronal compartment that regulates the generation of action potentials and maintenance of neuronal polarity. Despite its importance, live imaging of the AIS is challenging due to the limited number of suitable labeling methods. To overcome this limitation, we established a novel approach for live labeling of the AIS using unnatural amino acids (UAAs) and bioorthogonal click chemistry. The small size of the UAAs and the possibility of introducing them virtually anywhere into the target proteins make this method particularly suitable for live labeling and imaging of complex and spatially restricted proteins. With this approach, we labeled two large AIS components, the 186 kDa isoform of neurofascin (NF186) and the 260 kDa voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV1.6), and performed widefield and confocal microscopy in fixed and living neurons. Moreover, we demonstrated the applicability of this method by studying the localization of two epilepsy-causing NaV1.6 variants with a loss-of-function effect. Finally, to further improve the efficiency of the UAA incorporation, we developed adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for click labeling in primary neurons. The use of AAV vectors will facilitate the transfer of UAA-based click labeling technology to more complex biological systems, such as organotypic slice cultures, organoids, and animal models.

Although it has been proposed that deep neuronal activity might be recordable during cognitive tasks using magnetoencephalography (MEG), this remains to be demonstrated as the contribution of deep structures to MEG recordings may be too small to be detected or might be eclipsed by the activity of large-scale neocortical networks. In the present study, we disentangled mesial activity and large-scale networks from the MEG signals thanks to blind source separation (BSS). We then validated the MEG BSS components using intracerebral EEG signals recorded simultaneously in patients during their presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. In the MEG signals obtained during a memory task involving the recognition of old and new images, we identified with BSS a putative mesial component, which was present in all patients and all control subjects. The time course of the component selectively correlated with SEEG signals recorded from hippocampus and rhinal cortex, thus confirming its mesial origin. This finding complements previous studies with epileptic activity and opens new possibilities for using MEG to study deep brain structures in cognition and in brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG evidence that morally relevant autobiographical memories can be suppressed</a></h4>

              
                Remembering unpleasant events can trigger negative feelings. Fortunately, research indicates that unwanted memories can be suppressed to prevent them from intruding into awareness, improving our mental state. The current scientific understanding of memory suppression is, however, based mostly on simpler memories such as associations between words or pictures, which may not reflect how people control unpleasant memory intrusions in everyday life. Here, we investigated the neural and behavioural dynamics of suppressing personal and emotional autobiographical memories using a modified version of the Think/No-Think task. We asked participants to suppress memories of their own past immoral actions, which were hypothesised to be both highly intrusive and motivating to suppress. We report novel evidence from behavioural, ERP and EEG oscillation measures that autobiographical memory retrieval can be suppressed and suggest that autobiographical suppression recruits similar neurocognitive mechanisms as suppression of simple laboratory associations. Suppression did fail sometimes, and EEG oscillations indicated that such memory intrusions occurred from lapses in sustained control. Importantly however, participants improved at limiting intrusions with repeated practice. Furthermore, both behavioural and EEG evidence indicated that intentional suppression may be more difficult for memories of our morally wrong actions than memories of our morally right actions. The findings elucidate the neurocognitive correlates of autobiographical retrieval suppression and have implications for theories of morally motivated memory control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intelligence and Visual Mismatch Negativity: Is Pre-Attentive Visual Discrimination Related to General Cognitive Ability?</a></h4>

              
                Intelligence captures the cognitive ability level of an individual person and electroencephalography (EEG) has been used for decades to identify neurocognitive processes related to intelligence. The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) that is elicited when, within a series of frequent standard stimuli, rare deviant stimuli are presented. As stimuli are typically presented outside the focus of attention, the MMN is suggested to capture automatic pre-attentive discrimination processes, and mixed results have been reported in relation to intelligence. However, the MMN and its relation to intelligence has only been studied in the auditory domain, thus preventing any conclusion about the involvement of automatic discrimination processes in humans dominant sensory modality, i.e., vision. Here we provide a first test of this question. Electroencephalography was recorded from 50 healthy participants during a passive visual oddball task that presented simple sequence violations as well as deviations within a more complex hidden pattern. Signed area amplitudes and fractional area latencies of the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) were calculated with and without Laplacian transformation. Neither vMMN amplitudes nor vMMN latencies were significantly related to intelligence (Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices, RAPM) and Bayes Factors suggest moderate evidence for the absence of associations. Our study presents the first test of whether neural indices of pre-attentive visual discrimination processes are related to intelligence. We discuss critical differences between the auditory and visual MMN and conclude with a discussion of limitations and recommendations for further research in this evolving field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speeded Inference Game: Opening a new chapter in the assessment of error awareness</a></h4>

              
                Influential theories on error processing assume that when we conduct errors adaptive processes are triggered to improve our behaviour and prevent errors in the future. These processes appear to be more effective after participants have detected an error. Therefore, the assessment of error awareness allowing a differential analysis of detected and undetected errors in the context of cognitive control and behavioural adjustments has gained more and more attention in the past decades. A common methodological challenge posed on all studies investigating error detection is that the number of undetected errors is usually relatively low. Here, we introduce a gamified experimental task that uses an adaptive algorithm to generate a robust and stable amount of errors with a high rate of undetected errors. Further, we were able to identify error types, which interestingly differed in terms of their detection rate. Moreover, the game-like appearance of the novel experimental task led to highly motivated participants. The results of the first study were replicated and extended by a second behavioural study. Notably, in study 2, a change in task design specifically modulated error detection, while these changes did not affect the total error rate. Potential applications of the open-source code will be discussed. With this newly developed paradigm, we wish to lay the ground for future research to understand better (neural) processes associated with error awareness.

                Crosstalk mechanisms between pericytes, endothelial cells, and astrocytes preserve integrity and function of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) under physiological conditions. Long intercellular channels allowing the transfer of small molecules and organelles between distant cells called tunneling nanotubes (TNT) represent a potential substrate for energy and matter exchanges between the tripartite cellular compartments of the BBB. However, the role of TNT across BBB cells under physiological conditions and in the course of BBB dysfunction is unknown. In this work, we analyzed the TNT role in the functional dialogue between human brain endothelial cells, and brain pericytes co-cultured with human astrocytes under normal conditions or after exposure to ischemia/reperfusion, a condition in which BBB breakdown occurs, and pericytes participate in the BBB repair. Using live time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and laser-scanning confocal microscopy, we found that astrocytes form long TNT with pericytes and endothelial cells and receive functional mitochondria from both cell types through this mechanism. The mitochondrial transfer also occurred in multicellular assembloids of human BBB that reproduce the three-dimensional architecture of the BBB. Under conditions of ischemia/reperfusion, TNT formation is upregulated, and astrocytes exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation were rescued from apoptosis by healthy pericytes through TNT-mediated transfer of functional mitochondria, an effect that was virtually abolished in the presence of TNT-destroying drugs. The results establish a functional role of TNT in the crosstalk between BBB cells and demonstrate that TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer from pericytes rescues astrocytes from ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis. Our data confirm that the pericytes might play a pivotal role in preserving the structural and functional integrity of BBB under physiological conditions and participate in BBB repair in brain diseases.

                The locus coeruleus (LC) houses the vast majority of noradrenergic neurons in the brain and regulates many fundamental functions. While efferent projections of the LC have been extensively investigated, little is known about its local circuit organization. Here, we performed large-scale multi-patch recordings of LC noradrenergic neurons to profile their morpho-electric properties while simultaneously examining their interactions. LC neurons were diverse and could be classified into two major morpho-electric types. While chemical transmission was not detected, these neurons connected via electrical coupling at a rate comparable to other brain regions. Most connections form between dendrites and were restricted to narrowly spaced pairs or small clusters of neurons of the same type. Furthermore, more than two coupled pairs were often identified from individual recording sets that follow a train-like organizational pattern. The assembly of LC neurons thus follows a spatial and cell type-specific wiring principle that may be imposed by a unique train-like rule.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fluctuation-driven plasticity allows for flexible rewiring of neuronal assemblies</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic connections in neuronal circuits are modulated by pre- and post-synaptic spiking activity. Heuristic models of this process of synaptic plasticity can provide excellent fits to results from in-vitro experiments in which pre- and post-synaptic spiking is varied in a controlled fashion. However, the plasticity rules inferred from fitting such data are inevitably unstable, in that given constant pre- and post-synaptic activity the synapse will either fully potentiate or depress. This instability can be held in check by adding additional mechanisms, such as homeostasis. Here we consider an alternative scenario in which the plasticity rule itself is stable. When this is the case, net potentiation or depression only occur when pre- and post-synaptic activity vary in time, e.g. when driven by time-varying inputs. We study how the features of such inputs shape the recurrent synaptic connections in models of neuronal circuits. In the case of oscillatory inputs, the resulting structure is strongly affected by the phase relationship between drive to different neurons. In large networks, distributed phases tend to lead to hierarchical clustering. Our results may be of relevance for understanding the effect of sensory-driven inputs, which are by nature time-varying, on synaptic plasticity, and hence on learning and memory.

                The relationship between structural variability in late-developing association cortices like the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the development of higher-order cognitive skills is not well understood. Recent findings show that the morphology of LPFC sulci predicts reasoning performance; this work led to the observation of substantial individual variability in the morphology of one of these sulci, the para-intermediate frontal sulcus (pimfs). Here, we sought to characterize this variability and assess its behavioral significance. To this end, we identified the pimfs in a developmental cohort of 72 participants, ages 6-18. When controlling for age, the presence or absence of the ventral component of the pimfs was associated with reasoning, as was the total surface area of pimfs. These findings show that multiple features of sulci can support the development of complex cognitive abilities and highlight the importance of considering individual differences in local morphology when exploring the neurodevelopmental basis of cognition.

	<p>Metals&amp;amp;mdash;especially iron, copper and manganese&amp;amp;mdash;are important elements of brain functions and development. Metal-dysregulation homeostasis is associated with brain-structure damage to the motor, cognitive and emotional systems, and leads to neurodegenerative processes. There is more and more evidence that specialized cognitive and motor exercises can enhance brain function and attenuate neurodegeneration in mechanisms, such as improving neuroplasticity by altering the synaptic structure and function in many brain regions. Psychological and physical methods of rehabilitation are now becoming increasingly important, as pharmacological treatments for movement, cognitive and emotional symptoms are limited. The present study describes physical and cognitive rehabilitation methods of patients associated with metal-induced neurotoxicity such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and Wilson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. In our review, we describe physical (e.g., virtual-reality environments, robotic-assists training) and psychological (cognitive training, cognitive stimulation, neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based therapies) methods, significantly improving the quality of life and independence of patients associated with storage diseases. Storage diseases are a diverse group of hereditary metabolic defects characterized by the abnormal cumulation of storage material in cells. This topic is being addressed due to the fact that rehabilitation plays a vital role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately so far there are no specific guidelines concerning physiotherapy in neurodegenerative disorders, especially in regards to duration of exercise, type of exercise and intensity, as well as frequency of exercise. This is in part due to the variety of symptoms of these diseases and the various levels of disease progression. This further proves the need for more research to be carried out on the role of exercise in neurodegenerative disorder treatment.</p>

	<p>Verbs are central to the syntactic structure of sentences, and, thus, important for learning one&amp;amp;rsquo;s native language. This study examined how children visually inspect events as they hear, and do not hear, a new verb. Specifically, there is evidence that children may focus on the agent of the action or may prioritize attention to the action being performed; to date, little evidence is available. This study used an eye tracker to track 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds&amp;amp;rsquo; looking to the agent (i.e., face) vs. action (i.e., hands) while viewing events linked to a new verb as well as distractor events. A Tobii X30 eye tracker recorded children&amp;amp;rsquo;s fixations to AOIs (head/face and hands) as they watched three target events and two distractor events in different orders during the learning phase, and pointed to one of two events in two test trials. This was repeated for a second novel verb. Pointing results show that children in all age groups were able to learn and extend the new verbs to new events at test. Additionally, across age groups, when viewing target events, children increased their looking to the hands (where the action is taking place) as those trials progressed and decreased their looking to the agents&amp;amp;rsquo; face, which is less informative for learning a new verb&amp;amp;rsquo;s meaning. In contrast, when viewing distractor events, children decreased their looking to hands over trials and maintained their attention to the face. In summary, children&amp;amp;rsquo;s visual attention to agents&amp;amp;rsquo; faces and hands differed depending on whether the events cooccurred with the new verb. These results are important as this is the first study to show this pattern of visual attention during verb learning, and, thus, these results help reveal underlying attentional strategies children may use when learning verbs.</p>

	<p>Cognitive conflict effects are well characterized within unimodality. However, little is known about cross-modal conflicts and their neural bases. This study characterizes the two types of visual and auditory cross-modal conflicts through working memory tasks and brain activities. The participants consisted of 31 healthy, right-handed, young male adults. The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and the Paced Visual Serial Addition Test (PVSAT) were performed under distractor and no distractor conditions. Distractor conditions comprised two conditions in which either the PASAT or PVSAT was the target task, and the other was used as a distractor stimulus. Additionally, oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentration changes in the frontoparietal regions were measured during tasks. The results showed significantly lower PASAT performance under distractor conditions than under no distractor conditions, but not in the PVSAT. Oxy-Hb changes in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and inferior parietal cortex (IPC) significantly increased in the PASAT with distractor compared with no distractor conditions, but not in the PVSAT. Furthermore, there were significant positive correlations between &amp;amp;Delta;task performance accuracy and &amp;amp;Delta;Oxy-Hb in the bilateral IPC only in the PASAT. Visual cross-modal conflict significantly impairs auditory task performance, and bilateral VLPFC and IPC are key regions in inhibiting visual cross-modal distractors.</p>

	<p>Alpha is the predominant rhythm of the human electroencephalogram, but its function, multiple generators and functional coupling patterns are still relatively unknown. In this regard, alpha connectivity patterns can change between different cortical generators depending on the status of the brain. Therefore, in the light of the communication through coherence framework, an alpha functional network depends on the functional coupling patterns in a determined state. This notion has a relevance for brain-state dependent EEG-TMS because, beyond the local state, a network connectivity overview at rest could provide further and more comprehensive information for the definition of &amp;amp;lsquo;instantaneous state&amp;amp;rsquo; at the stimulation moment, rather than just the local state around the stimulation site. For this reason, we studied functional coupling at rest in 203 healthy subjects with MEG data. Sensor signals were source localized and connectivity was studied at the Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF) between three different cortical areas (occipital, parietal and prefrontal). Two different and complementary phase-coherence metrices were used. Our results show a consistent connectivity between parietal and prefrontal regions whereas occipito-prefrontal connectivity is less marked and occipito-parietal connectivity is extremely low, despite physical closeness. We consider our results a relevant add-on for informed, individualized real-time brain state dependent stimulation, with possible contributions to novel, personalized non-invasive therapeutic approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Morphology of an Inhibitory Retinal Interneuron Enables Simultaneous Local and Global Synaptic Integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Amacrine cells, inhibitory interneurons of the retina, feature synaptic inputs and outputs in close proximity throughout their dendritic trees, making them notable exceptions to prototypical somato-dendritic integration with output transmitted via axonal action potentials. The extent of dendritic compartmentalization in amacrine cells with widely differing dendritic tree morphology, however, is largely unexplored. Combining compartmental modeling, dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, targeted microiontophoresis and multielectrode patch-clamp recording (voltage and current clamp, capacitance measurement of exocytosis), we investigated integration in the AII amacrine cell, a narrow-field electrically coupled interneuron that participates in multiple, distinct microcircuits. Physiological experiments were performed with <I>in vitro</I> slices prepared from retinas of both male and female rats. We found that the morphology of the AII enables simultaneous local and global integration of inputs targeted to different dendritic regions. Local integration occurs within spatially restricted dendritic subunits and narrow time windows and is largely unaffected by the strength of electrical coupling. In contrast, global integration across the dendritic tree occurs over longer time periods and is markedly influenced by the strength of electrical coupling. These integrative properties enable AII amacrines to combine local control of synaptic plasticity with location-independent global integration. Dynamic inhibitory control of dendritic subunits is likely to be of general importance for amacrine cells, including cells with small dendritic trees, as well as for inhibitory interneurons in other regions of the CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our understanding of synaptic integration is based on the prototypical morphology of a neuron with multiple dendrites and a single axon at opposing ends of a cell body. Many neurons, notably retinal amacrine cells, are exceptions to this arrangement, and display input and output synapses interspersed along their dendritic branches. In the large dendritic trees of some amacrine cells, such arrangements can give rise to multiple computational subunits. Other amacrine cells, with small dendritic trees, have been assumed to operate as single computational units. Here, we report the surprising result that despite a small dendritic tree, the AII amacrine cell simultaneously performs local integration of synaptic inputs (over smaller dendritic subregions) and global integration across the entire cell.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">KCTD8 and KCTD12 Facilitate Axonal Expression of GABAB Receptors in Habenula Cholinergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors in habenula cholinergic neurons mediate strong presynaptic excitation and control aversive memory expression. K<sup>+</sup> channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) proteins are key interacting partners of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors; it remains unclear whether and how KCTDs contribute to GABA<SUB>B</SUB> excitatory signaling. Here, we show that KCTD8 and KCTD12 in these neurons facilitate the GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors expression in axonal terminals and contribute to presynaptic excitation by GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors. Genetically knocking out <I>KCTD8/12/16</I> or <I>KCTD8/12</I>, but not other combinations of the three <I>KCTD</I> isoforms, substantially reduced GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors&ndash;mediated potentiation of glutamate release and presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in response to axonal stimulation, whereas they had no effect on GABA<SUB>B</SUB>-mediated inhibition in the somata of cholinergic neurons within the habenulo&ndash;interpeduncular pathway in mice of either sex. The physiological phenotypes were associated with a significant decrease in the GABA<SUB>B</SUB> expression within the axonal terminals but not the somata. Overexpressing either KCTD8 or KCTD12 in the <I>KCTD8/12/16</I> triple knock-out mice reversed the changes in axonal GABA<SUB>B</SUB> expression and presynaptic excitation. In mice lacking the KCTDs, aversion-predicting cues produced stronger neuronal activation in the interpeduncular nucleus, and the infusion of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> agonist in this nucleus produced a weaker effect on fear extinction. Collectively, our results reveal isoform-specific roles of KCTD proteins in enriching the axonal expression of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors, facilitating their presynaptic signaling, and modulating aversion-related memory processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors represent the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, but they mediate strong presynaptic excitation in the habenulo&ndash;interpeduncular pathway and modulate aversion memory expression. KCTD proteins are integral constituents of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors. By analyzing the physiological, neuroanatomical, and behavioral phenotypes of multiple KCTD knock-out mouse lines, we show that KCTD8 and KCTD12 facilitate the axonal expression and hence presynaptic excitation of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors in habenula cholinergic neurons and control cued-aversion memory formation and expression in the habenulo&ndash;interpeduncular pathway. These results expand the physiological and behavioral functions of KCTDs in modulating the brain neural circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stabilization of Spine Synaptopodin by mGluR1 Is Required for mGluR-LTD</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dendritic spines, actin-rich protrusions forming the postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses, undergo activity-dependent molecular and structural remodeling. Activation of Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) by synaptic or pharmacological stimulation, induces LTD, but whether this is accompanied with spine elimination remains unresolved. A subset of telencephalic mushroom spines contains the spine apparatus (SA), an enigmatic organelle composed of stacks of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whose formation depends on the expression of the actin-bundling protein Synaptopodin. Allocation of Synaptopodin to spines appears governed by cell-intrinsic mechanisms as the relative frequency of spines harboring Synaptopodin is conserved <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I>. Here we show that expression of Synaptopodin/SA in spines is required for induction of mGluR-LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of male mice. Post-mGluR-LTD, mushroom spines lacking Synaptopodin/SA are selectively lost, whereas spines harboring it are preserved. This process, dependent on activation of mGluR1 but not mGluR5, is conserved in mature mouse neurons and rat neurons of both sexes. Mechanistically, we find that mGluR1 supports physical retention of Synaptopodin within excitatory spine synapses during LTD while triggering lysosome-dependent degradation of the protein residing in dendritic shafts. Together, these results reveal a cellular mechanism, dependent on mGluR1, which enables selective preservation of stronger spines containing Synaptopodin/SA while eliminating weaker ones and potentially countering spurious strengthening by <I>de novo</I> recruitment of Synaptopodin. Overall, our results identify spines with Synaptopodin/SA as the locus of mGluR-LTD and underscore the importance of the molecular microanatomy of spines in synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Long-term changes in functional synaptic strength are associated with modification of synaptic connectivity through stabilization or elimination of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic locus of excitatory synapses. How heterogeneous spine microanatomy instructs spine remodeling after long-term synaptic depression (LTD) remains unclear. Metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1 and mGluR5 induce a form of LTD critical to circuit function in physiological and disease conditions. Our results identify spines containing the protein Synaptopodin, which enables local assembly of a spine apparatus, as the locus of expression of mGluR-LTD and demonstrate a specific role of mGluR1 in promoting selective loss after mGluR-LTD of mature dendritic spines lacking Synaptopodin/spine apparatus. These findings highlight the fundamental contribution of spine microanatomy in selectively enabling functional and structural plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Daam2 Regulates Myelin Structure and the Oligodendrocyte Actin Cytoskeleton through Rac1 and Gelsolin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Myelin is essential to neuronal health and CNS function, and oligodendrocytes (OLs) undergo a complex process of cytoskeletal remodeling to form compact myelin sheaths. We previously discovered that a formin protein, Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 2 (Daam2), suppresses OL differentiation through Wnt signaling; however, its role in cytoskeletal control remains unknown. To investigate this, we used OL-specific Daam2 conditional knockout (Daam2 cKO) mice of either sex and found myelin decompaction during an active period of myelination in postnatal development and motor coordination deficits in adulthood. Using primary OL cultures, we found Daam2-depleted OLs showed morphologic dysregulation during differentiation, suggesting that Daam2 regulates the OL cytoskeleton. <I>In vivo</I> screening identified the actin regulators Rac1 and Gelsolin as possible effectors in Daam2-deficient OL cytoskeletal regulation. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function (LOF) experiments in primary OLs, we found that Rac1 and Gelsolin operate downstream of Daam2 in OL differentiation, with Gelsolin and Daam2 promoting and inhibiting membrane spreading during late differentiation, respectively. <I>In vivo</I> experiments using Daam2 cKO mice revealed increased protein levels of Gelsolin in the developing white matter with no change in RNA levels, suggesting that Daam2 acts in a posttranslational manner to suppress Gelsolin levels. <I>In vitro</I> biochemical studies show Daam2 induces Gelsolin ubiquitination and degradation in OLs. Together, our studies show Daam2 is essential for formation of functional myelin through modulation of Gelsolin levels to regulate the OL cytoskeleton. These findings further demonstrate the critical role of cytoskeletal dynamics in myelination and reveal novel avenues for treatment of a variety of white matter diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Proper myelin formation is essential to CNS function, and oligodendrocytes (OLs) require extensive changes in the actin cytoskeleton to form myelin sheaths. Here, we show that the formin protein Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 2 (Daam2) is necessary for myelin compaction during development and motor learning in adulthood. Further, we demonstrate that Daam2 regulates OL differentiation and morphology through actin regulators Rac1 and Gelsolin. Lastly, we find that Daam2 may control myelin compaction by modulating the ubiquitination and degradation of Gelsolin through recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. These findings reveal novel pathways for regulating myelin structure and function during white matter development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contralateral Limb Specificity for Movement Preparation in the Parietal Reach Region</a></h4>

              
                <p>The canonical view of motor control is that distal musculature is controlled primarily by the contralateral cerebral hemisphere; unilateral brain lesions typically affect contralateral but not ipsilateral musculature. Contralateral-only limb deficits following a unilateral lesion suggest but do not prove that control is strictly contralateral: the loss of a contribution of the lesioned hemisphere to the control of the ipsilesional limb could be masked by the intact contralateral drive from the nonlesioned hemisphere. To distinguish between these possibilities, we serially inactivated the parietal reach region, comprising the posterior portion of medial intraparietal area, the anterior portion of V6a, and portions of the lateral occipital parietal area, in each hemisphere of 2 monkeys (23 experimental sessions, 46 injections total) to evaluate parietal reach region's contribution to the contralateral reaching deficits observed following lateralized brain lesions. Following unilateral inactivation, reach reaction times with the contralesional limb were slowed compared with matched blocks of control behavioral data; there was no effect of unilateral inactivation on the reaction time of either ipsilesional limb reaches or saccadic eye movements. Following bilateral inactivation, reaching was slowed in both limbs, with an effect size in each no different from that produced by unilateral inactivation. These findings indicate contralateral organization of reach preparation in posterior parietal cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Unilateral brain lesions typically affect contralateral but not ipsilateral musculature. Contralateral-only limb deficits following a unilateral lesion suggest but do not prove that control is strictly contralateral: the loss of a contribution of the lesioned hemisphere to the control of the ipsilesional limb could be masked by the intact contralateral drive from the nonlesioned hemisphere. Unilateral lesions cannot distinguish between contralateral and bilateral control, but bilateral lesions can. Here we show similar movement initiation deficits after combined unilateral and bilateral inactivation of the parietal reach region, indicating contralateral organization of reach preparation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Transient Coupling between Infragranular and Subplate Layers to Layer 1 Neurons Before Ear Opening and throughout the Critical Period Depends on Peripheral Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical layer 1 (L1) contains a diverse population of interneurons that can modulate processing in superficial cortical layers, but the intracortical sources of synaptic input to these neurons and how these inputs change over development and with sensory experience is unknown. We here investigated the changing intracortical connectivity to L1 in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of mice of both sexes in <I>in vitro</I> slices across development using laser-scanning photostimulation. Before postnatal day (P)10, L1 cells receive excitatory input from within L1, L2/3, L4, and L5/6 as well as from subplate. Excitatory inputs from all layers increase, especially from L4, and peak during P10&ndash;P16, around the peak of the critical period for tonotopy. Inhibitory inputs followed a similar pattern. Functional circuit diversity in L1 emerges after P16. In adults, L1 neurons receive ascending inputs from L2/3 and L5/6, but only few inputs from L4. The transient hyperconnectivity from deep layers but not L2/3 is absent in deaf mice. Our results demonstrate that deep excitatory and superficial inhibitory circuits are tightly linked in early development and might provide a functional scaffold for the layers in between. These results suggest that early thalamically driven spontaneous and sensory activity in subplate can be relayed to L1 from the earliest ages on and shape L1 connectivity from deep layers. Our results also reveal a period of high transient columnar hyperconnectivity after ear opening coinciding with the critical period, suggesting that circuits originating in deep layers might play a key role in this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> L1 contains a diverse population of interneurons that can modulate processing in superficial cortical layers but the sources of synaptic input to these neurons and how these inputs change over development is unknown. We found that during the critical period a large fraction of excitatory inputs to L1 originated in L5/6 and the cortical subplate. This hyperconnectivity is absent in deaf mice. Our results directly demonstrate that deep excitatory and superficial inhibitory circuits are tightly linked in early development and might provide a functional scaffold for the layers in between.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">TRPV1-Lineage Somatosensory Fibers Communicate with Taste Neurons in the Mouse Parabrachial Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Trigeminal neurons convey somatosensory information from craniofacial tissues. In mouse brain, ascending projections from medullary trigeminal neurons arrive at taste neurons in the parabrachial (PB) nucleus, suggesting that taste neurons participate in somatosensory processing. However, the cell types that support this convergence were undefined. Using Cre-directed optogenetics and <I>in vivo</I> neurophysiology in anesthetized mice of both sexes, here we studied whether transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-lineage nociceptive and thermosensory fibers are primary neurons that drive trigeminal circuits reaching PB taste cells. We monitored spiking activity in individual PB neurons during photoexcitation of the terminals of TRPV1-lineage fibers arriving at the dorsal trigeminal nucleus caudalis, which relays orofacial somatosensory messages to the PB area. We also recorded PB neural responses to oral delivery of taste, chemesthetic, and thermal stimuli. We found that optical excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers elicited responses in traditionally defined taste neurons in lateral PB nuclei. The tuning of neurons across diverse tastes associated with their sensitivity to TRPV1-lineage fiber stimulation, which only sparingly engaged neurons oriented to preferred tastes like sucrose. Moreover, neurons responsive to photostimulation of TRPV1-lineage afferents showed strong responses to temperature including noxious heat, which predominantly excited PB bitter taste cells. Multivariate and machine learning analyses revealed the PB confluence of TRPV1-lineage signals with taste captured sensory valence information shared across aversive gustatory, nociceptive, and thermal stimuli. Our results reveal that TRPV1-lineage fibers, which have defined roles in thermosensation and pain, communicate with PB taste neurons. This multisensory convergence supports dependencies between gustatory and somatosensory hedonic representations in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The parabrachial (PB) nucleus participates in autonomic and integrative neural processing for diverse sensory modalities. We recently found in mice that trigeminal neurons supplying craniofacial somatosensation project to PB neurons sensitive to tastes. Here, we show that trigeminal projections to PB gustatory cells are driven by a genetic class of thermosensory and nociceptive fiber. Input from these fibers was associated with PB neural sensitivity to aversive oral temperatures and tastes and supported a multimodal neural representation of sensory valence across gustatory, nociceptive, and thermal stimuli. These results reveal gustation and somatosensation to be only components of a larger PB code that captures sensory value. Defining this circuit has implications for understanding the neural representation of taste, temperature, and also pain-related phenomena.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dopamine Release in Nucleus Accumbens Is under Tonic Inhibition by Adenosine A1 Receptors Regulated by Astrocytic ENT1 and Dysregulated by Ethanol</a></h4>

              
                <p>Striatal adenosine A<SUB>1</SUB> receptor (A<SUB>1</SUB>R) activation can inhibit dopamine release. A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs on other striatal neurons are activated by an adenosine tone that is limited by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) that is enriched on astrocytes and is ethanol sensitive. We explored whether dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core is under tonic inhibition by A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs, and is regulated by astrocytic ENT1 and ethanol. In <I>ex vivo</I> striatal slices from male and female mice, A<SUB>1</SUB>R agonists inhibited dopamine release evoked electrically or optogenetically and detected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, most strongly for lower stimulation frequencies and pulse numbers, thereby enhancing the activity-dependent contrast of dopamine release. Conversely, A<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonists reduced activity-dependent contrast but enhanced evoked dopamine release levels, even for single optogenetic pulses indicating an underlying tonic inhibition. The ENT1 inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine reduced dopamine release and promoted A<SUB>1</SUB>R-mediated inhibition, and, conversely, virally mediated astrocytic overexpression of ENT1 enhanced dopamine release and relieved A<SUB>1</SUB>R-mediated inhibition. By imaging the genetically encoded fluorescent adenosine sensor [GPCR-activation based (GRAB)-Ado], we identified a striatal extracellular adenosine tone that was elevated by the ENT1 inhibitor and sensitive to gliotoxin fluorocitrate. Finally, we identified that ethanol (50 m<scp>m</scp>) promoted A<SUB>1</SUB>R-mediated inhibition of dopamine release, through diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. Together, these data reveal that dopamine output dynamics are gated by a striatal adenosine tone, limiting amplitude but promoting contrast, regulated by ENT1, and promoted by ethanol. These data add to the diverse mechanisms through which ethanol modulates striatal dopamine, and to emerging datasets supporting astrocytic transporters as important regulators of striatal function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine axons in the mammalian striatum are emerging as strategic sites where neuromodulators can powerfully influence dopamine output in health and disease. We found that ambient levels of the neuromodulator adenosine tonically inhibit dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core via adenosine A<SUB>1</SUB> receptors (A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs), to a variable level that promotes the contrast in dopamine signals released by different frequencies of activity. We reveal that the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) on astrocytes limits this tonic inhibition, and that ethanol promotes it by diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. These findings support the hypotheses that A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs on dopamine axons inhibit dopamine release and, furthermore, that astrocytes perform important roles in setting the level of striatal dopamine output, in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Out of Rhythm: Compromised Precision of Theta-Gamma Coupling Impairs Associative Memory in Old Age</a></h4>

              
                <p>Episodic memory declines with advancing adult age. This decline is particularly pronounced when associations between items and their contexts need to be formed. According to theories of neural communication, the precise coupling of gamma power to the phase of the theta rhythm supports associative memory formation. To investigate whether age differences in associative memory are related to compromised theta-gamma coupling, we took EEG recordings during the encoding phase of an item-context association task. Fifty-eight younger (33 females) and 55 older (24 females) adults studied pictures of objects superimposed on background scenes. In a recognition test, objects were presented on old or new backgrounds, and participants responded if they had seen (1) the object and (2) the object/scene pair. Theta-gamma coupling supported pair memory formation in both age groups. Whereas pair memory was associated with coupling closer to the peak of the theta rhythm, item-only memory was associated with a deviation in phase angle relative to pair memory. Furthermore, a stable relation between coupling phase and pair memory performance demonstrated that coupling closer to the peak is beneficial for associative memory. Critically, older adults' lower pair memory was accompanied by a shift in coupling phase relative to that of younger adults. In concert, the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that decrements in the temporal precision with which gamma power is coupled to a specific theta phase underlie the decline of associative memory in normal cognitive aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> According to prominent theories of neural communication, the precise coordination of oscillatory activity enables the formation of associative memories. We propose that normal cognitive aging impairs associative memory formation by compromising the temporal precision of neural communication. We show that the coupling of high-frequency gamma power to low-frequency theta phase supports associative memory formation in both younger and older adults, with coupling closer to the theta peak benefitting memory performance. However, compared with younger adults, the coupling phase angle is shifted in time and is more variable in the older adults. We conclude that alterations in the precise timing of theta-gamma coupling contribute to adult age differences in associative memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Retrieval-Related Anterior Shift Is Moderated by Age and Correlates with Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent research suggests that episodic memory is associated with systematic differences in the localization of neural activity observed during memory encoding and retrieval. The retrieval-related anterior shift is a phenomenon whereby the retrieval of a stimulus event (e.g., a scene image) is associated with a peak neural response which is localized more anteriorly than the response elicited when the stimulus is experienced directly. Here, we examine whether the magnitude of the anterior shift (i.e., the distance between encoding- and retrieval-related response peaks) is moderated by age, and also whether the shift is associated with memory performance. Younger and older human subjects of both sexes underwent fMRI as they completed encoding and retrieval tasks on word-face and word-scene pairs. We localized peak scene and face selectivity for each individual participant within the face-selective precuneus and in three scene-selective (parahippocampal place area [PPA], medial place area, occipital place area) ROIs. In line with recent findings, we identified an anterior shift in the PPA and occipital place area in both age groups and, in older adults only, in the medial place area and precuneus also. Of importance, the magnitude of the anterior shift was larger in older than in younger adults. The shift within the PPA exhibited an age-invariant across-participant negative correlation with source memory performance, such that a smaller displacement between encoding- and retrieval-related neural activity was associated with better performance. These findings provide novel insights into the functional significance of the anterior shift, especially in relation to memory decline in older age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive aging is associated with reduced ability to retrieve precise details of previously experienced events. The retrieval-related anterior shift is a phenomenon in which category-selective cortical activity at retrieval is localized anterior to the peak activity at encoding. The shift is thought to reflect a bias at retrieval in favor of semantic and abstract information at the expense of low-level perceptual detail. Here, we report that the anterior shift is exaggerated in older relative to younger adults, and we demonstrate that a larger shift in the parahippocampal place area is associated with poorer memory performance. These findings suggest that the shift is sensitive to increasing age and that it is moderated by the quality and content of the retrieved episode.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sleep-Dependent Facilitation of Visual Perceptual Learning Is Consistent with a Learning-Dependent Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>How sleep leads to offline performance gains in learning remains controversial. A use-dependent model assumes that sleep processing leading to performance gains occurs based on general cortical usage during wakefulness, whereas a learning-dependent model assumes that this processing is specific to learning. Here, we found evidence that supports a learning-dependent model in visual perceptual learning (VPL) in humans (both sexes). First, we measured the strength of spontaneous oscillations during sleep after two training conditions that required the same amount of training or visual cortical usage; one generated VPL (learning condition), while the other did not (interference condition). During a post-training nap, slow-wave activity (SWA) and sigma activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and theta activity during REM sleep were source localized to the early visual areas using retinotopic mapping. Inconsistent with a use-dependent model, only in the learning condition, sigma and theta activity, not SWA, increased in a trained region-specific manner and correlated with performance gains. Second, we investigated the roles of occipital sigma and theta activity during sleep. Occipital sigma activity during NREM sleep was significantly correlated with performance gains in presleep learning; however, occipital theta activity during REM sleep was correlated with presleep learning stabilization, shown as resilience to interference from postsleep learning in a trained region-specific manner. Occipital SWA was not associated with offline performance gains or stabilization. These results demonstrate that sleep processing leading to performance gains is learning dependent in VPL and involves occipital sigma and theta activity during sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present study shows strong evidence that could help resolve the long-standing controversy surrounding sleep processing that strengthens learning (performance gains). There are two conflicting models. A use-dependent model assumes that sleep processing leading to performance gains occurs because of general cortical usage during wakefulness, whereas a learning-dependent model assumes that processing occurs specifically for learning. Using visual perceptual learning and interference paradigms, we found that processing did not take place after general cortical usage. Moreover, sigma activity during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and theta activity during REM sleep in occipital areas were found to be involved in processing, which is consistent with the learning-dependent model and not the use-dependent model. These results support the learning-dependent model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Brain Selectively Tunes to Unfamiliar Voices during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brain continues to respond selectively to environmental stimuli during sleep. However, the functional role of such responses, and whether they reflect information processing or rather sensory inhibition, is not fully understood. Here, we present 17 human sleepers (14 females) with their own name and two unfamiliar first names, spoken by either a familiar voice (FV) or an unfamiliar voice (UFV), while recording polysomnography during a full night of sleep. We detect K-complexes, sleep spindles, and microarousals, and assess event-related and frequency responses as well as intertrial phase synchronization to the different stimuli presented during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We show that UFVs evoke more K-complexes and microarousals than FVs. When both stimuli evoke a K-complex, we observe larger evoked potentials, more precise time-locking of brain responses in the delta band (1&ndash;4 Hz), and stronger activity in the high frequency (&gt;16 Hz) range, in response to UFVs relative to FVs. Crucially, these differences in brain responses disappear completely when no K-complexes are evoked by the auditory stimuli. Our findings highlight discrepancies in brain responses to auditory stimuli based on their relevance to the sleeper and propose a key role for K-complexes in the modulation of sensory processing during sleep. We argue that such content-specific, dynamic reactivity to external sensory information enables the brain to enter a sentinel processing mode in which it engages in the important internal processes that are ongoing during sleep while still maintaining the ability to process vital external sensory information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous research has shown that sensory processing continues during sleep. Here, we studied the capacity of the sleeping brain to extract and process relevant sensory information. We presented sleepers with their own names and unfamiliar names spoken by either an FV or a UFV. During NREM sleep, UFVs elicited more K-complexes and microarousals than FVs. By contrasting stimuli that evoked K-complexes, we demonstrate that UFVs evoked larger, more synchronized brain responses as well as stronger power at high frequencies (&gt;16 Hz) relative to FVs. These differences in brain responses disappeared when no K-complexes were evoked. Our results suggest a pivotal role for K-complexes in the selective processing of relevant information during NREM sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrating Reward Information for Prospective Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Value-based decision-making is often studied in a static context, where participants decide which option to select from those currently available. However, everyday life often involves an additional dimension: deciding when to select to maximize reward. Recent evidence suggests that agents track the latent reward of an option, updating changes in their latent reward estimate, to achieve appropriate selection timing (latent reward tracking). However, this strategy can be difficult to distinguish from one in which the optimal selection time is estimated in advance, allowing an agent to wait a predetermined amount of time before selecting, without needing to monitor an option's latent reward (distance-to-goal tracking). Here, we show that these strategies can in principle be dissociated. Human brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG), while female and male participants performed a novel decision task. Participants were shown an option and decided when to select it, as its latent reward changed from trial-to-trial. While the latent reward was uncued, it could be estimated using cued information about the option's starting value and value growth rate. We then used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to assess whether EEG signals more closely resembled latent reward tracking or distance-to-goal tracking. This approach successfully dissociated the strategies in this task. Starting value and growth rate were translated into a distance-to-goal signal, far in advance of selecting the option. Latent reward could not be independently decoded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using high temporal resolution neural recordings to identify internally computed decision variables in the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reward-seeking behavior involves acting at the right time. However, the external world does not always tell us when an action is most rewarding, necessitating internal representations that guide action timing. Specifying this internal neural representation is challenging because it might stem from a variety of strategies, many of which make similar predictions about brain activity. This study used a novel approach to test whether alternative strategies could be dissociated in principle. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we were able to distinguish between candidate internal representations for selection timing. This shows how pattern analysis methods can be used to measure latent decision information in noninvasive neural data.</p>

                <p>Neonatal hydrocephalus presents with various degrees of neuroinflammation and long-term neurologic deficits in surgically treated patients, provoking a need for additional medical treatment. We previously reported elevated neuroinflammation and severe periventricular white matter damage in the <I>progressive hydrocephalus</I> (<I>prh</I>) mutant which contains a point mutation in the <I>Ccdc39</I> gene, causing loss of cilia-mediated unidirectional CSF flow. In this study, we identified cortical neuropil maturation defects such as impaired excitatory synapse maturation and loss of homeostatic microglia, and swimming locomotor defects in early postnatal <I>prh</I> mutant mice. Strikingly, systemic application of the anti-inflammatory small molecule bindarit significantly supports healthy postnatal cerebral cortical development in the <I>prh</I> mutant. While bindarit only mildly reduced the ventricular volume, it significantly improved the edematous appearance and myelination of the corpus callosum. Moreover, the treatment attenuated thinning in cortical Layers II&ndash;IV, excitatory synapse formation, and interneuron morphogenesis, by supporting the ramified-shaped homeostatic microglia from excessive cell death. Also, the therapeutic effect led to the alleviation of a spastic locomotor phenotype of the mutant. We found that microglia, but not peripheral monocytes, contribute to amoeboid-shaped activated myeloid cells in <I>prh</I> mutants' corpus callosum and the proinflammatory cytokines expression. Bindarit blocks nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation and its downstream proinflammatory cytokines, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in the <I>prh</I> mutant. Collectively, we revealed that amelioration of neuroinflammation is crucial for white matter and neuronal maturation in neonatal hydrocephalus. Future studies of bindarit treatment combined with CSF diversion surgery may provide long-term benefits supporting neuronal development in neonatal hydrocephalus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In neonatal hydrocephalus, little is known about the signaling cascades of neuroinflammation or the impact of such inflammatory insults on neural cell development within the perinatal cerebral cortex. Here, we report that proinflammatory activation of myeloid cells, the majority of which are derived from microglia, impairs periventricular myelination and cortical neuronal maturation using the mouse <I>prh</I> genetic model of neonatal hydrocephalus. Administration of bindarit, an anti-inflammatory small molecule that blocks nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation, restored the cortical thinning and synaptic maturation defects in the <I>prh</I> mutant brain through suppression of microglial activation. These data indicate the potential therapeutic use of anti-inflammatory reagents targeting neuroinflammation in the treatment of neonatal hydrocephalus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disrupting the Balance of Protein Quality Control Protein UBQLN2 Accelerates Tau Proteinopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tau protein accumulation drives toxicity in several neurodegenerative disorders. To better understand the pathways regulating tau homeostasis in disease, we investigated the role of ubiquilins (UBQLNs)&mdash;a class of proteins linked to ubiquitin-mediated protein quality control (PQC) and various neurodegenerative diseases&mdash;in regulating tau. Cell-based assays identified UBQLN2 as the primary brain-expressed UBQLN to regulate tau. UBQLN2 efficiently lowered wild-type tau levels regardless of aggregation, suggesting that UBQLN2 interacts with and regulates tau protein under normal conditions or early in disease. Moreover, UBQLN2 itself proved to be prone to accumulation as insoluble protein in male and female tau transgenic mice and the human tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy. Genetic manipulation of UBQLN2 in a tauopathy mouse model demonstrated that a physiological UBQLN2 balance is required for tau homeostasis. UBQLN2 overexpression exacerbated phosphorylated tau pathology and toxicity in mice expressing P301S mutant tau, whereas P301S mice lacking UBQLN2 showed significantly reduced phosphorylated tau. Further studies support the view that an imbalance of UBQLN2 perturbs ubiquitin-dependent PQC and autophagy. We conclude that changes in UBQLN2 levels, whether because of pathogenic mutations or secondary to disease states, such as tauopathy, contribute to proteostatic imbalances that exacerbate neurodegeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We defined a role for the protein quality control protein Ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2), in age-related neurodegenerative tauopathies. This group of disorders is characterized by the accumulation of tau protein aggregates, which differ when UBQLN2 levels are altered. Given the lack of effective disease-modifying therapies for tauopathies and the function of UBQLN2 in handling various disease-linked proteins, we explored the role of UBQLN2 in regulating tau. We found that UBQLN2 reduced tau levels in cell models but behaved differently in mouse brain, where it accelerated mutant tau pathology and tau-mediated toxicity. A better understanding of the diverse functions of regulatory proteins like UBQLN2 can elucidate some of the causative factors in neurodegenerative disease and outline new routes to therapeutic intervention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dual PI3K{delta}/{gamma} Inhibitor Duvelisib Prevents Development of Neuropathic Pain in Model of Paclitaxel-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>The development of painful paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) represents a major dose-limiting side effect of paclitaxel chemotherapy. Here we report a promising effect of duvelisib (Copiktra), a novel FDA-approved PI3K/ isoform-specific inhibitor, in preventing paclitaxel-induced pain-like behavior and pronociceptive signaling in DRGs and spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) in rat and mouse model of PIPN. Duvelisib blocked the development of mechanical hyperalgesia in both males and females. Moreover, duvelisib prevented paclitaxel-induced sensitization of TRPV1 receptors, and increased PI3K/Akt signaling in small-diameter DRG neurons and an increase of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells within DRGs. Specific optogenetic stimulation of inhibitory neurons combined with patch-clamp recording revealed that duvelisib inhibited paclitaxel-induced weakening of inhibitory, mainly glycinergic control on SCDH excitatory neurons. Enhanced excitatory and reduced inhibitory neurotransmission in the SCDH following PIPN was also alleviated by duvelisib application. In summary, duvelisib showed a promising ability to prevent neuropathic pain in PIPN. The potential use of our findings in human medicine may be augmented by the fact that duvelisib is an FDA-approved drug with known side effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that duvelisib, a novel FDA-approved PI3K/ isoform-specific inhibitor, prevents the development of paclitaxel-induced pain-like behavior in males and females and prevents pronociceptive signaling in DRGs and spinal cord dorsal horn in rat and mouse model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.</p>

                Background: Racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life healthcare can be reduced by showing physicians how to best respond to a documented underlying cause: African American families’ hopes for a miracle via divine intervention influence their end-of-life medical decisions, like, for example, making them not want to withdraw ventilatory support in cases of poor neurologic prognosis because they are still hoping for God to intervene.  Methods: Autoethnographic research probing the author’s Spiritual Care experience in this context yields a nuanced, 90-second point-of-care spiritual intervention physicians can use to address the religious aspect of African American families who base end-of-life medical decisions on their hopes for a miracle via divine intervention. Autoethnographic analysis is framed by physician-author, Dr. Jessica Zitter’s documented journey of grappling with this context. The evolution of Dr. Zitter’s responses to miracle-hoping African American families provides a framework for applying autoethnographic analysis to a critical appropriation of the Johns Hopkins “AMEN” communication protocol for families hoping for a miracle.  Results: The common instinct of white physicians to remain neutral, holding miracle-hoping African American families at arm’s length, rather than supportively engaging their hopes, is shown to be an intellectual ruse for emotional avoidance. A novel, counterintuitive spiritual intervention for the religious aspect of miracle-hoping African American families is integrated into an existing physician communication protocol for responding to families hoping for a miracle with recommendations for utilization of existing communication technology when necessary.  Conclusion: Properly addressing the religious dimension of African American families hoping for a miracle may help physicians to increase their therapeutic connection with families, decrease their own stress/burnout levels, and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life healthcare.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">pTITAN2: Permutation of treatment labels and Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Taxa Indicator Threshold ANalysis (TITAN) was developed to identify thresholds along environmental gradients where rapid changes in taxa frequency and relative abundance are observed. TITAN determines separate change-points for increasing and decreasing taxa in aggregate, as well as change-points for individual taxa, with associated confidence intervals generated using bootstrapping. However, if TITAN is applied to different classes of observations, additional analyses besides using non-overlapping confidence intervals are needed to establish whether change-points differ between treatments or groups because non-overlapping confidence intervals can indicate significant differences but overlapping confidence intervals do not necessarily mean the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Methods: To address this, we present a new R package, pTITAN2, which is an extension to the existing TITAN2 package. The pTITAN2 package was developed to enable comparisons of TITAN output between treatments by permutating the observed data between treatments and rerunning TITAN on the permuted data. Results: The pTITAN2 package includes two functions, occurrences and permute. The occurrences function selects the taxonomic codes to be used in a TITAN run while maintaining the most taxonomic details. The permute function is then used to create a list of permuted sets of taxa and environmental gradients. TITAN is then run again on the permuted data and p-value test can be calculated using the observed and permuted TITAN output to test for statistical differences between treatment effects. Conclusions: The package pTITAN2 is an extension of the existing TITAN2 package and enables users to perform the appropriate statistical tests and determine statistical differences without using overlapping confidence intervals.

                Background: The unprecedented development of Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised the healthcare industry. In the next generation of healthcare systems, self-diagnosis will be pivotal to personalised healthcare services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new screening and diagnostic approaches like mobile health are well-positioned to reduce disease spread and overcome geographical barriers. This paper presents a non-invasive screening approach to predict the health of a person from visually observable features using machine learning techniques. Images like face and skin surface of the patients are acquired using camera or mobile devices and analysed to derive clinical reasoning and prediction of the person’s health. Methods: In specific, a two-level classification approach is presented. The proposed hierarchical model chooses a class by training a binary classifier at the node of the hierarchy. Prediction is then made using a set of class-specific reduced feature set. Results: Testing accuracies of 86.87% and 76.84% are reported for the first and second-level classification. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields favourable prediction results while greatly reduces the computational time. Conclusions: The study suggests that it is possible to predict the health condition of a person based on his/her face appearance using cost-effective machine learning approaches.

                Background: The associations of water and sanitation with population health have been well-documented. However, the specific effects of water and sanitation on chronic diseases in old age are least explored. This study examines the associations between water, sanitation and chronic diseases among older people in Ghana and whether these associations are moderated by sex and spatial variation. Methods: Data from the WHO-SAGE Wave 2 involving adults aged ≥ 50 years were analyzed. Chronis diseases were assessed based on the self-reported diagnosis by a healthcare professional. The exposures included water sources, type of toilet, and sharing of toilet facilities. Generalized logistic regression models estimated the effects of water and sanitation indicators on chronic diseases.  Results: Overall, 18.8% of the sample reported at least one chronic disease. Compared to men and those in rural areas, women and urban residents respectively were more likely to report chronic disease (p < 0.001). After full adjustments, logistic regressions showed that the use of unimproved sanitation (OR = 1.732, CI: 1.377–5.418) and sharing of sanitation facilities (OR = 1.624, CI: 1.095–1.320) were associated with higher odds of chronic diseases. However, the use of water did not reach significance (p = 0.125). We found a significant interaction effect for type of toilet × sex (OR = 3.498, CI: 1.744–16.442), source of water × residence (OR = 5.935, CI: 1.320–26.685), and type of toilet × spatial variation (OR = 1.998, CI: 1.462–8.642).  Conclusions: The use of unimproved sanitation facilities and the sharing of toilet facilities are associated with the occurrence of chronic diseases among older people. Policy and public health interventions targeted at improving the health and well-being of older people should conspicuously include better access and improved sanitation services.

                This dataset was collected from a total of 1,977 university lecturers across 24 African countries, that were purposively targeted due to their level of exposure to scholarly publications. The dataset was collected through an online survey that was sent to respondents through email, WhatsApp, and the Association of African Universities Telegram group. The questionnaire was designed by the researchers and validated by five experts for face and content validity. The demographic information of the data was analysed and the softcopy of the data uploaded to the Mendeley database for easy retrieval after deidentification (see Data Availability statement). The associated questionnaire can be found in the extended data. In Africa, this appears to be the broadest dataset associated with academics’ perception of utilizing digital platforms for research sharing. This implies that scholars can use this dataset to quantitatively analyse the extent to which different digital tools are being utilized for research communication. Considering the current restrictions on in-person social gatherings due to COVID-19, researchers working on related studies may readily utilize this set of data, saving time and cost. A comprehensive but non-exhaustive number of 20 digital tools were assessed based on academics' awareness and current engagement with them, and the challenges they have faced using them. This offers a wide range of areas for studies to be anchored. Furthermore, researchers interested in specific digital tools can also evaluate the extent to which academic staff in African universities are aware of and willing to utilize them for research dissemination. This data will enable scholars and researchers in Africa and beyond to understand the extent to which academics in varsities are willing to adopt digital repositories for research sharing in the context of Africa.

METASnake is a novel tool, implemented in the Snakemake workflow language, to automate multiple metaWRAP modules. Specifically, it wraps the shell scripts provided within the original metaWRAP software, within Snakemake. This approach enables high-throughput simultaneous assembly and analysis of multiple shotgun metagenomic datasets using the robust modular metaWRAP software. We expect this advancement to be of import in institutions where high-performance computing infrastructure is available, especially in the context of big data. This software tool is publicly available at https://github.com/jkrapohl/METASnake.

                Background: Companies need to go green to remain relevant. Previous studies have confirmed that going green leads to superior performance for companies. However, research of green practices in a value chain requires further attention, especially in identifying the green value chain activities that lead to superior performance. A value chain analysis focuses on identifying competitive advantages of firms through five primary and four support activities. Methods: This study extends from Ong et al. (2019), who developed and validated the instrument for the nine green value chain activities, to also examine their effect on firm performance. The 207 valid responses in this study are collected through a questionnaire survey of the sampling frame consisting of companies in Bursa Malaysia and the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers Directory. Results: The findings reveal that the companies’ green practices in primary value chain activities are higher than in the supporting value chain activities. Technological development is the activity with the lowest green attention among the nine value chain activities. Our multiple regression analysis shows that 25% of the variation in firm performance can be significantly explained by the nine green value chain activities. In terms of the individual green value chain activities, green technology development is the only activity that can positively and significantly explain firm performance. Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest that companies intending to build their green core competence need to engage in green technology development. Companies that go green for the purpose of complying to regulations and fulfilling minimum customers’ demands can still embed green practices into their green value chain without compromising their performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel mutation in hexokinase 2 confers resistance to 2-deoxyglucose by altering protein dynamics</a></h4>

Glucose is central to many biological processes, serving as an energy source and a building block for biosynthesis. After glucose enters the cell, hexokinases convert it to glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6P) for use in anaerobic fermentation, aerobic oxidative phosphorylation, and the pentose-phosphate pathway. We here describe a genetic screen in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> that generated a novel spontaneous mutation in hexokinase-2, <i>hxk2</i><sup>G238V</sup>, that confers resistance to the toxic glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). Wild-type hexokinases convert 2DG to 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2DG-6P), but 2DG-6P cannot support downstream glycolysis, resulting in a cellular starvation-like response. Curiously, though the <i>hxk2</i><sup>G238V</sup> mutation encodes a loss-of-function allele, the affected amino acid does not interact directly with bound glucose, 2DG, or ATP. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Hxk2<sup>G238V</sup> impedes sugar binding by altering the protein dynamics of the glucose-binding cleft, as well as the large-scale domain-closure motions required for catalysis. These findings shed new light on Hxk2 dynamics and highlight how allosteric changes can influence catalysis, providing new structural insights into this critical regulator of carbohydrate metabolism. Given that hexokinases are upregulated in some cancers and that 2DG and its derivatives have been studied in anti-cancer trials, the present work also provides insights that may apply to cancer biology and drug resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Missense variants in human ACE2 strongly affect binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike providing a mechanism for ACE2 mediated genetic risk in Covid-19: A case study in affinity predictions of interface variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stuart A. MacGowan, Michael I. Barton, Mikhail Kutuzov, Omer Dushek, P. Anton van der Merwe, Geoffrey J. Barton</p>

SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Spike) binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the strength of this interaction could influence parameters relating to virulence. To explore whether population variants in ACE2 influence Spike binding and hence infection, we selected 10 ACE2 variants based on affinity predictions and prevalence in gnomAD and measured their affinities and kinetics for Spike receptor binding domain through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 37°C. We discovered variants that reduce and enhance binding, including three ACE2 variants that strongly inhibited (p.Glu37Lys, ΔΔG = –1.33 ± 0.15 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> and p.Gly352Val, predicted ΔΔG = –1.17 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) or abolished (p.Asp355Asn) binding. We also identified two variants with distinct population distributions that enhanced affinity for Spike. ACE2 p.Ser19Pro (ΔΔG = 0.59 ± 0.08 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) is predominant in the gnomAD African cohort (AF = 0.003) whilst p.Lys26Arg (ΔΔG = 0.26 ± 0.09 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) is predominant in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AF = 0.01) and European non-Finnish (AF = 0.006) cohorts. We compared ACE2 variant affinities to published SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infectivity data and confirmed that ACE2 variants with reduced affinity for Spike can protect cells from infection. The effect of variants with enhanced Spike affinity remains unclear, but we propose a mechanism whereby these alleles could cause greater viral spreading across tissues and cell types, as is consistent with emerging understanding regarding the interplay between receptor affinity and cell-surface abundance. Finally, we compared mCSM-PPI2 ΔΔG predictions against our SPR data to assess the utility of predictions in this system. We found that predictions of decreased binding were well-correlated with experiment and could be improved by calibration, but disappointingly, predictions of highly enhanced binding were unreliable. Recalibrated predictions for all possible ACE2 missense variants at the Spike interface were calculated and used to estimate the overall burden of ACE2 variants on Covid-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tumor immune cell clustering and its association with survival in African American women with ovarian cancer</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher Wilson, Alex C. Soupir, Ram Thapa, Jordan Creed, Jonathan Nguyen, Carlos Moran Segura, Travis Gerke, Joellen M. Schildkraut, Lauren C. Peres, Brooke L. Fridley</p>

New technologies, such as multiplex immunofluorescence microscopy (mIF), are being developed and used for the assessment and visualization of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). These assays produce not only an estimate of the abundance of immune cells in the TIME, but also their spatial locations. However, there are currently few approaches to analyze the spatial context of the TIME. Therefore, we have developed a framework for the spatial analysis of the TIME using Ripley’s <i>K</i>, coupled with a permutation-based framework to estimate and measure the departure from complete spatial randomness (CSR) as a measure of the interactions between immune cells. This approach was then applied to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) using mIF collected on intra-tumoral regions of interest (ROIs) and tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 160 high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients in the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) (94 subjects on TMAs resulting in 263 tissue cores; 93 subjects with 260 ROIs; 27 subjects with both TMA and ROI data). Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the association of abundance and spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3+), cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+CD3+), and regulatory T-cells (CD3+FoxP3+) with overall survival. Analysis was done on TMA and ROIs, treating the TMA data as validation of the finding from the ROIs. We found that EOC patients with high abundance and low spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and T-cell subsets in their tumors had the best overall survival. Additionally, patients with EOC tumors displaying high co-occurrence of cytotoxic T-cells and regulatory T-cells had the best overall survival. Grouping women with ovarian cancer based on both cell abundance and spatial contexture showed better discrimination for survival than grouping ovarian cancer cases only by cell abundance. These findings underscore the prognostic importance of evaluating not only immune cell abundance but also the spatial contexture of the immune cells in the TIME. In conclusion, the application of this spatial analysis framework to the study of the TIME could lead to the identification of immune content and spatial architecture that could aid in the determination of patients that are likely to respond to immunotherapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The impact of individual perceptual and cognitive factors on collective states in a data-driven fish school model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Weijia Wang, Ramón Escobedo, Stéphane Sanchez, Clément Sire, Zhangang Han, Guy Theraulaz</p>

In moving animal groups, social interactions play a key role in the ability of individuals to achieve coordinated motion. However, a large number of environmental and cognitive factors are able to modulate the expression of these interactions and the characteristics of the collective movements that result from these interactions. Here, we use a data-driven fish school model to quantitatively investigate the impact of perceptual and cognitive factors on coordination and collective swimming patterns. The model describes the interactions involved in the coordination of burst-and-coast swimming in groups of <i>Hemigrammus rhodostomus</i>. We perform a comprehensive investigation of the respective impacts of two interactions strategies between fish based on the selection of the most or the two most influential neighbors, of the range and intensity of social interactions, of the intensity of individual random behavioral fluctuations, and of the group size, on the ability of groups of fish to coordinate their movements. We find that fish are able to coordinate their movements when they interact with their most or two most influential neighbors, provided that a minimal level of attraction between fish exist to maintain group cohesion. A minimal level of alignment is also required to allow the formation of schooling and milling. However, increasing the strength of social interactions does not necessarily enhance group cohesion and coordination. When attraction and alignment strengths are too high, or when the heading random fluctuations are too large, schooling and milling can no longer be maintained and the school switches to a swarming phase. Increasing the interaction range between fish has a similar impact on collective dynamics as increasing the strengths of attraction and alignment. Finally, we find that coordination and schooling occurs for a wider range of attraction and alignment strength in small group sizes.
