">Fornix and Uncinate Fasciculus Support Metacognition-Driven Cognitive Offloading</a></h4>

              
                People often use external tools to offload cognitive demands in remembering future intentions. While previous research has identified the causal role of metacognition in cognitive offloading, the neural mechanisms underlying this metacognitive control process remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted a study with 34 participants using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate how connections between brain regions support metacognition-driven cognitive offloading. Behaviorally, we confirmed that under-confidence in using internal memory to execute delayed intentions predicts a bias towards using external reminders. At the brain level we found that the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the fornix, a memory-related white matter tract connected to the hippocampus, positively correlated with the bias in setting up reminders. Additionally, the FA of the left uncinate fasciculus, which links the hippocampus to the prefrontal cortex and is involved in memory error monitoring, negatively correlated with deviations from optimal reminder use. Furthermore, the FA of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, a tract involved in metacognitive monitoring, moderated how confidence influenced the use of reminders. Taken together, our findings reveal a temporal-frontal neural circuit underlying metacognition-driven cognitive offloading, and provide new insights into the interaction between metacognitive monitoring and control.

">Input-specific localization of NMDA receptor GluN2 subunits in thalamocortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Molecular and functional diversity among synapses is generated, in part, by differential expression of neurotransmitter receptors and their associated protein complexes. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are tetrameric ionotropic glutamate receptors that most often comprise two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. NMDARs generate functionally diverse synapses across neuron populations through cell-type-specific expression patterns of GluN2 subunits (GluN2A - 2D), which have vastly different functional properties and distinct downstream signaling. Diverse NMDAR function has also been observed at anatomically distinct inputs to a single neuron population. However, the mechanisms that generate input-specific NMDAR function remain unknown as few studies have investigated subcellular GluN2 subunit localization in native brain tissue. We investigated NMDAR synaptic localization in thalamocortical (TC) neurons expressing all four GluN2 subunits. Utilizing super resolution imaging and knockout-validated antibodies, we revealed subtype- and input-specific GluN2 localization at corticothalamic (CT) versus sensory inputs to TC neurons in 4-week-old male and female C57Bl/6J mice. GluN2B was the most abundant postsynaptic subunit across all glutamatergic synapses followed by GluN2A and GluN2C, and GluN2D was localized to the fewest synapses. GluN2B was preferentially localized to CT synapses over sensory synapses, while GluN2A and GluN2C were more abundant at sensory inputs compared to CT inputs. Furthermore, postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD95 and SAP102 were preferentially localized with specific GluN2 subunits, and SAP102 was more abundant at sensory synapses than PSD95. This work indicates that TC neurons exhibit subtype- and input-specific localization of diverse NMDARs and associated scaffolding proteins that likely contribute to functional differences between CT and sensory synapses.

">TAF1-dependent transcriptional dysregulation underlies multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by neuroinflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to disablility. Genetic variants that confer MS risk implicate genes involved in immune function, while variants related to severity of the disease are associated with genes preferentially expressed within the CNS. Current MS therapies decrease relapse rates by preventing immune-mediated damage of myelin, but they ultimately fail to slow long-term disease progression, which apparently depends on CNS intrinsic processes. The molecular events that trigger progressive MS are still unknown. Here we report that the C-terminal region of TAF1 (the scaffolding subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID) is underrepresented in postmortem brain tissue from individuals with MS. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vivo, in genetically modified mice, that C-terminal alteration of TAF1 suffices to induce an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-elongation deficit that particularly affects oligodendroglial myelination-related genes and results in an MS-like brain transcriptomic signature, including increased expression of proinflammatory genes. This transcriptional profile is accompanied by CNS-resident inflammation, robust demyelination and MS-like motor phenotypes. We also identify numerous interactors of C-terminal TAF1 that participate in RNAPII-promoter escape, of which two show evidence for genetic association to MS. Our study reveals that TAF1 dysfunction converges with genetic susceptibility to cause transcriptional dysregulation in CNS cell types, such as oligodendrocytes, to ultimately trigger MS.

">Oxtyocin and vasopressin 1a receptor alterations in the superior temporal sulcus and hypothalamus in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe psychiatric condition characterized in part by social impairments. As social cognitive functioning is a major predictor of successful life outcomes in schizophrenia, there is a critical need to determine the neurobiological basis of social impairments in schizophrenia. The current study used receptor autoradiography to examine vasopressin 1a (AVPR1a) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) densities in the postmortem brain tissue of individuals who had schizophrenia (N=23) relative to unaffected matched controls (N=18). We analyzed the superior temporal sulcus, a brain region that is highly implicated in social perception and shows aberrant functioning in schizophrenia. Greater AVPR1a binding densities were observed relative to OXTR. Increases in AVPR1a densities with advanced age in females who had schizophrenia were also observed. This finding in the superior temporal sulcus may explain a shift in positive symptom severity(paranoia/suspiciousness) that has been observed with advanced age in women with schizophrenia. In addition, increased OXTR and a trend toward increased AVPR1a densities were observed in the hypothalamus in schizophrenia. The hypothalamus synthesizes oxytocin and vasopressin in the brain and is the initiator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which facilitates the fight or flight stress response. These receptor systems may be upregulated to compensate for possibly low exogenous oxytocin and vasopressin release from the hypothalamus in schizophrenia. Our findings show age- and sex-dependent effects on nonapeptide receptor binding that shed light onto the neurobiology of the social brain in the progression of schizophrenia.

">Musicality enhances selective attention: spatiotemporal insights from precise separation of simultaneous neural responses</a></h4>

              
                We precisely resolved simultaneous neural responses to their driving stimuli and classified them to different selective attention conditions towards specific melodies within mixtures. Magnetoencephalographic findings reveal the influence of participants' musicality and task performance on the recruitment of cortical regions in bottom-up and top-down attentional processes. Across parietal regions, musicality and performance correlated positively with top-down attention at the left hemisphere, but negatively with bottom-up attention at the right. In the right prefrontal cortex, individuals who maintained selective attention over the tone duration performed better and were more musical. These results suggest that musical training boosts performance by enhancing top-down attention, reducing bottom-up distractions, and sustaining selective attention overtime, with these effects mediated by the frontoparietal cortex. This work advances our understanding of neural selective attention mechanisms in complex soundscapes and underscores the potential of musical training for cognitive enhancement. Our breakthrough approach effectively captures cognitive effects with frequency-tagging, creating new possibilities for scientific applications.

	<p>This work aims to shed light on the differential diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD) within the context of intimate partner violence (IPV), which represents a highly innovative field of clinical research. To this end, a critical review of the literature was conducted to identify and compare the clinical patterns and symptomatic overlaps among cPTSD, PTSD, and BPD, with an emphasis on their manifestation in both IPV victims and offenders. The results show that despite some symptomatic similarities, cPTSD, PTSD, and BPD have distinct clinical patterns of interpersonal violence. Specifically, disturbances in self-organization (DSO) are more commonly found in offenders, while the diagnosis of cPTSD seems more aligned with the psychological functioning of victims. In addition, cPTSD and specific characteristics of BPD, such as fear of rejection and instability of identity, constitute risk factors for IPV victimization. cPTSD is shown as a predisposing factor not only for IPV victims but also for offenders, while PTSD emerges as a consequential factor. The specific pathways linking PTSD, cPTSD, and BPD with IPV have significant implications for clinical practice. Further research is needed to understand these profiles and the mechanisms linking trauma-related features to IPV, which is crucial for implementing effective violence prevention programs.</p>

	<p>Tobacco consumption in schizophrenia (SCHZ) patients is highly prevalent. Data support the occurrence of sequential events during comorbidity establishment, and both smoking first, SCHZ second and SCHZ first, smoking second sequences have been proposed. To investigate whether these two possibilities lead to distinct outcomes of comorbidity, we used a phencyclidine-induced SCHZ model and nicotine exposure as a surrogate of smoking. C57Bl/6 mice were submitted to a protocol that either began with 4 days of phencyclidine exposure or 4 days of nicotine exposure. This period was followed by 5 days of combined phencyclidine + nicotine exposure. Locomotor sensitization and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) were assessed due to their well-known associations with SCHZ as opposed to rearing, an unrelated behavior. Nicotine priming potentiated phencyclidine-evoked sensitization. However, nicotine exposure after SCHZ modeling did not interfere with phencyclidine&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects. In the PPI test, nicotine after SCHZ modeling worsened the phencyclidine-evoked deficiency in males. In contrast, nicotine priming had no effects. Regarding rearing, nicotine priming failed to interfere with phencyclidine-mediated inhibition. Similarly, phencyclidine priming did not modify nicotine-mediated inhibition. The present results indicate that the sequence, either SCHZ-first or nicotine-first, differentially impacts comorbidity outcomes, a finding that is relevant for the identification of mechanisms of nicotine interference in the neurobiology of SCHZ.</p>

">State modulation in spatial networks with three interneuron subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Several inhibitory interneuron subtypes have been identified as critical in regulating sensory responses. However, the specific contribution of each interneuron subtype remains uncertain. In this work, we explore the contributions of cell-type specific activity and synaptic connections to dynamics of a spatially organized spiking neuron network. We find that the firing rates of the somatostatin (SOM) interneurons align closely with the level of network synchrony irrespective of the target of modulatory input. Further analysis reveals that inhibition from SOM to parvalbumin (PV) interneurons must be limited to allow gradual transitions from asynchrony to synchrony and that the strength of recurrent excitation onto SOM neurons determines the level of synchrony achievable in the network. Our results are consistent with recent experimental findings on cell-type specific manipulations. Overall, our results highlight common dynamic regimes achieved across modulations of different cell populations and identify SOM cells as the main driver of network synchrony.

">Brain structure and activity predicting cognitive maturation in adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive abilities of primates, including humans, continue to improve through adolescence. While a range of changes in brain structure and connectivity have been documented, how they affect neuronal activity that ultimately determines performance of cognitive functions remains unknown. Here, we conducted a multilevel longitudinal study of monkey adolescent neurocognitive development. The developmental trajectory of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex accounted remarkably well for working memory improvements. While complex aspects of activity changed progressively during adolescence, such as the rotation of stimulus representation in multidimensional neuronal space, which has been implicated in cognitive flexibility, even simpler attributes, such as the baseline firing rate in the period preceding a stimulus appearance had predictive power over behavior. Unexpectedly, decreases in brain volume and thickness, which are widely thought to underlie cognitive changes in humans 5 did not predict well the trajectory of neural activity or cognitive performance changes. Whole brain cortical volume in particular, exhibited an increase and reached a local maximum in late adolescence, at a time of rapid behavioral improvement. Maturation of long-distance white matter tracts linking the frontal lobe with areas of the association cortex and subcortical regions best predicted changes in neuronal activity and behavior. Our results provide evidence that optimization of neural activity depending on widely distributed circuitry effects cognitive development in adolescence.

">Gesture encoding in human left precentral gyrus neuronal ensembles</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the cortical activity patterns driving dexterous upper limb motion has the potential to benefit a broad clinical population living with limited mobility through the development of novel brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. The present study examines the activity of ensembles of motor cortical neurons recorded using microelectrode arrays in the dominant hemisphere of two BrainGate clinical trial participants with cervical spinal cord injury as they attempted to perform a set of 48 different hand gestures. Although each participant displayed a unique organization of their respective neural latent spaces, it was possible to achieve classification accuracies of ~70% for all 48 gestures (and ~90% for sets of 10). Our results show that single unit ensemble activity recorded in a single hemisphere of human precentral gyrus has the potential to generate a wide range of gesture-related signals across both hands, providing an intuitive and diverse set of potential command signals for intracortical BCI use.

">Structural Development of Speech Networks in Young Children at Risk for Speech Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Characterizing the structural development of the neural speech network in early childhood is important for understanding speech acquisition. To investigate speech in the developing brain, 94 children aged 4-7-years-old at risk for early speech disorder were scanned using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, each child completed the Syllable Repetition Task (SRT), a validated measure of phoneme articulation. The DWI data were modeled using multi-compartment restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) to measure restricted and hindered diffusion properties in both grey and white matter. Consequently, we analyzed the diffusion data using both whole brain analysis, and automated fiber quantification (AFQ) analysis to establish tract profiles for each of six fiber pathways thought to be important for supporting speech development. In the whole brain analysis, we found that SRT performance was associated with restricted diffusion in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis, right pre-supplementary and supplementary motor area (pre-SMA/SMA), and bilateral cerebellar grey matter (p < .005). Age moderated these associations in left pars opercularis and frontal aslant tract (FAT). However, in both cases only the cerebellar findings survived a cluster correction. We also found associations between SRT performance and restricted diffusion in cortical association fiber pathways, especially left FAT, and in the cerebellar peduncles. Analyses using automatic fiber quantification (AFQ) highlighted differences in high and low performing children along specific tract profiles, most notably in left but not right FAT. These findings suggest that individual differences in speech performance are reflected in structural gray and white matter differences as measured by restricted and hindered diffusion metrics, and offer important insights into developing brain networks supporting speech in very young children.

	<p>Over the past 20 years, there has been a growing interest in the processing of tool objects, and in the spatial S-R correspondence effects obtained with pictures of manipulable objects. Beyond the original affordance activation account, a location coding account has been proposed for such behavioral effects, which states that the location of the visually salient portion of an object speeds up spatially aligned motor responses and slows down misaligned ones. Furthermore, an additional action coding account has been proposed, according to which it is the direction of the action of the perceived object (e.g., &amp;amp;ldquo;pouring tea leftward&amp;amp;rdquo; when the spout of a teapot is leftward-oriented) that biases motor performance. We investigated this action coding account of S-R correspondence effects by comparing the reaction time (RT) performance of two groups: younger (6 to 9 years old) and older (10 to 13 years old) children. We assumed that knowledge of tool objects and the activation of action codes from object perception is proportional to age. Therefore, a larger correspondence effect was hypothesized for the older relative to the younger children&amp;amp;rsquo;s group. Consistently, a 34 ms correspondence effect was observed in the older children relative to the younger ones (18 ms). The results support the view that action direction is a constitutive feature of tool objects, which is subject to experience, and thus, to increasing knowledge over time.</p>

	<p>Ideomotor apraxia is a cognitive disorder most often resulting from acquired brain lesions (i.e., strokes or tumors). Neuroimaging and lesion studies have implicated several brain regions in praxis and apraxia, but most studies have described (sub)acute patients. This study aimed to extend previous research by analyzing data from 115 left hemisphere chronic stroke patients using the praxis subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, which is divided into four action types: facial, upper limb, complex, and instrumental. Lesion&amp;amp;ndash;symptom mapping was used to identify brain regions most critically associated with difficulties in each of the four subtests. Complex and instrumental action deficits were associated with left precentral, postcentral, and superior parietal gyri (Brodmann areas 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), while the facial and upper limb action deficits maps were restricted to left inferior, middle, and medial temporal gyri (Brodmann areas 20, 21, 22, and 48). We discuss ideas about neuroplasticity and cortical reorganization in chronic stroke and how different methodologies can reveal different aspects of lesion and recovery networks in apraxia.</p>

                Background There is no doubt that vaccination is crucial for preventing the spread of diseases; however, not every vaccine is perfect or will work for everyone. The main objective of this work is to predict which vaccine will be most effective for a candidate without causing severe adverse reactions and to categorize a patient as potentially at high risk of death from the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods A comprehensive analysis was conducted using a dataset on COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions, exploring binary and multiclass classification scenarios. Ensemble models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Light Gradient Boosting, and extreme gradient boosting algorithm, were utilized to achieve accurate predictions. Class balancing techniques like SMOTE, TOMEK_LINK, and SMOTETOMEK were incorporated to enhance model performance. Results The study revealed that pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, history of allergies, prior vaccinations, other medications, age, and gender were crucial factors associated with poor outcomes. Moreover, using medical history, the ensemble learning classifiers achieved accuracy scores ranging from 75% to 87% in predicting the vaccine type and mortality possibility. The Random Forest model emerged as the best prediction model, while the implementation of the SMOTE and SMOTETOMEK methods generally improved model performance. Conclusion The random forest model emerges as the top recommendation for machine learning tasks that require high accuracy and resilience. Moreover, the findings highlight the critical role of medical history in optimizing vaccine outcomes and minimizing adverse reactions.

                This work is an application of experimental temperature data previously collected in a residential building in Douala, Cameroon, in order to analyze thermal discomfort. The data was collected according to three occupancy scenarios over 12 month period using thermohygrometer sensors. The temperature data are analysed in comparison with the comfortable temperature range from 24°C to 28°C. The degree hour (DH) method was used to assess the severity of thermal discomfort in a hot and humid climate. The results reveal that the open C1, closed C2 and inhabited C3 rooms corresponding to scenarios C1, C2 and C3 respectively, have 7270.6°H, 9063.9°H and 10023°H. The inhabited room C3 has the largest DH and although the room C1 has the smallest DH, the latter largely exceeded the tolerable limit value of 1250°H set by the RE2020 Environmental Regulations. Results from this work can serve in building modelling for researchers and architects to act for the alleviation of thermal discomfort in regions with hot and humid climate.

                Background As graph datasets—including social networks, supply chains, and bioinformatics data—grow in size and complexity, researchers are driven to search for solutions enhancing model efficiency and speed. One avenue that may provide a solution is Quantum Graph Learning (QGL), a subfield of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) that applies machine learning inspired or powered by quantum computing to graph learning tasks. Methods We reevaluate Quantum Feature Embeddings (QFE), a QGL methodology published by Xu et al. earlier this year. QFE uses Variational Quantum Circuits to preprocess node features and then sends them to a classical Graph Neural Network (GNN), with the goal of increasing performance and/or decreasing total model size. Xu et al. evaluated this methodology by comparing its performance with the performance of variously-sized classical models on the benchmark datasets PROTEINS and ENZYMES, and they report success. Our core methodology and learning task remain unchanged. However, we have made several changes to the experimental design that enhance the rigor of the study: 1) we include the testing of models with no embedder; 2) we conduct a thorough hyperparameter search using a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm; and 3) we conduct stratified five-fold cross-validation, which mitigates the bias produced by our small datasets and provides multiple test statistics from which we can calculate a confidence interval. Results We produce classical models that perform comparably to QFE and significantly outperform the small classical models used in Xu et al.’s comparison. Notably, many of our classical models achieve this using fewer parameters than the QFE models we trained. Xu et al. do not report their total model sizes. Conclusion Our study sheds doubt on the efficacy of QFE by demonstrating that small, well-tuned classical models can perform just as well as QFE, highlighting the importance of hyperparameter tuning and rigorous experimental design.

                Background This study investigated the influence of various factors on Faculty Attitude, Faculty Engagement, and Work Performance in higher education. The study specifically examined the impact of faculty attitudes towards digital technology on their level of involvement and effectiveness in the classroom. Furthermore, it investigated how the utilization of digital technology by faculty members influences the connection between their attitudes and job performance. Methods The study utilized a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect thorough data to explore the factors influencing faculty attitude. A survey was performed among 438 faculty members from higher educational institutions in the Delhi and NCR region. Results The results indicated a strong positive relationship of perceived usefulness, mutual learning, institutional support, collaborativeness, creativity, critical thinking, and faculty attitude towards digital technology adoption in academic setting. Nevertheless, External Pressure did not exhibit a significant relationship. The study revealed that the attitude of faculty members has a significant impact on both their work performance and engagement. Additionally, faculty engagement was found to have a positive impact on work performance. The mediation Analysis revealed that Faculty Engagement served as a partial mediator in the association between Faculty Attitude and Work Performance. Conclusions The study’s implications underscore the urgent need of fostering positive attitudes and engagement among faculty members for enhancing their performance in academic settings. Some of the limitations and implication of the study and future direction of the research directions are suggested.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012361">aiSEGcell: User-friendly deep learning-based segmentation of nuclei in transmitted light images</a></h4>

Segmentation is required to quantify cellular structures in microscopic images. This typically requires their fluorescent labeling. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can detect these structures also in only transmitted light images. This eliminates the need for transgenic or dye fluorescent labeling, frees up imaging channels, reduces phototoxicity and speeds up imaging. However, this approach currently requires optimized experimental conditions and computational specialists. Here, we introduce “aiSEGcell” a user-friendly CNN-based software to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images. We extensively evaluated it for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities in hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets. We provide this curated ground-truth data with 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images. aiSEGcell accurately segments nuclei from even challenging bright field images, very similar to manual segmentation. It retains biologically relevant information, e.g. for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. aiSEGcell is readily adaptable to new use cases with only 32 images required for retraining. aiSEGcell is accessible through both a command line, and a napari graphical user interface. It is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user expert coding experience.

                <p>by Bjarke Haldrup Pedersen, Filipa Bica Simões, Ivan Pogrebnyakov, Martin Welch, Helle Krogh Johansen, Søren Molin, Ruggero La Rosa</p>

Metabolism provides the foundation for all cellular functions. During persistent infections, in adapted pathogenic bacteria metabolism functions radically differently compared with more naïve strains. Whether this is simply a necessary accommodation to the persistence phenotype or if metabolism plays a direct role in achieving persistence in the host is still unclear. Here, we characterize a convergent shift in metabolic function(s) linked with the persistence phenotype during <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> colonization in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. We show that clinically relevant mutations in the key metabolic enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase, lead to a host-specialized metabolism together with a lower virulence and immune response recruitment. These changes in infection phenotype are mediated by impaired type III secretion system activity and by secretion of the antioxidant metabolite, pyruvate, respectively. Our results show how metabolic adaptations directly impinge on persistence and pathogenicity in this organism.

                <p>by Juan Du, Weiqiang Liu, Meng Li, Zihao Li, Xuanjing Li, Yichen Dai, Gaoming Liu, Xiao Wang, Pingfen Zhu, Vadim N. Gladyshev, Xuming Zhou</p>

The naked mole rat (NMR), <i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>, is known as the longest-lived rodent and is extraordinarily resistant to hypoxia and cancer. Here, both NMR embryonic fibroblasts (NEFs) and their mouse counterparts (MEFs) were subjected to anoxic conditions (0% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). A combination of comparative transcriptomics and proteomics was then employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Notably, we observed distinct levels of histone H1.2 (encoded by <i>HIST1H1C</i>) accumulation between NEFs and MEFs. Subsequent mechanistic analyses showed that higher H1.2 expression in NEFs was associated with the lower expression of its inhibitor, <i>PARP1</i>. Additionally, we discovered that H1.2 can directly interact with HIF-1α PAS domains, thereby promoting the expression of HIF-1α through facilitating the dimerization with HIF-1β. The overexpression of H1.2 was also found to trigger autophagy and to suppress the migration of cancer cells, as well as the formation of xenograft tumors, via the NRF2/P62 signaling pathway. Moreover, an engineered H1.2 knock-in mouse model exhibited significantly extended survival in hypoxic conditions (4% O<sub>2</sub>) and showed a reduced rate of tumor formation. Collectively, our results indicate a potential mechanistic link between H1.2 and the dual phenomena of anoxic adaptation and cancer resistance.

                <p>by Tea Kohlbrenner, Simon Berger, Ana Cristina Laranjeira, Tinri Aegerter-Wilmsen, Laura Filomena Comi, Andrew deMello, Alex Hajnal</p>

Germ cell apoptosis in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> hermaphrodites is a physiological process eliminating around 60% of all cells in meiotic prophase to maintain tissue homeostasis. In contrast to programmed cell death in the <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> soma, the selection of germ cells undergoing apoptosis is stochastic. By live-tracking individual germ cells at the pachytene stage, we found that germ cells smaller than their neighbors are selectively eliminated through apoptosis before differentiating into oocytes. Thus, cell size is a strong predictor of physiological germ cell death. The RAS/MAPK and ECT/RHO/ROCK pathways together regulate germ cell size by controlling actomyosin constriction at the apical rachis bridges, which are cellular openings connecting the syncytial germ cells to a shared cytoplasmic core. Enhancing apical constriction reduces germ cell size and increases the rate of cell death while inhibiting the actomyosin network in the germ cells prevents their death. We propose that actomyosin contractility at the rachis bridges of the syncytial germ cells amplifies intrinsic disparities in cell size. Through this mechanism, the animals can adjust the balance between physiological germ cell death and oocyte differentiation.

                Introduction Neuroinflammase, a key mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer and Parkinson, is influenced by statin, a lipid-binding protein. Studies show that statin can mitigate the likelihood of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease and can also reduce leukocytosis and T-regulatory function. Nevertheless, there is restricted literature on the use of statin in neuroinflammation. The objective of this investigation is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of statin use in neuroinflammation, providing valuable insights into research development and future research questions. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords neuroinflammation and statins. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The research trend found are Documents by Year, Most Global Cited Document, Most Relevant Sources, Factorial Map Of The Documents With The Highest Contributes, Documents by Author, Most Relevant Affiliations, Documents by Subject Area, Trend Topic, Network Visualization, Overlay visualization of scopus, database using Vosviewer, Density Visualization, Thematic Map, Thematic Evolution, Cluster Analysis, Qualitative Analysis, and Word Cloud. Conclusions The study highlights the potential for further research on statins and neuroinflammation, aiming to better understand their role in treating neuroinflammation and enhance the quality of life for patients with neuroinflammatory conditions.

                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.

                Where did Ecuador’s foreign debt originate and grow to alarming levels? The purpose of this article is to describe, from an analytical perspective based on the contributions of various authors, the origin of Ecuador’s external debt with international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the support that these organizations provide for the development of the countries of the South, case Ecuador. To achieve this purpose, a documentary methodology was implemented that included an exhaustive review of studies focused on the specific variables subject to analysis, the PRISMA tool and Atlas.ti 23 were used. The results show that the creation of these financing agencies in their attempt to support the financial stability of developing countries has not been sufficiently effective in improving the welfare conditions of a good percentage of the population and has generated an imbalance in the sustained development of the poorest countries. It is concluded that the capitalist system gives predominant priority to the economic growth of nations, thus relegating in its model the consideration of human development. This orientation does not contribute effectively to the improvement of crucial aspects such: education, health and the standard of living of the population.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurofilament light chains (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains (pNfH), established as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in hospital-based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cohorts, are now surrogate markers in clinical trials. This study extends their evaluation to a population level, with the aim of advancing their full establishment and assessing the transferability of biomarker findings from controlled cohorts to real-world ALS populations.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured serum NfL and pNfH levels in all ALS patients (n = 790) and general population controls (n = 570) with available baseline samples participating in the epidemiological ALS Registry Swabia, providing platform-specific (ELLA™) reference data and Z-scores for controls, as well as reference data, disease-specific Z-scores and longitudinal data in ALS. We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of neurofilaments and quantified the impact of ALS-related factors and non-ALS confounders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Neurofilaments showed high diagnostic and prognostic utility at the population level, with NfL superior to pNfH. The novel concept of a population-based ALS Z-score significantly improved the prognostic utility compared to absolute raw values. Both biomarkers increased more strongly with age in controls than in ALS, and age adjustment improved diagnostic accuracy. Our data show that disease progression rates, ALS phenotype, body mass index (BMI), and renal function need to be considered when interpreting neurofilament levels; longitudinal neurofilament levels were generally stable in individual patients, especially when adjusted for age and baseline levels.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Population-based assessment enhances the utility of particularly serum NfL as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in ALS and improves the translation of findings from controlled cohorts to real-world populations. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a highly prevalent subclinical inflammatory intestinal disorder associated with growth failure, impaired neurocognitive development, poor response to oral vaccines, and micronutrient deficiencies. However, EE research and clinical trials are hampered by the lack of non-invasive tools for measuring intestinal function in detail. This study aims to develop new tools for the measurement of multiple domains of gut functional capacity. Methods The GI TOOLS project is a cross-sectional study that will recruit adults aged 18-65 years with EE in Lusaka, Zambia. Each participant will undergo assessment of gut functional capacity using novel near-point-of-care tools and provide multiple samples for detailed laboratory analyses. Participants will also undergo endoscopy for collection of duodenal biopsies. Novel techniques include stable isotopes approaches to measuring digestion, absorption, and bidirectional transmucosal amino acid flux, a non-invasive fluorescence tool for real-time evaluation of gut permeability, and assessment of reverse permeation of intravenous antibiotics to be carried out separately in Zimbabwe. Stool and duodenal microbiome sequencing using MinION sequencing, metabolome analysis applied to plasma and intestinal fluids, blood immune cell phenotyping, in vitro epithelial barrier models, and duodenal immunohistochemistry will also be used to explore EE in depth. These will all be integrated with gold standard histology and mucosal morphometry, alongside lactulose permeation data, and stool and plasma biomarker analysis. The protocol has been approved by ethics committees and regulators in Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the UK. Participants will give informed consent before they can participate Anticipated outcomes Based on this extensive phenotyping, tests will be developed which can be simplified and refined for use in adults and children with EE, and for clinical trials. Findings from this project will be disseminated through in-person meetings with caregivers and regulatory bodies, presentations at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.

                Background This study was primarily intended to develop and validate a comprehensive and psychometrically acceptable measure of students’ propensity to cheat (PTC) behavior among undergraduate students in Ethiopian universities by assessing their engagement in different types of cheating behavior. Methods The present study employed an explanatory research design using a questionnaire based on the Propensity to Cheat Scale (PCS). The questionnaire was administered to 500 university students (male = 367 [73.4%]; female = 133 [26.6%]) selected from three Ethiopian public universities between November and January 2022. In order to measure the underlying variables of propensity towards cheating, a factor model is developed using exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate the students’ perceived PTC. The internal consistency of the PTC scale was assessed using reliability analysis, and validity evaluations were conducted to confirm the scale’s discriminant and convergent validity. Results Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results revealed a good fit to the data, and the internal consistency of the PCS was found to be strong, providing a reliable measure of students’ propensity for cheating. Validity evaluations, including discriminant validity and convergent validity, confirmed the validity of the scale. The average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability values also supported the scale’s convergent validity. The multidimensional concept of the PTC was supported by a four-factor solution consisting of 26 reliable and valid items. Conclusion The findings of the study demonstrate that the scale has also provided sufficient evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. By establishing discriminant and convergent validity, as well as reliability, through different validation procedures, the study has provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the PCS as an instrument for determining whether university students are likely to engage in cheating behavior.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There is currently scarce data on the electroclinical characteristics of epilepsy associated with synapsin 1 (<i>SYN1</i>) pathogenic variations. We examined clinical and electro-encephalographic (EEG) features in patients with epilepsy and <i>SYN1</i> variants, with the aim of identifying a distinctive electroclinical pattern.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected and reviewed demographic, genetic, and epilepsy data of 19 male patients with <i>SYN1</i> variants. Specifically, we analyzed interictal EEG data for all patients, and electro-clinical data from 10 epileptic seizures in 5 patients, using prolonged video-EEG monitoring recordings. Inter-ictal EEG functional connectivity parameters and frequency spectrum of the 10 patients over 12 years of age, were computed and compared with those of 56 age- and sex-matched controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The main electroclinical features of epilepsy in patients with <i>SYN1</i> were (1) EEG background and organization mainly normal; (2) interictal abnormalities are often rare or not visible on EEG; (3) more than 60% of patients had reflex seizures (cutaneous contact with water and defecation being the main triggers) isolated or associated with spontaneous seizures; (4) electro-clinical semiology of seizures was mainly temporal or temporo-insulo/perisylvian with a notable autonomic component; and (5) ictal EEG showed a characteristic rhythmic theta/delta activity predominating in temporo-perisylvian regions at the beginning of most seizures. Comparing patients with <i>SYN1</i> to healthy subjects, we observed a shift to lower frequency bands in power spectrum of interictal EEG and an increased connectivity in both temporal regions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A distinct epilepsy syndrome emerges in patients with <i>SYN1</i>, with a rather characteristic clinical and EEG pattern suggesting predominant temporo-insular involvement. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-954/v1?src=rss">Perspectives and guidance for developing artificial intelligence-based applications for healthcare using medical images [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential to transform healthcare and improve patient care. However, successful development and integration of AI models requires careful consideration of study designs and sample size calculations for development and validation of models, publishing standards, prototype development for translation and collaboration with stakeholders. As the field is relatively new and rapidly evolving there is a lack of guidance and agreement on best practices for most of these steps. We engaged stakeholders in the form of clinicians, researchers from academia and industry, and data scientists to discuss various aspects of the translational pipeline and identified the challenges researchers in the field face and potential solutions to them. In this viewpoint, we present the summary of our discussions as a brief guide on the process of developing AI-based applications for healthcare using medical images. We organized the entire process into six major themes (i.e., The gaps AI can fill in healthcare, Development of AI models for healthcare: practical and important things to consider, Good practices for validation of AI models for healthcare: study designs and sample size calculation, Points to consider when publishing AI models, Translation towards products, Challenges and potential solutions from a technical perspective) and presented important points as a rule of thumb. We conclude that successful integration of AI in healthcare requires a collaborative approach, rigorous validation, adherence to best practices as described and cited, and consideration of technical aspects.

                Background Sonneratia caseolaris, known as the red pidada, has been widely utilized by the Indonesian. S. caseolaris leaves contain various active compounds, contributing to their popularity in the treatment of various diseases. Mangrove leaves are also known to exhibit very high antioxidant activity. This study aims to assess the antioxidant activity of S . caseolaris leaves extracted using different solvents. The resulting extract was evaluated for antioxidant activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH) techniques. Methods Analysis of total flavonoids, total phenols, identification of active compounds with Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and bioinformatics were also carried out to obtain temporary conclusions about the antioxidant activity of S. caseolaris leaf extract. Results The results indicated that S. caseolaris leaves extracted with methanol and distilled water exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to other extracts. The analysis of total flavonoids and total phenols yielded results consistent with the antioxidant activity tests. LC-HRMS results identified three compounds in all S. caseolaris leaf extracts with antioxidant activity, namely Tempo, Choline, and Betaine. Tempo demonstrated a higher antioxidant activity than Choline and Betaine, as indicated by the binding affinity values in the bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions It is evident that S. caseolaris leaf extract has the potential to serve as an effective an antioxidant agent. Further research is needed to elucidate confirm the potential compounds in Sonneratia caseolaris leaves water extract interact with the target protein Keap1. S. caseolaris, in order to utilize them as active components in food and enhance antioxidant consumption among consumers.

                Purpose The current cadaveric report describes the abnormal origin and course of testicular arteries (TAs) in two donated cadavers, along with a renal artery (RA) duplication. Methods Dissection of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the abdominal aorta (AA) branching patterns were performed in 90-year-old- and 76-year-old formalin-embalmed donated male cadavers. Results Variants of the TA origin and course were identified, as coexisting with RA variants. Case 1: A right-sided RA (RRA) duplication (recorded as superior and inferior renal artery-SRA and IRA) with origin from the AA, coexisted with a right TA (RTA) that originated from the IRA and descended anteriorly to the ureter. The left TA (LTA) originated from the AA proximal to the origin of the left RA (LRA). The LTA coursed in front of the common drainage of the left testicular and renal vein into the IVC. Case 2: A bilateral RA duplication was identified and recorded as SRA and IRA. The right-sided SRA originated from the AA upper level and played the role of the accessory RA (ARA). The main perfusion of the right kidney was performed by the IRA which was further trifurcated into a superior polar, an inferior polar (IPA), and a TA. The RTA had a high origin from the IPA. Conclusion The current study reported two cases of TAs with abnormal origin and course accompanied by an RA duplication. A thorough knowledge of the origin and course of the TAs has clinical implications for the kidneys and testicle’ surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-69/v3?src=rss">What can we experience and report on a rapidly presented image? Intersubjective measures of specificity of freely reported contents of consciousness [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A majority of previous studies appear to support a view that human observers can only perceive coarse information from a natural scene image when it is presented rapidly (<100ms, masked). In these studies, participants were often forced to choose an answer from options that experimenters preselected. These options can underestimate what participants experience and can report on it. The current study aims to introduce a novel methodology to investigate how detailed information participants can report after briefly seeing a natural scene image. Methods: We used a novel free-report paradigm to examine what people can freely report following a rapidly presented natural scene image (67/133/267ms, masked). N = 670 online participants typed up to five words to report what they saw in the image together with confidence of the respective responses. We developed a novel index, Intersubjective Agreement (IA). IA quantifies how specifically the response words were used to describe the target image, with a high value meaning the word is not often reported for other images. Importantly, IA eliminates the need for experimenters to preselect response options. Results: The words with high IA values are often something detailed (e.g., a small object) in a particular image. With IA, unlike commonly believed, we demonstrated that participants reported highly specific and detailed aspects of the briefly (even at 67ms, masked) shown image. Further, IA is positively correlated with confidence, indicating metacognitive conscious access to the reported aspects of the image. Conclusion: These new findings challenge the dominant view that the content of rapid scene experience is limited to global and coarse gist. Our novel paradigm opens a door to investigate various contents of consciousness with a free-report paradigm.

                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                The acceptance rate towards COVID-19 vaccination among the global population could be higher due to the need for more education or awareness of prevention strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, there is a dire need to reduce the population’s reluctance towards COVID-19 vaccination across the globe, which will ultimately lead to the implementation of prevention and control strategies against the COVID-19 virus and improving health outcomes across the globe. The following study intends to conduct a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and the current trends related to COVID-19 vaccination faced by the global population. The methodology employed in this study primarily focused on assessing secondary data by conducting a systematic literature review. Internet and electronic databases were used to select research articles to obtain secondary sources. Six articles were selected from ScienceDirect and Google Scholar for a systematic literature review. The keywords used for the selection of articles were “COVID-19,” “Global trends,” Reluctance, “and “vaccination.” The selected articles that were most suitable for the topic consisted of global trends related to COVID-19 vaccination. Six articles relevant to the topic were selected and reviewed. The selected articles showed data collection results from different research journals. The findings of the six research articles depicted common themes, such as each vaccine having a different level of access attitude towards the regional existence, which primarily depends on the variability to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness. Further studies are required to evaluate the factors and strategies that help healthcare organizations and governments reduce the reluctance to use the COVID-19 vaccine among populations worldwide.

                Dysregulation of RNA processing contributes to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In this article, Wu et al. demonstrated that nuclear speckle dysfunction represents a converging toxic pathway contributed by both (GGGGCC)n repeat RNA and the noncanonical translation product poly-GR in C9ORF72-FTD/ALS. Impaired nuclear speckle integrity induces RNA mis-splicing and causes neuronal degeneration.

                The exon junction complex (EJC) is critical for the mRNA life cycle in eukaryotic cells. Alsina et al. report that the nucleating component of this complex, EIF4A3, acts non-canonically as a microtubule-binding protein in neurons to regulate axonal growth.

                Lingamallu et al. demonstrate that club cells (CCs), facultative stem cells of the lower airways, are maintained by canonical Notch signaling. Most CCs, excluding a subpopulation at NEBs and terminal bronchioles (v-CCs), transdifferentiate into multiciliated cells upon Notch inhibition. v-CCs escape due to β-catenin activation and repair airways post Notch inhibition.

Combining single-cell RNA-seq and GWAS data, they find MG susceptibility enriched in the medulla region of thymoma, characterized by specific immune cells. These findings provide a foundation for future MG research.

                de Kivit et al. reveal discerning lipidomes of conventional T cells (Tconvs) versus thymus-derived regulatory T cells (tTreg). Effector tTregs can use either glucose or lactate to synthesize long and unsaturated fatty acids, on which they rely for proliferation and suppressive function. These tTreg-specific properties may be therapeutically exploited.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68404">Inhibitors of the small membrane (M) protein viroporin prevent Zika virus infection</a></h4>

              
                <i>Flaviviruses</i>, including Zika virus (ZIKV), are a significant global health concern, yet no licensed antivirals exist to treat disease. The small Membrane (M) protein plays well-defined roles during viral egress and remains within virion membranes following release and maturation. However, it is unclear whether M plays a functional role in this setting. Here, we show that M forms oligomeric membrane-permeabilising channels <i>in vitro</i>, with increased activity at acidic pH and sensitivity to the prototypic channel-blocker, rimantadine. Accordingly, rimantadine blocked an early stage of ZIKV cell culture infection. Structure-based channel models, comprising hexameric arrangements of two <i>trans</i>-membrane domain protomers were shown to comprise more stable assemblages than other oligomers using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Models contained a predicted lumenal rimantadine binding site, as well as a second druggable target region on the membrane-exposed periphery. <i>In silico</i> screening enriched for repurposed drugs/compounds predicted to bind to either one site or the other. Hits displayed superior potency <i>in vitro</i> and in cell culture compared with rimantadine, with efficacy demonstrably linked to virion-resident channels. Finally, rimantadine effectively blocked ZIKV viraemia in preclinical models, supporting that M constitutes a physiologically relevant target. This could be explored by repurposing rimantadine, or development of new M-targeted-therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93062">The role of heterochronic gene expression and regulatory architecture in early developmental divergence</a></h4>

              
                New developmental programs can evolve through adaptive changes to gene expression. The annelid <i>Streblospio benedicti</i> has a developmental dimorphism, which provides a unique intraspecific framework for understanding the earliest genetic changes that take place during developmental divergence. Using comparative RNAseq through ontogeny, we find that only a small proportion of genes are differentially expressed at any time, despite major differences in larval development and life history. These genes shift expression profiles across morphs by either turning off any expression in one morph or changing the timing or amount of gene expression. We directly connect the contributions of these mechanisms to differences in developmental processes. We examine F<sub>1</sub> offspring – using reciprocal crosses – to determine maternal mRNA inheritance and the regulatory architecture of gene expression. These results highlight the importance of both novel gene expression and heterochronic shifts in developmental evolution, as well as the <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory factors in initiating divergence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87880">Drosophila model to clarify the pathological significance of OPA1 in autosomal dominant optic atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is a progressive form of blindness caused by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, mainly caused by mutations in the OPA1 mitochondrial dynamin <i>like</i> GTPase (<i>OPA1</i>) gene. <i>OPA1</i> encodes a dynamin-like GTPase present in the mitochondrial inner membrane. When associated with OPA1 mutations, DOA can present not only ocular symptoms but also multi-organ symptoms (DOA plus). DOA plus often results from point mutations in the GTPase domain, which are assumed to have dominant-negative effects. However, the presence of mutations in the GTPase domain does not always result in DOA plus. Therefore, an experimental system to distinguish between DOA and DOA plus is needed. In this study, we found that loss-of-function mutations of the <i>dOPA1</i> gene in <i>Drosophila</i> can imitate the pathology of optic nerve degeneration observed in DOA. We successfully rescued this degeneration by expressing the human <i>OPA1</i> (<i>hOPA1</i>) gene, indicating that <i>hOPA1</i> is functionally interchangeable with <i>dOPA1</i> in the fly system. However, mutations previously identified did not ameliorate the <i>dOPA1</i> deficiency phenotype. By expressing both WT and DOA plus mutant <i>hOPA1</i> forms in the optic nerve of <i>dOPA1</i> mutants, we observed that DOA plus mutations suppressed the rescue, facilitating the distinction between loss-of-function and dominant-negative mutations in <i>hOPA1</i>. This fly model aids in distinguishing DOA from DOA plus and guides initial <i>hOPA1</i> mutation treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94407">Association with TFIIIC limits MYCN localisation in hubs of active promoters and chromatin accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II</a></h4>

              
                MYC family oncoproteins regulate the expression of a large number of genes and broadly stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). While the factors that control the chromatin association of MYC proteins are well understood, much less is known about how interacting proteins mediate MYC’s effects on transcription. Here, we show that TFIIIC, an architectural protein complex that controls the three-dimensional chromatin organisation at its target sites, binds directly to the amino-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain of MYCN. Surprisingly, TFIIIC has no discernible role in MYCN-dependent gene expression and transcription elongation. Instead, MYCN and TFIIIC preferentially bind to promoters with paused RNAPII and globally limit the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters. Consistent with its ubiquitous role in transcription, MYCN broadly participates in hubs of active promoters. Depletion of TFIIIC further increases MYCN localisation to these hubs. This increase correlates with a failure of the nuclear exosome and BRCA1, both of which are involved in nascent RNA degradation, to localise to active promoters. Our data suggest that MYCN and TFIIIC exert an censoring function in early transcription that limits promoter accumulation of inactive RNAPII and facilitates promoter-proximal degradation of nascent RNA.

">Properties and predictive potential of the pre-ictal oscillatory dynamics in an ex vivo model of epileptiform activity in the different hippocampal subregions</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal oscillatory activity facilitates the transmission of information between neurons. However, abnormally synchronous neuronal activity results in the emergence of seizure-like activity (SLA). The hippocampus (HPC) is a brain area highly susceptible to SLA. The mechanisms leading to SLA are not yet well understood, although changes in neuronal oscillations have been suggested to exist in the time period before SLA onset. Anti-epileptic drugs, such as diazepam (DZP), a GABAA receptor agonist, and carbamazepine (CBZ), a sodium channel blocker, have significant anti-convulsant properties. However, their role in modulating the oscillatory activity within HPC subregions remains unclear. In our study, we used a high [K+] (HK+) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solution to induce SLA in mouse HPC slices, which was detected using spontaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings. SLA activity was recorded in the three HPC subregions, namely CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG). LFP analysis in the pre-ictal period revealed significant changes in the oscillatory activity compared to the absence of SLA and to ictal events. A classification algorithm revealed that the oscillatory dynamics, particularly in the CA1 subregion, can predict the emergence of an ictal event with high accuracy. Furthermore, we detected differential DZP and CBZ-induced changes in the oscillatory activity in the CA1, CA3 and DG. Imaging of neuronal activation in the ex vivo model of SLA, using the Fos protein as an activity marker, also revealed a subregion-dependent differential modulation following DZP and CBZ perfusion, which resembled the pattern of oscillatory activity changes. Therefore, the oscillatory dynamics could serve a potential electrophysiological biomarker for predicting seizure activity and are differentially modulated by anti-epileptic drugs.

">Tactile Mechanisms and Afferents Underlying the Rat Pup Transport Response</a></h4>

              
                Juvenile rodents and other altricial mammals react with calming, immobility and folding up of feet to parental pickup, a set of behaviors referred to as transport response. Here we investigate sensory mechanisms underlying the rat transport response. Grasping rat pups in anterior neck positions evokes strong immobility and folding up of feet, whereas more posterior grasping positions have lesser effects on immobility and foot position. Transport responses are enhanced by slow (1Hz) and even more so by fast (4Hz) gentle shaking and translation of the pup, features consistent with parental transport. In response to lateral grasping, the forepaw below the grasping position points downwards and the forepaw lateral to the grasping position points upwards and medially. Such forepaw adjustments put the pups center of gravity below the grasping point, optimizing pup transportability along with folding up of feet and tail lifting. Tactile stimuli on the back, belly, tail, whisker, dorsal forepaws and dorsal hind-paws do not significantly affect the behaviour of anterior-neck-held pups. Instead, ground contact or paw stimulation consistent with ground contact disrupts transport responses. We identify afferents mediating the transport response by examining membrane labelling with FM1-43 following anterior neck grasping. We observe a dense innervation of the anterior neck skin region (~30 terminals/ mm2). We also observed an age-related decrease of cytochrome oxidase reactivity in the rat somatosensory cortical neck representation, a possible correlate to the developmental decrease in the pup transport response. We conclude anterior neck grasping and loss of ground contact trigger calming and postural adjustments for parental transport in rat pups, responses putatively driven from the densely innervated anterior neck skin.

">Boundaries in the eyes: measure event segmentation during naturalistic video watching using eye tracking</a></h4>

              
                During naturalistic information processing, individuals spontaneously segment their continuous experiences into discrete events, a phenomenon known as event segmentation. Traditional methods for assessing this process, which include subjective reports and neuroimaging techniques, often disrupt real-time segmentation or are costly and time intensive. Our study investigated the potential of measuring event segmentation by recording and analyzing eye movements while participants view naturalistic videos. We collected eye movement data from healthy young adults as they watched commercial films (N=104), or online Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) educational courses (N=44). We analyzed changes in pupil size and eye movement speed near event boundaries and employed inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) and hidden Markov models (HMM) to identify patterns indicative of event segmentation. We observed that both the speed of eye movements and pupil size dynamically responded to event boundaries, exhibiting heightened sensitivity to high-strength boundaries. Our analyses further revealed that event boundaries synchronized eye movements across participants. These boundaries, can be effectively identified by HMM, yielded higher within-event similarity values and aligned with human-annotated boundaries. Importantly, HMM-based event segmentation metrics responded to experimental manipulations and predicted learning outcomes. This study provided a comprehensive computational framework for measuring event segmentation using eye-tracking. With the widespread accessibility of low-cost eye-tracking devices, the ability to measure event segmentation from eye movement data promises to deepen our understanding of this process in diverse real-world settings.

">Detecting behavioural oscillations with increased sensitivity: A modification of Brookshire's (2022) AR-surrogate method</a></h4>

              
                A core challenge of cognitive neuroscience is to understand how cognition changes over time within the same individual. For example, the tendency for behavioural responses in a range of cognitive domains to oscillate over time has been studied extensively. Recently, however, the phenomenon of behavioural oscillations has been called into question by indications that past findings might reflect aperiodic temporal structure rather than true oscillations. Brookshire (2022) proposed methods to control for aperiodic temporal structure while examining oscillations in behavioural time-courses and found no evidence of behavioural oscillations in reanalyses of four published datasets. However, Brookshire's (2022) method has been criticised for having low sensitivity to detect effects of realistic magnitude, so it is currently unclear whether these findings suggest that behavioural oscillations are not present in these and perhaps many other datasets, or whether they are false negatives. Here, we present a modification of Brookshire's (2022) AR-surrogate method with increased sensitivity to detect effects of realistic magnitude, adequate control of false positives, and other desirable properties such as the ability to increase statistical power by adding more participants. Using this method, we reanalyse the same publicly available datasets and show significant behavioural oscillations in each of them, suggesting oscillations in behaviour are a robust phenomenon upon which to draw theoretical inferences. The participant-level AR-surrogate method is currently the most sensitive method available for analysing behavioural oscillations while controlling for the contribution of aperiodic data fluctuations.

">Unveiling microglial heterogeneity from single-cell transcriptomics in neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are key players in maintaining brain homeostasis and responding to pathological conditions. Their multifaceted roles in health and disease have garnered significant attention in the context of neurodegeneration. In recent years, single-cell transcriptomic techniques have provided unprecedented insights into microglial heterogeneity, revealing distinct subpopulations and gene expression patterns associated with neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. Here, the transcriptomic landscape of microglia has been dissected by leveraging human single-nuclei RNA sequencing datasets of neurodegenerative conditions, encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, aging, and Parkinson's disease. Results have led to the identification of distinct cell subpopulations, representative of the functional heterogeneity of the brain microglia. Moreover, distinct gene signatures and regulatory networks linked to inflammation and neurodegeneration have been identified. Overall, the study provides an improved portrait of microglia in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, and it holds promise for developing a more targeted research aimed at modulating microglial function to mitigate disease progression and foster neuroprotection.

">Bidirectional locomotion induces unilateral limb adaptations</a></h4>

              
                Humans can acquire and maintain motor skills throughout their lives through motor learning. Motor learning and skill acquisition are essential for rehabilitation following neurological disease or injury. Adaptation, the initial stage of motor learning, involves short-term changes in motor performance in response to a new demand in the person's environment. Repeated adaptation can improve skill performance and result in long-term skill retention. Locomotor adaptation is extensively studied using split-belt treadmill paradigms. In this study we explored whether bidirectional walking (BDW) on a split-belt treadmill can induce short-term gait adaptations. Twelve healthy volunteers participated in our single session, starting with 2 minutes of normal walking (NW), followed by four 5-minute blocks of BDW with a 1-minute passive rest in between blocks, and ending with another 2-minute of NW. We recorded body kinematics and ground reaction forces throughout the experiment. Participants quickly adapted to BDW with both legs showing decreased step lengths. However, only the backward-walking leg exhibited aftereffects upon returning to NW, indicating short-term adaptation. Notable kinematic changes were observed, particularly in hip extension and pelvis tilt, though these varied among participants. Our findings suggest that BDW induces unilateral adaptations despite bilateral changes in gait, offering new insights into locomotor control and spinal CPG organization.

">Rapid Changes in Risk Preferences Originate from Bayesian Inference on Parietal Magnitude Representations</a></h4>

              
                Risk preferences - the willingness to accept greater uncertainty to achieve larger potential rewards - determine many aspects of our lives and are often interpreted as an individual trait that reflects a general 'taste' for risk. However, this perspective cannot explain why risk preferences can change considerably across contexts and even across repetitions of the identical decisions. Here we provide modelling and neural evidence that contextual shifts and moment-to-moment fluctuations in risk preferences can emerge mechanistically from Bayesian inference on noisy magnitude representations in parietal cortex. Our participants underwent fMRI while choosing between safe and risky options that were either held in working memory or present on the screen. Risky options that were held in working memory were less likely to be chosen (risk aversion) when they had large payoffs but more likely to be chosen (risk-seeking) when they had small payoffs. These counterintuitive effects are mechanistically explained by a computational model of the Bayesian inference underlying the perception of the payoff magnitudes: Options kept in working memory are noisier and therefore more prone to central tendency biases, leading small (or large) payoffs to be overestimated (or underestimated) more. Congruent with the behavioural modelling, fMRI population-receptive field modelling showed that on trials where intraparietal payoff representations were noisier, choices were also less consistent and less risk-neutral, in line with participants resorting more to their prior belief about potential payoffs. Our results highlight that individual risk preferences and their puzzling changes across contexts and choice repetitions are mechanistically rooted in perceptual inference on noisy parietal magnitude representations, with profound implications for economic, psychological, and neuroscience theories of risky behaviour.

">On the same wavelength: The relationship between neural synchrony and cognitive ability during movie watching in late childhood and early adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Development during late childhood and early adolescence is associated with vast improvements to thinking and reasoning abilities. Coinciding with developing cognitive abilities, the environments children navigate become more complex, with an expanding social circle giving rise to richer and more elaborate experiences. If cognitive development is associated with more complex experiences, do individual differences in cognitive abilities influence how children and adolescents experience their world? To address this question, we investigated the relationships between intersubject correlation (ISC) during movie watching and cognitive scores in children and adolescents (aged 7 -15, N = 309). Data for the current study was obtained from the Healthy Brain Biobank. As part of the Healthy Brain Biobank protocol, participants watched a 10-minute clip of Despicable Me while in the fMRI scanner. They also completed the Weschler Intelligent Scale for Children (WISC). We compared the degree to which participants brain activity synchronized to other participants brain activity during the movie, as measured by ISC, and investigated if scores on the WISC predicted this synchrony. We found adolescents (ages 11-15) with higher cognitive scores showed greater ISC during movie watching in brain networks associated with social processing and executive functions compared to those with below average cognitive scores. These networks included the frontoparietal and default mode networks. This pattern was not evident in children (ages 7-11) who differed in their cognitive scores. These results suggest that adolescents with more mature cognitive abilities may have more similar experiences of naturalistic stimuli. Our results also suggest that children may be less reliant on the frontoparietal network when processing movies, compared to previous findings in adults.

">Anxiety and risk-taking behavior maps onto opioid and alcohol polysubstance consumption patterns in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Polysubstance use is prevalent in the population but remains understudied in preclinical models. Alcohol and opioid polysubstance use is associated with negative outcomes, worse treatment prognosis, and higher overdose risk; but underlying mechanisms are still being uncovered. Examining factors that motivate use of one substance over another in different contexts in preclinical models will better our understanding of polysubstance use and improve translational value. Here we assessed baseline anxiety like and locomotive behavior and then measured voluntary consumption of multiple doses of alcohol and fentanyl in group housed male and female mice using our novel Socially Integrated Polysubstance (SIP) system. Fifty six male (n=32) and female (n=24) adult mice were housed in groups of 4 for one week with continuous access to food, water, two doses of ethanol (5% and 10%) and two doses of fentanyl (5 ug/ml and 20 ug/ml). Our analyses revealed sex differences across multiple domains - female mice consumed more liquid in the dark cycle, had higher activity, a higher preference for both ethanol and fentanyl over water, and their fentanyl preference increased over the seven days. We then used machine-learning techniques to reveal underlying relationships between baseline behavioral phenotypes and subsequent polysubstance consumption patterns, where anxiety- and risk taking-like behavioral phenotypes mapped onto discrete patterns of polysubstance use, preference, and escalation. By simulating more translationally relevant substance use and improving our understanding of the motivations for different patterns of consumption, this study contributes to the developing preclinical literature on polysubstance use with the goal of facilitating better treatment outcomes and novel therapeutic strategies.

">The Impact of Ketamine and Thiopental Anesthesia onUltraweak Photon Emission and Oxidative-Nitrosative Stress in Rat Brains</a></h4>

              
                Anesthetics such as ketamine and thiopental, commonly used for inducing unconsciousness, have distinct effects on neuronal activity, metabolism, and cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Ketamine increases heart rate and blood pressure while preserving respiratory function, whereas thiopental decreases both and can cause respiratory depression. This study investigates the impact of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and thiopental (45 mg/kg) on ultraweak photon emission (UPE), oxidative-nitrosative stress, and antioxidant capacity in isolated rat brains. To our knowledge, no previous study has investigated and compared UPE in the presence and absence of anesthesia. Here, we compare the effects of ketamine and thiopental anesthetics with each other and with a non-anesthetized control group. Ketamine increased UPE, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme activity while reducing thiol levels. Conversely, thiopental decreased UPE, oxidative markers, and antioxidant enzyme activity, while increasing thiol levels. UPE was negatively correlated with thiol levels and positively correlated with oxidative stress markers. These findings suggest that the contrasting effects of ketamine and thiopental on UPE are linked to their differing impacts on brain oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity. This research suggests a potential method to monitor brain oxidative stress via UPE during anesthesia, and opens up new ways for understanding and managing anesthetic effects.

">Nageotte nodules in human DRG reveal neurodegeneration in painful diabetic neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Diabetic neuropathy is frequently accompanied by pain and loss of sensation attributed to axonal dieback. We recovered dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from 90 organ donors, 19 of whom had medical indices for diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN). Nageotte nodules, dead sensory neurons engulfed by non-neuronal cells, were abundant in DPN DRGs and accounted for 25% of all neurons. Peripherin-and Nav1.7-positive dystrophic axons invaded Nageotte nodules, forming small neuroma-like structures. Using histology and spatial sequencing, we demonstrate that Nageotte nodules are mainly composed of satellite glia and non-myelinating Schwann cells that express SPP1 and are intertwined with sprouting sensory axons originating from neighboring neurons. Our findings solve a 100-year mystery of the nature of Nageotte nodules linking these pathological structures to pain and sensory loss in DPN.

">Broadband high frequency Activity initializes Distractor Suppression</a></h4>

              
                Selective attention requires fast and accurate distractor suppression. We investigated if broadband high frequency activity (BHA; 80 to 150 Hz), indicative of local neuronal population dynamics in early sensory cortices, indexes rapid processing of distracting information. In the first experiment we tested whether BHA distinguishes targets from distracting information in a visual search paradigm using tilted gratings as targets and distractors. In the second experiment, we examined whether BHA distractor processing can be trained by statistical learning. In both experiments, BHA preceded the low-frequency target enhancement (NT) and distractor suppression (PD; 1 to 40 Hz) components and distinguished between targets and distractors. Only the BHA but not low-frequency component amplitude correlated with participants performance and was higher for lateral distractors versus lateral targets. Furthermore, BHA predicted the strength of the PD. These results indicate that BHA initiates stimulus discrimination via distractor suppression.

">Social risk coding by amygdala activity and connectivity with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                Risk is a fundamental factor affecting individual and social economic decisions, but its neural correlates are largely unexplored in the social domain. The amygdala, together with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), is thought to play a central role in risk taking. Here, we investigated in human volunteers (n=20; 11 females) how risk (defined as variance of reward probability distributions) in a social situation affects decisions and concomitant neural activity as measured with fMRI. We found social variance-risk signals in the amygdala. Activity in lateral parts of the amygdala increased parametrically with social reward variance of the presented options. Behaviorally, 75% of participants were averse to social risk as estimated in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak auction-like procedure. The stronger this aversion, the more negative was the coupling between risk-related amygdala regions and dACC. This negative relation was significant for social risk attitude but not for the attitude towards variance-risk in juice outcomes. Our results indicate that the amygdala and its coupling with dACC process objective and subjectively evaluated social risk. Moreover, while social risk can be captured with a framework originally established by finance theory for individual risk, the amygdala appears to processes social risk largely separately from individual risk.

">The preference for surprise in reinforcement learning underlies the differences in developmental changes in risk preference between autistic and neurotypical youth</a></h4>

              
                Risk preference changes nonlinearly across development. Although extensive developmental research on the neurotypical population has shown that risk preference is highest during adolescence, developmental changes in risk preference in autistic people, who tend to prefer predictable behaviors, have not been investigated. Here, we aimed to investigate these changes and underlying computational mechanisms. Using a game-like risk-sensitive reinforcement learning task, we found a significant difference in nonlinear developmental changes in risk preference between the autistic and neurotypical groups (N = 75; age range, 6-30 years). The computational modeling approach with reinforcement learning models revealed that individual preferences for surprise modulated such preferences. These findings indicate that for neurotypical people, adolescence is a developmental period involving risk preference, possibly due to lower surprise aversion. Conversely, for autistic people, who show opposite developmental trajectories of risk preference, adolescence could be a developmental period involving risk avoidance because of low surprise preference.

">Loss of Insulin Signaling in Microglia Impairs Cellular Uptake of Aβ and Neuroinflammatory Response Exacerbating Alzheimer-like Neuropathology</a></h4>

              
                Insulin receptors are present on cells throughout the body, including the brain. Dysregulation of insulin signaling in neurons and astrocytes has been implicated in altered mood, cognition, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). To define the role of insulin signaling in microglia, the primary phagocytes in brain critical for maintenance and damage repair, we created mice with an inducible microglia-specific insulin receptor knockout (MG-IRKO). RiboTag profiling of microglial mRNAs revealed that loss of insulin signaling results in alterations of gene expression in pathways related to innate immunity and cellular metabolism. In vitro, loss of insulin signaling in microglia results in metabolic reprograming with an increase in glycolysis and impaired uptake of A{beta}. In vivo, MG-IRKO mice exhibit alterations in mood and social behavior, and when crossed with the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, the resultant mice exhibit increased levels of A{beta}; plaque and elevated neuroinflammation. Thus, insulin signaling in microglia plays a key role in microglial cellular metabolism, neuroinflammation and the ability of the cells to take up A{beta}; such that reduced insulin signaling in microglia alters mood and social behavior and accelerates AD pathogenesis. Together these data indicate key roles of insulin action in microglia and the potential of targeting insulin signaling in microglia in treatment of AD.

	<p>In neuropsychology and clinical psychology, the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) experiences for knowledge acquisition and the potential for modifying conduct are well documented. Consequently, the scope of VR experiences for educational purposes has expanded in the health field in recent years. In this study, we sought to assess the effectiveness of ViveDe in a psychoeducational caregiver program. ViveDe is a VR application that presents users with possible daily life situations from the perspective of individuals with dementia. These situations can be experienced in immersive mode through 360&amp;amp;deg; video. This research aimed to ascertain the associations between the sense of presence that can be achieved in VR and some users&amp;amp;rsquo; psychological characteristics, such as distress and empathetic disposition. The study involved 36 informal caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. These participants were assessed using scales of anxiety and depression, perceived stress, empathy, and emotional regulation. They were asked to participate in a six-session psychoeducation program conducted online on dementia topics, in addition to experiencing the ViveDe application. The immersive VR sessions enabled the caregivers to directly experience the symptoms of dementia (e.g., spatial disorientation, agnosia, difficulty in problem-solving, and anomia) in everyday and social settings. The results indicated that although the experience in ViveDe (evaluated using the XRPS scale and five questions about emotional attunement) showed efficacy in producing a sense of first-person participation in the symptoms of dementia, further research is needed to confirm this. The structural equation model provided evidence that the characteristics of individuals who enjoy the VR experience play a determining role in the perceived sense of presence, which in turn affects the efficacy of the VR experience as a psychoeducational tool. Further research will be conducted to ascertain the potential role of these elements in conveying change in the caregivers of people with dementia. This will help us study the long-term effectiveness of a large-scale psychoeducation program in VR.</p>

	<p>Musculoskeletal conditions often involve pain related to specific movements. However, most studies on the impact of experimental pain on motor performance and learning have used tonic pain models. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of experimental phasic pain during the preparation or execution of a reaching task on the acquisition and retention of sensorimotor adaptation. Participants were divided into three groups: no pain, pain during motor preparation, and pain during motor execution. Pain was induced over the scapula with a laser while participants performed a force field adaptation task over two days. To assess the effect of pain on motor performance, two baseline conditions (with or without pain) involving unperturbed pointing movements were also conducted. The results indicated that the timing of the nociceptive stimulus differently affected baseline movement performance. Pain during motor preparation shortened reaction time, while pain during movement execution decreased task performance. However, when these baseline effects were accounted for, no impact of pain on motor adaptation or retention was observed. All groups showed significant improvements in all motor variables for both adaptation and retention. In conclusion, while acute phasic pain during motor preparation or execution can affect the movement itself, it does not interfere with motor acquisition or retention during a motor adaptation task.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with inflammation and a high level of comorbidities. Atypical depression (AD) is a MDD subtype based on DSM criteria, that could have specific underlying biological mechanisms. AD is associated with elevated cardiovascular (CVD) comorbidities, higher risk of suicide attempts, hypersomnia, and anxiety disorder. In this study, we aim to investigate if AD and polysomnographic parameters could be associated with low-grade inflammation (LGI). LGI is defined by a range from 3 to 10 mg/L of C-reactive protein levels. We carried out a retrospective cohort study in which 765 individuals with MDD were split into two groups: with and without LGI. Our results exhibit differences between the groups for the polysomnographic parameters, with the LGI group showing parameters already associated with inflammation such as reduced rapid eye movement sleep and elevated hypoxemia markers (identified as CVD risk factor). We found that AD is associated with LGI (OR 1.48; p = 0.047) after adjustment. Likewise, we found an LGI prevalence in AD higher (34.8%) than in MDD without atypical features (26.8%). Overall, these results confirm the low-grade inflammation feature of AD and highlight polysomnographic parameters associated with LGI that could also act as risk factors in this context.</p>

	<p>Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a severe complication following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), linked to poor functional outcomes and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Timely DCI diagnosis is crucial but remains challenging. Dysregulated blood glucose, commonly observed after aSAH, may impair the constant glucose supply that is vital for brain function, potentially contributing to DCI. This study aimed to assess whether glucose indices could help identify at-risk patients and improve DCI detection. This retrospective, single-center observational study examined 151 aSAH patients between 2016 and 2019. Additionally, 70 of these (46.4%) developed DCI and 81 did not (no-DCI). To determine the value of glycemic indices for DCI, they were analyzed separately in patients in the period before (pre-DCI) and after DCI (post-DCI). The time-weighted average glucose (TWAG, p = 0.024), mean blood glucose (p = 0.033), and novel time-unified dysglycemic rate (TUDR140, calculated as the ratio of dysglycemic to total periods within a glucose target range of 70&amp;amp;ndash;140 mg/dL, p = 0.042), showed significantly higher values in the pre-DCI period of the DCI group than in the no-DCI group. In the time-series analysis, significant increases in TWAG and TUDR140 were observed at the DCI onset. In conclusion, DCI patients showed elevated blood glucose levels before and a further increase at the DCI onset. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings, as this retrospective, single-center study cannot completely exclude confounders and limitations. In the future blood glucose indices might become valuable parameters in multiparametric models to identify patients at risk and detect DCI onset earlier.</p>

                Background Insufficient and above WHO-recommended levels of iodine intake during pregnancy can lead to serious health outcomes. This study aimed to assess median urine iodine concentration and its associated risk factors among pregnant women in the Mbeya region, Tanzania. Method A cross sectional survey involving 420 pregnant women (n=420) aged 15-49, registered in Reproductive and Child Health Clinics was conducted. Socio-demographic and dietary factors were assessed by structured questionnaire and the urine samples were analyzed using the ammonium persulfate digestion method. Results Median urinary iodine concentration (mUIC) was 279.4μg/L and it ranged from 26.1 to 1915μg/L. Insufficient mUIC (below 150μg/L) was observed in 17.14% of participants, sufficient mUIC was 24.29% and 58.57% had mUIC above the recommended level (>250μg/L). Sample women who reported consuming fish in the last 24 hours had an increased risk of insufficient mUIC [Adjusted OR= 2.60 (95%CI 1.31-5.15)] while the risk was lower for those who attended at least primary education [AOR= 0.29 (CI 0.08-0.99)]. Further, sample women resident in Mbarali district, in the oldest age group (35-49) and having a higher socio-economic status were associated with an increased risk of having MUIC above recommended level [AOR=4.09 (CI 1.85-9.010], [AOR=2.51 (CI 0.99-6.330] and, [AOR=2.08 (CI 0.91-4.71) respectively. Conclusion This study demonstrated a significant association between geographical, age and socio-economic factors and median urine iodine concentration above the WHO-recommended level. Further, this study found association between inadequate iodine in diet and insufficient median urine iodine concentration. Therefore, educational programs on iodine intake should be strengthened.

                Background: In healthcare settings, specialists from different fields may follow the most well-known, reliable, and easy-to-understand medical guidelines. This study aimed to determine Iraqi physicians’ adherence to treatment guidelines, to specify which treatment guidelines are utilized for each disease and identify their barriers to follow the guidelines. Methods: This was qualitative study including face-to-face and virtual semi-structured interviews with specialist physicians from different disciplines. The interviews were conducted between December 2021 and May 2022 in Kirkuk province, Iraq. The qualitative data generated through interviews was analyzed using thematic analysis. Result: The study recruited 48 specialists (27 male and 21 female) from seven medical specialties at two large government hospitals. Most physicians (38 /44) revealed that healthcare settings implement treatment guidelines in more than half of cases. American guideline was the most used among the participating physicians. European and British guidelines and textbooks were also used by some specialties. Unfortunately, most (43 out of 47) physicians were unaware of Iraqi treatment guideline. Most senior physicians often followed the same guidelines for one branch, with little variation in approach based on their experience and flexibility. Almost all participating physicians believed that shortages in treatment (46/47) and investigation/lab materials (45/47) and low patient adherence (44/47) are major barriers to implement the guideline(s). Six out of seven specialties experienced shortage in the essential medications that recommended by the guidelines Conclusions: Most physicians followed well-known international guidelines. Each specialty follows different guidelines relying on the disease. Medication shortage in the public hospitals was the main barrier facing physicians to implement treatment guidelines. Enhancing physician awareness of the Iraqi guidelines should be encouraged. Finally, securing essential medicines in public hospitals is pivotal to adopt evidence-based guidelines effectively.

                <p>by Lin Yuan, Ling Zhao, Jinling Lai, Yufeng Jiang, Qinhu Zhang, Zhen Shen, Chun-Hou Zheng, De-Shuang Huang</p>

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in transcription and translation. Identification of circRNA-RBP (RNA-binding protein) interaction sites has become a fundamental step in molecular and cell biology. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to predict circRNA-RBP interaction sites and achieved impressive identification performance. However, those methods cannot effectively capture long-distance dependencies, and cannot effectively utilize the interaction information of multiple features. To overcome those limitations, we propose a DL-based model iCRBP-LKHA using deep hybrid networks for identifying circRNA-RBP interaction sites. iCRBP-LKHA adopts five encoding schemes. Meanwhile, the neural network architecture, which consists of large kernel convolutional neural network (LKCNN), convolutional block attention module with one-dimensional convolution (CBAM-1D) and bidirectional gating recurrent unit (BiGRU), can explore local information, global context information and multiple features interaction information automatically. To verify the effectiveness of iCRBP-LKHA, we compared its performance with shallow learning algorithms on 37 circRNAs datasets and 37 circRNAs stringent datasets. And we compared its performance with state-of-the-art DL-based methods on 37 circRNAs datasets, 37 circRNAs stringent datasets and 31 linear RNAs datasets. The experimental results not only show that iCRBP-LKHA outperforms other competing methods, but also demonstrate the potential of this model in identifying other RNA-RBP interaction sites.

                <p>by Lucas Rudelt, Daniel González Marx, F. Paul Spitzner, Benjamin Cramer, Johannes Zierenberg, Viola Priesemann</p>

A core challenge for the brain is to process information across various timescales. This could be achieved by a hierarchical organization of temporal processing through intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., recurrent coupling or adaptation), but recent evidence from spike recordings of the rodent visual system seems to conflict with this hypothesis. Here, we used an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Moreover, intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent. We could reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input. Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.

                <p>by Zonglai Liang, Daniel Christiaan Dondorp, Marios Chatzigeorgiou</p>

During embryonic development, tissues and organs are gradually shaped into their functional morphologies through a series of spatiotemporally tightly orchestrated cell behaviors. A highly conserved organ shape across metazoans is the epithelial tube. Tube morphogenesis is a complex multistep process of carefully choreographed cell behaviors such as convergent extension, cell elongation, and lumen formation. The identity of the signaling molecules that coordinate these intricate morphogenetic steps remains elusive. The notochord is an essential tubular organ present in the embryonic midline region of all members of the chordate phylum. Here, using genome editing, pharmacology and quantitative imaging in the early chordate <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> we show that Ano10/Tmem16k, a member of the evolutionarily ancient family of transmembrane proteins called Anoctamin/TMEM16 is essential for convergent extension, lumen expansion, and connection during notochord morphogenesis. We find that Ano10/Tmem16k works in concert with the plasma membrane (PM) localized Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) residing SERCA, RyR, and IP3R proteins to establish developmental stage specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling molecular modules that regulate notochord morphogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. In addition, we find that the highly conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors calmodulin (CaM) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) show an Ano10/Tmem16k-dependent subcellular localization. Their pharmacological inhibition leads to convergent extension, tubulogenesis defects, and deranged Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, suggesting that Ano10/Tmem16k is involved in both the “encoding” and “decoding” of developmental Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Furthermore, Ano10/Tmem16k mediates cytoskeletal reorganization during notochord morphogenesis, likely by altering the localization of 2 important cytoskeletal regulators, the small GTPase Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and the actin binding protein Cofilin. Finally, we use electrophysiological recordings and a scramblase assay in tissue culture to demonstrate that Ano10/Tmem16k likely acts as an ion channel but not as a phospholipid scramblase. Our results establish Ano10/Tmem16k as a novel player in the prevertebrate molecular toolkit that controls organ morphogenesis across scales.

The transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genomes of eukaryotes (Numts) has been linked to lifespan in nonhuman species and recently demonstrated to occur in rare instances from one human generation to the next. Here, we investigated numtogenesis dynamics in humans in 2 ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 postmortem brain and blood samples from different individuals. Compared to circulating immune cells (<i>n</i> = 389), postmitotic brain tissue (<i>n</i> = 798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples, we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, an increase in the number of brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI) who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeated-measures whole-genome sequencing design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of 1 Numt every ~13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven by cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived <i>SURF1</i>-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7-fold faster than healthy donors. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan. These findings open the possibility that mito-nuclear horizontal gene transfer among human postmitotic tissues produces functionally relevant human Numts over timescales shorter than previously assumed.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002645">An empirical appraisal of eLife’s assessment vocabulary</a></h4>

Research articles published by the journal eLife are accompanied by short evaluation statements that use phrases from a prescribed vocabulary to evaluate research on 2 dimensions: importance and strength of support. Intuitively, the prescribed phrases appear to be highly synonymous (e.g., important/valuable, compelling/convincing) and the vocabulary’s ordinal structure may not be obvious to readers. We conducted an online repeated-measures experiment to gauge whether the phrases were interpreted as intended. We also tested an alternative vocabulary with (in our view) a less ambiguous structure. A total of 301 participants with a doctoral or graduate degree used a 0% to 100% scale to rate the importance and strength of support of hypothetical studies described using phrases from both vocabularies. For the eLife vocabulary, most participants’ implied ranking did not match the intended ranking on both the importance (<i>n</i> = 59, 20% matched, 95% confidence interval [15% to 24%]) and strength of support dimensions (<i>n</i> = 45, 15% matched [11% to 20%]). By contrast, for the alternative vocabulary, most participants’ implied ranking did match the intended ranking on both the importance (<i>n</i> = 188, 62% matched [57% to 68%]) and strength of support dimensions (<i>n</i> = 201, 67% matched [62% to 72%]). eLife’s vocabulary tended to produce less consistent between-person interpretations, though the alternative vocabulary still elicited some overlapping interpretations away from the middle of the scale. We speculate that explicit presentation of a vocabulary’s intended ordinal structure could improve interpretation. Overall, these findings suggest that more structured and less ambiguous language can improve communication of research evaluations.

                Background Melasma is a common dyschromia, mainly found in women with darker skin types. Although asymptomatic, melasma significantly impacts patients’ quality of life. Due to this complex pathogenesis, melasma is difficult to treat. Plant and plant-derived products have been explored as alternatives for the treatment of melasma. Methods This study utilized network pharmacology coupled with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular mechanisms of three selected Cassipourea metabolites in the treatment of melasma. Results Of the 202 genes obtained from the 14 profiled metabolites, only PTGS2, TYR, ESR2, and ESR1 were common among metabolites and targets implicated in melasma. From this, The gene ontology highlighted the intracellular steroid hormone receptor, signalling pathway, macromolecular complex, and estrogen receptor activity as the top enriched functional annotations, while the KEGG pathway analysis identified five signalling pathways, from which the prolactin signalling pathway, endocrine resistance, and estrogen signalling pathway were implicated in the pathogenesis of melasma. These pathways were further connected by their linkage to ESR2 and ESR1., Of all Cassipourea metabolites and standards, with afzelechin having the highest docking score for both gens. Further binding interaction analysis showed that ESR2-bound tamoxifen had the highest binding free energy of -47.68 kcal/mol, however, among the interacting Cassipourea metabolites, sitosterol-glycoside exhibited the highest negative binding affinity for both ESR2 (-40.50 kcal/mol) and ESR1 (-78.97 kcal/mol) over 150 ns simulation, suggesting its potential as a dual modulator. Altogether, the metabolites presented remarkable binding stability and thermodynamic compactness with the apo-genes. Conclusion The finding that the selected Cassipourea metabolites are associated with the genes and enzymes implicated in melasma pathogenesis, together with their significant binding effects on the enriched genes, suggests their regulatory potential on the profiled targets and, consequently, in the treatment of melasma.

                Abstract* Background Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is widely used in the biomedical field due to its outstanding biological and mechanical properties. Originally employed as a temporary abutment in implantology, recent research has expanded its indications for more definitive applications, such as frameworks and dental post and core. This shift requires a thorough assessment of PEEK’s adhesion and mechanical characteristics. However, PEEK’s inert properties and intricate chemistry create difficulties in surface treatment, resulting in reduced surface energy and inadequate adhesion. Inducing specific physical and chemical changes aims to overcome these challenges and enhance adhesion for PEEK. Despite its numerous clinical trials, standardized protocols remain lacking. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of surface treatments on the bonding performance of PEEK posts. Methods A detailed search of the literature will be conducted across several databases including PubMed, Scopus and clinical trial registries. Additional databases such as Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Web of Science and EBSCO will also be included. The search strategy will target controlled randomized studies and non-randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of surface treatments on PEEK post adhesion strength. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) will be used to assess bias in non-randomized studies, while the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB II) tool will be employed for evaluating randomized controlled trials. Data extraction will focus on study design, treatment methods, outcomes and results. This systematic review protocol will adhere to the guidelines for systematic reviews outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Discussion The discussion will explore the implications of findings on clinical practice, highlighting the importance of enhancing PEEK’s bioactivity and surface energy to improve bonding efficacy in dental procedures. Moreover, it will suggest areas for future research to advance dental materials science, aiming to optimize the utilization of PEEK in dental applications Systematic review registration PROSPERO: CRD42024529783 (Registered on 08/04/2024).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-950/v1?src=rss">The epidemiologic case for urban health: conceptualizing and measuring the magnitude of challenges and potential benefits [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We discuss how epidemiology has been and can continue to be used to advance understanding of the links between urban areas and health informed by an existing urban-health conceptual framework. This framework considers urban areas as contexts for health, determinants of health and modifiers of health pathways, and part of a complex system that affects health. We highlight opportunities for descriptive epidemiology to inform the context of urban health, for example, by characterizing the social and physical environments that give rise to health and the actions that change those conditions. We then describe inferential tools for evaluating the impact of group-level actions (e.g., interventions, policies) on urban health, providing some examples, and describing assumptions and challenges. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges of applying systems thinking and methods to advance urban health. While different conceptual frames lead to different insights, each perspective demonstrates that urban health is a major and growing challenge. The effectiveness of urban health knowledge, action, and policy as the world continues to urbanize can be informed by applying and expanding upon research and surveillance methods described here.

                Chen et al. discovered the separable and generalizable subspaces for sensory and sequence working memory in macaque frontal neural states. The neural activities and their dynamics within these subspaces reflected the flexible control of sequence working memory in various sequence sorting tasks, predicting monkeys’ behavior in single trials.

                Snyder et al. develop measures of human cortical folding, revealing an axis of linear to complex sulcal shape across the adult cortex. This axis predicts the phased emergence of sulci in utero and boundaries of cortical gene expression, implicating these processes in the formation of mature cortical geometry.

                Our study identifies TRIM4 and TRIM21 as the E3 ligases that degrade TPL2 protein by polyubiquitination of K415 and K439 in the C terminus. We show that oncogenic KRAS can degrade TRIM4 and TRIM21 to stabilize TPL2, leading to aberrant regulation of signaling pathways, including the MAPK, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin cascades.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94931">A ‘double-edged’ role for type-5 metabotropic glutamate receptors in pain disclosed by light-sensitive drugs</a></h4>

              
                We used light-sensitive drugs to identify the brain region-specific role of mGlu5 metabotropic glutamate receptors in the control of pain. Optical activation of systemic JF-NP-26, a caged, normally inactive, negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of mGlu5 receptors, in cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices and thalamus inhibited neuropathic pain hypersensitivity. Systemic treatment of alloswitch-1, an intrinsically active mGlu5 receptor NAM, caused analgesia, and the effect was reversed by light-induced drug inactivation in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, and thalamus. This demonstrates that mGlu5 receptor blockade in the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamus is both sufficient and necessary for the analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists. Surprisingly, when the light was delivered in the basolateral amygdala, local activation of systemic JF-NP-26 reduced pain thresholds, whereas inactivation of alloswitch-1 enhanced analgesia. Electrophysiological analysis showed that alloswitch-1 increased excitatory synaptic responses in prelimbic pyramidal neurons evoked by stimulation of presumed BLA input, and decreased BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of amygdala output neurons. Both effects were reversed by optical silencing and reinstated by optical reactivation of alloswitch-1. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the action of mGlu5 receptors in the pain neuraxis is not homogenous, and suggest that blockade of mGlu5 receptors in the BLA may limit the overall analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists. This could explain the suboptimal effect of mGlu5 NAMs on pain in human studies and validate photopharmacology as an important tool to determine ideal target sites for systemic drugs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89936">Task-specific invariant representation in auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Categorical sensory representations are critical for many behaviors, including speech perception. In the auditory system, categorical information is thought to arise hierarchically, becoming increasingly prominent in higher-order cortical regions. The neural mechanisms that support this robust and flexible computation remain poorly understood. Here, we studied sound representations in the ferret primary and non-primary auditory cortex while animals engaged in a challenging sound discrimination task. Population-level decoding of simultaneously recorded single neurons revealed that task engagement caused categorical sound representations to emerge in non-primary auditory cortex. In primary auditory cortex, task engagement caused a general enhancement of sound decoding that was not specific to task-relevant categories. These findings are consistent with mixed selectivity models of neural disentanglement, in which early sensory regions build an overcomplete representation of the world and allow neurons in downstream brain regions to flexibly and selectively read out behaviorally relevant, categorical information.

">The neural mechanisms of fast versus slow decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Not all decisions are created equal; factors such as the difficulties or associated costs affect the time spent to make decisions. This is variously interpreted as speed/accuracy, fast/slow, or impulsivity/deliberateness tradeoffs according to different models of behaviour. Regardless, it is generally assumed that decision latency reflects the neural mechanisms underlying behavioural strategy and cognitive investment. However, such investigations have been difficult in mice which are consistently impulsive. Here, we show that manipulating cost, using a novel floating-platform paradigm, overcomes the natural impulsivity of mice, more closely matching human behaviour. Furthermore, this approach allowed us simultaneously to measure the flow of activity from medial to lateral frontal cortex (MFC to LFC) and record sequences of single neuron activity with 2-photon imaging. Surprisingly, MFC display a different mode of operation, with high vulnerability to optical inhibition compared to LFC. Furthermore, the balance in choice coding at the beginning of sequences in MFC correlated with trial history and behavioural strategy. We found that for optimal performance, slow sequences in MFC showed declining numbers of active neurons whereas the opposite was true in LFC. Our results suggest that while LFC acts as an integrative motor threshold, MFC plays a larger cognitive role in the selection and timing of decisions than previously thought. Our study offers a methodological and mechanistic framework in mouse frontal cortex to understand the neural basis of voluntary decision making.

">Generation of humanized mouse models to support therapeutic development for SYNGAP1 and STXBP1 disorders</a></h4>

              
                Heterozygous variants in SYNGAP1 and STXBP1 lead to distinct neurodevelopmental disorders caused by haploinsufficient levels of post-synaptic SYNGAP1 and pre-synaptic STXBP1, which are critical for normal synaptic function. While several gene-targeted therapeutic approaches have proven efficacious in vitro, these often target regions of the human gene that are not conserved in rodents, hindering the pre-clinical development of these compounds and their transition to the clinic. To overcome this limitation, here we generate and characterize Syngap1 and Stxbp1 humanized mouse models in which we replaced the mouse Syngap1 and Stxbp1 gene, respectively, with the human counterpart, including regulatory and non-coding regions. Fully humanized Syngap1 mice present normal viability and can be successfully crossed with currently available Syngap1 haploinsufficiency mouse models to generate Syngap1 humanized haploinsufficient mice. Stxbp1 mice were successfully humanized, yet exhibit impaired viability (particularly males) and reduced STXBP1 protein abundance. Mouse viability could be improved by outcrossing this model to other mouse strains, while Stxbp1 humanized females and hybrid mice can be used to evaluate target engagement of human-specific therapeutics. Overall, these humanized mouse models represent a broadly available tool to further pre-clinical therapeutic development for SYNGAP1 and STXBP1 disorders.

                INTRODUCTION: White matter (WM) alterations are among the earliest changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet limited work has comprehensively characterized the effects of AD risk factors on WM. METHODS: In older adults with a family history of AD, we investigated the sex-specific and APOE genotype-related relationships between WM microstructure and risk factors. Multiple MRI-derived metrics were integrated using a multivariate approach based on the Mahalanobis distance (D2). The links between WM D2 and cognition were also explored. RESULTS: WM D2 in several regions was associated with high systolic blood pressure, BMI, and glycated hemoglobin, and low cholesterol, in both males and females. APOE4+ displayed a distinct risk pattern, with LDL-cholesterol having a detrimental effect only in carriers, and this pattern was linked to immediate memory performance. Myelination was the main mechanism underlying WM alterations. DISCUSSION: Our findings reveal that combined exposure to multiple cardiometabolic risk factors negatively impacts microstructural health, which may subsequently affect cognition. Notably, APOE4 carriers exhibited a different risk pattern, especially in the role of LDL, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms in this group.

We aim to generate high-quality audio despite the limitations of available training data by employing a Transformer-based decoder and a pretrained vocoder. Specifically, we used a pre-trained neural vocoder, Parallel WaveGAN, to convert the log-mel spectrograms output by the Transformer decoder, which was trained on ECoG signals, into high-quality audio signals. In our experiments, using ECoG signals recorded from 13 participants, the synthesized speech from imagined speech achieved a dynamic time-warping (DTW) Pearson correlation ranging from 0.85 to 0.95. This high-quality speech synthesis can be attributed to the Transformer decoder's ability to accurately reconstruct high-fidelity log-mel spectrograms, demonstrating its effectiveness in dealing with limited training data.

">Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors prevent presymptomatic capillary flow disturbances in a model of cerebral amyloidosis</a></h4>

              
                To enhance early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer{middle dot}s disease (AD), understanding the pathological changes before symptoms arise is crucial. The continuum model of AD suggest that A{beta} beta (A{beta}) accumulation precedes symptoms by at least 15 years, with vascular changes detectable around this time. Disturbances in capillary flow dynamics have been linked to reduced oxygen delivery to brain tissue, but evidence in presymptomatic AD remains elusive. We examined capillary flow dynamics in presymptomatic Tg-SwDI mice and the capacity of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) to prevent capillary flow disturbances. Our study revealed capillary flow disturbances associated with alterations in capillary morphology, adhesion molecule expression, and A{beta} load in cognitively normal 9-10-month-old Tg-SwDI mice. Treated mice showed ameliorated capillary flow disturbances, enhanced oxygen availability, and reduced A{beta} load. These findings underscore the importance of capillary flow disturbances in presymptomatic AD and highlight CAIs{middle dot} potential for preserving vascular integrity in early AD.

	<p>In humans, epilepsy is diagnosed through electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Epileptic seizures (ESs) arise due to anxiety. The detection of anxiety-based seizures is challenging for radiologists, and there is a limited availability of anxiety-based EEG signals. Data augmentation methods are required to increase the number of novel samples. An epileptic seizure arises due to anxiety, which manifests as variations in EEG signal patterns consisting of changes in the size and shape of the signal. In this study, anxiety EEG signals were synthesized by applying data augmentation methods such as random data augmentation (RDA) to existing epileptic seizure signals from the Bonn EEG dataset. The data-augmented anxiety seizure signals were processed using three algorithms&amp;amp;mdash;(i) fuzzy C-means&amp;amp;ndash;particle swarm optimization&amp;amp;ndash;long short-term memory (FCM-PS-LSTM), (ii) particle swarm optimization&amp;amp;ndash;long short-term memory (PS-LSTM), and (iii) parrot optimization LSTM (PO-LSTM)&amp;amp;mdash;for the detection of anxiety ESs via EEG signals. The predicted accuracies of detecting ESs through EEG signals using the proposed algorithms&amp;amp;mdash;namely, (i) FCM-PS-LSTM, (ii) PS-LSTM, and (iii) PO-LSTM&amp;amp;mdash;were about 98%, 98.5%, and 96%, respectively.</p>

	<p>Background: Flow diversion has significantly improved the management of cerebral aneurysms. Technological advancements and increased clinical experience over the past decade have led to better outcomes and fewer complications. This study provides updated results and examines the factors that influence the success of flow diversion. Methods: We reviewed records of 115 patients with 121 intracranial aneurysms treated from July 2014 to August 2023. All patients had unruptured aneurysms in the anterior and posterior circulation. Results: Complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 72.7% of cases, with a complication rate of 9.1%. Significant predictors of complete occlusion included aneurysm diameter (OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.82&amp;amp;ndash;0.97, p = 0.009) and the presence of incorporated branches (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.08&amp;amp;ndash;0.59, p = 0.003). Cox analysis identified neck diameter (HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.87&amp;amp;ndash;0.98, p = 0.009) and incorporated branch (HR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.24&amp;amp;ndash;0.69, p = 0.001) as significant for occlusion. Multivariable analysis identified aneurysm diameter (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09&amp;amp;ndash;1.37, p = 0.001) as significant for safety outcomes. Improved outcomes were observed in recent treatments, with higher occlusion rates (79.7% vs. 61.7%, p = 0.050) and lower complication rates (4.1% vs. 14.9%, p = 0.011). Conclusions: Enhanced technical proficiency, better devices, and refined patient selection have significantly improved the efficacy and safety of flow diversion for cerebral aneurysms. Identifying significant predictors for treatment success and safety outcomes can inform clinical practice, aiding in patient selection.</p>

	<p>Brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external devices using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. BCIs based on code-modulated visual evoked potentials (cVEPs) are based on visual stimuli, thus appropriate visual feedback on the interface is crucial for an effective BCI system. Many previous studies have demonstrated that implementing visual feedback can improve information transfer rate (ITR) and reduce fatigue. This research compares a dynamic interface, where target boxes change their sizes based on detection certainty, with a threshold bar interface in a three-step cVEP speller. In this study, we found that both interfaces perform well, with slight variations in accuracy, ITR, and output characters per minute (OCM). Notably, some participants showed significant performance improvements with the dynamic interface and found it less distracting compared to the threshold bars. These results suggest that while average performance metrics are similar, the dynamic interface can provide significant benefits for certain users. This study underscores the potential for personalized interface choices to enhance BCI user experience and performance. By improving user friendliness, performance, and reducing distraction, dynamic visual feedback could optimize BCI technology for a broader range of users.</p>

	<p>Psychological resilience (PR) is known to be inversely associated with depression. While there is a growing body of research examining how depression alters activity across multiple functional neural networks, how differences in PR affect these networks is largely unexplored. This study examines the relationship between PR and functional connectivity in the alpha and beta bands within (and between) eighteen established cortical nodes in the default mode network, the central executive network, and the salience network. Resting-state EEG data from 99 adult participants (32 depressed, 67 non-depressed) were used to measure the correlation between the five factors of PR sourced from the Connor&amp;amp;ndash;Davidson Resilience Scale and eLORETA-based measures of coherence and phase synchronisation. Distinct functional connectivity patterns were seen across each resilience factor, with a notable absence of overlapping positive results across the depressed and non-depressed samples. These results indicate that depression may modulate how resilience is expressed in terms of fundamental neural activity.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study is to identify autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit&amp;amp;ndash;hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits in adolescents who experience psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), often ignored in clinical practice but widely prevalent in the general population. A total of 57 adolescents and young adults (aged between 16 and 24 years old) were recruited consecutively in the outpatient services. A total of 37 were females (64.9%), 18 were males (31.6%), and two participants (3.5%) were non-binary or gender non-conforming, with a mean age at referral of 18.26 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.06. To investigate these symptoms, three sets of standardized questionnaires were used, as follows: the Autism Spectrum Quotient&amp;amp;ndash;short form (AQ-10), the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-42), and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS). We found significant associations between the ASRS and AQ-10 total scores and all CAPE scales. The model which explained the highest variance was CAPE Score&amp;amp;rsquo;s Total Frequency score (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Our findings underline the importance of investigating the presence of subthreshold ASD and ADHD symptoms in clinical populations, particularly in the period of adolescence and young adulthood, to promptly identify the presence of PLEs and, thus, prevent the onset of a frank psychotic disorder, particularly in the presence of a comorbid psychopathological condition, leading to better diagnosis and treatment for individuals with two or more of these conditions.</p>

	<p>The human organism is affected by multiple stressors every single day, especially during extremely demanding activities. It needs a method to regulate itself better. One of the stressors that is affecting humans is social isolation. The state of prolonged isolation happens during space missions. In this study, 40 analog astronauts attended a two-week-long mission. The experimental group had EEG neurofeedback training intervention performed on a daily basis, while the control group remained isolated without neurofeedback. The results let us take this non-invasive intervention under consideration, while debating the methods to lower the physiological stress reaction in humans that are exposed to extremely hard circumstances. Although not statistically significant, the trends observed give us direction towards other research to confirm EEG neurofeedback as a method to lower cell stress response levels.</p>

	<p>Background: The use of music in cognitive interventions represents a possibility with potential worthy of further investigation in the field of aging, both in terms of prevention from dementia, in the phase of mild cognitive impairment, and in the treatment of overt dementia. Objectives: Currently, the types of music-based interventions proposed in the literature are characterized by wide heterogeneity, which is why it is necessary to clarify which interventions present more evidence of effectiveness in stimulating different cognitive domains. Method: The study was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews. By searching two different databases, PubMed and the Web of Science, all studies evaluating the cognitive effects of music-based interventions on people at early stages of cognitive decline (MCI or mild-to-moderate dementia) were selected. Results: The study selection included a total of 28 studies involving n = 1612 participants (mean age ranged from 69.45 to 85.3 years old). Most of the studies analyzed agree with the observation of an improvement, or at least maintenance, of global cognitive conditions (mainly represented by the results of the MMSE test) following music-based interventions, together with a series of other positive effects on verbal fluency, memory, and executive processes. Conclusions: The results of this review suggest the introduction of music-based interventions as complementary approaches to usual cognitive treatments. Also, the use of standardized and well-defined protocols, in addition to strong methodological research approaches, is suggested. Music-based interventions are recommended in the early stages of dementia, in MCI, and in a preventive sense in healthy older adults.</p>

                <p>Stress impairs fertility, at least in part, via inhibition of gonadotropin secretion. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is an important gonadotropin that is released in a pulsatile pattern in males and in females throughout the majority of the ovarian cycle. Several models of stress, including acute metabolic stress, suppress LH pulses via inhibition of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus that coexpress kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (termed KNDy cells) which form the pulse generator. The mechanism for inhibition of KNDy neurons during stress, however, remains a significant outstanding question. Here, we investigated a population of catecholamine neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), marked by expression of the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), in female mice. First, we found that a subpopulation of DBH neurons in the NTS is activated (express c-Fos) during metabolic stress. Then, using chemogenetics, we determined that activation of these cells is sufficient to suppress LH pulses, augment corticosterone secretion, and induce sickness-like behavior. In subsequent studies, we identified evidence for suppression of KNDy cells (rather than downstream signaling pathways) and determined that the suppression of LH pulses was not dependent on the acute rise in glucocorticoids. Together these data support the hypothesis that DBH cells in the NTS are important for regulation of neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress.</p>

                <p>During learning of a sensory discrimination task, the cortical and subcortical regions display complex spatiotemporal dynamics. During learning, both the amygdala and cortex link stimulus information to its appropriate association, for example, a reward. In addition, both structures are also related to nonsensory parameters such as body movements and licking during the reward period. However, the emergence of the cortico-amygdala relationships during learning is largely unknown. To study this, we combined wide-field cortical imaging with fiber photometry to simultaneously record cortico-amygdala population dynamics as male mice learn a whisker-dependent go/no-go task. We were able to simultaneously record neuronal populations from the posterior cortex and either the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or central/medial amygdala (CEM). Prior to learning, the somatosensory and associative cortex responded during sensation, while amygdala areas did not show significant responses. As mice became experts, amygdala responses emerged early during the sensation period, increasing in the CEM, while decreasing in the BLA. Interestingly, amygdala and cortical responses were associated with task-related body movement, displaying significant responses ~200&nbsp;ms before movement initiation which led to licking for the reward. A correlation analysis between the cortex and amygdala revealed negative and positive correlation with the BLA and CEM, respectively, only in the expert case. These results imply that learning induces an involvement of the cortex and amygdala which may aid to link sensory stimuli with appropriate associations.</p>

                <p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) increases resilience and buffers behavioral stress responses in male rats in part through decreasing the excitability of principal output neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Intra-BLA administration of NPY acutely increases social interaction (SI) through activation of either Y<SUB>1</SUB> or Y<SUB>5</SUB> receptors, whereas repeated NPY (rpNPY) injections (once daily for 5&nbsp;d) produce persistent increases in SI through Y<SUB>5</SUB> receptor-mediated neuroplasticity in the BLA. In this series of studies, we characterized the neural circuits from the BLA that underlie these behavioral responses to NPY. Using neuronal tract tracing, NPY Y<SUB>1</SUB> and Y<SUB>5</SUB> receptor immunoreactivity was identified on subpopulations of BLA neurons projecting to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Inhibition of BLA-&gt;BNST, but not BLA-&gt;CeA, neurons using projection-restricted, cre-driven designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug-G<SUB>i</SUB> expression increased SI and prevented stress-induced decreases in SI produced by a 30&nbsp;min restraint stress. This behavioral profile was similar to that seen after both acute and rpNPY injections into the BLA. Intracellular recordings of BLA-&gt;BNST neurons demonstrated NPY-mediated inhibition via suppression of H currents, as seen previously. Repeated intra-BLA injections of NPY, which are associated with the induction of BLA neuroplasticity, decreased the activity of BLA-&gt;BNST neurons and decreased their dendritic complexity. These results demonstrate that NPY modulates the activity of BNST-projecting BLA neurons, suggesting that this pathway contributes to the stress-buffering actions of NPY and provides a novel substrate for the proresilient effects of NPY.</p>

                <p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a major contributor to relapse to cocaine in humans and to reinstatement in rodent models of cocaine use disorder. The output from the mPFC is potently modulated by parvalbumin (PV)-containing fast&ndash;spiking interneurons, the majority of which are surrounded by perineuronal nets. We previously showed that treatment with chondroitinase ABC (ABC) reduced the consolidation and reconsolidation of a cocaine conditioned place preference memory. However, self-administration memories are more difficult to disrupt. Here we report in male rats that ABC treatment in the mPFC attenuated the consolidation and blocked the reconsolidation of a cocaine self-administration memory. However, reconsolidation was blocked when rats were given a novel, but not familiar, type of retrieval session. Furthermore, ABC treatment prior to, but not after, memory retrieval blocked reconsolidation. This same treatment did not alter a sucrose memory, indicating specificity for cocaine-induced memory. In naive rats, ABC treatment in the mPFC altered levels of PV intensity and cell firing properties. In vivo recordings from the mPFC and dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) during the novel retrieval session revealed that ABC prevented reward-associated increases in high-frequency oscillations and synchrony of these oscillations between the dHIP and mPFC. Together, this is the first study to show that ABC treatment disrupts reconsolidation of the original memory when combined with a novel retrieval session that elicits coupling between the dHIP and mPFC. This coupling after ABC treatment may serve as a fundamental signature for how to disrupt reconsolidation of cocaine memories and reduce relapse.</p>

                <p>The implementation of low-dimensional movement control by the central nervous system has been debated for decades. In this study, we investigated the dimensionality of the control signals received by spinal motor neurons when controlling either the ankle or knee joint torque. We first identified the low-dimensional latent factors underlying motor unit activity during torque-matched isometric contractions in male participants. Subsequently, we evaluated the extent to which motor units could be independently controlled. To this aim, we used an online control paradigm in which participants received the corresponding motor unit firing rates as visual feedback. We identified two main latent factors, regardless of the muscle group (vastus lateralis-medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis-medialis). The motor units of the gastrocnemius lateralis could be controlled largely independently from those of the gastrocnemius medialis during ankle plantarflexion. This dissociation of motor unit activity imposed similar behavior to the motor units that were not displayed in the feedback. Conversely, it was not possible to dissociate the activity of the motor units between the vastus lateralis and medialis muscles during the knee extension tasks. These results demonstrate that the number of latent factors estimated from linear dimensionality reduction algorithms does not necessarily reflect the dimensionality of volitional control of motor units. Overall, individual motor units were never controlled independently of all others but rather belonged to synergistic groups. Together, these findings provide evidence for a low-dimensional control of motor units constrained by common inputs, with notable differences between muscle groups.</p>

                <p>Although anesthesia provides favorable conditions for surgical procedures, recent studies have revealed that the brain remains active in processing noxious signals even during anesthesia. However, whether and how these responses affect the anesthesia effect remains unclear. The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), a crucial hub for pain regulation, also plays an essential role in controlling general anesthesia. Hence, it was hypothesized that the vlPAG may be involved in the regulation of general anesthesia by noxious stimuli. Here, we found that acute noxious stimuli, including capsaicin-induced inflammatory pain, acetic acid-induced visceral pain, and incision-induced surgical pain, significantly delayed recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia in male mice, whereas this effect was absent in the spared nerve injury-induced chronic pain. Pretreatment with peripheral analgesics could prevent the delayed recovery induced by acute nociception. Furthermore, we found that acute noxious stimuli, induced by the injection of capsaicin under sevoflurane anesthesia, increased c-Fos expression and activity in the GABAergic neurons of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Specific reactivation of capsaicin-activated vlPAG<sup>GABA</sup> neurons mimicked the effect of capsaicin and its chemogenetic inhibition prevented the delayed recovery from anesthesia induced by capsaicin. Finally, we revealed that the vlPAG<sup>GABA</sup> neurons regulated the recovery from anesthesia through the inhibition of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neuronal activity, thus decreasing dopamine (DA) release and activation of DA D<SUB>1</SUB>-like receptors in the brain. These findings reveal a novel, cell- and circuit-based mechanism for regulating anesthesia recovery by nociception, and it is important to provide new insights for guiding the management of the anesthesia recovery period.</p>

                <p>Naturalistic observations show that animals pre-empt danger by moving to locations that increase their success in avoiding future threats. To test this in humans, we created a spatial margin of safety (MOS) decision task that quantifies pre-emptive avoidance by measuring the distance subjects place themselves to safety when facing different threats whose attack locations vary in predictability. Behavioral results show that human participants place themselves closer to safe locations when facing threats that attack in spatial locations with more outliers. Using both univariate and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) on fMRI data collected during a 2&nbsp;h session on participants of both sexes, we demonstrate a dissociable role for the vmPFC in MOS-related decision-making. MVPA results revealed that the posterior vmPFC encoded for more unpredictable threats with univariate analyses showing a functional coupling with the amygdala and hippocampus. Conversely, the anterior vmPFC was more active for the more predictable attacks and showed coupling with the striatum. Our findings converge in showing that during pre-emptive danger, the anterior vmPFC may provide a safety signal, possibly via foreseeable outcomes, while the posterior vmPFC drives unpredictable danger signals.</p>

                <p>Current anesthetic theory is mostly based on neurons and/or neuronal circuits. A role for astrocytes also has been shown in promoting recovery from volatile anesthesia, while the exact modulatory mechanism and/or the molecular target in astrocytes is still unknown. In this study by animal models in male mice and electrophysiological recordings in vivo and in vitro, we found that activating astrocytes of the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) and/or knocking down PVT astrocytic Kir4.1 promoted the consciousness recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the PVT reveals two distinct cellular subtypes of glutamatergic neurons: PVT<I><sup>GRM</sup></I> and PVT<I><sup>ChAT</sup></I> neurons. Patch-clamp recording results proved astrocytic Kir4.1-mediated modulation of sevoflurane on the PVT mainly worked on PVT<I><sup>ChAT</sup></I> neurons, which projected mainly to the mPFC. In summary, our findings support the novel conception that there is a specific PVT-&gt;prefrontal cortex projection involved in consciousness recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia, which is mediated by the inhibition of sevoflurane on PVT astrocytic Kir4.1 conductance.</p>

                <p>Recent studies suggest that time estimation relies on bodily rhythms and interoceptive signals. We provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence suggesting an association between the brain's processing of heartbeat and duration judgment. We examined heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) and contingent negative variation (CNV) during an auditory duration-reproduction task and a control reaction-time task spanning 4, 8, and 12&nbsp;s intervals, in both male and female participants. Interoceptive awareness was assessed with the Self-Awareness Questionnaire (SAQ) and interoceptive accuracy through the heartbeat-counting task (HCT). Results revealed that SAQ scores, but not the HCT, correlated with mean reproduced durations with higher SAQ scores associating with longer and more accurate duration reproductions. Notably, the HEP amplitude changes during the encoding phase of the timing task, particularly within 130&ndash;270&nbsp;ms (HEP1) and 470&ndash;520&nbsp;ms (HEP2) after the <I>R</I>-peak, demonstrated interval-specific modulations that did not emerge in the control task. A significant ramp-like increase in HEP2 amplitudes occurred during the duration-encoding phase of the timing but not during the control task. This increase within the reproduction phase of the timing task correlated significantly with the reproduced durations for the 8&nbsp;s and the 4&nbsp;s intervals. The larger the increase in HEP2, the greater the under-reproduction of the estimated duration. CNV components during the encoding phase of the timing task were more negative than those in the reaction-time task, suggesting greater executive resources orientation toward time. We conclude that interoceptive awareness (SAQ) and cortical responses to heartbeats (HEP) predict duration reproductions, emphasizing the embodied nature of time.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/34/e2343232024?rss=1">Dissociable Roles of the Dorsolateral and Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex in Human Categorization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Models of human categorization predict the prefrontal cortex (PFC) serves a central role in category learning. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) have been implicated in categorization; however, it is unclear whether both are critical for categorization and whether they support unique functions. We administered three categorization tasks to patients with PFC lesions (mean age, 69.6&nbsp;years; 5 men, 5 women) to examine how the prefrontal subregions contribute to categorization. These included a rule-based (RB) task that was solved via a unidimensional rule, an information integration (II) task that was solved by combining information from two stimulus dimensions, and a deterministic/probabilistic (DP) task with stimulus features that had varying amounts of category-predictive information. Compared with healthy comparison participants, both patient groups had impaired performance. Impairments in the dlPFC patients were largest during the RB task, whereas impairments in the vmPFC patients were largest during the DP task. A hierarchical model was fit to the participants&rsquo; data to assess learning deficits in the patient groups. PFC damage was correlated with a regularization term that limited updates to attention after each trial. Our results suggest that the PFC, as a whole, is important for learning to orient attention to relevant stimulus information. The dlPFC may be especially important for rule-based learning, whereas the vmPFC may be important for focusing attention on deterministic (highly diagnostic) features and ignoring less predictive features. These results support overarching functions of the dlPFC in executive functioning and the vmPFC in value-based decision-making.</p>

                <p>by Ján Antolík, Rémy Cagnol, Tibor Rózsa, Cyril Monier, Yves Frégnac, Andrew P. Davison</p>

Knowledge integration based on the relationship between structure and function of the neural substrate is one of the main targets of neuroinformatics and data-driven computational modeling. However, the multiplicity of data sources, the diversity of benchmarks, the mixing of observables of different natures, and the necessity of a long-term, systematic approach make such a task challenging. Here we present a first snapshot of a long-term integrative modeling program designed to address this issue in the domain of the visual system: a comprehensive spiking model of cat primary visual cortex. The presented model satisfies an extensive range of anatomical, statistical and functional constraints under a wide range of visual input statistics. In the presence of physiological levels of tonic stochastic bombardment by spontaneous thalamic activity, the modeled cortical reverberations self-generate a sparse asynchronous ongoing activity that quantitatively matches a range of experimentally measured statistics. When integrating feed-forward drive elicited by a high diversity of visual contexts, the simulated network produces a realistic, quantitatively accurate interplay between visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductances; contrast-invariant orientation-tuning width; center surround interactions; and stimulus-dependent changes in the precision of the neural code. This integrative model offers insights into how the studied properties interact, contributing to a better understanding of visual cortical dynamics. It provides a basis for future development towards a comprehensive model of low-level perception.

The band 3 transporter is a critical integral membrane protein of the red blood cell (RBC), as it is responsible for catalyzing the exchange of bicarbonate and chloride anions across the plasma membrane. To elucidate the structural mechanism of the band 3 transporter, detergent solubilized human ghost membrane reconstituted in nanodiscs was applied to a cryo-EM holey carbon grid to define its composition. With this approach, we identified and determined structural information of the human band 3 transporter. Here, we present 5 different cryo-EM structures of the transmembrane domain of dimeric band 3, either alone or bound with chloride or bicarbonate. Interestingly, we observed that human band 3 can form both symmetric and asymmetric dimers with a different combination of outward-facing (OF) and inward-facing (IF) states. These structures also allow us to obtain the first model of a human band 3 molecule at the IF conformation. Based on the structural data of these dimers, we propose a model of ion transport that is in favor of the elevator-type mechanism.

                Optic neuropathy is very rare and exceptionally inaugural in systemic erythematous lupus erythematosus (SLE), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a novel clinical disorder. What makes this observation unique is the combination of these two pathologies. We Hereby present the case of a severe presentation of PRES in a 15-year-old girl who was transferred to the intensive care unit for worsening hypertension and abdominal pain. The patient was first admitted to the adult medical department for sudden onset of binocular blindness. Therefore, antihypertensive drugs were prescribed and mechanical ventilation was required. A head computed tomography and MRI supported the diagnosis of PRES. The course was marked by a progressive improvement in blood pressure and recovery of normal vision after 2 days. The patient was transferred to the nephrology department for renal biopsy. The diagnosis of SLE was based on four ACR criteria: positive ANA, positive anti-DNA, proteinuria greater than 0.5 g/l and lymphopenia. In the presence of PRES, there should be no hesitation in requesting an immunological workup to look for a systemic disease. Despite a worrying clinical and radiological presentation, the prognosis of PRES remains favorable.

                This paper critically evaluates the UK’s policy responses to forced marriage through a postmodernist lens. Utilising data from the UK Forced Marriage Unit (FMU), which supported 302 cases in 2022 involving possible forced marriage or female genital mutilation, this paper highlights the complexity of addressing forced marriage as a human rights violation. To begin, the paper discusses three primary policy approaches employed by the UK in combatting forced marriages, which are regulation, exit, and community engagement. Through a postmodernist analysis, this paper critiques the essentialist view of forced marriage as a cultural problem and argues for a more nuanced understanding that incorporates diverse experiences and intersecting sociological, political, and economic factors. Due to this, this paper recommends removing forced marriage from the ‘honour-based abuse’ category and advocates for the implementation of reliable data-collecting methods to better address this issue.

[version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Administration of local anesthesia via injection is the main reason for inducing anxiety in children and if not intervened it aggravates the anxiety in subsequent appointments. There are many approaches, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods that can be used to reduce children’s perception of pain and anxiety. A frequently used non-pharmacological behaviour management method to reduce anxiety and procedure pain is distraction. The rationale of distraction is to shift the attention to avert the brain from receiving unwanted stimulus which induce anxiousness. Many approaches including music, television, portable video games, virtual reality (VR) helmet, and virtual reality audio-visual eyewear, have been implemented so far. Kaleidoscope and virtual reality goggles may help as distraction techniques in reducing the levels of anxiety caused during administration of local anesthesia. By the aid of which the operator may be able to make the dental experience child friendly and ultimately provide quality dental care to anxious children. Non pharmacological measures of reducing pain are cost effective and best means that can be used while performing dental procedures. This is a research protocol for a study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of kaleidoscope and virtual reality goggles to reduce dental anxiety in young children.

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether arterial spin labeling perfusion images of healthy controls can enhance ictal single-photon emission computed tomography analysis and whether the acquisition of the interictal image can be omitted.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed 2 pipelines: The first uses ictal and interictal images and compares these to single-photon emission computed tomography and arterial spin labeling of healthy controls. The second pipeline uses only the ictal image and the analogous healthy controls. Both pipelines were compared to the gold standard analysis and evaluated on data of individuals with epilepsy who underwent ictal single-photon emission computed tomography imaging during presurgical evaluation between 2010 and 2022. Fifty healthy controls prospectively underwent arterial spin labeling imaging. The correspondence between the detected hyperperfusion and the postoperative resection cavity or the presumably affected lobe was assessed using Dice score and mean Euclidean distance. Additionally, the outcomes of the pipelines were automatically assigned to 1 of 5 concordance categories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Inclusion criteria were met by 43 individuals who underwent epilepsy surgery and by 73 non-surgical individuals with epilepsy. Compared to the gold standard analysis, both pipelines resulted in significantly higher Dice scores and lower mean distances (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The combination of both provided localizing results in 85/116 cases, compared to 54/116 generated by the current gold standard analysis and the ictal image alone produced localizing results in 60/116 (52%) cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose a new ictal single-photon emission computed tomography protocol; it finds relevantly more ictal hyperperfusion, and halves the radiation dose in about half of the individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Increased population growth and imbalance between the need for rice are driving the conversion of numerous rice fields into non-agricultural zones and posing a significant threat to national food security. Therefore, this research is carried out to effectively address Indonesian government’s policy in preventing conversion of rice fields due to the lack of harmonization between cross-sectoral policies. Method A juridical-normative research method is used to analyze policy problems through legal theory and reality. The method is studying regulations against social phenomenon in food security sourced from the unconformity between the policies and the reality. It started by elaborating a way of thought, synthesizing conclusions, stating errors, and advising the re-formulation of policies to change the appropriation of land that in turn will affect national food security. Results The results show that there is proposed concept for reformulating rice field policies to integrate policies across sectors, ensure coherence in policy planning, and enhance the efficiency policies. The addition and harmonization of the components will strengthen the protection of the rice fields while preventing inconsistency and overlapping of authority from different sectors. The realization of this re-formulation will in time manifest national food security. Conclusions Indonesian government stipulates various policies to prevent the conversion of rice fields and to manifest national food security. However, of inconsistency and overlapping authority persist in its practice. Further close examination and reviews show the need reformation of policy for a transfer of land appropriation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23633?af=R">Estrogens dynamically regulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult female rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrone and estradiol differentially modulate neuroplasticity and cognition. How they influence the maturation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus, however, is not known. The present study assessed the effects of estrone and estradiol on the maturation timeline of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of ovariectomized (a model of surgical menopause) young adult Sprague–Dawley rats using daily subcutaneous injections of 17β-estradiol, estrone or vehicle. Rats were injected with a DNA synthesis marker, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were perfused 1, 2, or 3 weeks after BrdU injection and daily hormone treatment. Brains were sectioned and processed for various markers including: sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), antigen kiel 67 (Ki67), doublecortin (DCX), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Immunofluorescent labeling or co-labelling of BrdU with Sox2 (progenitor cells), Sox2/GFAP (neural progenitor cells), Ki67 (cell proliferation), DCX (immature neurons), NeuN (mature neurons) was used to examine the trajectory and maturation of adult-born neurons over time. Estrogens had early (1 week of exposure) effects on different stages of neurogenesis (neural progenitor cells, cell proliferation and early maturation of new cells into neurons) but these effects were less pronounced after prolonged treatment. Estradiol enhanced, whereas estrone reduced cell proliferation after 1 week but not after longer exposure to either estrogen. Both estrogens increased the density of immature neurons (BrdU/DCX-ir) after 1 week of exposure compared to vehicle treatment but this increased density was not sustained over longer durations of treatments to estrogens, suggesting that the enhancing effects of estrogens on neurogenesis were short-lived. Longer duration post-ovariectomy, without treatments with either of the estrogens, was associated with reduced neural progenitor cells in the DG. These results demonstrate that estrogens modulate several aspects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis differently in the short term, but may lose their ability to influence neurogenesis after long-term exposure. These findings have potential implications for treatments involving estrogens after surgical menopause.</p>
