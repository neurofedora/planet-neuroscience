              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17523">Unsupervised sleep-like intra- and inter-layer plasticity categorizes and improves energy efficiency in a multilayer spiking network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.17523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep is thought to support memory consolidation and the recovery of optimal energetic regime by reorganizing synaptic connectivity, yet how plasticity across hierarchical brain circuits contributes to abstraction and energy efficiency remains unclear. Here we study a spiking multi-layer network alternating wake-like and deep-sleep-like states, with state-dependent dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity in a biologically inspired thalamo-cortical framework. During wakefulness, the model learns from few perceived examples, while during deep sleep it undergoes spontaneous replay driven by slow oscillations. Plasticity enabled not only within intra-layer connections, but also in inter-layer pathways, is critical for memory consolidation and energetic downshift. Compared to restricted plasticity, full inter-layer plasticity yields higher post-sleep visual classification accuracy and promotes the emergence of sharper class-specific associations. Furthermore, we introduce a biophysically grounded estimator of metabolic power expressing network energy consumption in ATP units, partitioned into baseline, synaptic maintenance, action potential, and transmission costs. We find that inter-layer plasticity in sleep leads to a larger reduction in firing rates, synaptic strength and synaptic activity, corresponding to a substantially larger decrease in power consumption. This work suggests promising elements to be integrated in neuromorphic/energy-efficient AI learning systems, supported by brain state-specific apical mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17796">AI and World Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.17796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large neural nets perform impressively on specific tasks, they are unreliable and unsafe, as is shown by the persistent hallucinations of large language models. This paper shows that large neural nets are intrinsically unreliable, because it is not possible to make or validate a tractable theory of how a neural net works. There is no reliable way to extrapolate its performance from a limited number of test cases to an unlimited set of use cases. To have confidence in the performance of a neural net, it is necessary to enclose it in a guardrail which is provably safe, so that whatever the neural net does, there cannot be harmful consequences. World models have been proposed as a way to do this. This paper discusses the scope and architecture required of world models. World models are often conceived as models of the physical and natural world, using established theories of natural science, or learned regularities, to predict the physical consequences of AI actions. However, unforeseen consequences of AI actions impact the human social world as much as the physical world. To predict and control the consequences of AI, a world model needs to include a model of the human social world. I explore the challenges that this entails. Human language is based on a Common Ground of mutual understanding of the world, shared by the people conversing. The common ground is an overlapping subset of each persons world model, including their models of the physical, social and mental worlds. LLMs have no stable representation of a common ground. To be reliable, AI systems will need to represent a common ground with their users, including physical, mental and social domains.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18286">Closed Eyes and Coil Size -- Effects on Motor Threshold and Intracortical Inhibition, measured with TMS</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rationale: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-based measures such as resting motor threshold (RMT) and short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) are widely employed to study motor cortical and corticospinal tract function, and effects of diseases and drug therapies thereon. However, the effect of key experimental factors, including as eye state (open or closed) or stimulating coil size, remain unclear. As such, it is unknown whether these factors must be kept consistent across multi-center studies, and whether differences in such factors may underpin contradictory findings in existing literature.
  Materials and Methods: Threshold tracking TMS was employed to measure RMT and SICI (3ms interstimulus interval, conditioning at 70% of RMT) in 21 alert and awake, healthy controls. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from abductor pollicis brevis. Both RMT and SICI were measured under 6 conditions, while eyes were open or closed, using 3 figure-of-eight coils of differing winding diameter. Mixed effects modelling was employed to investigate effects of eye state and coil size on each measure.
  Results: RMT was found to be significantly higher for the smallest (30BFT) coil compared to both larger (50BFT and 70BF) coils. No difference in SICI was identified across coil sizes. Eye state was not found to affect either RMT or SICI measurements.
  Conclusions: Measurements of RMT and SICI can be considered comparable if recorded with eyes open or closed, provided the individual is awake and alert. Measurements of SICI recorded with figure-of-eight coils of different size can be considered comparable.

                arXiv:2508.16414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge, complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13481">Complex-valued Phase Synchrony Reveals Directional Coupling in FMRI and Tracks Medication Effects</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.13481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding interactions in complex systems requires capturing the relative timing of coupling, not only its strength. Phase synchronization captures this timing, yet most methods either reduce the phase to its cosine or collapse it into scalar indices such as the phase-locking value, discarding relative timing. We propose a complex-valued phase synchrony (CVPS) framework that estimates phase with an adaptive Gabor wavelet and preserves both cosine and sine components. Simulations confirm that CVPS recovers true phase offsets and tracks non-stationary dynamics more faithfully than Hilbert-based methods. Because antipsychotics are known to modulate the timing of cortical interactions, they provide a rigorous context to evaluate whether CVPS can capture such pharmacological effects. CVPS further reveals cortical neuro-hemodynamic drivers, with occipital-to-parietal and prefrontal-to-striatal lead--lag flows consistent with known receptor targets, confirming its ability to capture pharmacological timing. CVPS, therefore, offers a robust, generalizable framework for detecting relative timing in complex systems such as the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10912">Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.10912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14125">Contrastive Consolidation of Top-Down Modulations Achieves Sparsely Supervised Continual Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22860">Far from the Shallow: Brain-Predictive Reasoning Embedding through Residual Disentanglement</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.22860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically, reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG) brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), defined as an abnormal buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on protein biomarkers via PET or CSF analysis. However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19764">A flexible framework for structural plasticity in GPU-accelerated sparse spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.19764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity, where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections. However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic applications.

                arXiv:2601.17513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an automated antenna design and optimization framework employing multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGAs) to investigate various evolutionary optimization approaches, with a primary emphasis on multi-band frequency optimization. Five MOGA variants were implemented and compared: the Pareto genetic algorithm (PGA), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with niching (NSGA-I), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with elitism (NSGA-II), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm using reference points (NSGA-III), and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA). These algorithms are employed to design and optimize microstrip patch antennas loaded with complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs). A weighted-sum scalarization approach was adopted within a single-objective genetic algorithm framework enhanced with domain-specific constraint handling mechanisms. The optimization addresses the conflicting objectives of minimizing the return loss ($S_{11} < -10$~dB) and achieving multi-band resonance at 2.4~GHz, 3.6~GHz, and 5.2~GHz. The proposed method delivers a superior overall performance by aggregating these objectives into a unified fitness function encompassing $S_{11}$(2.4~GHz), $S_{11}$(3.6~GHz), and $S_{11}$(5.2~GHz). This approach effectively balances all three frequency bands simultaneously, rather than exploring trade-off solutions typical of traditional multi-objective approaches. The antenna was printed on a Rogers RT5880 substrate with a dielectric constant of 2.2 , loss tangent of 0.0009 , and thickness of 1.57~mm . Scalarization approach achieved return loss values of $-21.56$~dB, $-16.60$~dB, and $-27.69$~dB, with corresponding gains of 1.96~dBi, 2.6~dB, and 3.99~dBi at 2.4~GHz, 3.6~GHz, and 5.2~GHz, respectively.

                arXiv:2601.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has driven major advances in autonomous control. Still, standard Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents tend to rely on fixed learning rates and uniform update scaling, even as updates are modulated by temporal-difference (TD) error. This rigidity destabilizes convergence, especially in sparse-reward settings where feedback is infrequent. We introduce Deep Intrinsic Surprise-Regularized Control (DISRC), a biologically inspired augmentation to DQN that dynamically scales Q-updates based on latent-space surprise. DISRC encodes states via a LayerNorm-based encoder and computes a deviation-based surprise score relative to a moving latent setpoint. Each update is then scaled in proportion to both TD error and surprise intensity, promoting plasticity during early exploration and stability as familiarity increases. We evaluate DISRC on two sparse-reward MiniGrid environments, which included MiniGrid-DoorKey-8x8 and MiniGrid-LavaCrossingS9N1, under identical settings as a vanilla DQN baseline. In DoorKey, DISRC reached the first successful episode (reward > 0.8) 33% faster than the vanilla DQN baseline (79 vs. 118 episodes), with lower reward standard deviation (0.25 vs. 0.34) and higher reward area under the curve (AUC: 596.42 vs. 534.90). These metrics reflect faster, more consistent learning - critical for sparse, delayed reward settings. In LavaCrossing, DISRC achieved a higher final reward (0.95 vs. 0.93) and the highest AUC of all agents (957.04), though it converged more gradually. These preliminary results establish DISRC as a novel mechanism for regulating learning intensity in off-policy agents, improving both efficiency and stability in sparse-reward domains. By treating surprise as an intrinsic learning signal, DISRC enables agents to modulate updates based on expectation violations, enhancing decision quality when conventional value-based methods fall short.

                arXiv:2601.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motif discovery is a core problem in computational biology, traditionally formulated as a likelihood optimization task that returns a single dominant motif from a DNA sequence dataset. However, regulatory sequence data admit multiple plausible motif explanations, reflecting underlying biological heterogeneity. In this work, we frame motif discovery as a quality-diversity problem and apply the MAP-Elites algorithm to evolve position weight matrix motifs under a likelihood-based fitness objective while explicitly preserving diversity across biologically meaningful dimensions. We evaluate MAP-Elites using three complementary behavioral characterizations that capture trade-offs between motif specificity, compositional structure, coverage, and robustness. Experiments on human CTCF liver ChIP-seq data aligned to the human reference genome compare MAP-Elites against a standard motif discovery tool, MEME, under matched evaluation criteria across stratified dataset subsets. Results show that MAP-Elites recovers multiple high-quality motif variants with fitness comparable to MEME's strongest solutions while revealing structured diversity obscured by single-solution approaches.

                arXiv:2601.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neighborhood search operators are critical to the performance of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) and rely heavily on expert design. Although recent LLM-based Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) methods have made notable progress, they primarily optimize individual heuristics or components independently, lacking explicit exploration and exploitation of dynamic coupling relationships between multiple operators. In this paper, multi-operator optimization in MOEAs is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the improvement of interdependent operators through sequential decision-making. To address this, we propose the Evolution of Operator Combination (E2OC) framework for MOEAs, which achieves the co-evolution of design strategies and executable codes. E2OC employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to progressively search combinations of operator design strategies and adopts an operator rotation mechanism to identify effective operator configurations while supporting the integration of mainstream AHD methods as the underlying designer. Experimental results across AHD tasks with varying objectives and problem scales show that E2OC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AHD and other multi-heuristic co-design frameworks, demonstrating strong generalization and sustained optimization capability.

                arXiv:2601.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Spiking Transformers emerging as a promising architecture for energy-efficient sequence modeling. However, existing Spiking Transformers still lack a principled mechanism for effective temporal fusion, limiting their ability to fully exploit spatiotemporal dependencies. Inspired by feedforward-feedback modulation in the human visual pathway, we propose TEFormer, the first Spiking Transformer framework that achieves bidirectional temporal fusion by decoupling temporal modeling across its core components. Specifically, TEFormer employs a lightweight and hyperparameter-free forward temporal fusion mechanism in the attention module, enabling fully parallel computation, while incorporating a backward gated recurrent structure in the MLP to aggregate temporal information in reverse order and reinforce temporal consistency. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that TEFormer consistently and significantly outperforms strong SNN and Spiking Transformer baselines under diverse datasets. Moreover, through the first systematic evaluation of Spiking Transformers under different neural encoding schemes, we show that the performance gains of TEFormer remain stable across encoding choices, indicating that the improved temporal modeling directly translates into reliable accuracy improvements across varied spiking representations. These results collectively establish TEFormer as an effective and general framework for temporal modeling in Spiking Transformers.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18446">Scaling Behaviors of Evolutionary Algorithms on GPUs: When Does Parallelism Pay Off?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are increasingly implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs) to leverage parallel processing capabilities for enhanced efficiency. However, existing studies largely emphasize the raw speedup obtained by porting individual algorithms from CPUs to GPUs. Consequently, these studies offer limited insight into when and why GPU parallelism fundamentally benefits EAs. To address this gap, we investigate how GPU parallelism alters the behavior of EAs beyond simple acceleration metrics. We conduct a systematic empirical study of 16 representative EAs on 30 benchmark problems. Specifically, we compare CPU and GPU executions across a wide range of problem dimensionalities and population sizes. Our results reveal that the impact of GPU acceleration is highly heterogeneous and depends strongly on algorithmic structure. We further demonstrate that conventional fixed-budget evaluation based on the number of function evaluations (FEs) is inadequate for GPU execution. In contrast, fixed-time evaluation uncovers performance characteristics that are unobservable under small or practically constrained FE budgets, particularly for adaptive and exploration-oriented algorithms. Moreover, we identify distinct scaling regimes in which GPU parallelism is beneficial, saturates, or degrades as problem dimensionality and population size increase. Crucially, we show that large populations enabled by GPUs not only improve hardware utilization but also reveal algorithm-specific convergence and diversity dynamics that are difficult to observe under CPU-constrained settings. Consequently, our findings indicate that GPU parallelism is not strictly an implementation detail, but a pivotal factor that influences how EAs should be evaluated, compared, and designed for modern computing platforms.

                arXiv:2601.17061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information can evolve as a physical consequence of non-equilibrium dynamics, even in the absence of genes, replication, or predefined fitness functions. We present Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA), a framework in which stochastic assembly combined with differential persistence biases populations toward longer-lived motifs. Assemblies that persist longer become more frequent and are therefore more likely to participate in subsequent interactions, generating feedback that reshapes the population distribution and implements fitness-proportional sampling, realizing evolution as a natural, emergent genetic algorithm (SDA/GA) driven solely by stability. We apply SDA/GA to chemical symbol space using SMILES fragments with recombination, mutation, and a heuristic stability function. Simulations show hallmark features of evolutionary search, including scaffold-level dominance, sustained novelty, and entropy reduction, yielding open-ended dynamics absent from equilibrium models with fixed transition rates. These results motivate an evolutionary ladder hypothesis where persistence-driven selection precedes genetic replication.

                arXiv:2601.17749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently envisioned goal-oriented communications paradigm calls for the application of inference on wirelessly transferred data via Machine Learning (ML) tools. An emerging research direction deals with the realization of inference ML models directly in the physical layer of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, which, however, entails certain significant challenges. In this paper, leveraging the technology of programmable MetaSurfaces (MSs), we present an eXtremely Large (XL) MIMO system that acts as an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) performing binary classification tasks completely Over-The-Air (OTA), which can be trained in closed form. The proposed system comprises a receiver architecture consisting of densely parallel placed diffractive layers of XL MSs followed by a single reception radio-frequency chain. The front layer facing the MIMO channel consists of identical unit cells of a fixed NonLinear (NL) response, while the remaining layers of elements of tunable linear responses are utilized to approximate OTA the trained ELM weights. Our numerical investigations showcase that, in the XL regime of MS elements, the proposed XL-MIMO-ELM system achieves performance comparable to that of digital and idealized ML models across diverse datasets and wireless scenarios, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of embedding OTA learning capabilities into future communication systems.

  O(n^2) computational complexity, RSGN embeds computational nodes in learned hyperbolic space where connection strength
  decays with geodesic distance, achieving dynamic sparsity that adapts to each input. The architecture operates on two
  distinct timescales: fast differentiable activation propagation optimized through gradient descent, and slow
  Hebbian-inspired structural learning for connectivity adaptation through local correlation rules. We provide rigorous
  mathematical analysis demonstrating that RSGN achieves O(n*k) computational complexity, where k << n represents the average
  active neighborhood size. Experimental evaluation on hierarchical classification and long-range dependency tasks
  demonstrates that RSGN achieves 96.5% accuracy on long-range dependency tasks while using approximately 15x fewer
  parameters than standard Transformers. On challenging hierarchical classification with 20 classes, RSGN achieves 23.8%
  accuracy (compared to 5% random baseline) with only 41,672 parameters, nearly 10x fewer than the Transformer baselines
  which require 403,348 parameters to achieve 30.1% accuracy. Our ablation studies confirm the contribution of each architectural
  component, with Hebbian learning providing consistent improvements. These results suggest that brain-inspired principles
  of sparse, geometrically-organized computation offer a promising direction toward more efficient and biologically plausible
  neural architectures.

                arXiv:2601.18067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verilog's design cycle is inherently labor-intensive and necessitates extensive domain expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising pathway toward automation, their limited training data and intrinsic sequential reasoning fail to capture the strict formal logic and concurrency inherent in hardware systems. To overcome these barriers, we present EvolVE, the first framework to analyze multiple evolution strategies on chip design tasks, revealing that Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) excels at maximizing functional correctness, while Idea-Guided Refinement (IGR) proves superior for optimization. We further leverage Structured Testbench Generation (STG) to accelerate the evolutionary process. To address the lack of complex optimization benchmarks, we introduce IC-RTL, targeting industry-scale problems derived from the National Integrated Circuit Contest. Evaluations establish EvolVE as the new state-of-the-art, achieving 98.1% on VerilogEval v2 and 92% on RTLLM v2. Furthermore, on the industry-scale IC-RTL suite, our framework surpasses reference implementations authored by contest participants, reducing the Power, Performance, Area (PPA) product by up to 66% in Huffman Coding and 17% in the geometric mean across all problems. The source code of the IC-RTL benchmark is available at https://github.com/weiber2002/ICRTL.

                arXiv:2601.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global optimization of atomic clusters represents a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry and materials science due to the exponential growth of local minima with system size (i.e., the curse of dimensionality). We introduce a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the low-rank structure of potential energy surfaces through Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations. This work establishes TT-decomposition as a powerful tool for molecular structure prediction and provides a general framework adaptable to a wide range of high-dimensional optimization problems in computational material science.

                arXiv:2601.18707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based surrogate models have emerged as more efficient alternatives to numerical solvers for physical simulations over complex geometries, such as car bodies. Many existing models incorporate the simulation mesh as an additional input, thereby reducing prediction errors. However, generating a simulation mesh for new geometries is computationally costly. In contrast, mesh-free methods, which do not rely on the simulation mesh, typically incur higher errors. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce SMART, a neural surrogate model that predicts physical quantities at arbitrary query locations using only a point-cloud representation of the geometry, without requiring access to the simulation mesh. The geometry and simulation parameters are encoded into a shared latent space that captures both structural and parametric characteristics of the physical field. A physics decoder then attends to the encoder's intermediate latent representations to map spatial queries to physical quantities. Through this cross-layer interaction, the model jointly updates latent geometric features and the evolving physical field. Extensive experiments show that SMART is competitive with and often outperforms existing methods that rely on the simulation mesh as input, demonstrating its capabilities for industry-level simulations.

                arXiv:2507.16937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) draw inspiration from biological neurons to enable brain-like computation, demonstrating effectiveness in processing temporal information with energy efficiency and biological realism. Most existing SNNs are based on neural dynamics such as the (leaky) integrate-and-fire (IF/LIF) models, which are described by first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with Markovian characteristics. This means the potential state at any time depends solely on its immediate past value, potentially limiting network expressiveness. Empirical studies of real neurons, however, reveal long-range correlations and fractal dendritic structures, suggesting non-Markovian behavior better modeled by fractional-order ODEs.Motivated by this, we propose a fractional-order spiking neural network (f-SNN) framework that strictly generalizes integer-order SNNs and captures long-term dependencies in membrane potential and spike trains via fractional dynamics, enabling richer temporal patterns. We also release an open-source toolbox to support the f-SNN framework, applicable to diverse architectures and real-world tasks. Experimentally, fractional adaptations of established SNNs into the f-SNN framework achieve superior accuracy, comparable energy efficiency, and improved robustness to noise, underscoring the promise of f-SNNs as an effective extension of traditional SNNs.

                arXiv:2509.23516v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delay-coupled systems often require low-latency decisions from sparse telemetry, where dense fixed-step neural inference is wasteful and can degrade near stability margins. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a trainable two-state event-driven dynamical unit for delayed, graph-coupled streams, whose states map to a fast load variable and a slower recovery resource. NOS uses bounded excitability for finite buffers, explicit leak terms for service and damping, and graph-local coupling with per-link gates and communication delays, with differentiable resets compatible with surrogate-gradient training and neuromorphic execution. We prove existence and uniqueness of subthreshold equilibria, derive Jacobian-based stability conditions, and obtain a scalar network stability threshold that separates topology from node dynamics via a Perron-mode spectral condition. A stochastic arrival model aligned with telemetry smoothing explains increased variability as systems approach stability boundaries. On delayed graph forecasting and early-warning tasks from queue telemetry, NOS improves detection F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN/GRU, and temporal GNN baselines under a common residual-based protocol, while providing calibration rules for resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Biological neural networks exist in physical space where distance influences communication delays: a fundamental coupling between space and time absent in most artificial neural networks. While recent work has separately explored spatial embeddings and learnable synaptic delays in spiking neural networks, we unify these approaches through a novel neuron position learning algorithm where delays relate to the Euclidean distances between neurons. We derive gradients with respect to neuron positions and demonstrate that this biologically-motivated constraint acts as an inductive bias: networks trained on temporal classification tasks spontaneously self-organize into local, clustered topologies and a modular, efficiently wired structure emerges if connection costs are distance-dependent. Remarkably, we observe functional specialization aligned with spatial clustering without explicitly enforcing it. These findings lay the groundwork for networks in which space and time are intrinsically coupled, offering new avenues for mechanistic interpretability, biologically inspired modelling, and efficient implementations.

                arXiv:2511.12487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts that elicit toxic content even after safety alignment. We present ToxSearch, a black-box evolutionary framework that tests model safety by evolving prompts in a synchronous steady-state loop. The system employs a diverse set of operators, including lexical substitutions, negation, back-translation, paraphrasing, and two semantic crossover operators, while a moderation oracle provides fitness guidance. Operator-level analysis shows heterogeneous behavior: lexical substitutions offer the best yield-variance trade-off, semantic-similarity crossover acts as a precise low-throughput inserter, and global rewrites exhibit high variance with elevated refusal costs. Using elite prompts evolved on LLaMA 3.1 8B, we observe practically meaningful but attenuated cross-model transfer, with toxicity roughly halving on most targets, smaller LLaMA 3.2 variants showing the strongest resistance, and some cross-architecture models retaining higher toxicity. These results suggest that small, controllable perturbations are effective vehicles for systematic red-teaming and that defenses should anticipate cross-model reuse of adversarial prompts rather than focusing only on single-model hardening.

Abstract: We present Yukthi Opus (YO), a multi-chain hybrid metaheuristic designed for NP-hard optimization under explicit evaluation budget constraints. YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization.
  We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction. Overall, YO achieves competitive performance on large and multimodal problems while maintaining predictable evaluation budgets, making it suitable for expensive black-box optimization settings.

                arXiv:2601.11325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is a longstanding challenge in operations research and logistics. Classical heuristics and constructive methods can generate packings quickly, but often fail to address industrial constraints such as stability, balance, and handling feasibility. Metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms (GAs) provide flexibility and the ability to optimize across multiple objectives; however, pure GA approaches frequently struggle with efficiency, parameter sensitivity, and scalability to industrial order sizes. This gap is especially evident when scaling to real-world pallet dimensions, where even state-of-the-art algorithms often fail to achieve robust, deployable solutions. We propose a KPI-driven GA-based pipeline for industrial 3D-BPP that integrates key performance indicators directly into a multi-objective fitness function. The methodology combines a layer-based chromosome representation with domain-specific operators and constructive heuristics to balance efficiency and feasibility. On the BED-BPP benchmark of 1,500 real-world orders, our Hybrid-GA pipeline consistently outperforms heuristic- and learning-based state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 35% higher space utilization and 15 to 20% stronger surface support, with lower variance across orders. These improvements come at a modest runtime cost but remain feasible for batch-scale deployment, yielding stable, balanced, and space-efficient packings.

                arXiv:2407.00449v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fully tensorial theoretical framework for hypercomplex-valued neural networks is presented. The proposed approach enables neural network architectures to operate on data defined over arbitrary finite-dimensional algebras. The central observation is that algebra multiplication can be represented by a rank-three tensor, which allows all algebraic operations in neural network layers to be formulated in terms of standard tensor contractions, permutations, and reshaping operations.
  This tensor-based formulation provides a unified and dimension-independent description of hypercomplex-valued dense and convolutional layers and is directly compatible with modern deep learning libraries supporting optimized tensor operations. The proposed framework recovers existing constructions for four-dimensional algebras as a special case.
  Within this setting, a tensor-based version of the universal approximation theorem for single-layer hypercomplex-valued perceptrons is established under mild non-degeneracy assumptions on the underlying algebra, thereby providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for the considered class of neural networks.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental condition characterized by repetitive behaviors and impairments in social and communication skills. Despite the clear manifestation of these symptoms, many individuals with ASD remain undiagnosed. This paper proposes a methodology for ASD detection using a three-dimensional walking video dataset, leveraging supervised machine learning classification algorithms combined with nature-inspired optimization algorithms for feature extraction. The approach employs supervised classifiers to identify ASD cases, while nature-inspired optimization techniques select the most relevant features, enhanced by the use of ranking coefficients to identify initial leading particles. This strategy significantly reduces computational time, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy. Experimental evaluation with various algorithmic combinations demonstrates an exceptional classification accuracy of 100% in the best case when using the Random Forest classifier coupled with the Gravitational Search Algorithm for feature selection. The methodology's application to additional datasets promises improved robustness and generalizability. With its high accuracy and reduced computational requirements, the proposed framework offers significant contributions to both medical and academic fields, providing a foundation for future advances in ASD diagnosis.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 infection manifests as a multi-system disease with substantial extrapulmonary involvement. Hepatic dysfunction represents a critical prognostic determinant, particularly among patients presenting with gastrointestinal manifestations—a distinct clinical phenotype requiring comprehensive investigation of liver injury predictors. Methods This prospective cross-sectional study enrolled 347 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms across three tertiary medical centers in Al-Anbar, Iraq (March 2021–July 2025). Hepatic involvement was defined biochemically as aminotransferase elevation exceeding twice the upper limit of normal, without imaging or histopathological confirmation. Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses identified associations with liver enzyme elevation, though causality cannot be established. Results Hepatic involvement occurred in 168 patients (48.4%). Variables associated with biochemical hepatic dysfunction included age ≥61 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62–4.43, P<0.001), male sex (aOR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.12–2.96, P=0.016), diabetes mellitus (aOR=2.94, 95% CI: 1.74–4.97, P<0.001), hypertension (aOR=2.12, 95% CI: 1.28–3.51, P=0.004), and severe COVID-19 disease (aOR=10.42, 95% CI: 5.48–19.81, P<0.001). Alanine aminotransferase >80 U/L demonstrated optimal predictive performance (area under the curve [AUC]=0.896; sensitivity 78.6%, specificity 82.1%). An internally validated clinical scoring system achieved 82.1% sensitivity and 78.8% specificity; external validation remains pending. Conclusions Biochemical hepatic abnormalities correlate strongly with COVID-19 severity, though distinguishing direct viral hepatotoxicity from systemic illness effects, medication-induced injury, or hypoxic hepatitis remains challenging without structural assessment. The proposed risk stratification model requires external validation before clinical implementation.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aims to examine the impact of applying green accounting on the quality of sustainability reports at the Central Bank of Iraq within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, It examined the moderating effect of environmental awareness on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach A structured questionnaire was used to survey 320 senior officials and accountants regarding green accounting practices, environmental awareness, and reporting quality. Quantitative models using structural equation modeling (SEM) employed to analyze direct and indirect relationships between variables. Findings The results showed that green accounting practices had a direct negative impact on the quality of sustainability reports, indicating a discrepancy between objectives and implementation. However, the presence of environmental awareness among leaders reduced the organizational confusion resulting from the new systems represented by green accounting. The results also indicate factors, such as the legal framework and technological maturity, enhancing the effectiveness of green accounting initiatives. Practical implications Adopting green accounting without the necessary infrastructure weakens the quality of sustainability reports. A key factor in this is environmental awareness among officials, which promotes transparency and sustainability. Therefore, organizations must understand that the successful implementation of green accounting begins with raising environmental awareness among leaders and employees, training and developing human resources to use these systems, and improving existing technological systems and regulations to align with them and enhance the chances of successful green accounting implementation. Originality/value This study makes a pivotal contribution to the academic literature, adding to the limited body of research on the dynamic links between green accounting, sustainability reporting and environmental awareness in banks.

                Background This study investigates how digital technology, particularly virtual reality (VR), is transforming narrative patterns in modern English literature. It explores the shift from linear storytelling to immersive, participatory forms. Methods The research employs a literary analysis of Ernest Cline’s novel Ready Player One, using Mikhail Bakhtin’s “chronotope” theory as a framework. This approach examines the alteration of time-space dynamics within narrative construction. Results The analysis demonstrates that VR facilitates a move from chronological plots to exploratory spatial narratives, where users gather scattered story elements. In texts like Ready Player One, the virtual OASIS platform enables audience transformation into active characters, blurring the lines between reality and fiction, consumer and creator. This narrative agency aligns with broader pedagogical benefits, supporting immersive learning in relation to Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education). Conclusions The study concludes that VR fundamentally reshapes narrative development, structure, and purpose, accelerating a shift toward interactive, participant-driven storytelling. The integration of VR with traditional narrative is not merely a technical advance but a significant reinterpretation of storytelling with substantial implications for education, culture, and society.

                The functional characterization of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) has been disproportionately shaped by the paradigm of cytoplasmic miRNA sponging, a model that, while valid for many transcripts, has overshadowed a more fundamental and impactful role. This opinion article argues for a critical conceptual shift, positing that the most potent role of many lncRNAs is not as competitive sponges, but as primary architects and scaffolds of the epigenetic landscape. The prevailing focus on the cytoplasm has created diagnostic and therapeutic blind spots. We contend that deliberately recentering the narrative around lncRNAs as nuclear scaffolds and specificity factors for chromatin-modifying complexes is essential for identifying precise disease biomarkers and developing the next generation of targeted epigenetic therapies.

                <p>Daughterless (Da), the <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> homolog of mammalian E-protein transcription factor 4 (TCF4), is well studied in fruit fly embryonic development but its functions in adult nervous system are poorly understood. Mutations in human <I>TCF4</I> gene lead to intellectual disabilities such as Pitt&ndash;Hopkins syndrome and <I>TCF4</I> has also been linked to schizophrenia. Here, to explore the roles of Da in the <I>Drosophila</I> mature brain, we map Da DNA binding sites and study the transcriptomics of the brains where Da function is inhibited by pan-neuronal Extramacrohaete (Emc) overexpression, in both male and female <I>Drosophila</I>. Our transcriptome analyses reveal that in the adult brain Da regulates the expression of genes involved in behavior, memory, synaptic signaling, protein translation, and metabolic processes. Moreover, combining the RNA sequencing data with Da ChIP sequencing results indicates that genes associated with neuronal projection guidance, metabolism, and translation are direct targets of Da. In addition, we validate the involvement of Da in memory formation. Overall, our results provide valuable information about the functions of Da in the adult brain and aid in better understanding the mechanisms of TCF4-related disorders.</p>

                <p>by Anna Krzynowek, Jasper Snoeks, Karoline Faust</p>

<i>PlasticEnz</i> is a new open-source tool for detecting plastic-degrading enzymes (plastizymes) in metagenomic data by combining sequence homology-based search with machine learning techniques. It integrates custom Hidden Markov Models, DIAMOND alignments, and polymer-specific classifiers trained on ProtBERT embeddings to identify candidate depolymerases from user-provided contigs, genomes, or protein sequences. PlasticEnz supports 11 plastic polymers with ML classifiers for PET and PHB, achieving F1 > 0.7 on an independent test set. Applied to plastic-exposed microcosms and field metagenomes, the tool recovered known PETases and PHBases, distinguished plastic-contaminated from pristine environments, and clustered predictions with validated reference enzymes. <i>PlasticEnz</i> is fast, scalable, and user-friendly, providing a robust framework for exploring microbial plastic degradation potential in complex communities.

Interferons (IFNs) are potent antiviral cytokines that are rapidly activated when infected cells sense a virus, but continued IFN production following acute infection is linked to impaired recovery. IFNs protect against infection by inducing a suite of antiviral effectors in IFN receptor-expressing cells via JAK/STAT signaling. However, how IFNs curtail tissue repair is not fully understood. Here, we studied the effects of Type III IFNs (IFNλ1 and IFNλ2) and Type I IFN (IFNβ) on tissue repair functions of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). We show that both Type III IFNs and IFNβ reduce bronchial epithelial cell migration and proliferation through a common upstream mechanism: activation of LATS1, a kinase best known for limiting organ growth as part of the Hippo signaling pathway. Mechanistically, Type III IFN or IFNβ curtailed wound healing by triggering phosphorylation of LATS1 via JAK activity, bypassing activation of MST1/2, the canonical activator of LATS1 in the Hippo pathway. Further experiments showed that distinct signaling pathways lead to LATS1 and STAT1 phosphorylation downstream of IFN receptor signaling. STAT1 was dispensable for IFN-mediated LATS1 phosphorylation and suppression of tissue repair, although as expected STAT1 was required for IFN-mediated protection from rhinovirus or influenza infection. Dose–response curve experiments revealed that higher concentrations of IFN were required to trigger LATS1 phosphorylation compared to STAT1 phosphorylation. Consistently, during rhinovirus or influenza virus infection of organotypic HBEC cultures, we observed phosphorylation of both LATS1 and STAT1, but with different kinetics, with LATS1 activation showing earlier resolution compared to STAT1 activation. These results provide a conceptual framework for understanding how IFN receptor signaling differentially controls epithelial functions required for tissue repair and antiviral defense, and inform efforts to target pathological effects of IFNs following viral infection and in other high IFN states.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-119/v1?src=rss">High False-Positive Rate of Syphilis Serological Screening in Male Blood Donors: A Molecular Validation Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Accurate serological screening is fundamental to transfusion safety. The VDRL test remains extensively used for syphilis screening despite documented limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Objectives This study validated VDRL results through PCR, determined true Treponema pallidum prevalence among VDRL-positive blood donors, established diagnostic accuracy of ELISA and rapid tests, and enhanced blood safety protocols. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study was conducted at the Al-Ramadi regional blood transfusion facility between February and August 2024. Among 5,579 male blood donors aged 18-65 years who underwent screening, 50 demonstrated VDRL reactivity (0.90%). Confirmatory testing protocols included treponemal-specific ELISA, rapid immunochromatographic assays, and real-time PCR targeting the *T. pallidum polA* gene. Diagnostic performance parameters were calculated using PCR (reported sensitivity 99%, specificity 98%) as the reference standard. Results VDRL reactivity was detected in 0.90% (50/5,579) of male blood donors. All VDRL-reactive specimens demonstrated concordant positive results on both ELISA and rapid immunochromatographic platforms. However, PCR analysis detected *T. pallidum* DNA in only 29 specimens (58%), revealing that 21 specimens (42%) represented false-positive serological reactions. Diagnostic accuracy analysis comparing serological assays against PCR demonstrated limited discriminatory performance: ELISA exhibited 100% concordance with VDRL among reactive specimens but failed to distinguish true infections from false-positive reactions (positive predictive value 58%). The rapid diagnostic test demonstrated comparable limitations. High VDRL titers (≥1:8) demonstrated strong correlation with PCR positivity (87.5%), whereas low titers (1:1-1:4) exhibited poor correlation (41.0%). False-positive rates were highest among donors aged 35-44 years. The disposal of blood units based on false-positive serological results represents substantial wastage of valuable blood resources. Conclusion Molecular confirmation of reactive specimens enhances transfusion safety and conserves blood resources. The high false-positive rate (42%) necessitates urgent revision of screening algorithms and implementation of PCR confirmation strategies.

                <p>Nature Photonics, Published online: 26 January 2026; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-025-01833-8">doi:10.1038/s41566-025-01833-8</a></p>The researchers show that a subwavelength film of indium tin oxide, the bulk permittivity of which is strategically modulated via optical pumping, can be dynamically tuned to act as both a non-resonant amplifier and a perfect absorber. The findings extend the concept of coherent perfect absorption to the temporal domain and may enable coherent manipulation of light in Floquet-engineered complex photonic systems.

                Pharmacological enhancement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis is an attractive strategy to mitigate pathology linked to etiologically diverse protein misfolding diseases. However, despite this promise, few compounds have been identified that enhance ER proteostasis through defined mechanisms of action. We previously identified the phenylhydrazone-based compound AA263 as a molecule that promotes adaptive ER proteostasis remodeling through mechanisms including preferential activation of the ATF6 signaling arm of the unfolded protein response (Plate et al., 2016). However, the protein target(s) of AA263 and the potential for further development of this class of ER proteostasis regulators had not been previously explored. Here, we employ chemical proteomics to demonstrate that AA263 covalently targets a subset of ER protein disulfide isomerases, revealing a potential molecular mechanism for the activation of ATF6 afforded by this compound. We then use medicinal chemistry to establish next-generation AA263 analogs showing improved potency and efficacy for ATF6 activation, as compared to the parent compound. Finally, we show that treatment with these AA263 analogs enhances secretory pathway proteostasis to correct the pathologic protein misfolding and trafficking of both a destabilized, disease-associated α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) variant and an epilepsy-associated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variant. These results establish AA263 analogs with enhanced potential for correcting imbalanced ER proteostasis associated with etiologically diverse protein misfolding disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95576">Axonal distribution of mitochondria maintains neuronal autophagy during aging via eIF2β</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal aging and neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by proteostasis collapse, while the cellular factors that trigger it have not been identified. Impaired mitochondrial transport in the axon is another feature of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we found that genetic depletion of axonal mitochondria causes dysregulation of protein degradation. Axons with mitochondrial depletion showed abnormal protein accumulation and autophagic defects. Lowering neuronal ATP levels by blocking glycolysis did not reduce autophagy, suggesting that autophagic defects are associated with mitochondrial distribution. We found that eIF2β was increased by the depletion of axonal mitochondria via proteome analysis. Phosphorylation of eIF2α, another subunit of eIF2, was lowered, and global translation was suppressed. Neuronal overexpression of <i>eIF2β</i> phenocopied the autophagic defects and neuronal dysfunctions, and lowering <i>eIF2β</i> expression rescued those perturbations caused by depletion of axonal mitochondria. These results indicate the mitochondria-eIF2β axis maintains proteostasis in the axon, of which disruption may underlie the onset and progression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

">Persistent cerebellar molecular layer interneuron activity facilitates anticipatory control of tongue movements</a></h4>

              
                Precise, anticipatory movements depend on the brain ability to generate motor commands in advance of immediate sensory input. Although the cerebellar cortex receives abundant sensory input via the mossy fiber pathway, the mechanisms by which continuous sensory signals are transformed or gated remain poorly understood. Here we show that molecular layer interneurons acquire persistent sensory-related activity in mice that develop anticipatory behavior. Employing a targeted lick interception task, we found that interneurons in lobule Crus I exhibit enhanced activity up to five seconds before movement onset locked to the spatial position of a continuously moving target independent of body movement. In more anticipatory mice, movement onset becomes linked to the dynamics of this persistent activity, whereas less anticipatory mice adjust their movements based on immediate sensory related input. Moreover, chemogenetic inhibition of Crus I, but not Crus II, impairs behavioral performance and delays lick onset without altering overall lick parameters. Our results indicate that anticipation in dynamic sensorimotor tasks relies on sensory representations encoded by interneurons.

">Comprehensive 3D mapping reveals distinct spatial gradients of SST, PV, and TH interneurons across the mouse caudoputamen</a></h4>

              
                In addition to spatially organized excitatory forebrain inputs along its mediolateral, dorsoventral, and anteroposterior axes, the striatum relies on cellular diversity to subserve its myriad processing functions. Distinct striatal GABAergic interneuron subtypes, including somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) interneurons likely subserve complementary computational roles. However, a detailed understanding of how these microcircuit components are distributed across striatal territories remains lacking. To address this gap, we generated a comprehensive three-dimensional atlas of SST, PV, and TH interneurons across the mouse caudoputamen using genetic labeling, brain-wide imaging, and voxel-wise quantification. We found that SST and TH interneurons were relatively enriched in the ventral caudoputamen, whereas PV interneurons were enriched dorsally. In addition, PV and TH interneurons exhibited opposing anteroposterior distribution patterns, with PV interneurons enriched posteriorly and TH interneurons showing a marked decline in density towards the striatal tail. Consequently, while the three interneuron subtypes displayed comparable densities in the functionally defined lateral striatum and anterior ventromedial striatum, PV interneurons predominated in the dorsomedial striatum and tail of striatum. We did not observe major sex differences. Together, these findings reinforce the view that the striatum is not a monolithic structure: in addition to structured excitatory inputs, inhibitory microcircuits themselves are differentially distributed across striatal territories, providing region-specific constraints on circuit computation. By integrating interneuron organization into existing anatomical frameworks, this atlas provides a foundation for linking striatal anatomy to function across behavioral domains.

">The curse of dimensionality in motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how motor cortex generates movement is a foundational challenge in neuroscience. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), are widely used to transform high-dimensional neural data into a more interpretable, low-dimensional space. It is broadly assumed that the dimensionality of a particular motor task--that is, the number of principal components needed to explain a fixed fraction of variance--is an intrinsic property of the underlying neural dynamics, potentially modulated by task complexity. Here, we show that unsupervised estimates of dimensionality do not converge but instead scale with the number of recorded neurons. Across four animals, we found that while low-dimensional structure reflects changes in behavioral context, traditional metrics of dimensionality are relatively insensitive to increasingly complex movements. Rather, dimensionality increases with electrode count, exhibiting non-saturating growth as recordings scale to 1000 electrodes. While decoders trained on unsupervised subspaces showed only modest gains with scale, supervised methods leveraged additional electrodes to separate neural states more effectively. Surprisingly, the percentage of variance required for accurate supervised reach decoding became vanishingly small at high electrode counts (<0.1% at 1000 electrodes). Our results challenge current views on cortical dimensionality and highlight the divergent properties of supervised versus unsupervised learning, motivating careful consideration of appropriate computational methods as experimental data volumes scale.

">Neural modes in motor cortex cycle over fast timescales</a></h4>

              
                The embedding of low-dimensional latent states in the activity of large neuron populations has become a tenet of systems neuroscience. Despite the stability of these latent representations over time, the underlying activity of individual neurons is known to change both within experimental sessions and across days; yet, less attention has been devoted to changes in the coordinated activity of neuron populations on short timescales, particularly under conditions where networks must adapt quickly (e.g., during learning or after injury). To investigate, patterns of individual neuron contributions to population state dimensions in motor cortex were tracked over short blocks of repeated reaching trials. The number of distinct encoding patterns was consistently less than the typical dimensionality reported for motor cortex. Although the neuron population state space and dynamics were effectively conserved, these underlying encoding patterns changed in two ways: fast switches among themselves, as well as slow modifications over time. To explore whether these two drift timescales shared a common physiological mechanism, we analyzed the response of motor cortex to a causal perturbation. Direct electrical current was passed through two recording electrodes to terminate a small number of neurons, which evoked drift over both fast and slow timescales, both together and independently. While changes in fast switch rates were not necessarily associated with behavioral deficits, a significant increase in slow drift was accompanied by a decrease in behavioral performance. Together, these results reveal an additional timescale of drift in correlated population activity that could help guide the discovery of cellular and network mechanisms responsible for the maintenance, (re)learning, and recovery of low-dimensional structure in neuron populations.

">Reconciling contradictory models of subthalamic nucleus contributions to basal ganglia beta oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Recent computational studies of Parkinsons disease have yielded contradictory findings regarding the role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in pathological beta oscillations, with some models implicating STN as essential for beta generation and others suggesting that STN suppresses oscillations. This work addresses these discrepancies by systematically investigating how the specific features of the integrate-and-fire neurons used in these models influence simulated basal ganglia network dynamics. Using both rate models and spiking network simulations incorporating coupled subthalamopallidal and pallidostriatal circuits, we demonstrate that the choice between leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) and quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) models to represent STN neurons fundamentally impacts the phase relationship between STN and external globus pallidus prototypical (Proto) neuron populations. QIF STN neurons establish in-phase coupling with Proto neurons, which enhances beta oscillation amplitude, while LIF STN neurons develop anti-phase relationships, which suppresses beta power. Through intervention experiments and parameter sweeps across physiologically relevant firing rates, we show that these phase-related effects persist robustly across network conditions, and we mathematically establish conditions under which these results are guaranteed to hold. Our findings reveal that the fundamental mathematical structure underlying spike generation, rather than other biophysical details, determines whether the subthalamopallidal loop acts as a beta amplifier or suppressor. This mechanistic insight reconciles contradictory findings in the literature, demonstrates that seemingly minor modeling choices can have profound consequences for understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets, and offers predictions for determining which model framework reflects the biological reality.

">A pathogenic AMPA receptor gating mutation disrupts synapse-mitochondrion axis and stalls synapse maturation</a></h4>

              
                AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are central regulators of excitatory synaptic transmission and play critical roles in activity dependent synapse maturation and circuit development. De novo missense mutations in AMPAR subunits have been widely linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Despite this, how these variants lead to neuronal dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the consequences of a recurrent pathogenic mutation in the GluA1 subunit (GRIA1 p.A636T), which alters AMPAR gating properties and is associated with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. We developed a GluA1A636T knock-in mouse model, we show that GluA1A636T mice exhibit impairments in hippocampal dependent learning and working memory accompanied by reduced baseline activity of CA1 neurons in vivo. Mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomic analyses of juvenile and adult hippocampal samples revealed that the A636T mutation significantly alters synaptic protein expression at both ages. Notably, the mutation drives a robust upregulation of mitochondrial proteins specifically in adult mice. Consistent with this, dendritic mitochondria in adult GluA1A636T mice exhibited altered morphology and increased oxidative stress. Electrophysiological analyses further revealed abnormalities in synaptic function, including reduced basal excitatory transmission, persistence of functionally silent synapses in adulthood, and altered synaptic plasticity consistent with impaired synapse maturation. Together, these findings demonstrate that a pathogenic AMPAR gating mutation disrupts the coordinated development of synaptic and metabolic programs in the hippocampus, linking altered excitatory signaling to delayed mitochondrial stress and enduring circuit dysfunction. Our study provides a developmental framework for understanding how disease-associated AMPAR variants impair brain function and highlights synapse mitochondria coupling as a critical axis in glutamate receptor ionotropic (GRI) disorders.

">Inhibition of Slc17a7 expressing neurons in the basolateral amygdala which project to the nucleus accumbens shapes the fidelity of motivated behavior</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior depends on the ability to form predictive associations between environmental cues and biologically relevant outcomes. Classical models posit that projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) promote reward seeking, whereas projections to the central amygdala facilitate defensive responding. However, accumulating evidence indicates that molecular identity and inhibitory dynamics introduce additional layers of functional heterogeneity within these pathways. Genetically defined subsets of BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons can drive either reward-related or aversive behaviors, and single-cell imaging studies show that cue-responsive BLA ensembles undergo an inhibitory shift as conditioning progresses. How these molecular and inhibitory mechanisms interact within defined projections to shape motivated behavior remains unclear. To address this, we examined Vglut1-expressing BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons (Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc), the predominant excitatory population within this pathway. Whole-cell electrophysiology revealed that reward conditioning increases inhibitory synaptic input onto Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons and reduces intrinsic excitability. Using a dual-recombinase chemogenetic strategy, we found that selective inhibition of this projection enhances acquisition of a cued reward task, increases instrumental reward seeking, and elevates reward valuation in a two-choice preference assay. Similar enhancement was observed in a fear-discrimination task, where inhibition of Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons improved differentiation between threat- and safety-associated cues. These findings identify inhibitory regulation of Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons as a key mechanism that strengthens stimulus-outcome associations. By demonstrating that conditioning-associated inhibitory plasticity modulates this major BLA output pathway, the work refines prevailing models of BLA[-&gt;]NAc function and highlights inhibition as an important contributor to the fidelity of motivated behavior.To address this, we examined Vglut1-expressing BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons (Vglut1BLA[-&gt;]NAc), the predominant excitatory population within this pathway.

">Multilevel sex-specific neurobiological signatures of early life adversity</a></h4>

              
                Stress exposure early in life is an established risk factor for adult psychiatric illness, yet these disorders -- including anxiety disorders and depression -- show significant sex-dependence in prevalence, symptomatology, and treatment response. The biology underlying these differences remains largely unexplored and may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity in anxiety and depression. Here, we characterize the lasting impact of developmental stress on adulthood neurobiology and behavior in mice by combining analyses of multiple levels of brain function, including whole-brain c-Fos mapping, manganese-enhanced MRI and transcriptomics with advanced behavioral phenotyping. Across levels of investigation, we find distinct and often opposite effects of developmental stress depending on sex. These results together showcase the strong influence of sex on how early life adversity affects the onset of stress-related disorders. This work emphasizes the necessity of considering sex when investigating developmental and neurobiological underpinnings of stress-related disorders and displays a vast range of lasting effects of developmental stress on the brain, which provides a valuable resource for future studies aiming to improve psychiatric treatments.

">Altered Physiology and Ensemble Recruitment of Dentate Gyrus Semilunar Granule Cells in a Mouse Model of Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                The dentate gyrus is a major locus for structural and synaptic reorganization in temporal lobe epilepsy. While physiological changes during epileptogensis are well characterized in the principal dentate projection neuron, granule cells (GCs), epilepsy-related changes in semilunar granule cells (SGCs), a distinct subset of dentate projection neurons, remain unknown. Using a mouse pilocarpine model of epilepsy, we show that, unlike GCs, SGCs exhibit an increase in intrinsic excitability 1 week after status epilepticus (SE), accompanied by a depolarized resting membrane potential in epileptic mice 1-month post-SE. Both GCs and SGCs display increased frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in early post-SE and epileptic mice. However, only SGCs received more frequent spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and exhibited smaller afferent-evoked IPSCs early after SE. Additionally, evoked EPSC amplitude in SGCs was reduced in epileptic mice. Behaviorally, epileptic mice showed impairments in their ability to use spatial search strategies in a Barnes maze paradigm. Epileptic TRAP::tdT mice showed reduced activity dependent neuronal ensemble labeling, with fewer tdT-labeled neurons in both task-naive and trained conditions and reduced c-Fos co-expression following task re-acquisition compared to controls. Notably, the proportion of SGCs within labeled ensembles was reduced in task-naive epileptic mice but not in trained animals. Collectively, our findings identify selective changes in SGC intrinsic excitability during epileptogenesis that could contribute to enhanced network excitability. The cell-specific alterations in SGC circuit connectivity during epileptogenesis, alongside the apparent reduction in neuronal recruitment to behavioral ensembles likely contribute to spatial navigation deficits observed in epilepsy.

">Task goals reorganize visual codes in human ventral temporal cortex via medial frontal modulation</a></h4>

              
                How higher cortical regions dynamically modulate sensory representations to support cognitive flexibility remains a fundamental open question. Using rare simultaneous single-neuron recordings across multiple human brain regions, we show that representations in ventral temporal cortex (VTC), not traditionally associated with context-dependent coding, are dynamically reconfigured by the timing of task instructions. Identical visual stimuli evoked distinct responses in VTC depending on when task instructions were provided, with categorical representations sharpened when goals were specified in advance. In contrast, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and hippocampus carried strong signals related to instruction timing, consistent with known regional specialization in top-down control. Coupling between dACC and VTC increased with uncertainty and for high cognitive demand, and its strength predicted correct performance. These findings uncover a dynamic feedback mechanism through which medial frontal cortex reorganizes sensory population codes in VTC, linking flexible cortical coordination to successful goal-directed computation.

">Pulsed taVNS-elicited pupil dilation: effects of intermixed stimulation, sham location and respiratory phase</a></h4>

              
                Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) may offer a powerful, noninvasive way to stimulate activity of brainstem arousal systems, including the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Pulsed taVNS is known to elicit pupil dilation, a marker of LC activity. However, studies reporting taVNS effects on pupil dilation have delivered taVNS and sham stimulation in separate blocks of trials or in separate sessions, hindering the integration of taVNS into rapid, event-related task designs of cognitive neuroscientists. In two experiments, we examined the effectiveness of pulsed taVNS in eliciting pupil dilation when active and sham stimulation were intermixed within the same blocks of trials, and whether these effects depend on sham location and respiratory phase. In Experiment 1 (N = 40), intermixed taVNS and (earlobe) sham pulses of 3.4 seconds produced inconclusive evidence for increased taVNS-evoked pupil dilation. In contrast, in Experiment 2 (N = 60), taVNS pulses of 1.0 seconds had a strong effect on pupil dilation, but only in a group of participants that received sham stimulation at the earlobe; this effect was abolished in a group that received sham stimulation at the upper scapha, a non-vagal control area with a similar density of sympathetic nerve fibers as the cymba concha. Furthermore, taVNS-evoked pupil dilation was not enhanced when stimulation was delivered during exhalation, as would be expected if pupil effects were mediated by the vagus nerve-nucleus tractus solitarius-LC pathway. Together, these findings show that the effect of pulsed taVNS on pupil dilation can be preserved when taVNS and (earlobe) sham are delivered in the same blocks of trials. However, the null finding with the scapha as sham location, and the absence of an enhanced taVNS effect during exhalation call into question the assumption that taVNS-induced pupil dilation is mediated by activation of the vagal afferent pathway.

">When Randomness Becomes Rigid: Dynamic Connectivity Entropy and Symptom-Linked Network Dysfunction in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                High dimensionality of dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC) data representation complicates clinical interpretation and biomarker discovery. We propose a new complementary analytical framework based on dynamic inter-network connectivity entropy (DICE) and its potential use as a biomarker of mental illness. Our framework shows that DICE features extend beyond patient-control discrimination, revealing distinct pathophysiological signatures and differential associations with symptom dimensions. Using resting-state fMRI data from 311 participants, 160 controls, 151 schizophrenia (SZ) patients, we identified 53 intrinsic networks, computed DICE and derived three families of DICE-based metrics: (i) entropy level and range, (ii) distributional shape and temporal organization, (iii) entropy-state repertoire and occupancy. These measures revealed a multidimensional signature of altered entropy dynamics in SZ: (1) elevated baseline entropy with reduced fluctuation magnitude and reduced entropy acceleration; (2) reduced temporal persistence of entropy excursions and entropy distributions closer to Gaussian; and (3) a narrowed repertoire of entropy states, prolonged time in near-baseline entropy configurations. The DICE-based metrics within the SZ group show different associations with symptom dimensions. Reduced fluctuation magnitude and acceleration were associated with greater PANSS general symptom severity (disturbance of volition and preoccupation). Reduced deviation from Gaussianity was associated with higher PANSS positive severity (delusions and hallucinations). Reduced temporal persistence was associated with multiple PANSS positive, negative, and general symptoms. Reduced entropy-state diversity and prolonged dwell time in near-baseline states were associated with depression and PANSS positive/general severity, respectively. The multidimensional pathophysiology revealed through the different entropy patterns may potentially guide biomarker development and personalized treatments.

">Effects of delay and amplification of auditory feedback for walking: anticipation, variability, and frequency adaptation.</a></h4>

              
                When walking, we generate rich acoustic information through our footsteps. This sound stream contains information about footfall timing, dragging, loading rate, etc. The role of this endogenous auditory feedback in gait control remains underexplored. Building on work in delayed auditory feedback (DAF) for speech and on theories of sensorimotor coupling, we investigated whether manipulating the delay and amplification of self-produced footstep sounds modulates gait dynamics. Thirty healthy young adults walked overground while receiving real-time lateralized playback of the sound close to their feet using shoe-mounted microphones, belt-worn micro-computer, and headphones, all connected with cables for minimal latency. Across conditions, auditory feedback was delivered with no delay, low delay (12.5% step duration), or high delay (25% step duration), and at either full or half amplification. There was also a masked hearing condition with pink noise. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, namely cadence, speed, stride length, and coefficient of variation were analyzed as percent change relative to baseline. We found that amplification without delay reduced variability by almost 10% on average, consistent with strengthened sensorimotor coupling via enhanced perceptual access to foot-ground interaction dynamics. A second interesting finding was that delay increased the cadence of walking instead of reducing it, contrary to our expectations. We discussed how this effect can be explained by both Bayesian predictive coding and anticipatory dynamic systems with delayed feedback. We developed a theoretical model with anticipatory dynamics, with implications for closed-loop gait rehabilitation tools.

">A Primary Central Source Determines Perturbation-Evoked N1 Amplitudes but not Latencies in Younger Adults</a></h4>

              
                The balance perturbation-evoked N1 potential is a reliable cortical response during reactive balance control that is correlated to a variety of cognitive and motor functions. Although the supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the primary source of the N1, it is less understood whether other brain regions contribute to N1 recorded at the scalp. We used source localization on electroencephalography (EEG) data from 25 younger adults recorded during backward whole-body perturbations during stance. We identified the sources that contribute to channel-based N1 recordings and quantified their impact on N1 amplitude and latency. In younger adults, N1 amplitudes can be explained by one single source in a central midline cortical region covering the SMA. When reconstructing N1 signals using backprojections with one versus all independent components (IC) identified as brain sources there was no difference in peak amplitudes and a small but significant difference in N1 peak latencies. Parallel brain sources thus deflect the time course of the N1, but not its magnitude. Brain areas associated with IC's contributing to the shift in N1 latency varied between participants. Our results emphasize the dominant influence of central cortical areas on the N1 response, informing hypothesizes regarding the nature of the signal and its functional role. Importantly, the extent and location of other cortical structures that influence N1 timing, such as parietal cortex areas and the anterior cingulate cortex, may further elucidate cortical contributions to balance. These markers could be crucial for the early detection of balance problems in clinical populations.

">Predicting driver distraction using a single channel ear EEG</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive distraction poses a major risk to driving safety, yet remains difficult to detect in real time because it often lacks overt behavioral markers. Neurophysiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) provide objective indices of cognitive load, but conventional EEG systems are impractical for real-world deployment due to their intrusiveness and computational demands. The present study examined whether cognitive distraction during naturalistic driving can be decoded using a single-channel, non-invasive in-ear EEG, and how its temporal dynamics compare with those obtained from full-cap scalp EEG and behavioral measures. Twenty-seven participants performed a dual-task paradigm in a highly immersive driving simulator, combining continuous vehicle control with low- and high-load arithmetic tasks presented on an in-vehicle display. Single-channel in-ear EEG, 24-channel scalp EEG, eye movements, and head rotation were recorded concurrently. Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis was applied to decode working-memory load with millisecond precision across modalities. Cognitive distraction was reliably decoded from in-ear EEG, with detection latency and temporal generalization profiles closely matching those of full-cap scalp EEG. Although peak decoding performance was higher for scalp EEG, the timing and temporal stability of distraction-related neural signatures were largely overlapping between the two neural modalities. Eye velocity provided the earliest and most sensitive behavioral marker of distraction, while head rotation contributed complementary but weaker information. Scalp EEG topographies indicated that neural signals underlying decoding were closely linked to oculomotor and visuomotor processes engaged during task performance. These findings demonstrate that single-channel in-ear EEG provides a temporally precise and low-burden neural marker of cognitive distraction during driving. By prioritizing early detection and minimal hardware over maximal classification accuracy, the results identify a practical operating point for wearable EEG-based driver monitoring systems and support the feasibility of fast, off-the-shelf decoding approaches for real-world applications.

                Accurate pose estimation underpins quantitative analysis of behavior, yet many deep learning-based tracking tools remain optimized for offline workflows that rely on fragmented software pipelines, workstation-grade GPUs, or external middleware to enable real-time deployment. Here we present an integrated software-hardware ecosystem for pose estimation that spans dataset creation, model training, offline analysis, and real-time deployment on embedded edge-computing devices. SqueakPose Studio provides a software suite for whole-frame, deep learning-based pose estimation that unifies dataset creation, manual and model-assisted labeling, model training, validation, and large-scale offline inference. The system leverages modern object-detection architectures to enable efficient end-to-end training and inference without patch-based sampling or multi-stage postprocessing, and supports execution on CPUs, GPUs, and Apple Silicon. For experimental settings requiring continuous recording and synchronized data acquisition, SqueakView enables real-time model deployment, video capture, and sensor logging on embedded edge-computing hardware, while MouseHouse provides a compact, modular enclosure designed for home cage-based experiments that integrates embedded GPU compute, microcontroller-based timing, and peripheral I/O. A shared data format and deterministic timing architecture ensure consistency across offline analysis and real-time deployment. Together, SqueakPose Studio, SqueakView, and MouseHouse provide a unified platform for pose estimation that supports both conventional offline analysis and embedded, real-time experimentation, without reliance on workstation-grade hardware or external middleware.

">Neuromark Fusion: A Replicable Multimodal Template for Structure-Function Fusion of Brain MRI</a></h4>

              
                Multimodal data fusion is a powerful technique for extracting shared and complementary information about the brain that is captured across neuroimaging modalities. Independent component analysis (ICA)-based approaches are among the most widely utilized methods for multimodal fusion, as they are data-driven, robust to noise, and capable of identifying complex, hidden linkages of varying strengths across high-dimensional datasets. However, the data-driven nature of ICA fusion approaches can make comparisons across analyses difficult without a normative framework in place. In this work, we utilize resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) scans from >15,000 subjects to generate a normative model of multimodal structure-function linkages that can be used as a template to guide ICA fusions of new datasets. When applying this template in two datasets, resultant components exhibit high correspondence to the template even in small sample sizes, and subject-level loadings from template-derived ICs show significant associations to age.

">Global brain activity links subcortical degeneration to cortical tau progressively across Braak regions over early Alzheimer disease stages</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by early tau pathology in subcortical neuromodulatory nuclei, followed by progressive cortical tau accumulation; however, the mechanisms linking subcortical dysfunction to cortical tau pathology remain unclear. Using multimodal neuroimaging data from the ADNI cohort, we examined how infra-slow (< 0.1 Hz) global brain (i.e., gBOLD) activity is related to the volume of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) and cortical tau accumulations in the early stages of AD. NbM degeneration was associated with reduced gBOLD activity and spatially co-localized tau accumulation, appearing in early Braak regions during the preclinical stage, i.e., cognitively unimpaired participants with abnormal CSF markers, and extending to more advanced Braak areas during the prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. Our findings suggest that infra-slow gBOLD activity serves as a functional neural mediator linking subcortical degeneration to cortical tau pathology, highlighting a potential functional pathway linking subcortical and cortical pathology in early AD.

">Opening the black box: a modular approach to spike sorting</a></h4>

              
                Spike sorting is an algorithmic process to extract the activity of individual neurons from extracellular electrophysiology recordings. With the ballooning use of high density probes, such as Neuropixels, this essential processing step is increasingly becoming time consuming and computationally expensive. Although many software tools have been proposed to address spike sorting, they are usually constructed and benchmarked as monolithic 'black boxes', making it difficult to factor out the effects of individual algorithmic steps on the final outcome, especially when varying datasets and parameters. To address this issue, we developed a modular and common framework to develop, benchmark, and assemble the key computational steps that are used in state-of-the-art spike sorting algorithms. Relying on fast and efficient ground truth generation of biophysically plausible recordings, we show that we are able to individually benchmark and precisely quantify the performance of different steps in a spike sorting pipeline (peak detection, feature extraction and clustering, and template matching). We then leverage these results to create a modular component-based spike sorters that can outperform Kilosort4 on large and dense simulated recordings. In addition, we find that the major bottleneck of all modern spike sorting pipelines is in the physical motion of probes, regardless of the drift-correction strategy. The presented component-based spike sorting framework has the potential to foster community engagement in the field by lowering the barrier to contributions, and provides a flexible yet powerful framework to construct end-to-end spike sorting solutions.

">Transcriptomic profiling reveals neurophysiological gene candidates underlying vocal evolution in African clawed frogs</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiologists have discovered many mechanisms underlying the production of animal behaviors in specific species; these involve a collection of neuromuscular systems, neuronal membrane and neural network properties, as well as the hormones and neuromodulators known to modify them. However, the mechanistic basis of behavioral evolution is less well-studied, and causal links between differences in gene expression, cellular mechanisms and species-typical behaviors are rare. Vertebrate vocal behaviors are an excellent system for studying the evolution of behaviors because they are ancient, diverse and readily quantifiable. Xenopus frogs are particularly well-suited to the study of vocal evolution due to the temporal diversity of male advertisement calls between closely related species and the well-described vocal pattern generating circuitry. Here we focus on two species, X. laevis and X. petersii, that diverged 8.5 million years ago and produce advertisement calls with distinct timing. To begin bridging the gap between behavioral and mechanistic diversity in Xenopus vocal behaviors, we performed RNA sequencing of the parabrachial nucleus, a vocal premotor hindbrain area known to encode species-typical temporal patterns in X. laevis and X. petersii. We identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes between the two species, including many genes related to hormone signaling, neuromodulation, neuronal and synaptic functions, ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. We explore several testable hypotheses emerging from these results that may explain mechanisms by which candidate genes and gene families may contribute to vocal pattern differences between X. laevis and X. petersii.

">Temporal Phase Differences Encode Tactile Motion from Static Vibrotactile Inputs</a></h4>

              
                Motion perception in touch is traditionally attributed to spatially sequential stimulation or skin deformation caused by moving objects. Here, we demonstrate that directional tactile motion can instead be inferred purely from temporal phase differences between two spatially static vibrotactile inputs. Using psychophysical experiments in human participants (n = 54), we show that continuous vibrations delivered to separate fingertips, when offset in phase, evoke a robust and directionally consistent motion percept despite the absence of physical movement. Discrimination performance depended systematically on the temporal phase relationship between stimuli, following a sinusoidal relationship, consistent with a phase-based motion inference mechanism. Vibration amplitude had little influence on perceptual accuracy once stimuli exceeded detection threshold, although higher amplitudes modestly reduced response times. In contrast, envelope dynamics and spatial configuration significantly modulated performance: vibrations with exponential amplitude envelopes - reflecting the natural propagation of mechanical energy through a medium - enhanced phase sensitivity and sped responses, and bimanual stimulation across the two hands improved both accuracy and response time. These findings identify temporal phase integration as a fundamental mechanism for tactile motion perception, analogous to timing-based computations in auditory localisation and visual motion detection. Phase-coded vibrotactile stimulation therefore offers a minimal and efficient strategy for conveying directional motion in haptic interfaces without requiring spatial arrays or moving actuators.

">History-dependent ephaptic interactions in paired olfactory receptor neurons</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory sensing begins with the transduction of odors into receptor currents on the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In insects and many other arthropods, ORNs are grouped stereotypically in hair-like sensilla on the surface of olfactory organs, enabling mutual inhibition through non-synaptic 'ephaptic' interactions (NSIs). Given the electrical, and therefore virtually instantaneous, nature of NSIs, it has been hypothesized that they contribute to processing fast temporal elements of mixed odor plumes. Here, we present single sensillum recordings and computational modeling that characterize NSIs during short offset dual-odor stimulations in the olfactory sensilla of adult female Drosophila melanogaster. We find in the experiments that the magnitude of inhibition between co-housed ORNs cannot be predicted by their instantaneous activity (firing rate) alone. It is adaptation-dependent, with strong effects only occurring when the inhibited ORN is adapted. This limits the usefulness of NSIs for fast odor processing when ORNs lack time to adapt. We reproduced the observed phenomena in a computational model and use this model to explain how the adaptation-dependence of NSI-mediated inhibition arises from nonlinearities in neural responses. We conclude that NSIs are unlikely to support the encoding of fast temporal dynamics in mixed odor stimuli, instead contributing to slower peripheral processing, supporting roles such as novelty detection. More broadly, we demonstrate how the nonlinear interactions of fairly simple electrical components lead to non-intuitive results, offering insight into the longstanding debate around ephaptic interactions in other systems, such as the mammalian CNS.

">A Population Vector Model of Visual Working Memory for Real-World Scenes</a></h4>

              
                Visual working memory is essential for navigating through and interacting with complex real-world environments. It is therefore important to understand how natural visual inputs - characterized by complex contours, continuously varying feature gradients, and spatial relationships - are represented in working memory. However, most research in this field has focused on simplified arrays of discrete artificial objects, favoring experimental control and modeling simplicity over ecological validity. This has led to quantitative models of working memory that require inputs consisting of easily parsed objects defined by a single value along one or more simple feature dimensions. It is not clear how these models could be updated to represent complex, photograph-like scenes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a population vector model of working memory that was designed specifically for real-world scenes. This model represents a scene as a noisy vector of neural firing rates across one or more areas of the ventral pathway, as estimated by a deep neural network model. We show that this model can account for both variations in behavioral performance and patterns of brain activity in tasks that require storing naturalistic scenes in working memory. These results demonstrate the viability of our general modeling approach, setting the stage for more sophisticated models that can fully account for the storage of real-world scenes in working memory.

">A mathematical model of pathology progression in the TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease whose etiology is poorly understood and for which current treatments provide only modest control of symptoms. To better investigate the causes and progression of the disease, the transgenic TgF344-AD rat model has emerged as a crucial tool. In this paper, we collect observations on the accumulation of amyloid-{beta}, changes in neuronal density, and a decline in cognitive performance in TgF344-AD and wild-type rats. We develop a compartmental ordinary differential equation model and determine its parameters by fitting the output to the experimental observations. Our model simulations support the hypothesis that the accumulation of amyloid-{beta} leads to a rapid decline in neuronal density followed by a significant loss in memory and learning ability. Our mathematical model can provide a bridge between AD research in rodent models and the human condition of AD.

">Neural Signatures of Post-Decision Outcome Expectation and Evaluation in Human Sensorimotor Choice Behavior</a></h4>

              
                The concept of embodied sensorimotor decision-making proposes that processes implicated in evaluating sensory inputs and selecting appropriate motor actions unfold partly in cortical regions traditionally associated with movement planning and execution. Reinforcement learning models emphasize the role of reward prediction error (RPE) in optimizing action selection based on decision outcome feedback. However, most evidence for the existence of RPE signals locates them in midline frontal and parietal cortex, and comes from tasks with externally manipulated reward probabilities that create artificial prediction errors. Whether RPE signals are expressed in human cortical motor areas during deterministic (non-probabilistic) tasks remains unclear, and would provide further support for embodied decision-making. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study post-decision neural dynamics in a color discrimination task in selected cortical regions of interest (ROIs). Participants had to press buttons with their left or right index finger in response to checkerboard stimuli with different levels of color evidence for the correct choice. Outcomes were fully determined by participants' choices. Delayed auditory feedback veridically indicated whether their hand choice was correct or not. We observed a robust beta-band (15-29 Hz) rebound after correct outcome feedback, strongest in ventral and dorsal premotor, anterior cingulate and superior parietal ROIs as well as occipital and auditory ROIs, and weakest in the primary motor and somatosensory ROIs. Critically, the rebound magnitude after correct feedback scaled inversely with color evidence strength and associated decision error rates. It was minimal in strong-evidence trials (~0.1% errors) and maximal in weak-evidence trials (~34% errors), resembling a context-sensitive positive RPE signal that was strongest when a correct outcome was least expected. Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) post-feedback rebound increases in weak evidence trials were not as strong as in the beta band and appeared mainly in occipital, superior parietal and posterior cingulate ROIs. After the decision but before feedback, both beta and alpha band power showed sensitivity to the level of sensory evidence on which the decisions had been based, with reduced post-movement rebound or enhanced suppression in trials with weak evidence, suggestive of internally generated outcome expectations. Pre-feedback alpha rebound suppression was strongest in occipital, superior parietal and posterior cingulate ROIs. Pre-feedback beta rebound suppression was not as strong. Together, these findings reveal distinct beta- and alpha-band dynamics that reflect internal pre-feedback outcome expectations and feedback-driven RPE-like outcome assessments. They support distributed cortical mechanisms, including premotor, parietal and cingulate regions, in reward expectation, outcome evaluation, and adaptive control, highlighting a role for motor and associative cortices in embodied decision-making, performance monitoring, and flexible behavior under uncertainty.

">Temporal Dynamics of EEG Decoding for Continuously Changing Visual Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Multivariate analyses of M/EEG data are typically performed on neural responses time-locked to discrete stimulus onsets. Such designs usually reveal high decoding performance during the initial transient response (0-500 ms), which subsequently drops to a lower, sustained level. Here, we examined time-resolved EEG decoding of natural scene processing when scenes gradually enter the visual field without a clear onset. We created video sequences in which one scene category (e.g., a beach) smoothly transitioned into another category (e.g., a forest) by blending images from two categories into a single composite panorama and moving a square aperture across it. We then compared EEG decoding for the first scenes within the transitions, which appeared with a sudden onset, to the second scenes, which emerged gradually as the videos progressed. For the first scenes, we observed robust category decoding from 60 ms after onset with a clear peak structure. For the second scene, category decoding was markedly weaker and showed no discernable peak structure. Realigning the appearance of category-diagnostic content for the second scene using deep neural networks did not enhance decoding or recover a peak structure. Further, classifiers trained on the first scene generalized to the second, but with a broad, temporally diffuse pattern, indicating that the second scene did not engage the same hierarchical temporal cascade as the first. Together, these results demonstrate that sudden versus gradual onsets produce distinct temporal decoding dynamics. Insights from onset-based decoding studies, therefore, do not straightforwardly extend to continuous and free-flowing natural stimulation.

">Systemic AAV delivery of a calcium indicator in marmosets: functional validation in visual area MT</a></h4>

              
                Functional optical imaging in nonhuman primates provides an important complement to electrophysiological approaches in neuroscience research, but its broader use has been limited by challenges in achieving large-scale, homogeneous expression of genetically encoded reporters, and imaging accessibility in species with gyrencephalic brains with sulci and fissures (e.g., rhesus macaques). Specifically, conventional local intracortical viral injections are invasive and often produce spatially restricted or heterogeneous expression, constraining population-level analyses. Here, we show that systemic intravenous delivery of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid engineered for enhanced blood-brain barrier crossing, AAV.CAP-B10, supports robust and widespread expression of a calcium indicator CAaMP8s in the common marmoset. Intravenous delivery in two marmosets resulted in widespread cortical expression. Using a large cranial window over extrastriate visual area MT (and its satellite areas), we performed widefield single-photon imaging and two-photon cellular-resolution imaging in awake,behaving marmosets to functionally validate activity in this well studied primate visual-motion sensitive cortical area. Population level responses to visual motion and spatial organization measured with widefield imaging, as well as single-cell level motion direction tuning measured with two-photon imaging, were consistent with canonical properties of MT reported in previous electrophysiological studies. Quantitative analyses of lightsheet imaging after whole hemisphere brain clearing further confirmed the broad expression of GCaMP in both cortical and subcortical areas. Together, these results indicate that systemic delivery using AAV.CAP-B10 provides a minimally invasive approach for robust multi-scale functional optical imaging in awake, behaving marmosets.

">Impaired Associative Memory, Inference, and Theta Dynamics in Postictal Psychosis of Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Postictal psychosis (PIP) is a severe complication occurring in 2% of people with epilepsy (PWE) whose underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Although historically considered separate from other forms of psychosis, newer evidence demonstrates a shared genetic susceptibility. People with schizophrenia are typically impaired at both associative learning and inferring connections between overlapping associations. Successful associative encoding, retrieval, and inference can each be predicted by changes in frontotemporal theta band activity, which is impaired in rodent models and people with schizophrenia. Here, we recorded high-density scalp EEG from PWE with history of PIP and well-matched control participants while they undertook a memory inference task. We found that associative memory and inference were both impaired in the PIP group, despite no difference in item recognition. Moreover, we found disrupted theta activity during memory encoding and the retrieval of inferred associations in PWE with PIP that likely originated from the medial temporal and frontal lobes. These results suggest a pattern of behavioural deficits and altered neural dynamics common to both PIP and schizophrenia. Interpreted in conjunction with previous genetic studies, they may reflect shared neural mechanisms contributing to psychopathology in both conditions and argue that PIP is a model of more general psychoses.

">Oculomotor dance learning task: Implications for audio-visual cued spatial learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning dance of a motor sequence learning involves the coordination of both oculomotor and manual motor systems through the practiced repetition of a fixed sequence of actions, resulting in automatized execution of movement through habit learning. This study aims to address whether a sequence-based learning paradigm centered on the visual-motor system can feasibly be measured while listening to music (Bar and DeSouza 2016). It aims to develop a new visual-motor-based learning paradigm with music, potentially promoting neuroplasticity and creating new interventional tools, building upon prior research that shows behavioural and putative neural changes following dance-based neurorehabilitation in people with Parkinson's disease (Bearss et al. 2024). Eye movements of 10 participants (8 female, 2 male) were tracked using the Eyelink 1000 Plus system during a 68-second eye-dance sequence. The experiment consisted of a learning phase, where participants observed the sequence five times with 30-second breaks, and a performance phase, where they performed the sequence five times from memory on a grey screen without visual cues. Music was incorporated into both phases to aid memorization of the 4 spatial locations. After each performance, the participant was shown a visual reinforcer and asked for their thoughts on how well they executed the dance. A visual reinforcer flashes one of three different colours: red, yellow, or green. Each colour corresponds to how many steps in the dance a participant performed correctly, with key points being: under one third, between one to two thirds, and over two thirds of total steps correct. Participants were scored based on timing of the steps as well for exact (1.00), good (0.66), slightly off (0.33) or missed (0) steps. Data was analyzed using R4.3.1, MATLAB, and Experiment Builder: Data Viewer software. Results showed a significant improvement in performance accuracy between the first session (g1; M = 40%, SD = 7.2%) and the last session (g5; M = 69.7%, SD = 22.8%). A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of session on performance accuracy, F(4, 36) = 6.99, p < 0.001, 2G = 0.26, indicating that accuracy significantly improved over sessions. Post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons showed that accuracy in later sessions was significantly higher than earlier sessions, suggesting a defined learning curve and consolidation of performance pattern across repeated practice. Similarly, there was significant improvement in timing accuracy between the first session g1; M = 0.29, SD = 0.06) and the fifth session (g5; M = 0.46, SD = 0.12). A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of session on timing precision, F(4, 36) = 11.67, p < 0.001, 2G = 0.25, indicating significant improvements in temporal control and coordination over sessions. Post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons showed that timing precision significantly improved between early and late sessions (e.g, g1-g4, p <0.01; g1-g5, p < 0.001), suggesting a defined learning curve and increase in precision across repeated practice. These findings suggest that visual-motor-based interventions have the potential to enhance motor and non-motor symptoms like depression and anxiety for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disorder (PD). The results provide a foundation for developing targeted therapies that integrate learning paradigms to improve functional outcomes, warranting further exploration of their long-term efficacy.

">Can category-selective cortex predict categorisation behaviour?</a></h4>

              
                One of the distinctive features of the human visual system is the presence in occipito-temporal cortex (OTC) of regions that show preferential activation to specific categories of visual objects. To understand how this selectivity relates to categorisation behaviour, studies have employed a distance-to-bound approach (DTB), where multivariate brain activity is used to estimate a decision boundary, from which behavioural performance can be predicted. Using this approach, correlations have been found between activity in OTC, and behavioural performance when carrying out certain categorisation tasks. However, it remains unclear what determines where in OTC this correlations can be found, and with which categorisation tasks they can be found. Here, we bridged this gap by relating category selective regions of OTC, to behavioural performance while participants categorised images as belonging or not to their preferred categories. We adopted a more basic approach and considered simple, univariate activity, rather than relying on decoding to build our DTB. Our results show that activation in regions selective to faces (FFA & OFA), bodies (EBA), and scenes (PPA), is sufficient to predict behavioural performance while categorising images as being faces, bodies, or scenes, respectively. These results are largely consistent across reaction time and motor movements, and generalise to animacy classification. Overall, our data adds to evidence that category-selective regions in OTC can serve to guide categorisation behaviour, and underlines the validity of the DTB approach to address this relationship.

                The developed ISNAG-spectrofluorometric method of Etoricoxib determination is a novel approach, based on quenching of fluorescein fluorescence under interaction with the analyzed compound. In order to stabilize the emitted signal, low-pressure mercury lamp (LPML) as an excitation source and eight solar cells arranged at a 90° interval were used. As a result, the correlated signal is more sensitive and stable. The linear nature of the method in the 0.08-12 mmol/L range reflects a correlation coefficient of 0.9905 & R2 %= 98.10 which is a perfect linearity. The limit of detection was calculated as 0.61 μg/170μL while the limit of quantification as 1.83 μg/sample ensuring excellent trace detection of etoricoxib. The precision on RSD (relative percent standard deviation) scale was determined to be less than 0.5 % which reflects a high level of repeatability and reproducibility of the method. The proposed method was applied to commercial pharmaceutical formulation. In the following statistical experiment, both paired two-sided t-tests were employed. The strength of the proposed method in relation to the official references was an object for one test whereas the speed of the routine one as well as its decrease in reagents usage proportions was an object for another test. There was no significant difference in those tests which proves the applicability of the proposed method. Moreover, the precision of the novel method utilized less reagents, and a significant variation, forming a confidence level utilization was observed. In conclusion, the developed ISNAG-spectrofluorometric method of Etoricoxib determination proved to be a rapid, stable, accurate, and validated method suitable for routine investigation of commercial pharmaceutical formulations.

                Hyperspectral band selection has become a key focus in hyperspectral image processing as it reduces the spectral redundancy and computational overhead, thereby improving classification performance. However, optimal band selection remains challenging due to its combinatorial nature. Although numerous metaheuristic algorithms have been introduced in recent years to address this problem, achieving an effective balance between exploration and exploitation continues to pose a major challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines a parameter-free binary Jaya algorithm with a mutation operator to enhance exploration and maintain solution diversity within the search space. We employ Opposition-based Learning (OBL) for population initialization and Quasi-Reflection reinitialization strategy to add diversity whenever fitness stagnation occurs. To simultaneously improve classification performance and band reduction we adopt weighted sum multi-objective fitness function that minimizes redundancy and enhances model generalization. Our proposed method is evaluated using three benchmark datasets, namely Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas. Experimental results demonstrate that the pro-posed method outperforms recent metaheuristic-based band selection techniques. Its superior performance makes it well suited for various HSI applications.

Systems thinking, as it points out the links between parts of complex systems, is being seen as an important skill for managing issues such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and sustainability. Despite its importance, genetics is introduced differently in education around the world. Using Scopus data, we study the main contributors to this field, emerging research themes, and how different institutions are teaming up, with sustainability, STEM education, and interdisciplinary learning being areas that are gaining importance. This information highlights the need for international research partnerships and support for teachers to teach systems thinking and improve students’ skills to face real-life problems. The results can help improve how policymakers, educators, and researchers introduce systems thinking into classrooms.

                Background Precision medicine is an emerging approach that tailors treatments based on an individual’s genetic profile. The UAE has made significant strides in this field through initiatives like the National Genomics Strategy and the Emirati Genome Program. However, public awareness and engagement remain key challenges. Purpose This study assesses awareness, acceptance, and utilization of precision medicine among UAE residents. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a snowball sampling method. The survey collected demographic data, health status, knowledge, and experiences with precision medicine. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to analyze associations. Results Most participants (94.3%) were under 50 years old, 62.5% were female, and 60.0% held a bachelor’s degree. Awareness of precision medicine was moderate (55.3%), with higher familiarity among females and students. While 40% believed its main benefit was optimizing drug effectiveness, 38.5% viewed it as crucial for preventing adverse drug reactions. Family and friends (29.5%) were the primary sources of information, yet 25.5% had never heard of precision medicine. Awareness of insurance coverage was low, with 59.0% uncertain about their policy. Genetic testing participation was associated with education level (p < 0.05). Acceptance of precision medicine was higher among individuals with chronic illnesses (p = 0.004). Familiarity scores varied significantly by occupation (p < 0.001) and income (p = 0.004), with higher-income individuals showing greater awareness. Males had a broader range of practice scores (p = 0.003), and individuals with chronic conditions were more aware of precision medicine (p = 0.023). Conclusion Despite advancements, public engagement with precision medicine remains limited. Targeted educational initiatives, improved accessibility, and increased awareness of insurance coverage may enhance adoption and utilization.

                Background Since the building sector contributes significantly to carbon emissions, using sustainable materials is more crucial than ever. Mycelium is investigated in this study as a natural substitute for conventional insulation materials like rock wool and XPS. Its thermal performance has been evaluated in a residential building in New Cairo, Egypt, using Design-Builder simulations, paying particular attention to U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. The results demonstrate that mycelium is environmentally safe, biodegradable, and provides insulation that is comparable to XPS. This demonstrates its promise as a sustainable option for building in the future. Methods This research uses Design-Builder software version 7.3.0.046 integrated with Energy-Plus to simulate the thermal conductivity of mycelium compared to two of the most frequently utilized traditional materials for insulation in Egypt, in Janna Compound, New Cairo. The analysis examines energy consumption, thermal comfort, Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfaction (PPD%). The study provides a comparative evaluation of mycelium insulation compared to traditional materials like XPS and Rockwool. Results According to the simulation results, mycelium insulation performs comparably to XPS regarding U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. Specifically, mycelium achieved a 0.323 U-value, reduced discomfort hours percentage to 16.9%, and achieved a ratio of energy reduction of 15.8% compared to the base case. These results demonstrate how mycelium has the potential to compete with traditional insulation materials while offering significant sustainability advantages, such as biodegradability and a lower carbon footprint. Conclusion In Janna Compound, New Cairo, the research shows how mycelium insulation can improve thermal comfort and save energy usage. It performs similarly to XPS but has more positive environmental effects. These results support the integration of mycelium into Egypt’s sustainable housing practices, providing key insights for architects, developers, and policymakers focused on energy-efficient and sustainable urban development.

We then examined an advanced AD case with postmortem MRI and coregistered whole-brain phospho-tau staining for evidence of sulcal tau distribution in AD. Finally, in a sample of 187 cognitively unimpaired young and older adults with resting-state functional MRI, we examined connectivity strength between tau-vulnerable regions and the hippocampus across adulthood, prior to disease-related cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our findings revealed that tau-related cortical thinning predominantly occurs in sulcal regions, especially the deepest parts. Postmortem histology confirmed preferential tau accumulation in sulcal depths. Additionally, connectivity analyses revealed that, across adulthood, these primarily sulcal regions most susceptible to tau-related thinning also have stronger connectivity to the hippocampus, suggesting a role for network connectivity in the vulnerability of sulci to the effects of tau pathology later in life.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings support the hypothesis that sulci, and particularly their depths, represent structurally and functionally vulnerable regions for tau deposition in AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this sulcal vulnerability provides insight into general principles driving regional susceptibility to pathology, and sheds light on the detrimental functional and cognitive effects of tau pathology.

                Background The burden of visual impairment and avoidable blindness has been attributed to the shortage and poor distribution of adequately trained eye care personnel. In the district health system, primary health care (PHC) nurses are the first point of contact for eye care patients. To provide adequate eye care, the nurses in PHC clinics apply their knowledge on basic eye health to ensure best practices and management for patients that present at their clinics. Anecdotal evidence regarding the knowledge and practices of these PHC professionals is scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PHC nurses’ knowledge and practices on eye health. Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural district of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. Stratified random sampling was used to select 28 from the 74 PHC clinics in the district. A researcher-administered questionnaire using a 5-point likert scale with options strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree and strongly agree, was developed, piloted and finalised for this study. The tool had four sections: demographic information, knowledge of eye health, practices on evaluating visual function and identification and management of presenting eye conditions. Data were collected, captured onto MSXcel, cleaned, coded and analysed descriptively, and for Chi-squared significance at 95%, using R statistical software. Results From 200 responses, 86.4% (n=172) were females of the African race. Most (93.5%, n=187) had never undergone formal training in eye care. Only 28% (n=56) correctly identified a mature cataract while 28% (n=56) correctly identified signs of glaucoma; the global leading causes of preventable blindness. A total of 94% (n=188) failed to accurately measure visual acuity on a patient. Conclusions PHC nurses showed poor knowledge and practices of common eye conditions. There is an urgent need for eye health training for PHC nurses, and the clear management protocols on eye care.

                Background Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is one of the microvascular complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) which tended not to be detected early, necessitating more effective biomarkers for its detection. HbA1c showed a negative correlation with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and was significantly associated with an increased urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), thereby influencing the progression of DKD. Objective This study was an untargeted metabolomics study and aimed to compare the urinary metabolites of low DKD risk T2DM patients with controlled and uncontrolled HbA1c in patients taking metformin-glimepiride. Materials and Methods This study conducted as a cross-sectional study using non-probability sampling at Pasar Minggu District Health Center, 32 samples were divided into controlled (n=16) and uncontrolled HbA1c groups (n=16). Blood samples were collected for HbA1c and eGFR measurements, while urine samples were analyzed for UACR and metabolites. Analysis was performed using LC/MS-QTOF and the data was processed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0 and various databases. The discrimination results of the two groups were visualized through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). The significance of metabolites between groups was selected with the parameters VIP>1, log2(FC)>1.2, and p-value<0.05. Results Fifteen selected metabolites underwent metabolic pathway analysis and were evaluated for their potential as biomarkers. Three of these metabolites showed potential as biomarkers (AUC>0.65): oxaloacetate and 5′-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamidine, which decreased in the uncontrolled HbA1c group, and (S)-dihydroorotate, which increased in the uncontrolled HbA1c group. The involved metabolic pathways included (1) alanine, aspartate, and glutamate, (2) citric acid (Krebs cycle), (3) gluconeogenesis, (4) pyruvate, (5) pyrimidine, and (6) purine. Conclusion Based on these results, there’s a significant difference in urine metabolites of the two groups that potentially be the biomarkers for DKD progression with controlled and uncontrolled HbA1c.

                Background Plectranthus amboinicus is an aromatic herb known for its medicinal properties and is increasingly explored for cosmetic applications. Its bioactive compounds possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a promising candidate for multifunctional skincare formulations. Methods This study investigated the extraction of bioactive compounds from P. amboinicus leaves using microwave-assisted ethanol extraction. Two drying techniques—tray drying and freeze-drying—were compared to evaluate their impact on the extraction efficiency. The optimal extract (PF15), prepared using 15-minute microwave extraction and freeze-drying, was selected for further analysis. Bioactive content was assessed through quantification of caffeic acid, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity via the DPPH assay. The antimicrobial activity of PF15 was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Cutibacterium acnes. Anti-inflammatory potential of PF15 was evaluated in LPS-stimulated human THP-1 macrophages by measuring cytokine production. Results The PF15 extract yielded the highest levels of bioactive compounds and demonstrated strong antioxidant activity. It exhibited significant antimicrobial effects against all tested skin pathogens. In the anti-inflammatory assay, PF15 significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) while upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The extract was formulated into a topical cream, which underwent accelerated stability testing over six heat-cool cycles. The cream remained stable with no signs of phase separation, discoloration, odor change, or microbial contamination, and maintained a pH of 5.5. Conclusions The PF15 extract of P. amboinicus demonstrates potent antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its successful incorporation into a stable cream formulation supports its potential as a multifunctional active ingredient in skincare products. These findings highlight P. amboinicus as a valuable natural source for the development of cosmetic formulations targeting oxidative stress, microbial infection, and inflammation.

                Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was isolated from the marine sponge Melophlus sarasinorum collected in Indonesia. The crude extracts of this strain displayed antibacterial and cytotoxic activity, and therefore, to further investigate the bioactive potential of the strain, whole genome sequencing was performed in this study. The whole genome sequencing of Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was conducted using both Illumina NextSeq and Oxford Nanopore platforms with a de novo hybrid assembly approach. The high-quality genome obtained is 10.23 Mbp with a GC content of 71.57%. It is organised into a single chromosomal contig, two linear plasmids, and one circular plasmid. Interestingly, a long-terminal inverted repeat (L-TIR) sequence of 1.5 Mbp has been confirmed in the strain genome. Phylogenomic analysis suggested that the strain BTA 1-131 likely represents a new species within the genus Streptomyces. To the best of our knowledge, the genome data described here would be the first report on the hybrid genome sequence of Streptomyces associated with the rarely reported sponge Melophlus sarasinorum from Indonesia, with a unique feature of L-TIR. The complete genome data generated here will provide compelling information for further analysis of the biosynthetic potential of the strain BTA 1-131 to produce new bioactive compounds.

                Background The current study attempts to fill a significant and crucial deficiency in knowing how to trigger the digital footprints for enhancing service quality from the customers’ point of view among Internet service providers as well, especially under the Iraqi environment, Mosul city, Nineveh Governorate. The sector is in a unique competitive situation, and although this strategic function of digital data is extremely critical for personalization initiatives as well as for competitive advantage, very little practical use has been made in such an environment. Indeed, metrics such as (data governance maturity and customer trust) emerged as challenges impacting the use of data analytics and their integration into the improvement of customer experience. As such, this study seeks to understand how local Internet service providers (ISPs) can be empowered by individual customers’ digital footprints, evaluate what influences their most effective use in order to enhance customer experience, and discover best explorations for guidance on appropriate and ethical strategies. Methodology The method data were collected from (ISPs) using a structured questionnaire, issued to a representative sample of ISP and overall number of (319). Results However, the results obtained using statistical analysis indicate that while digital footprints significantly enhance service personalization and support efficiency, there is a substantial implementation gap between data collection and its application to design value-adding interactions. This, in turn, suggests a need to strengthen the analysis capacity of service providers. Conclusion This paper ends with an insight; for Internet service providers to facilitate customer digital footprints and the digital data left by customers to enhance the quality of services, they must adopt a balanced, evidence-based strategy as well as transparent consideration of privacy concerns that sustain user trust.

                Background Recently, health professional education uses visual art observation to promote various observation-related technical skills. This article maps the studies on such interventions, scrutinizes what they measured as observational skills, and discusses their effectiveness. Methods Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, a scoping review was conducted. Publications from 2001 on were identified by searching four databases and by hand searching. The author screened each publication using the pre-designed eligibility criteria: participants were novice healthcare learners enrolled in visual art observation training; the study aimed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on technical skills related to observation; the skills were objectively measured. The author extracted relevant information from the included papers without additional inquiry into the study authors. The extracted information was illustrated in both a tabular and descriptive format. Results 3,157 publications were identified, of which 18 articles were included. Few studies had valid and reliable experiments. The relatively valid evidence is that the participants listed more elements or signs for artistic or medical images. Conclusions Sound evidence is lacking for all the technical skills intended to be fostered. Observation skills for artistic images have not been demonstrated to transfer to technical skills. Nor do the studies show that they promoted accurate diagnoses and reduced misdiagnoses. Additionally, the evidence on verbalizing skills is not isolated from the impact of discussions and is unclear regarding its transfer to actual communication. For the others, there are not enough valid studies on technical skills. This is true for studies that directly examine promoting accurate diagnosis or reducing misdiagnosis. Moreover, there may be promising alternatives to visual art observations for cultivating such technical skills, but no comparative studies were conducted.

                Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving differential equations, yet their efficiency is often hindered by the need for intricate and computationally costly loss-balancing techniques to address residual term imbalance. This paper introduces a direct differential equation term scaling framework that removes the loss-balancing bottleneck entirely. By scaling each term in the governing equations using characteristic physical dimensions, the proposed method ensures numerical consistency across all contributions, eliminating the need for adaptive weighting during training. This not only simplifies the PINN formulation but also improves stability and convergence. The approach is validated on challenging nonlinear one-dimensional elasticity problems, demonstrating that high-accuracy solutions can be obtained with compact neural network architectures and reducing floating-point operations by at least two orders of magnitude. A reverse scaling step restores the solution to the original physical domain, preserving physical interpretability. Unlike existing approaches that modify the loss function during training, the proposed framework operates directly at the level of the governing equations, prior to loss construction. The results demonstrate that direct term scaling transforms PINN training into an efficient, and easily deployable process, paving the way for broader adoption in computational mechanics and other physics-driven domains.

                Background Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), such as methandienone, are synthetic testosterone derivatives that are widely used for the enhancement of physical performance and the growth of muscles. This study looked at the effect of methandienone on ovarian CYP19A1 gene expression and oxidative status in rabbits. The work also examined whether supplementation with selenium could reduce the adverse effects caused by methandienone. Methods Twenty healthy adult female rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups and maintained under uniform management for 30 days. The groups included a control, a methandienone-treated group (T1), a selenium group (T2), and a combined methandienone plus selenium group (T3). Serum oestrogens concentrations were measured using standard biochemical techniques. CYP19A1 mRNA expression in ovarian tissue and markers were quantified by established molecular and biochemical protocols. Results Rabbits receiving methandienone alone (T1) showed a significant decline (P≤0.05) in CYP19A1 mRNA expression and serum oestrogens when compared with the control and other treatment groups. Selenium supplementation (T2) produced marked increases in both parameters relative to G1 and G3, indicating a robust corrective effect. Oxidative stress analysis revealed elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl content (PCC) in the T1 group, consistent with increased oxidative stress. Intermediate oxidative stress values were observed in the T3 group, exceeding those in the T1 group but remaining below those in the T2 group. Conclusion Methandienone appears to impair ovarian function by suppressing CYP19A1gene expression and promoting oxidative stress, leading to reduced steroidogenic activity. Selenium administration mitigates these disturbances by enhancing antioxidant defense and partially restoring gene expression and oestrogens levels. These findings highlight the potential of selenium as a supportive intervention against methandienone -induced oxidative and hormonal disruptions in rabbits.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 infection is novel and widespread globally, causing a range of illness severity. The impacts on the liver from SARS-CoV-2 are variable and appear unpredictable. Objective In the weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection, liver-related blood tests are abnormal in patterns different than in matched controls without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods This was a retrospective study of health administrative data of individuals in Ontario, Canada between January 2020 and September 2022. Cases were individuals with their first positive COVID-19 test with at least one liver-related blood test (AST, ALT, albumin, INR, bilirubin) available in the following 28 days. Two control individuals (with a negative COVID-19 test) were age/sex matched to each case. Any patients with a diagnostic code indicting pre-existing liver disease, or a positive COVID-19 test in the preceding six months were excluded. Machine learning analysis approaches included logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), and neutral network models. Results 100,574 cases and 200,709 matched controls were included. 49% (49,299) had at least one abnormal liver test in 28 days following positive COVID-19 test. Of the controls, 41% (82,495) had at least one abnormal liver test in the 28 days following negative COVID-19 test. The optimal machine learning model used XGBoost for adult cases, with an area under the curve of 0.74. Conclusions Further studies could use this approach to create monitoring systems to use abnormalities like liver enzyme changes, at a population level, as a bellwether for not only COVID-19 outbreaks, but also other hepatotropic illness epidemics, and pandemics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-113/v1?src=rss">Experiences of Indonesian Christian Religious Education Teachers in Implementing the Independent Curriculum in Sen-ior High Schools: A Phenomenological Approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study explores the experiences of Christian religious education teachers in implementing the independent curriculum. The independent curriculum in Indonesia was developed as a more adaptive curriculum framework as part of the learning reform initiative, focusing on essential materials and the development of students’ character and skills. The government explains that the main characteristics of this curriculum that support learning recovery are project-based learning, which develops soft skills and character. Methods This study employs a qualitative phenomenological approach to examine how Christian religious education teachers engage with the independent curriculum. Given that the research questions focused on the subjective experiences of Christian religious education teachers, data were collected through semi-structured and in-depth interviews with four selected participants, chosen based on the study’s objectives and a purposive sampling approach in North Tapanuli Regency, Indonesia. Results The study revealed that teachers encountered several challenges, including IT skills gaps, differences in understanding the concept of independent curriculum, and the scarcity of relevant materials for Christian education. Teachers need help adapting to the limitations of old learning methods and the special training and mentoring required to implement the new technology system of the independent curriculum. However, there are initiatives from teachers to collaborate, add materials, and learn from the teacher community to improve their competence. Therefore, this study ultimately offers a new perspective on understanding a phenomenon, namely, the experiences of Christian religious education teachers in implementing the independent curriculum. Conclusion This study emphasizes the importance of more comprehensive support from the government and schools to enhance the effectiveness of implementing the independent curriculum, especially in Christian religious education. This study offers valuable insights for policymakers and education practitioners to support the effective and sustainable implementation of the independent curriculum.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-112/v1?src=rss">Experimental study For improving sandy soil against uplift capacity by Emulsion Asphalt for Anchor plate [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The use of anchors fixed in sandy soil is currently pioneering, especially in fixing the sides of excavations or marine structures, and even in engineering structures exposed to lateral loads. Therefore, there is a need to use improvements to develop the bearing capacity of anchors, whether single or group, or even if their burial depth is shallow or deep, as is the case with other engineering structures. Method A physical model was used in this experimental research to study the behavior of anchors individually and collectively in sandy soil and how to change the critical depth of burial from shallow depth to deep depth individually and collectively with anchors in addition to the upward bearing capacity in the soil without improvement and also using electronic measuring devices to measure the vertical displacement, and then using bituminous emulsion and recording the values of the uplift bearing capacity of the anchors and comparing them with natural soil. Results In this paper model tests were carried out by using single and line groups square anchor plates (1x2), (1x3), (1x4) & (1x5) in sandy soil with (30) different embedded ratio (H/D) test to understand the behavior of the anchor plate in sandy soils depending upon on the transition from shallow to deep anchor, also to obtain the transitional depth by which the anchor acts as a shallow or deep while in loading state. Depending on the tests the critical depth in the line group ranges from (5D) to (6D), while using a single anchor the critical depth is approximately more than (5D). The other (10) tests were carried out for improving the soil around the anchor by emulsion asphalt at depth (2D) & (6D) shallow and deep respectively. The optimum ratio of the emulsion asphalt was from (4-6)% by direct shear and unconfined pressure tests. The ultimate capacity was improved at high ratio for shallow single anchor than deep single anchor. The use of asphalt emulsion with a 21-day curing period resulted in an increase in the uplift capacity of both the individual anchors and the group. On the other hand, the uplift capacity of the anchor was increased with the use of asphalt emulsion with a 21-day curing period. Furthermore, the uplift capacity of the individual anchor was lower than that of the group of anchors, while the improvement in the shallow anchors resulted in a higher increase in uplift capacity than the deep anchors. Conclusions After conducting laboratory experiments on sandy soil with anchors installed in it and at different depths, it was found that there is a critical depth for the anchors at which the depth moves from shallow to deep. Also, the improvement with bituminous emulsion led to an increase in the load-bearing capacity of the anchors when lifting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-111/v1?src=rss">Exploring the Relationship Between Decreased Sound Tolerance and Neural Attention Processing: An ERP Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Decreased sound tolerance (DST) is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study examined how attentional control resources influence DST. Previous studies have shown that increasing cognitive load enhances the brain activity component (N100) to task-irrelevant noise. We hypothesized that individuals with DST would be more sensitive to cognitive load, showing a greater increase in their neural responses to noise as cognitive load increases. Because DST comprises multiple subjective symptoms, we analyzed the associations with specific symptoms. Methods Thirteen adults with ASD and twenty-two adults without ASD participated in the study. Participants who self-reported auditory hypersensitivity were classified as the DST group. All participants completed a DST questionnaire with six subscales: excessive loudness, ear pain, fear, annoyance, attention control, and attention to detail. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by task-irrelevant noise were analyzed during an auditory n-back task. The n-back task included a low (1-back) and a high (2-back) cognitive load condition. Results The prevalence of self-reported DST was significantly higher in the ASD group than in controls. Individuals who reported DST also tended to experience other types of sensory hypersensitivity. Attentional functions were associated with fear, annoyance, and loudness perception of sounds, and ear pain appeared to function independently of other DST symptoms. Scores for attentional control difficulties related to DST did not correlate with performance on the n-back task, which reflects susceptibility to noise interference. Contrary to previous findings, N100 amplitude did not differ between task-load conditions and did not vary according to the presence of DST. P200 amplitude was larger in the 1-back than in the 2-back condition but did not differ by ASD diagnosis or DST status. Conclusions The presence of DST or ASD was not associated with cognitive capacity or with the auditory processing of task-irrelevant noise.

                Zhang et al. reveal that ZDHHC12-mediated palmitoylation negatively regulates PARP1-DNA binding and suppresses PARP1 trapping by PARP inhibitors. Blocking PARP1 palmitoylation enhances PARP inhibitor sensitivity in ovarian cancer models and overcomes resistance conferred by patient-derived PARP1 mutations (R138C/R591C), revealing a targetable therapeutic vulnerability.

                <p>Episodic timing refers to the one-shot, automatic encoding of temporal information in the brain, in the absence of attention to time. A previous magnetoencephalography (MEG) study showed that the relative burst time of spontaneous alpha oscillations (&alpha;) during quiet wakefulness was a selective predictor of retrospective duration estimation. This observation was interpreted as &alpha; embodying the "ticks" of an internal contextual clock. Herein, we replicate and extend these findings using electroencephalography (EEG), assess robustness to time-on-task effects, and test the generalizability in virtual reality (VR) environments. In three EEG experiments, 128 participants of either sex underwent 4&nbsp;min eyes-open resting-state recordings followed by an unexpected retrospective duration estimation task. Experiment 1 tested participants before any tasks, Experiment 2 after 90&nbsp;min of timing tasks, and Experiment 3 in VR environments of different sizes. We successfully replicated the original MEG findings in Experiment 1 but did not in Experiment 2. We explain the lack of replication through time-on-task effects (changes in &alpha; power and topography) and contextual changes yielding a cognitive strategy based on temporal expectation (supported by a fast passage of time). In Experiment 3, we did not find the expected duration underestimation in VR and did not replicate the correlation between &alpha; bursts and retrospective time estimates. Overall, while EEG captures the &alpha; burst marker of episodic timing, its reliability depends critically on experimental context. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling experimental context when using &alpha; bursts as a neural marker of episodic timing.</p>

                With increasing concern about the environmental and social impacts of the food industry, sustainability has become a central focus of scientific research. To better understand how this field has evolved, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify publication trends, key themes, and emerging topics. The analysis was based on data from Scopus and Web of Science and examined the evolution of scientific output related to sustainability in the food industry. Methods included keyword co-occurrence analysis, assessments of country and author productivity, and thematic evolution analysis. In addition, a Cartesian framework was used to classify key terms according to their relevance and recency. The results show an exponential growth in scientific output, with notable increases in 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023, reaching a statistical significance of 99.65%. Three main country clusters were identified, with the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy standing out for their productivity and impact. At the author level, Mangla and Luthra were the most productive, while Land, Beske, and Van Der Vorst had the greatest impact on the field. Thematic evolution analysis revealed a transition from early research focused on “soil erosion” to more recent themes such as “circular economy,” “supply chain management,” “food safety,” and “wastewater treatment.” The keyword co-occurrence network identified seven thematic clusters, with the most prominent cluster centered on “sustainability,” “waste management,” and “short supply chain.” Emerging topics included “Covid-19,” “blockchain,” and the “agri-food sector.” Overall, the study demonstrates a clear evolution and diversification of sustainability research in the food industry, underscoring the importance of emerging topics and international collaboration. It also proposes a multidisciplinary research agenda that prioritizes food security, sustainable agriculture, and supply chain management, and emphasizes the integration of innovative technologies to address current environmental, economic, and social challenges.

                Background Ruminal impaction is a serious digestive disorder in sheep, leading to systemic metabolic acidosis and, as a consequence, widespread physiological disturbances. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate biochemical, electrolyte and oxidative parameters in a local Iraqi sheep that was suffering from ruminal impaction. Methods A case control study was performed in 20 adult female sheep (Awassi sheep breeder) (10 ruminal impaction and 10 control) diagnosed with in Fallujah, Iraq, based on clinical signs and confirmed by laboratory findings of hyperkalaemia. The control group consisted of sheep of age, sex and weight consistent with clinically normal sheep. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected, and serum was analyzed for electrolytes, biochemical and oxidative markers using established laboratory methods. Results The impacted animals showed significant increases (P≤0.05) in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), glucose, urea, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate and significant decreases (P≤0.05) in albumin, cholesterol, sodium, chloride, and calcium levels, where serum level of magnesium did not show any significant difference between the groups. In addition, oxidative stress was present as there was a significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Background These findings indicate a pathogenesis cascade whereby ingestion of poorly digested food causes ruminal stasis, systemic acidosis, liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, electrolyte disturbances, oxidative stress and oxidative stress. Using a single biomarker may underestimate the true severity of the disease, while combining biochemical, electrolyte and oxidative measurements provides a more complete picture.

                Microalgae are increasingly recognized as sustainable green cell factories capable of producing a various high-value bioactive compounds. Among them, the red microalga Porphyridium purpureum stands out for its unique ability to secrete sulfated exopolysaccharides (sEPS)—complex macromolecules enriched with sulfate and uronic acid groups that exhibit potent biological activities. These compounds function as natural antioxidants, immunomodulators, and antimicrobial agents, attracting substantial interest from the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and functional food industries. A targeted literature search was conducted across the Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases to identify studies focusing on the extraction, structural characterization, and applications of sulfated exopolysaccharides from Porphyridium purpureum between 2015 and 2025. Recent research has demonstrated rapid advancements in environmentally friendly extraction technologies, including membrane filtration, three-phase partitioning (TPP), ultrasound-assisted TPP (UATPP), and deep eutectic solvents (DES), which collectively enhance the yield, purity, and preserve the biological functionality of sEPS. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in structural and mechanistic elucidation through advanced analytical and imaging techniques such as two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, FTIR, methylation analysis, and transcriptomic profiling. These approaches have clarified how cultivation parameters and environmental stressors influence EPS biosynthesis, sulfation patterns, and biological activity. Overall, this review provides an integrated and forward-looking perspective on the scientific advances and technological challenges surrounding P. purpureum sEPS, outlining future directions toward sustainable bioprocessing and industrial valorization of these high-value biomacromolecules.

                <p>by Tengfei Ji, Bo Yang, Meng Wang, Hong Ji, Huazhe Yang, Yizhuo Liu</p>

Spatial transcriptomics enables the measurement of gene expression in intact tissues. Despite this, reconstructing anatomically accurate spatial domains remains challenging, primarily due to expression sparsity, complex tissue architecture that is characterized by sharp boundaries and long-range continuity, and weak spatial signals. Traditional pipelines typically rely on expression-driven clustering and spatial smoothing, which underperform at boundaries and in sparse regions while neglecting morphological information. To address these challenges, AugGCL is proposed, an augmented graph-convolutional learning framework that enhances spatial structure decoding and gene expression reconstruction through targeted augmentation of both gene and image data. A key component of AugGCL is neighborhood information aggregation mechanism, which integrates expression similarity and spatial proximity to construct a weighted graph and an enhanced expression matrix, addressing sparsity without sacrificing boundary clarity. Additionally, a two stream weighted graph convolutional network jointly models refined gene features and image-derived morphological information, with image-aware auxiliary reconstructions enhancing weak spatial signals and sharpening boundaries. On datasets from the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, breast cancer, and mouse embryo, AugGCL outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics, showing robustness and generalization across a range of datasets. Downstream analysis validated the reliability of the method, confirming its effectiveness in cell annotation, functional enrichment, and mechanistic studies. AugGCL generates clearer spatial domains and significantly advances the application of spatial transcriptomics in tissue structure and disease research.

                <p>by Haneol Cho, Junho Lee, Sean Lawler, Yangjin Kim</p>

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer with the very poor survival and high recurrence rate. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play a pivotal role in regulation of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we developed a new mathematical model of the critical GBM-TAN interaction in the heterogeneous brain tissue. The model reveals that the dual and complex role of TANs (either anti-tumorigenic N1 and the pro-tumorigenic N2 type) regulates the phenotypic trajectory of the evolution of tumor growth and the invasive patterns in white and gray matter via mediators such as IFN-<i>β</i> and TGF-<i>β</i>. We investigated the effect of normalizing the immune environment on glioma growth by applying a therapeutic antibody and developed several strategies for eradication of tumor cells by neutrophil-mediated transport of nanoparticles. We also developed a strategy of combination therapy (surgery + Trojan neutrophils) for effective control of the infiltration of the glioma cells in one hemisphere before crossing the corpus callosum (CC) in order to prevent recurrence in the other hemisphere. This alternative approach compared to the extended resection of the glioma including CC or butterfly GBM may provide the greater anti-tumor efficacy and reduce side effects such as cognitive impairment.

                <p>by Daniel Shani, Peter Dayan</p>

Egocentric representations of the environment have historically been relegated to being used only for simple forms of spatial behaviour such as stimulus-response learning. However, in the many cases that critical aspects of policies are best defined relative to the self, egocentric representations can be advantageous. Furthermore, there is evidence that forms of egocentric representation might exist in the wider hippocampal formation. Nevertheless, egocentric representations have yet to be fully incorporated as a component of modern navigational methods. Here we investigate egocentric successor representations (SRs) and their combination with allocentric representations. We build a reinforcement learning agent that combines an egocentric SR with a conventional allocentric SR to navigate complex 2D environments. We demonstrate that the agent learns generalisable egocentric and allocentric value functions which, even when only additively composed, allow it to learn policies efficiently and to adapt to new environments quickly. Our work shows the benefit for egocentric relational structure to be captured, as well as allocentric. We offer a new perspective on how cognitive maps could usefully be composed from multiple simple maps representing associations between state features defined in different reference frames.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003616">The conserved outer mitochondrial membrane protein Mtch regulates mitophagy during Drosophila intestinal development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lucas J. Restrepo, Jasmine K. Graslie, Tina M. Fortier, Eric H. Baehrecke</p>

The clearance of mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy) is important for cell health. Mutations in genes that are required for mitophagy, including <i>Vps13D</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, and <i>Parkin</i>, are associated with movement disorders, but gaps exist in our understanding of how Vps13D regulates mitophagy. Here, we identify Mtch (MTCH2 in humans) as a regulator of mitophagy based on a relationship with Vps13D during developmentally programmed mitophagy in <i>Drosophila</i> intestine enterocyte cells. Similar to <i>Vps13D</i> mutant cells, <i>Mtch</i> mutant cells fail to clear mitochondria and possess elevated markers of autophagy. Genetic and molecular experiments reveal that Mtch and Vps13D function in a mitophagy pathway with PINK1, Parkin, and the mitophagy receptor BNIP3. Unlike <i>Vps13D</i> and <i>Parkin</i> mutant cells, <i>Mtch</i> is required for proper expression of the tail-anchored protein BNIP3. Thus, the tail-anchored protein insertase function of Mtch/MTCH2 likely explains how these proteins possess multiple cell context-specific functions.

                <p>by Yanhua Zhao, Meiting Zhang, Yan You, Jinrong Zhang, Yuning Ji, Lei Lei</p>

Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a valuable tool in regenerative medicine, yet its efficiency remains limited by epigenetic reprogramming barriers that have been partially corrected by global regulation of epigenetic enzymes. However, these approaches lack gene locus specificity and may disrupt normal gene regulation. Therefore, new strategies capable of broadly enhancing reprogramming fidelity are needed. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the pioneer transcription factor Nr5a2 in mouse SCNT embryos improves both zygotic genome activation and the morula-to-blastocyst transition, two major developmental barriers in SCNT, and enhances birth rates. Mechanistically, Nr5a2 recruits P300 to increase H3K27ac at genes with low expression, restoring transcriptional activity and promoting SCNT embryo development.

                <p>by Dinh Nhan Lai, Xi Yang, Chong Xie, Ting Li, An Yan, Xing Liu, Yun Zhou</p>

Land plants alternate between generations of asexual sporophytes and sexual gametophytes. Unlike seed plants, ferns produce free-living gametophytes that grow independently from their sporophytes. Gametophytes of the model fern <i>Ceratopteris</i> exist in two sex types: hermaphrodites and males. Hermaphrodites maintain meristems and secrete the pheromone antheridiogen, inducing undecided gametophytes to become males. In the absence of antheridiogen, males exhibit developmental plasticity and dynamic cell fate specification by initiating de novo meristems to convert into hermaphrodites. Despite its essential role, the molecular signals governing this process remain unclear. Here, we show that local auxin biosynthesis, dynamically regulated during sex-type conversion, establishes new auxin maxima that are critical for specifying and promoting the proliferation of the meristem progenitor cell (MPC) lineage, ultimately enabling the de novo formation of a multicellular meristem from a single MPC. Time-lapse imaging revealed that upon antheridiogen removal, auxin signaling is specifically activated at the initial site of proliferation in <i>Ceratopteris</i> males, triggering new meristem formation. This auxin signaling subsequently becomes concentrated at the center of the proliferating meristem, aligning with localized auxin biosynthesis and the emergence of the meristem notch. Computationally reconstrued lineage maps further showed that chemical inhibition of CrTAA1 abolishes these dynamic auxin patterns, blocking MPC lineage initiation and its subsequent proliferation. Furthermore, genetic knockout of <i>CrTAA1</i> via CRISPR-Cas9 phenocopies the effects of chemical inhibition, preventing new meristem formation and disrupting male-to-hermaphrodite conversion. Together, these findings uncover a molecular mechanism underlying sex-type conversion in land plants and highlight the pivotal role of de novo auxin biosynthesis in orchestrating cell fate and proliferation during meristem formation.

                <p>Cladribine tablets are approved for relapsing multiple sclerosis, mediating their clinical effect by moderately depleting lymphocytes. In a prospective, monocentric study including 22 patients completing 2 annual cycles of cladribine, B- and T-cell receptor repertoires and relapse activity were assessed at baseline and after 24 months. T-cell clonality increased, driven by loss of low-frequency, naive clonotypes, and re-expansion of dominant CD8 memory clonotypes, particularly in clinically stable patients. In contrast, B-cell receptor richness increased because of reconstruction by transitional and naive B cells with higher clonotype numbers observed in relapsing patients. Therefore, competing immune reconstitution following cladribine therapy could result in differential clinical responses. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Background The effectiveness of information systems in enhancing user performance is influenced by various factors, including system quality, service quality, and user satisfaction. Perceived Organizational Support (POS) has been proposed as a moderator in this relationship, though its impact remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the moderating role of POS on the relationship between system quality, service quality, and user performance, specifically in the context of Approweb, an information system used by account representatives at the Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) in Jakarta. Methods A quantitative research approach with an explanatory design was adopted to examine causal relationships among the variables. The theoretical framework was based on the DeLone and McLean Information System Success Model (2003), with POS incorporated from the socio-technical perspective. Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey from 329 Account Representatives (ARs) using a probability sampling method Results The study found that both system quality and service quality significantly influence user satisfaction and user performance. Moreover, POS was found to significantly moderate the relationship between system quality, service quality, and user performance, enhancing the positive effects of both quality dimensions on performance. These results suggest that organizational support is a key factor in maximizing the benefits of information systems. Conclusions The findings confirm the critical role of system quality, service quality, and POS in improving user performance. POS was shown to amplify the positive effects of both system and service quality, indicating that users are more likely to perform effectively when they perceive strong organizational support. The study contributes to the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model by incorporating POS as a moderating factor and emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to system success that integrates both technical and social dimensions.

                Background Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus must monitor their Blood Glucose (BG) to continually control their glycemia. They had to undergo a blood test at least twice a day using a finger prick, and must visit a laboratory every three months for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the constitution of Iraqi diabetes patients is 13.9%. An Internet of Things (IoT) based framework for non-invasive BG monitoring was recently developed. The aim is to enhance the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device by using IoT technologies. Methods Starting with a review of the latest IoT technologies and some of the CGM commercial devices recommended by ISO 15197 standard. A questionnaire sheet is distributed to determine how much patients in Iraq knew about their health situation and whether they are interested in using new IoT technologies. Women patients are volunteered to check their BG using both finger prick and a CGM device three times a day for comparing. The suggestion is to connect CGM to a personal smart device that has a method controlling alarm messages instead of CGM output. Results The results show how important to educate patients about new technologies. A CGM and finger prick results are checked for similarity using statistical package. Results are presented as (mean ± SD (standard deviation)), the findings demonstrated that, significantly at P < 0.05, there were no differences between the means for tests in both methods based on the standard Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) report. Conclusion This study shows how Iraqi’s patients feel when using a CGM device with new IoT technologies. CGM output is accurate but appeared every 15 min which may be uncomfortable. A method is suggested to transfer CGM output to a smart device to be controlled by algorithms, so that an alarm message is showed every 8h in a normal situation rather than every 15 min. Moreover, GMI% can be calculated every two weeks using data stored in the cloud to estimate a patient’s HbA1c level by using Markov chain. This figure how BG levels are changing in a shorter timeframe, helping in fine-tune diabetes management plans.

                Abstract* Background Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) in mathematics education has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, reflecting broader advances in machine learning, learning analytics, and generative AI. However, a comprehensive overview of publication trends, thematic structures, and collaborative patterns specific to mathematics education remains limited. Methods This study employed a bibliometric approach guided by the PRISMA protocol to systematically analyze research on AI and ITS in mathematics education published between 2001 and 2025. A total of 237 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers indexed in Scopus were identified, screened, and included. Bibliographic data were analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package to examine annual publication growth, author productivity, international collaboration networks, and thematic evolution through keyword co-occurrence and thematic mapping techniques. Results The findings indicate that research output grew slowly during the early 2000s but increased markedly after 2019, aligning with the global surge in interest in machine learning, large language models, and generative AI. Author productivity followed a typical long-tail distribution, with a small group of core authors contributing consistently over time. International collaboration was evident but uneven, dominated by a limited number of countries. Thematic analysis revealed two enduring pillars of the field: pedagogical approaches in mathematics education and technology-driven instructional systems. Emerging themes, including federated learning and adversarial machine learning, point to rising attention to privacy, security, and robustness in adaptive learning environments. STEM education and generative AI have also gained prominence in recent years. Conclusions The evolution of research on AI and ITS in mathematics education reflects a clear paradigm shift from traditional instruction toward adaptive, data-driven, and intelligent learning systems. While technological innovation continues to accelerate, the findings highlight the critical role of teachers’ pedagogical readiness in ensuring that AI-enhanced mathematics education remains effective, inclusive, and sustainable.

                This study investigated the relationship between parents perceptions of children’s values in Indonesian families, focusing on economic, social, emotional, and religious dimensions. The investigation was based on background factors, such as gender, location of residence, and education level, as well as correlations and regressions between dimensions of children’s values. The study participants consisted of 255 parents living in various urban and rural areas in Indonesia. Data were collected using the Children’s Values Scale adapted for the Indonesian context. The study findings showed that there were no significant differences in children’s perceptions of values based on gender or education level. However, there were significant differences based on location of residence, especially on economic and religious dimensions. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between social and emotional dimensions, while a negative relationship was found between economic and emotional dimensions in some contexts. The results of multiple linear regression analysis using the Stepwise method showed that economic and religious dimensions had a significant impact on overall family relationship patterns. This study highlights the importance of understanding the factors that influence parents’ perceptions of children’s values to support effective and harmonious parenting in Indonesian families.

                Wong, Paschini, et al. show that loss of one epithelial cell type can elicit organ-wide effects on other epithelial tissue compartments mediated by macrophages. Loss of airway club cells stimulated altered gene expression programs in macrophages and other myeloid cells, leading to proliferation of the typically quiescent distal alveolar progenitor cells.

                Factors that promote inflammation in C9ORF72 mutation carriers with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have remained elusive. McCourt et al. identified pro-inflammatory forms of glycogen in gut contents of people with ALS/FTD and demonstrate that targeting glycogen in a C9orf72 mouse model extends lifespan and reduces neuroinflammation.

                Vold et al. studied two SNAP-25 variants with different clinical severity. Variants destabilize the SNARE complex and reduce binding to the Munc18-1:VAMP2:syntaxin-1 acceptor complex, with correlated effects on neurotransmitter release. Effects of co-expression of variant and wild-type SNAP-25 were modeled by assuming the co-existence of both species in a ring of SNARE complexes.
