              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Using aquatic animals as partners to increase yield and maintain soil nitrogen in the paddy ecosystems</a></h4>

              
                Whether species coculture can overcome the shortcomings of crop monoculture requires additional study. Here, we show how aquatic animals (i.e. carp, crabs, and softshell turtles) benefit paddy ecosystems when cocultured with rice. Three separate field experiments and three separate mesocosm experiments were conducted. Each experiment included a rice monoculture (RM) treatment and a rice-aquatic animal (RA) coculture treatment; RA included feed addition for aquatic animals. In the field experiments, rice yield was higher with RA than with RM, and RA also produced aquatic animal yields that averaged 0.52–2.57 t ha<sup>-1</sup>. Compared to their corresponding RMs, the three RAs had significantly higher apparent nitrogen (N)-use efficiency and lower weed infestation, while soil N contents were stable over time. Dietary reconstruction analysis based on <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N showed that 16.0–50.2% of aquatic animal foods were from naturally occurring organisms in the rice fields. Stable-isotope-labeling (<sup>13</sup>C) in the field experiments indicated that the organic matter decomposition rate was greater with RA than with RM. Isotope <sup>15</sup>N labeling in the mesocosm experiments indicated that rice used 13.0–35.1% of the aquatic animal feed-N. All these results suggest that rice-aquatic animal coculture increases food production, increases N-use efficiency, and maintains soil N content by reducing weeds and promoting decomposition and complementary N use. Our study supports the view that adding species to monocultures may enhance agroecosystem functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An estimate of the deepest branches of the tree of life from ancient vertically-evolving genes</a></h4>

              
                Core gene phylogenies provide a window into early evolution, but different gene sets and analytical methods have yielded substantially different views of the tree of life. Trees inferred from a small set of universal core genes have typically supported a long branch separating the archaeal and bacterial domains. By contrast, recent analyses of a broader set of non-ribosomal genes have suggested that Archaea may be less divergent from Bacteria, and that estimates of inter-domain distance are inflated due to accelerated evolution of ribosomal proteins along the inter-domain branch. Resolving this debate is key to determining the diversity of the archaeal and bacterial domains, the shape of the tree of life, and our understanding of the early course of cellular evolution. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of the marker genes key to the debate. We show that estimates of a reduced Archaea-Bacteria (AB) branch length result from inter-domain gene transfers and hidden paralogy in the expanded marker gene set. By contrast, analysis of a broad range of manually curated marker gene datasets from an evenly sampled set of 700 Archaea and Bacteria reveal that current methods likely underestimate the AB branch length due to substitutional saturation and poor model fit; that the best-performing phylogenetic markers tend to support longer inter-domain branch lengths; and that the AB branch lengths of ribosomal and non-ribosomal marker genes are statistically indistinguishable. Furthermore, our phylogeny inferred from the 27 highest-ranked marker genes recovers a clade of DPANN at the base of the Archaea, and places CPR within Bacteria as the sister group to the Chloroflexota.

                Genomic epidemiology has proven successful for real-time and retrospective monitoring of small and large-scale outbreaks. Here, we report two genomic sequencing and analysis strategies for rapid-turnaround or high-throughput processing of metagenomic samples. The rapid-turnaround method was designed to provide a quick phylogenetic snapshot of samples at the heart of active outbreaks, and has a total turnaround time of <48 hours from raw sample to analyzed data. The high-throughput method, first reported here for SARS-CoV2, was designed for semi-retrospective data analysis, and is both cost effective and highly scalable. Though these methods were developed and utilized for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response in Arizona, U.S, we envision their use for infectious disease epidemiology in the 21st Century.

     alt="Molecular ontology of the parabrachial nucleus"/>
<p>The parabrachial nucleus (PB) contains diverse, intermingled neurons regulating various homeostatic functions. Their neuronal distributions often do not align with cytoarchitectural subdivisions. Here, we show that the PB is a blend of two, developmentally distinct glutamatergic populations identified by the embryonic transcription factors <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Lmx1a</i>/<i>Lmx1b</i>. We show that macropopulation identity predicts output connectivity and other gene expression patterns in this region. Our findings lay the foundation for a molecular ontology that will be useful for interpreting transcriptomic, connectomic, and other experimental data involving PB neurons.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Diverse neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PB) communicate with widespread brain regions. Despite evidence linking them to a variety of homeostatic functions, it remains difficult to determine which PB neurons influence which functions because their subpopulations intermingle extensively. An improved framework for identifying these intermingled subpopulations would help advance our understanding of neural circuit functions linked to this region. Here, we present the foundation of a developmental-genetic ontology that classifies PB neurons based on their intrinsic, molecular features. By combining transcription factor labeling with Cre fate-mapping, we find that the PB is a blend of two, developmentally distinct macropopulations of glutamatergic neurons. Neurons in the first macropopulation express <i>Lmx1b</i> (and, to a lesser extent, <i>Lmx1a</i>) and are mutually exclusive with those in a second macropopulation, which derive from precursors expressing <i>Atoh1</i>. This second, <i>Atoh1</i>-derived macropopulation includes many <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing neurons, but <i>Foxp2</i> also identifies a subset of <i>Lmx1b</i>-expressing neurons in the Kölliker–Fuse nucleus (KF) and a population of GABAergic neurons ventrolateral to the PB (“caudal KF”). Immediately ventral to the PB, <i>Phox2b</i>-expressing glutamatergic neurons (some coexpressing <i>Lmx1b</i>) occupy the KF, supratrigeminal nucleus, and reticular formation. We show that this molecular framework organizes subsidiary patterns of adult gene expression (including <i>Satb2</i>, <i>Calca</i>, <i>Grp</i>, and <i>Pdyn</i>) and predicts output projections to the amygdala (<i>Lmx1b</i>), hypothalamus (<i>Atoh1</i>), and hindbrain (<i>Phox2b</i>/<i>Lmx1b</i>). Using this molecular ontology to organize, interpret, and communicate PB-related information could accelerate the translation of experimental findings from animal models to human patients.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to validate the Erasmus Guillain–Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score in the International Guillain–Barré Syndrome Outcome Study cohort, and to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined data from the first 1,500 included patients, aged ≥6 years and not ventilated prior to study entry. Patients with a clinical variant or mild symptoms were also included. Outcome was mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Model performance was assessed regarding the discriminative ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and the calibration (observed vs predicted probability of mechanical ventilation), in the full cohort and in Europe/North America and Asia separately. We recalibrated the model to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the group of 1,023 eligible patients (Europe/North America n = 842, Asia n = 104, other n = 77), 104 (10%) required mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Area under the curve values were ≥0.80 for all validation subgroups. Mean observed proportions of mechanical ventilation were lower than predicted risks: full cohort 10% versus 21%, Europe/North America 9% versus 21%, and Asia 17% versus 23%. After recalibration, predicted risks for the full cohort and Europe/North America corresponded to observed proportions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This prospective, international cohort study validated the Erasmus Guillain–Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score, and showed that the model can be used in the full spectrum of Guillain–Barré syndrome patients. In addition, a more accurate, region-specific version of the model was developed for patients from Europe/North America. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>Ethnicity/race moderated the relationships between knee pain, pain catastrophizing, and resting-state functional connectivity in non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White participants. Further investigations of the factors influencing sociodemographic differences are needed.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is a significant public health problem, and the prevalence and societal impact continues to worsen annually. Multiple cognitive and emotional factors are known to modulate pain, including pain catastrophizing, which contributes to pain facilitation and is associated with altered resting-state functional connectivity in pain-related cortical and subcortical circuitry. Pain and catastrophizing levels are reported to be higher in non-Hispanic black (NHB) compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals. The current study, a substudy of a larger ongoing observational cohort investigation, investigated the pathways by which ethnicity/race influences the relationship between pain catastrophizing, clinical pain, and resting-state functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), insula, and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Participants included 136 (66 NHBs and 70 NHWs) community-dwelling adults with knee osteoarthritis. Participants completed the Coping Strategies Questionnaire-Revised Pain Catastrophizing subscale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained, and resting-state functional connectivity was analyzed. Relative to NHW, the NHB participants were younger, reported lower income, were less likely to be married, and self-reported greater clinical pain and pain catastrophizing (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05). Ethnicity/race moderated the mediation effects of catastrophizing on the relationship between clinical pain and resting-state functional connectivity between the ACC, dlPFC, insula, and S1. These results indicate the NHB and NHW groups demonstrated different relationships between pain, catastrophizing, and functional connectivity. These results provide evidence for a potentially important role of ethnicity/race in the interrelationships among pain, catastrophizing, and resting-state functional connectivity.</p>

     alt="Lateral entorhinal cortex lesions impair odor-context associative memory in male rats"/>
<p>Rats with lesions of lateral entorhinal cortex have impaired memory for associations of odors and contexts while their memory for individual items is unaffected. This suggests that integration of associative information occurs at the level of lateral entorhinal cortex as well as the hippocampus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) has been hypothesized to process nonspatial, item information that is combined with spatial information from medial entorhinal cortex to form episodic memories within the hippocampus. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that LEC has a role in integrating features of episodic memory prior to the hippocampus. While the precise role of LEC is still unclear, anatomical studies show that LEC is ideally placed to be a hub integrating multisensory information. The current study tests whether the role of LEC in integrating information extends to long-term multimodal item-context associations. In Experiment 1, male rats were trained on a context-dependent odor discrimination task, where two different contexts served as the cue to the correct odor. Rats were pretrained on the task and then received either bilateral excitotoxic LEC or sham lesions. Following surgery, rats were tested on the previously learned odor-context associations. Control rats showed good memory for the previously learned association but rats with LEC lesions showed significantly impaired performance relative to both their own presurgery performance and to control rats. Experiment 2 went on to test whether impairments in Experiment 1 were the result of LEC lesions impairing either odor or context memory retention alone. Male rats were trained on simple odor and context discrimination tasks that did not require integration of features to solve. Following surgery, both LEC and control rats showed good memory for previously learned odors and contexts. These data show that LEC is critical for long-term odor-context associative memory.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep is a universal and evolutionarily conserved behavior among many animal species, yet we do not have a fundamental understanding of why animals need to sleep. What we do know, however, is that sleep is critical for behavioral performance during the waking period and for long-term brain health. Here we provide an overview of some putative mechanisms that mediate the restorative effects of sleep, namely metabolic biosynthesis, fluid perfusion, and synaptic homeostasis. We then review recent experimental findings that advance the possibility of inducing sleep-like slow-wave activity (SWA) during wakefulness or enhance SWA during sleep in a top-down manner using noninvasive brain stimulation. SWA induction and SWA enhancement are believed to recapitulate the beneficial effects of sleep independent of the actual state of the subjects. If confirmed, these observations will change the way in which we investigate the neural correlates of sleep, thus paving the way for comprehending and actively controlling its restorative function.</p>

<p>By quantitatively measuring the brain coupling signature between functional activity and structural connectome using graph frequency analysis, we found a unique signature of brain structural-functional reorganization in multiple sclerosis.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain activities and the underlying wiring diagrams are vulnerable in multiple sclerosis (MS). Also, it remains unknown whether the complex coupling between these functional and structural brain properties would be affected. To address this issue, we adopted graph frequency analysis to quantify the high-order structural-functional interactions based on a combination of brain diffusion and functional MRI data. The structural-functional decoupling index was proposed to measure how much brain regional functional activity with different graph frequency was organized atop the underlying wiring diagram in MS. The identified patterns in MS included (1) disruption of inherent structural-functional coupling in the somatomotor network (<i>β</i> = 0.05, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and (2) excessive decrease of decoupling in the subcortical (<i>β</i> = −0.10, <i>p</i> = 0.02), visual (<i>β</i> = −0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.01), and dorsal attention networks (<i>β</i> = −0.12, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Besides, this structural-functional coupling signature in the somatomotor network was associated with cognitive worsening of MS patients (<i>β</i> = −24.31, <i>p</i> = 0.006). Overall, our study unveiled a unique signature of brain structural-functional reorganization in MS.</p>

<p>Very low (≤0.5 Gy) radiation doses twice per week (ultra-hyper fractionated radiotherapy) started soon after the last standard 2.0 Gy radiotherapeutic fraction may help to control high-grade glioma progression (image credits: University of Utah).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ionizing radiation is a mainstay of high-grade glioma therapy. The current standard radiotherapeutic schedule involves a total 60 Gy split in 2.0 Gy fractions delivered on weekdays for six weeks. Thereafter, almost invariably the tumor relapses and progresses. <i>In vitro</i> studies have demonstrated that the therapeutic effectiveness of ionizing radiation towards high-grade glioma cells is greatly increased by splitting the total dose in fractions ten times smaller [0.1–0.5 Gy instead of standard 2.0 Gy—ultra-hyper-fractionated radiotherapy (ultra-hyper-FRT)]. Recently, it became possible to consistently translate this therapeutic effect to the animal setting, by using glioma-initiating cell-driven faithful animal modeling. A re-analysis of the literature reporting radiotherapeutic clinical trials also suggests that the lower the average fraction size, the higher is the achievable overall survival of patients. However, average fraction sizes ≤ 0.5 Gy have never been thoroughly investigated in the clinics. We propose to study in the clinical setting the therapeutic effect of an ultra-hyper-FRT schedule promptly extending the conventional radiation component of the current guidelines (“Stupp”) therapeutic protocol.</p>

<p>Adolescent chronic unpredictable stress altered levels of GRα isoforms, especially those with lower molecular weight, along with expression of GR-responsive genes of the hippocampus and the PFC, contributing to anxiety and depressive-like behavior in adult mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescent stress predisposes individuals to increased risk for anxiety and depression in adulthood. The stress response is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) via regulation of GR-responsive genes involved in brain reaction to stress. Although dysregulation of GR in depression is well documented, this is the first study investigating the role of GRα isoforms in pathogenesis of depression. We exposed adolescent male and female C57BL/6J mice to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 12 days starting at postnatal day 28 (PND28). Tests evaluating anxiety and depressive-like behaviors were performed at PND70. We analyzed corticosterone concentrations in serum, levels of GRα isoforms (95, 67, 50, 40, and 25 kDa), and mRNA levels of GR-responsive genes (GR, FKBP5, BDNF, and IL-1β) in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). CUS increased anxiety and depressive-like behavior in adult animals of both sexes, but did not affect corticosterone serum levels, 95 and 67 kDa GR isoforms. However, the levels of shorter GRα isoforms (50, 40, and 25 kDa) were altered in adult mice underwent CUS, in sex- and brain structure–specific way. Changes in gene expression revealed that female depressive-like behavior could be related to increased levels of IL-1β in hippocampus and reduced BDNF levels in both hippocampus and PFC. However, in males, adolescent CUS increased expression of GR in adult hippocampus and BDNF in PFC. These findings suggest that adolescent stress altered levels of GRα isoforms, especially those with lower molecular weight, in sex- and tissue-specific ways, contributing to anxiety and depression in adult mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">How do protein aggregates escape quality control in neurodegeneration?</a></h4>

              
                Protein aggregates are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. The protein quality control (PQC) system normally prevents proteins from misfolding and accumulation; however, proteins somehow escape this control on disease. Here we review advances in the role of PQC in protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. We focus primarily on the protein Tau, which aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. We also examine recent advances in amyloid fibril structures and the process of fibril formation via phase separation, which are shedding new light on the role of PQC in protein aggregation diseases.

                In humans, DNA methylation marks inherited from gametes are largely erased following fertilisation, prior to construction of the embryonic methylome. Exploiting a natural experiment of seasonal variation including changes in diet and nutritional status in rural Gambia, we analysed three datasets covering two independent child cohorts and identified 259 CpGs showing consistent associations between season of conception (SoC) and DNA methylation. SoC effects were most apparent in early infancy, with evidence of attenuation by mid-childhood. SoC-associated CpGs were enriched for metastable epialleles, parent-of-origin specific methylation and germline DMRs, supporting a periconceptional environmental influence. Many SoC-associated CpGs overlapped enhancers or sites of active transcription in H1 ESCs and fetal tissues. Half were influenced but not determined by measured genetic variants that were independent of SoC. Environmental ‘hotspots’ providing a record of environmental influence at periconception constitute a valuable resource for investigating epigenetic mechanisms linking early exposures to lifelong health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Slow oscillation–spindle coupling strength predicts real-life gross-motor learning in adolescents and adults</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we demonstrated that precise temporal coordination between slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles indexes declarative memory network development (Hahn et al., 2020). However, it is unclear whether these findings in the declarative memory domain also apply in the motor memory domain. Here, we compared adolescents and adults learning juggling, a real-life gross-motor task. Juggling performance was impacted by sleep and time of day effects. Critically, we found that improved task proficiency after sleep lead to an attenuation of the learning curve, suggesting a dynamic juggling learning process. We employed individualized cross-frequency coupling analyses to reduce inter- and intragroup variability of oscillatory features. Advancing our previous findings, we identified a more precise SO–spindle coupling in adults compared to adolescents. Importantly, coupling precision over motor areas predicted overnight changes in task proficiency and learning curve, indicating that SO–spindle coupling relates to the dynamic motor learning process. Our results provide first evidence that regionally specific, precisely coupled sleep oscillations support gross-motor learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">P2Y1 purinergic receptor identified as a diabetes target in a small-molecule screen to reverse circadian β-cell failure</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian circadian clock drives daily oscillations in physiology and behavior through an autoregulatory transcription feedback loop present in central and peripheral cells. Ablation of the core clock within the endocrine pancreas of adult animals impairs the transcription and splicing of genes involved in hormone exocytosis and causes hypoinsulinemic diabetes. Here, we developed a genetically sensitized small-molecule screen to identify druggable proteins and mechanistic pathways involved in circadian β-cell failure. Our approach was to generate β-cells expressing a nanoluciferase reporter within the proinsulin polypeptide to screen 2640 pharmacologically active compounds and identify insulinotropic molecules that bypass the secretory defect in CRISPR-Cas9-targeted clock mutant β-cells. We validated hit compounds in primary mouse islets and identified known modulators of ligand-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors, including the antihelmintic ivermectin. Single-cell electrophysiology in circadian mutant mouse and human cadaveric islets revealed ivermectin as a glucose-dependent secretagogue. Genetic, genomic, and pharmacological analyses established the P2Y1 receptor as a clock-controlled mediator of the insulinotropic activity of ivermectin. These findings identify the P2Y1 purinergic receptor as a diabetes target based upon a genetically sensitized phenotypic screen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thymocytes trigger self-antigen-controlling pathways in immature medullary thymic epithelial stages</a></h4>

              
                Interactions of developing T cells with Aire<sup>+</sup> medullary thymic epithelial cells expressing high levels of MHCII molecules (mTEC<sup>hi</sup>) are critical for the induction of central tolerance in the thymus. In turn, thymocytes regulate the cellularity of Aire<sup>+</sup> mTEC<sup>hi</sup>. However, it remains unknown whether thymocytes control the precursors of Aire<sup>+</sup> mTEC<sup>hi</sup> that are contained in mTEC<sup>lo</sup> cells or other mTEC<sup>lo</sup> subsets that have recently been delineated by single-cell transcriptomic analyses. Here, using three distinct transgenic mouse models, in which antigen presentation between mTECs and CD4<sup>+</sup> thymocytes is perturbed, we show by high-throughput RNA-seq that self-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> thymocytes induce key transcriptional regulators in mTEC<sup>lo</sup> and control the composition of mTEC<sup>lo</sup> subsets, including Aire<sup>+</sup> mTEC<sup>hi</sup> precursors, post-Aire and tuft-like mTECs. Furthermore, these interactions upregulate the expression of tissue-restricted self-antigens, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules important for T-cell development. This gene activation program induced in mTEC<sup>lo</sup> is combined with a global increase of the active H3K4me3 histone mark. Finally, we demonstrate that these self-reactive interactions between CD4<sup>+</sup> thymocytes and mTECs critically prevent multiorgan autoimmunity. Our genome-wide study thus reveals that self-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> thymocytes control multiple unsuspected facets from immature stages of mTECs, which determines their heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Paradoxical neuronal hyperexcitability in a mouse model of mitochondrial pyruvate import deficiency</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal excitation imposes a high demand of ATP in neurons. Most of the ATP derives primarily from pyruvate-mediated oxidative phosphorylation, a process that relies on import of pyruvate into mitochondria occuring exclusively via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). To investigate whether deficient oxidative phosphorylation impacts neuron excitability, we generated a mouse strain carrying a conditional deletion of MPC1, an essential subunit of the MPC, specifically in adult glutamatergic neurons. We found that, despite decreased levels of oxidative phosphorylation and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in these excitatory neurons, mice were normal at rest. Surprisingly, in response to mild inhibition of GABA mediated synaptic activity, they rapidly developed severe seizures and died, whereas under similar conditions the behavior of control mice remained unchanged. We report that neurons with a deficient MPC were intrinsically hyperexcitable as a consequence of impaired calcium homeostasis, which reduced M-type potassium channel activity. Provision of ketone bodies restored energy status, calcium homeostasis and M-channel activity and attenuated seizures in animals fed a ketogenic diet. Our results provide an explanation for the seizures that frequently accompany a large number of neuropathologies, including cerebral ischemia and diverse mitochondriopathies, in which neurons experience an energy deficit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">STAT3-mediated allelic imbalance of novel genetic variant rs1047643 and B cell specific super-enhancer in association with systemic lupus erythematosus</a></h4>

              
                Mapping of allelic imbalance (AI) at heterozygous loci has the potential to establish links between genetic risk for disease and biological function. Leveraging multi-omics data for AI analysis and functional annotation, we discovered a novel functional risk variant rs1047643 at 8p23 in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This variant displays dynamic AI of chromatin accessibility and allelic expression on <i>FDFT1</i> gene in B cells with SLE. We further found a B-cell restricted super-enhancer (SE) that physically contacts with this SNP-residing locus, an interaction that also appears specifically in B cells. Quantitative analysis of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation profiles further demonstrated that the SE exhibits aberrant activity in B cell development with SLE. Functional studies identified that STAT3, a master factor associated with autoimmune diseases, directly regulates both the AI of risk variant and the activity of SE in cultured B cells. Our study reveals that STAT3-mediated SE activity and cis-regulatory effects of SNP rs1047643 at 8p23 locus are associated with B cell deregulation in SLE.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Telencephalic outputs from the medial entorhinal cortex are copied directly to the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Complementary actions of the neocortex and the hippocampus enable encoding and long-term storage of experience dependent memories. Standard models for memory storage assume that sensory signals reach the hippocampus from superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC). Deep layers of the EC on the other hand relay hippocampal outputs to the telencephalic structures including many parts of the neocortex. Here we show that cells in Layer 5a of the medial EC send a copy of their telencephalic outputs back to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Combining cell-type specific anatomical tracing with high-throughput RNA-sequencing based projection mapping and optogenetics aided circuit mapping, we show that in the mouse brain these projections have a unique topography and target hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons. Our results suggest that projections of deep medial EC neurons are anatomically configured to influence the hippocampus and neocortex simultaneously and therefore lead to novel hypotheses on the functional role of the deep EC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Parallel evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage resistance and virulence loss in response to phage treatment in vivo and in vitro</a></h4>

              
                With rising antibiotic resistance, there has been increasing interest in treating pathogenic bacteria with bacteriophages (phage therapy). One limitation of phage therapy is the ease at which bacteria can evolve resistance. Negative effects of resistance may be mitigated when resistance results in reduced bacterial growth and virulence, or when phage coevolve to overcome resistance. Resistance evolution and its consequences are contingent on the bacteria-phage combination and their environmental context, making therapeutic outcomes hard to predict. One solution might be to conduct '<i>in vitro</i> evolutionary simulations' using bacteria-phage combinations from the therapeutic context. Overall, our aim was to investigate parallels between <i>in vitro</i> experiments and <i>in vivo</i> dynamics in a human participant. Evolutionary dynamics were similar, with high levels of resistance evolving quickly with limited evidence of phage evolution. Resistant bacteria - evolved <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> - had lower virulence. <i>In vivo</i>, this was linked to lower growth rates of resistant isolates, whereas <i>in vitro</i> phage resistant isolates evolved greater biofilm production. Population sequencing suggests resistance resulted from selection on <i>de novo</i> mutations rather than sorting of existing variants. These results highlight the speed at which phage resistance can evolve <i>in vivo</i>, and how <i>in vitro</i> experiments may give useful insights for clinical evolutionary outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cellular organization in lab-evolved and extant multicellular species obeys a maximum entropy law</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of multicellular organisms is due in part to their ability to form complex structures. How cells pack in these structures is a fundamental biophysical issue, underlying their functional properties. However, much remains unknown about how cell packing geometries arise, and how they are affected by random noise during growth - especially absent developmental programs. Here, we quantify the statistics of cellular neighborhoods of two different multicellular eukaryotes: lab-evolved ‘snowflake’ yeast and the green alga <i>Volvox carteri</i>. We find that despite large differences in cellular organization, the free space associated with individual cells in both organisms closely fits a modified gamma distribution, consistent with maximum entropy predictions originally developed for granular materials. This ‘entropic’ cellular packing ensures a degree of predictability despite noise, facilitating parent-offspring fidelity even in the absence of developmental regulation. Together with simulations of diverse growth morphologies, these results suggest that gamma-distributed cell neighborhood sizes are a general feature of multicellularity, arising from conserved statistics of cellular packing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pseudohypoxic HIF pathway activation dysregulates collagen structure-function in human lung fibrosis</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening with downstream activation of mechanosensitive pathways is strongly implicated in fibrosis. We previously reported that altered collagen nanoarchitecture is a key determinant of pathogenetic ECM structure-function in human fibrosis (Jones et al., 2018). Here, through human tissue, bioinformatic and ex vivo studies we provide evidence that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway activation is a critical pathway for this process regardless of the oxygen status (pseudohypoxia). Whilst TGFβ increased the rate of fibrillar collagen synthesis, HIF pathway activation was required to dysregulate post-translational modification of fibrillar collagen, promoting pyridinoline cross-linking, altering collagen nanostructure, and increasing tissue stiffness. In vitro, knockdown of Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), which modulates HIF activity, or oxidative stress caused pseudohypoxic HIF activation in the normal fibroblasts. By contrast, endogenous FIH activity was reduced in fibroblasts from patients with lung fibrosis in association with significantly increased normoxic HIF pathway activation. In human lung fibrosis tissue, HIF-mediated signalling was increased at sites of active fibrogenesis whilst subpopulations of human lung fibrosis mesenchymal cells had increases in both HIF and oxidative stress scores. Our data demonstrate that oxidative stress can drive pseudohypoxic HIF pathway activation which is a critical regulator of pathogenetic collagen structure-function in fibrosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human spinal cord in vitro differentiation pace is initially maintained in heterologous embryonic environments</a></h4>

              
                Species-specific differentiation pace in-vitro indicates that some aspects of neural differentiation are governed by cell intrinsic properties. Here we describe a novel in-vitro human neural-rosette assay that recapitulates dorsal spinal cord differentiation but proceeds more rapidly than in the human embryo, suggesting that it lacks endogenous signalling dynamics. To test whether in-vitro conditions represent an intrinsic differentiation pace, human iPSC-derived neural rosettes were challenged by grafting into the faster differentiating chicken embryonic neural tube iso-chronically, or hetero-chronically into older embryos. In both contexts in-vitro differentiation pace was initially unchanged, while long-term analysis revealed iso-chronic slowed and hetero-chronic conditions promoted human neural differentiation. Moreover hetero-chronic conditions did not alter the human neural differentiation programme, which progressed to neurogenesis, while the host embryo advanced into gliogenesis. This study demonstrates that intrinsic properties limit human differentiation pace, and that timely extrinsic signals are required for progression through an intrinsic human neural differentiation programme.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition proceeds through directional destabilization of multidimensional attractor</a></h4>

              
                How a cell changes from one stable phenotype to another one is a fundamental problem in developmental and cell biology. Mathematically a stable phenotype corresponds to a stable attractor in a generally multi-dimensional state space, which needs to be destabilized so the cell relaxes to a new attractor. Two basic mechanisms for destabilizing a stable fixed point, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations, have been extensively studied theoretically, however direct experimental investigation at the single cell level remains scarce. Here we performed live cell imaging studies and analyses in the framework of dynamical systems theories on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While some mechanistic details remain controversial, EMT is a cell phenotypic transition (CPT) process central to development and pathology. Through time-lapse imaging we recorded single cell trajectories of human A549/Vim-RFP cells undergoing EMT induced by different concentrations of exogenous TGF-β in a multi-dimensional cell feature space. The trajectories clustered into two distinct groups, indicating that the transition dynamics proceeds through parallel paths. We then reconstructed the reaction coordinates and the corresponding quasi-potentials from the trajectories. The potentials revealed a plausible mechanism for the emergence of the two paths where the original stable epithelial attractor collides with two saddle points sequentially with increased TGF-β concentration, and relaxes to a new one. Functionally the directional saddle-node bifurcation ensures a CPT proceeds towards a specific cell type, as a mechanistic realization of the canalization idea proposed by Waddington.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Application of ATAC-Seq for genome-wide analysis of the chromatin state at single myofiber resolution</a></h4>

              
                Myofibers are the main components of skeletal muscle, which is the largest tissue in the body. Myofibers are highly adaptive and can be altered under different biological and disease conditions. Therefore, transcriptional and epigenetic studies on myofibers are crucial to discover how chromatin alterations occur in the skeletal muscle under different conditions. However, due to the heterogenous nature of skeletal muscle, studying myofibers in isolation proves to be a challenging task. Single cell sequencing has permitted the study of the epigenome of isolated myonuclei. While this provides sequencing with high dimensionality, the sequencing depth is lacking, which makes comparisons between different biological conditions difficult. Here we report the first implementation of single myofiber ATAC-Seq, which allows for the sequencing of an individual myofiber at a depth sufficient for peak calling and for comparative analysis of chromatin accessibility under various physiological and disease conditions. Application of this technique revealed significant differences in chromatin accessibility between resting and regenerating myofibers, as well as between myofibers from a mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (mdx) and wild type (WT) counterparts. This technique can lead to a wide application in the identification of chromatin regulatory elements and epigenetic mechanisms in muscle fibers during development and in muscle-wasting diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the Mental Status of Stargazer Mice</a></h4>

              
                In many childhood-onset genetic epilepsies, seizures are accompanied by neurobehavioral impairments and motor disability. In the Stargazer mutant mouse, genetic disruptions of Cacng2 result in absence-like spike-wave seizures, cerebellar gait ataxia and vestibular dysfunction. Here, we combine videotracking and instrumented home-cage monitoring to resolve the neurobehavioral facets of the murine Stargazer syndrome. We find that despite their gait ataxia, stargazer mutants display horizontal hyperactivity and variable rates of repetitive circling behavior. While feeding rhythms, circadian or ultradian oscillations in activity are unchanged, mutants exhibit fragmented sleep bouts, atypical licking dynamics and lowered sucrose preference. Mutants also display an attenuated response to visual and auditory home-cage perturbations, together with profound reductions in voluntary wheel-running. Our results reveal that the seizures and ataxia of Stargazer mutants occur in the context of a more pervasive behavioral syndrome with elements of encephalopathy, repetitive behavior and anhedonia. These findings expand our understanding of the function of Cacng2/CACNG2, variants in which have been identified in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous behavioural recovery following stroke relates to the integrity of sensory and association cortices</a></h4>

              
                Stroke is a devastating disease that results in neurological deficits and represents a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Following a stroke, there is a degree of spontaneous recovery of function, the neural basis of which is of great interest among clinicians in their efforts to reduce disability following stroke and enhance rehabilitation. Conventionally, work on spontaneous recovery has tended to focus on the neural reorganization of motor cortical regions, with comparably little attention being paid to changes in non-motor regions and how these relate to recovery. Here we show, using structural neuroimaging in a macaque stroke model and by exploiting individual differences in spontaneous behavioural recovery, that the preservation of regions in the sensory and association cortices predict animal recovery. To characterize recovery, we performed a clustering analysis using Non-Human Primate Stroke Scale (NHPSS) scores and identified a good versus poor recovery group. By comparing the preservation of brain volumes in the two groups, we found that brain areas in integrity of brain areas in parietal, temporal and somatosensory cortex were associated with better recovery. In addition, a decoding approach performed across all subjects revealed that the preservation of specific brain regions in the parietal, somatosensory and medial frontal cortex predicted recovery. Together, these findings highlight the importance of the sensory and association regions in spontaneous behavioural recovery, supporting the notion that the sensory retraining of impairments following stroke is critical to recovery and motor function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional Connections Among Neurons within Single Columns of Macaque V1</a></h4>

              
                Recent developments in high-density neurophysiological tools now make it possible to record from hundreds of single neurons within local, highly interconnected neural networks. Among the many advantages of such recordings is that they dramatically increase the quantity of identifiable, functional connections between neurons thereby providing an unprecedented view of local circuit interactions. Using high-density, Neuropixels recordings from single neocortical columns of primary visual cortex in nonhuman primates, we identified 1000s of functionally connected neuronal pairs using established crosscorrelation approaches. Our results reveal clear and systematic variations in the strength and synchrony of functional connections across the cortical column. Despite neurons residing within the same column, both measures of functional connectivity depended heavily on the vertical distance separating neuronal pairs, as well as on the similarity of stimulus tuning. In addition, we leveraged the statistical power afforded by the large numbers of connected pairs to categorize functional connections between neurons based on their crosscorrelation functions. These analyses identified distinct, putative classes of functional connections within the full population. These classes of functional connections were corroborated by their unique distributions across defined laminar compartments and were consistent with known properties of V1 cortical circuitry, such as the lead-lag relationship between simple and complex cells. Our results provide a clear proof-of-principle for the use of high-density neurophysiological recordings to assess circuit-level interactions within local neuronal networks.

	<p>Background: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by excessive preoccupation with imagined defects in appearance. Optical illusions induce illusory effects that distort the presented stimulus, thus leading to ambiguous percepts. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated whether BDD is related to differentiated perception during illusory percepts. Methods: A total of 18 BDD patients and 18 controls were presented with 39 optical illusions together with a statement testing whether or not they perceived the illusion. After a delay period, they were prompted to answer whether the statement was right/wrong and their degree of confidence in their answer. We investigated differences of BDD patients on task performance and self-reported confidence and analyzed the brain oscillations during decision-making using nonparametric cluster statistics. Results: Behaviorally, the BDD group exhibited reduced confidence when responding incorrectly, potentially attributed to higher levels of doubt. Electrophysiologically, the BDD group showed significantly reduced alpha power at the fronto-central and parietal scalp areas, suggesting impaired allocation of attention. Interestingly, the lower the alpha power of the identified cluster, the higher the BDD severity, as assessed by BDD psychometrics. Conclusions: Results evidenced that alpha power during illusory processing might serve as a quantitative EEG biomarker of BDD, potentially associated with reduced inhibition of task-irrelevant areas.</p>

	<p>Tongue pressure measurement (TPM) is an indicator of oral function. However, the association between tongue pressure and cerebral activation remains unclear. We used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to examine the correlation between cerebral cortex activation and tongue pressure stimulation against the anterior palatal mucosa. We measured voluntary maximum tongue pressure (MTP) using a TPM device; a pressure value of approximately 60% of the MTP was used for the experimental tongue pressure (MTP60%). We examined the effect of oral functional tongue pressure stimulation against the anterior palatal mucosa on cerebral activation using NIRS in 13 adults. Tongue pressure stimulation caused significant changes in cerebral blood flow in some areas compared with controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). We performed a correlation analysis (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) between MTP60% and changes in oxygenated hemoglobin in all 47 NIRS channels. MTP60% triggered activation of the right somatosensory motor area and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and deactivation of the anterior prefrontal cortex (APFC). TPM balloon-probe insertion in the oral cavity activated the bilateral somatosensory motor area and deactivated the wide area of the APFC. Moreover, MTP60% via the TPM balloon probe activated the bilateral somatosensory and motor cortex areas. Tongue pressure stimulation changes cerebral blood flow, and NIRS is useful in investigating the relationship between oral stimulation and brain function.</p>

	<p>Background: Elevated admission glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels have been suggested to be associated with 90-day functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). However, whether the prognostic significance of admission glucose and that of HbA1c have a joint effect on patients with intravascular thrombolysis (IVT) and/or EVT remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the association between admission glucose combined with HbA1c and outcomes in patients with reperfusion therapy. Methods: Consecutive AIS patients treated with IVT and/or EVT between 2 January 2018 and 27 February 2021 in West China hospital were enrolled. Admission glucose and HbA1c levels were measured at admission. Participants were divided into four groups according to admission glucose level (categorical variable: &amp;amp;lt;7.8 and &amp;amp;ge;7.8 mmol/L) and HbA1c level (categorical variable: &amp;amp;lt;6.5% and &amp;amp;ge;6.5%): normal glucose and normal HbA1c (NGNA), normal glucose and high HbA1c (NGHA), high glucose and normal HbA1c (HGNA), and high glucose and high HbA1c (HGHA). The primary outcome was an unfavorable functional outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) &amp;amp;ge; 3. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Results: A total of 519 patients (mean age, 69.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.4 years; 53.8% males) were included. Patients in the HGHA group had a significantly increased risk of unfavorable functional outcome (OR, 1.81; 95%CI, 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;3.23) and mortality (OR, 1.75; 95%CI, 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;3.06) at 90 days compared with those in the NGNA group after adjustment for confounders. There was no significant association between NGHA (OR, 0.43; 95%CI, 0.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.53) or HGNA (OR, 1.46; 95%CI, 0.84&amp;amp;ndash;2.56) and outcomes compared to the NGNA group. Conclusion: The combination of high admission glucose and high HbA1c level was significantly associated with unfavorable functional outcome and mortality at 90 days in AIS patients with reperfusion therapy.</p>

	<p>Objectives: In this retrospective study, we investigated how spasticity developed in patients diagnosed with a prolonged DOC over an almost two-year observation period (21 months), and how it related to the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; age, gender, time since injury, etiology, level of consciousness, and anti-spastic medications. Methods: In total, 19 patients with a severe brain injury and prolonged DOC admitted to a long-term care facility were included in this study (14 male, age: 45.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 15.3 years, 10 traumatic brain injury, 1.01 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.99 years after brain injury, 11 minimally conscious state vs. 8 vegetative state). Each patient was assessed at admission and then quarterly, totaling eight assessments over 21 months. Spasticity was measured with the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) for both upper and lower limbs. The Western Neuro Sensory Stimulation Profile (WNSSP) was administered to assess the level of consciousness. Any other medical and demographic information of interest was obtained through medical records. Linear mixed models were used to assess each variable&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on the change of spasticity over time. Results: Significant differences were observed in the evolution of spasticity in patients based on their etiology for the upper limbs [F (7, 107.29) = 2.226; p = 0.038], and on their level of consciousness for the lower limbs [F (7, 107.07) = 3.196; p = 0.004]. Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that spasticity evolves differently according to the type of brain lesion and the level of consciousness. Spasticity in DOCs might therefore be mediated by different mechanisms and might have to be treated differently among patients. Future longitudinal studies should be performed prospectively in a bigger cohort and with data collection beginning earlier after brain injury to confirm our results and better understand the evolution of spasticity in this population.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate functional and safety outcomes of Endovascular thrombectomy(EVT) vs Medical Management(MM) in patients with M2 occlusion and examine their association with perfusion imaging mismatch and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a pooled, patient-level analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials(EXTEND-IA, EXTEND-IA-TNK part 1&2) and 2 prospective non-randomized studies(INSPIRE&SELECT), we evaluated EVT association with 90-day functional independence(mRS 0-2) in isolated M2 occlusions as compared to medical management overall and in subgroups by mismatch profile status and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 517 patients(EVT=195, MM=322), baseline median(IQR) NIHSS was 13(8-19) in EVT vs 10(6-15) in MM, p&lt;0.001. Pre-treatment ischemic core did not differ(EVT=10(0-24)mL vs MM=9(3-21)mL, p=0.59). Compared to MM, EVT was more frequently associated with functional independence(68.3% vs 61.6%, aOR=2.42,95%CI=1.25-4.67, p=0.008,IPTW-OR=1.75,95% CI=1.00-3.75,p=0.05) with a shift towards better mRS outcomes(adjusted cOR=2.02,95%CI:1.23-3.29,p=0.005), and lower mortality(5% vs 10%, aOR=0.32,95%CI=0.12-0.87,p=0.025). EVT was associated with higher functional independence in patients with a perfusion mismatch profile(EVT=70.7% vs MM=61.3%, aOR=2.29, 95%CI=1.09-4.79,p=0.029, IPTW-OR=2.02,1.08-3.78,p=0.029), whereas no difference was found in those without mismatch(EVT=43.8% vs MM=62.7%,p=0.17, IPTW-OR: 0.71,95% CI=0.18-2.78,p=0.62). Functional independence was more frequent with EVT in patients with moderate or severe strokes, as defined by baseline NIHSS above any thresholds from 6-10, whereas there was no difference between groups with milder strokes below these thresholds.</p>

                Assessing the risk for SARS-CoV-2-induced new-onset diabetes requires an integration of multiple complementary lines of investigation. Here, van der Heide et al. demonstrate that the specific limits of in vitro pancreatic SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest at best a minor, if any, role for virus-induced beta cell damage directly promoting new-onset diabetes.

                Size homeostasis is one of the most fundamental aspects of biology and it is particularly important for large cells as neurons. We have previously proposed a motor-dependent length-sensing and growth-regulating mechanism wherein a partial reduction in the levels of microtubule motor proteins should lead to accelerated neuronal growth. This prediction was originally validated in sensory neurons heterozygous for the Loa point mutation in dynein heavy chain 1 (Dync1h1Loa). Here we describe a new mouse model with a conditional allele allowing deletion of exons 24-25 in Dync1h1. Homozygous Islet1-Cre deletion of Dync1h1 is embryonic lethal, but heterozygous animals (Isl1-Dync1h1+/-) survive to adulthood with approximately 50% dynein expression in targeted cell types. Isl1-Dync1h1+/- adult sensory neurons reveal an accelerated growth phenotype, similar to that previously reported in Dync1h1Loa neurons. Moreover, Isl1-Dync1h1+/- mice show mild impairments in gait, proprioception and tactile sensation; and slightly impaired recovery from peripheral nerve injury. Thus, conditional deletion of Dync1h1 exons 24-25 enables targeted studies of the role of dynein in neuronal growth and neurological disorders.

                The thalamus is the principal information hub of the vertebrate brain, with essential roles in sensory and motor information processing, attention, and memory. The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson's disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.

                Infant avoidance and aggression are promoted by activation of the Urocortin-3 expressing neurons of the perifornical area of hypothalamus (PeFAUcn3) in male and female mice. PeFAUcn3 neurons have been implicated in stress, and stress is known to reduce maternal behavior. We asked how chronic restraint stress (CRS) affects infant-directed behavior in virgin and lactating females and what role PeFAUcn3 neurons play in this process. Here we show that infant-directed behavior increases activity in the PeFAUcn3 neurons in virgin and lactating females. Chemogenetic inhibition of PeFAUcn3 neurons facilitates pup retrieval in virgin females. CRS reduces pup retrieval in virgin females and increases activity of PeFAUcn3 neurons, while CRS does not affect maternal behavior in mothers. Inhibition of PeFAUcn3 neurons blocks stress-induced deficits in pup-directed behavior in virgin females. Together, these data illustrate the critical role for PeFAUcn3 neuronal activity in mediating the impact of chronic stress on female infant-directed behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic Location Is a Determinant of the Detrimental Effects of α-Synuclein Pathology to Glutamatergic Transmission in the Basolateral Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a soluble protein enriched at presynaptic boutons and its abnormal aggregation is a hallmark of Parkinsons disease (PD). The amygdala shows selective vulnerability to the formation of insoluble aSyn aggregates, and its circuit dysfunction may contribute to prevalent psychiatric deficits in PD. Yet, how aSyn aggregates affect the amygdala function remains elusive. In the present study, we examined the presence of aSyn in glutamatergic axon terminals and how its aggregation affects glutamatergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Using confocal microscopy, we showed that aSyn is primarily present in the axon terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), but not in those expressing vGluT2. Using electrophysiology and optogenetics, we found that glutamatergic neurotransmission from vGluT1+ axon terminals are functionally more vulnerable than vGluT2+ axon terminals to the toxic effects of pathological aSyn aggregation triggered by aSyn preformed fibrils (PFFs). Using the PFFs models and mouse genetics, we showed that loss of aSyn promotes short-term depression of cortico-BLA synapses responding to repetitive stimuli, leading to an input-selective filtering of cortical inputs to the BLA. Together, we demonstrate that aSyn expresses specifically in a subset of synapses in mouse amygdala, which causes an input-specific decrease of cortical inputs to the BLA as aSyn aggregation forms. These results might be relevant to the reduced cortical control of amygdala function that has been associated with psychiatric deficits in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kir6.2-containing KATP channels are necessary for glucose dependent increases in amyloid-beta and Alzheimer's-related pathology</a></h4>

              
                Increased neuronal excitability contributes to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) production and aggregation in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Previous work from our lab demonstrated that hyperglycemia, or elevated blood glucose levels, increased brain excitability and A{beta} release potentially through inward rectifying, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. KATP channels are present on several different cell types and help to maintain excitatory thresholds throughout the brain. KATP channels are sensitive to changes in the metabolic environment, which are coupled to changes in cellular excitability. Therefore, we hypothesized that neuronal KATP channels are necessary for the hyperglycemic-dependent increases in extracellular A{beta} and eliminating KATP channel activity will uncouple the relationship between metabolism, excitability, and A{beta} pathology. First, we demonstrate that Kir6.2/KCNJ11, the pore forming subunits, and SUR1/ABCC8, the sulfonylurea receptors, are predominantly expressed on excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the human brain and that cortical expression of KCNJ11 and ABCC8 change with AD pathology in humans and rodent models. Next, we crossed APP/PS1 mice with Kir6.2 -/- mice, which lack neuronal KATP channel activity, to define the relationship between KATP channels, A{beta}, and hyperglycemia. Using in vivo microdialysis and hyperglycemic clamps, we explored how acute elevations in peripheral blood glucose levels impacted hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose, lactate, and A{beta} levels in APP/PS1 mice with or without KATP channels. Kir6.2+/+, APP/PS1 mice and Kir6.2-/-, APP/PS1 mice were exposed to a high sucrose diet for 6 months to determine the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on A{beta} deposition. We found that elevations in blood glucose levels correlate with increased ISF A{beta}, amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and amyloid plaque pathology in APP/PS mice with intact KATP channels. However, neither acute hyperglycemia nor chronic sucrose overconsumption raised ISF A{beta} or increased A{beta} plaque burden in APP/PS1 mice lacking Kir6.2-KATP channel activity. Mechanistic studies demonstrate ISF glucose not only correlates with ISF A{beta} but also ISF lactate. Without KATP channel activity, ISF lactate does not increase during hyperglycemia, which correlates with decreased monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) expression, a lactate transporter responsible for astrocytic lactate release. This suggests that KATP channel activity regulates ISF lactate during hyperglycemia, which is important for A{beta} release and aggregation. These studies identify a new role for Kir6.2-KATP channels in Alzheimer's disease pathology and suggest that pharmacological antagonism of Kir6.2-KATP channels holds therapeutic promise in reducing A{beta} pathology, especially in diabetic and prediabetic patients.

                Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulse and flow throughout the brain, driven by the cardiac cycle. These fluid dynamics, which are essential to healthy brain function, are characterized by several noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. Recent developments in fast MRI, specifically simultaneous multislice (SMS) acquisition methods, provide a new opportunity to rapidly and broadly assess cardiac-driven flow, including CSF spaces, surface vessels and parenchymal vessels. We use these techniques to assess blood and CSF flow dynamics in brief (3.5 minute) scans on a conventional 3T MRI scanner. Cardiac pulses are measured with a photoplethysmograph (PPG) on the index finger, along with fMRI signals in the brain. We retrospectively analyze the fMRI signals gated to the heart beat. Highly reliable cardiac-gated fMRI temporal signals are observed in CSF and blood on the timescale of one heartbeat (test-retest reliability within subjects R2>0.50). Cardiac pulsations with a local minimum following systole are observed in blood vessels, with earlier extrema in the carotid and basilar arteries and in branches of the anterior, posterior and middle cerebral arteries and extrema ~200 ms later in the superior sagittal, transverse and straight sinuses. CSF spaces in the ventricles and subarachnoid space showed cardiac pulsations with a local maximum following systole instead. Similar responses are observed, with less temporal detail, in slower resting state scans with slice timing retrospectively aligned to the cardiac pulse in the same manner. The SMS measurements rapidly, noninvasively and reliably sample brain-wide fMRI signal pulsations aligned to the heartbeat. The measurements estimate the amplitude and phase of cardiac driven fMRI pulsations in the CSF relative to those in the arteries, which is thought to be an estimate of the local intracranial impedance. Cardiac aligned fMRI signals can provide new insights about fluid dynamics or diagnostics for diseases where these dynamics are important.

                Integrating physiology with structural insights of the same neuronal circuit provides a unique approach to understanding how the mammalian brain computes information. However, combining the techniques that provide both streams of data represents an experimental challenge. When studying glomerular column circuits in the mouse olfactory bulb, this approach involves e.g. recording the neuronal activity with in vivo 2-photon (2P) calcium imaging, retrieving the circuit structure with synchrotron X-ray computed tomography with propagation-based phase contrast (SXRT) and/or serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) and correlating these datasets. Sample preparation and dataset correlation are two key bottlenecks in this correlative workflow. Here, we first quantify the occurrence of different artefacts when staining tissue slices with heavy metals to generate X-ray or electron contrast. We report improvements in the staining procedure, ultimately achieving perfect staining in ~67% of the 0.6 mm thick olfactory bulb slices that were previously imaged in vivo with 2P. Secondly, we characterise the accuracy of the spatial correlation between functional and structural datasets. We demonstrate that direct, single-cell precise correlation between in vivo 2P and SXRT tissue volumes is possible and as reliable as correlating between 2P and SBEM. Altogether, these results pave the way for experiments that require retrieving physiology, circuit structure and synaptic signatures in targeted regions. These correlative function-structure studies will bring a more complete understanding of mammalian olfactory processing across length scales and time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network communication models narrow the gap between the modular organization of structural and functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Structural and functional brain networks are modular. Canonical functional systems, such as the default mode network, are well-known modules of the human brain and have been implicated in a large number of cognitive, behavioral and clinical processes. However, modules delineated in structural brain networks inferred from tractography generally do not recapitulate canonical functional systems. Neuroimaging evidence suggests that functional connectivity between regions in the same systems is not always underpinned by anatomical connections. As such, direct structural connectivity alone would be insufficient to characterize the functional modular organization of the brain. Here, we demonstrate that augmenting structural brain networks with models of indirect (polysynaptic) communication unveils a modular network architecture that more closely resembles the brain's established functional systems. We find that diffusion models of polysynaptic connectivity, particularly communicability, narrow the gap between the modular organization of structural and functional brain networks by 20-60%, whereas routing models based on single efficient paths do not improve mesoscopic structure-function correspondence. This suggests that functional modules emerge from the constraints imposed by local network structure that facilitates diffusive neural communication. Our work establishes the importance of modeling polysynaptic communication to understand the structural basis of functional systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unsupervised physiological noise correction of fMRI data using phase and magnitude information (PREPAIR)</a></h4>

              
                Of the sources of noise which affect BOLD fMRI, respiration and cardiac fluctuations are responsible for the largest part of the variance, particularly at high and ultra-high field. Existing approaches to removing physiological noise either use external recordings, which can be unwieldy and unreliable, or attempt to identify physiological noise from the magnitude fMRI data. Data-driven approaches are limited by sensitivity, temporal aliasing and the need for user interaction. In the light of the sensitivity of the phase of the MR signal to local changes in the field stemming from physiological processes, we have developed an unsupervised physiological noise correction method which uses the information carried in both the phase and the magnitude of EPI data. Our technique, Physiological Regressor Estimation from Phase and mAgnItude, sub-tR (PREPAIR) derives time series signals which are sampled at the slice TR from both phase and magnitude images. It allows physiological noise to be captured without aliasing, and efficiently removes other sources of signal fluctuations which are not related to physiology, prior to regressor estimation. We demonstrate that the physiological signal time courses identified with PREPAIR not only agree well with those from external devices, but also retrieve challenging cardiac dynamics. The removal of physiological noise was as effective as that achieved with the most commonly used approach based on external recordings, RETROICOR. In comparison with widely used physiological noise correction tools which do not use external signals, PESTICA and FIX, PREPAIR removed more respiratory and cardiac noise and achieved a larger increase in tSNR at both 3 T and 7 T.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Methodological Framework to Assess the Accuracy of Virtual Reality Hand-Tracking Systems: A case study with the Oculus Quest 2</a></h4>

              
                Optical marker-less hand-tracking systems incorporated into virtual reality (VR) headsets are transforming the ability to assess motor skills, including hand movements, in VR. This promises to have far-reaching implications for the increased applicability of VR across scientific, industrial and clinical settings. However, so far, there is little data regarding the accuracy, delay and overall performance of these types of hand-tracking systems. Here we present a novel methodological framework which can be easily applied to measure these systems' absolute positional error, temporal delay and finger joint-angle accuracy. We used this framework to evaluate the Meta Quest 2 hand-tracking system. Our results showed an average fingertip positional error of 1.1 cm, an average finger joint angle error of 9.6{degrees} and an average temporal delay of 38.0 ms. Finally, a novel approach was developed to correct for these positional errors based on a lens distortion model. This methodological framework provides a powerful tool to ensure the reliability and validity of data originating from VR-based, marker-less hand-tracking systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cardiac and gastric interoception have distinct neural substrates</a></h4>

              
                The functional roles of interoception or senses that arise from within the body have been thought to guide the agents in adaptive behavior by informing of various bodily states such as a heart rate or energy status. However, direct evidence that the different types of interoception are processed or represented differently in the human brain is still lacking. Here, we directly compared the neural activation for cardiac (awareness related to heartbeats) and gastric (awareness related to stomach) interoception in the same population (N = 31) where the participants were asked to focus on sensations of their heart and stomach in the magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The result showed that neural activation underlying gastric interoception encompassed the sensorimotor and reward-related regions when compared to cardiac interoception, including the occipitotemporal visual cortices, bilateral primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral hippocampal regions. Conversely, cardiac interoception selectively activated the right frontal operculum/insula in contrast to gastric interoception. Moreover, we found that the left dorsal middle insula encoded cardiac and gastric interoception differently but the posterior insula was not by performing multivoxel pattern analysis. Our results demonstrated that cardiac and gastric interoception, different types of bodily awareness, have distinct neural substrates particularly relevant to the functions for each interoception for the first time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prefrontally Modulated Vagal Tone Inhibits Inflammatory Responses to Prevent Telomere Damage in Healthy Participants</a></h4>

              
                Background: Accumulated senescent cells are proposed to be one of the main drivers of age-related pathology through disruption of tissue structure and function. We recently proposed the Neuro-Immuno-Senescence Integrative Model (NISIM; Ask et al., 2018) which relates prefrontally modulated vagal tone and subsequent balance between vagal and sympathetic input to the spleen to inflammatory responses leading to generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative telomere damage. The NISIM is based on converging evidence and argues for the existence of a prefrontal cortex-autonomic nervous system-spleen (PAS) axis, suggesting that the inflammation that induces reactive oxygen species-generation is downstream of this axis. Aim: In this study, we aim to assess inflammation as a mediator in the relationship between prefrontally modulated vagal tone and leukocyte telomere length to test the hypothesis that PAS axis dysregulation accelerates cellular aging. We also assess the relationship between a recently proposed index of vagal immunomodulation (vagal tone/inflammation ratio; NIM index; Gidron et al., 2018) and telomere length, and compare results between the NIM index and vagal tone as predictors of telomere length. Methods: This study uses participant data from a large nationally representative longitudinal study since 1974 with a total of 45,000 Norwegian residents so far. A sub-sample of 1372 participants from which vagal tone, C Reactive Protein, and leukocyte telomere length could be obtained were included in the study. Relationships were analyzed with hierarchical multiple linear regression using either vagal tone and C Reactive Protein or the NIM index to predict telomere length. Sleeping problems, tobacco use status, alcohol use status, time since last meal, and symptoms of depression were included as control variables. Results: In the mediation analysis, vagal tone was a significant positive predictor of telomere length, while C Reactive Protein was a significant negative predictor of telomere length. This relationship remained significant when individually controlling for some but not all confounding variables. The NIM index was a significant positive predictor of telomere length. This relationship remained significant when controlling for all confounding variables except one. In a reduced dataset excluding all participants where confounders were present, the NIM index remained a significant predictor of telomere length. Conclusion: This is the first study suggesting that PAS axis activity is associated with telomere length thus supporting the NISIM. Results indicate that the NIM index is a more sensitive indicator of PAS axis activity than vagal tone and C Reactive Protein in isolation. Clinical relevance and suggestions for future research are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long noncoding RNA MEG3 activates neuronal necroptosis in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal cell loss is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it remains unclear how neurons die and how this relates to other defining characteristics of the disease. Existing in vivo AD models only partially recapitulate the neuropathology of AD with very mild or no neuronal cell loss. Here we demonstrate that human neurons xenografted in mouse brain exposed to amyloid pathology develop sarkosyl-insoluble tau filaments, positive Gallyas silver staining, release phosphorylated tau (P-tau181) into the blood, and display considerable neuronal cell loss, providing a model for the induction of full Tau pathology by simple exposure to amyloid pathology in AD. The alterations are specific to human neurons and contrast with the mild effects exhibited in mouse neurons. A core transcriptional program in the human neurons is characterized by strong upregulation of MEG3, a neuron-specific long noncoding RNA. MEG3 is also strongly upregulated in neurons from AD patients in situ. MEG3 expression alone is sufficient to induce necroptosis in human neurons in vitro. Orally administered small molecule receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase -1 and -3 inhibitors rescued the neuronal cell loss in this novel AD model. Thus, xenografted human neurons are uniquely sensitive to amyloid pathology, recapitulate all the defining neuropathological features of AD, and ultimately die by necroptosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ethanol exposure alters Alzheimer's-related pathology, behavior, and metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Epidemiological studies suggest that alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the mechanisms underlying this relationship are poorly understood. Preclinical studies consistently show that chronic, high dose ethanol exposure increases amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau pathology, hallmarks of AD, in rodent models. Conversely, other studies suggest that moderate ethanol consumption may also be protective against AD-related pathology. Thus, we used a modified two-bottle choice paradigm to identify how chronic ethanol exposure, at moderate levels, alters A{beta}-related pathology, cognitive performance, and metabolism. Over the course of the experiment, APP/PS1 mice consumed more ethanol than wild-type mice. This led to changes in food and water consumption in APP/PS1 mice, where ethanol-exposed APP/PS1 mice displayed a circadian shift in eating behavior. Ethanol-exposed APP/PS1 mice displayed glucose intolerance, a marker of insulin resistance, even though fasting blood glucose levels and body weights were comparable across all groups. Ethanol-exposed APP/PS1 mice exhibited deficits in nest building, a metric of self-care, as well as increased locomotor activity and central zone exploration in an open field test. Ethanol exposure also led to decreased brain mass, specifically in APP/PS1 mice, suggesting an interaction between ethanol exposure, amyloid pathology, and neurodegeneration. While there was a trend towards increased cortical A{beta} deposition, there was a shift in the distribution of plaque size and numbers, with ethanol-exposed APP/PS1 mice showing a greater number of smaller plaques than H2O-exposed APP/PS1 mice. Finally, we used in vivo microdialysis to explore whether acute ethanol modulates hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF) A{beta} and ISF glucose levels in unrestrained, APP/PS1 mice. Acute intraperitoneal injection of ethanol led to a rapid rise in ISF ethanol and directly ISF A{beta} (e.g. decreasing during acute exposure and increasing during acute withdrawal), and ISF glucose levels in the hippocampus. Together, these studies indicate that chronic ethanol, even at moderate doses, is sufficient to exacerbate an Alzheimer's-like phenotype in APP/PS1 mice through the direct modulation of A{beta}.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring the link between Parkinson's disease and Diabetes Mellitus in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in blood. Recent epidemiological studies are highlighting the link between both diseases; it is even considered that DM might be a risk factor for PD. To further investigate the likely relation of these diseases, we have used a Drosophila PD model based on inactivation of the DJ-1{beta} gene (ortholog of human DJ-1), and diet-induced Drosophila and mouse T2DM models, together with human neuron-like cells. T2DM models were obtained by feeding flies with a high sugar containing medium, and mice with a high fat diet. Our results showed that both fly models exhibit common phenotypes such as alterations in carbohydrate homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction or motor defects, among others. In addition, we demonstrated that T2DM might be a risk factor of developing PD since our diet-induced fly and mouse T2DM models present DA neurodegeneration, a hallmark of PD. We have also confirmed that neurodegeneration is caused by increased glucose levels, which has detrimental effects in human neuron-like cells by triggering apoptosis and leading to cell death. Besides, the observed phenotypes were exacerbated in DJ-1{beta} mutants cultured in the high sugared medium, indicating that DJ-1 might have a role in carbohydrate homeostasis. Finally, we have confirmed that metformin, an antidiabetic drug, is a potential candidate for PD treatment and that it could prevent PD onset in T2DM model flies. This result supports antidiabetic drugs as promising PD therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representational dynamics of memories for real-life events</a></h4>

              
                The continuous flow of experience that characterizes real-life events is not recorded as such in episodic memory. The unfolding of events is represented as a succession of moments of prior experience (referred to as "experience units") that are separated by temporal discontinuities, such that events are temporally compressed when remembered. To unravel the neural basis of this temporal structure of episodic memories, we recorded a series of real-life events using wearable camera technology and then used fMRI to investigate brain activity during the temporal unfolding of these events in memory. We found that, compared to the representation of static scenes in memory, dynamically unfolding memory representations were associated with greater activation of posterior brain regions that support episodic recollection (i.e., the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and angular gyrus). Strikingly, by analyzing the autocorrelation of brain activity patterns at successive time points throughout the retrieval period, we found that these brain regions showed higher temporal dynamics when remembering the unfolding of events compared to static scenes. Furthermore, these effects were more pronounced when recalling events that included a higher density of experience units (i.e., actions compared to spatial displacements). These results reveal the key role of the posterior medial network in representing the dynamic unfolding of event segments that constitute episodic memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced sensorimotor beta dynamics could represent a "slowed movement state" in healthy individuals</a></h4>

              
                Beta oscillations (~13-30 Hz) recorded from the sensorimotor cortex have canonical amplitude changes during movement. Specifically, a movement-related beta decrease (MRBD) occurs before movement, and a post-movement beta rebound (PMBR) follows. We investigated how the MRBD and PMBR vary with movement speed. Individuals performed a task with blocks that generated longer reaction times (RTs) and shorter RTs (Slow and Fast blocks, respectively) while scalp-electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The timing of task events before movement was also modulated to generate blocks with certain and uncertain timing (Fixed and Varied blocks, respectively). Beta modulation was reduced in Slow blocks compared to Fast blocks (i.e., a less negative MRBD and less positive PMBR). For the movement certainty manipulation, we saw mixed behavioral and EEG results. Our primary findings align with previous work which has shown reduced movement-related beta modulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. We propose that a "slowed movement state", whether it is experimentally induced or a manifestation of Parkinson's disease bradykinesia, is represented through reduced beta dynamics. Altogether, the MRBD and PMBR may represent motor speed on a continuum with Parkinson's disease as an extreme example of slowed movement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Active haptic training improves somatosensory-motor feedback control in the motor skills of experts</a></h4>

              
                A common problem experts experience is the challenge of overcoming the ceiling effects of highly trained sensorimotor skills. Recent studies have demonstrated that the amount of practice fails to explain interindividual variation in experts' motor expertise, implicating hidden bottlenecks that prevent experts from overcoming this ceiling. Here, we show that somatosensory function in motion is one that defines further improvement of the sensorimotor skills of expert pianists. We found that even in expert pianists, specialized training that was designed to enhance somatosensory perception in motion improved sensorimotor skills in which feedback, but not feedforward, control plays a predominant role. Furthermore, training increased reliance on afferent information in motion relative to predictive information that could originate from internal models of movement. Together, these findings suggest that enhancement of somatosensory processing in motion improves the somatosensory-motor feedback loop and thereby enabling experts to surpass the ceiling that initially limited their motor expertise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The impact of familiarity on cortical taste coding</a></h4>

              
                The role of the gustatory region of the insular cortex in mediating associative taste learning, such as conditioned taste aversion, has been well studied. However, while associative learning plays a role in some taste behaviors, such as avoidance of toxins, taste stimuli are often encountered by animals in their natural environment without explicit consequences. This type of inconsequential experience with sensory stimuli has been studied in other sensory systems, generally with the finding that neuronal responses habituate with repeated sensory exposure. The present study sought to determine the effect of taste familiarity on population taste coding in mouse gustatory cortex (GC). Using microendoscope calcium imaging, we studied the taste responses of visually identifiable neurons over five days of taste experience, during which animals could freely choose to consume taste stimuli. We found that the number of active cells in insular cortex, as well as the number of cells characterized as taste-responsive, significantly decreased as animals became familiar with taste stimuli. Moreover, the magnitude of taste-evoked excited responses increased, and inhibited responses decreased with experience. By tracking individual neurons over time, we focused on taste coding in a subpopulation of "stable" neurons that were present on all days of the taste familiarity paradigm. The population-level response across these stable cells was distinct when taste stimuli were novel but became more intercorrelated among those taste stimuli mice willingly consumed as the stimuli became familiar. Overall, these results highlight the effects of familiarity on taste responses in gustatory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The virtual aging brain: a model-driven explanation for cognitive decline in older subjects</a></h4>

              
                Healthy aging is accompanied by heterogeneous decline of cognitive abilities among individuals, especially during senescence. The mechanisms of this variability are not understood, but have been associated with the reorganization of white matter fiber tracts and the functional co-activations of brain regions. Here, we built a causal inference framework to provide mechanistic insight into the link between structural connectivity and brain function, informed by brain imaging data and network modeling. By applying various degrees of interhemispheric degradation of structural connectivity, we were not only able to reproduce the age-related decline in interhemispheric functional communication and the associated dynamical flexibility, but we obtained an increase of global modulation of structural connectivity over the brain function during senescence. Notably, the increase in modulation between structural connectivity and brian function was higher in magnitude and steeper in its increase in older adults with poor cognitive performance. We independently validated the causal hypothesis of our framework via a Bayesian approach based on deep-learning. The current results might be the first mechanistic demonstration of dedifferentiation and scaffolding during aging leading to cognitive decline demonstrated in a large cohort.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuromodulation due to propofol affects anesthetic oscillatory coupling</a></h4>

              
                The anesthetic propofol produces prominent oscillatory signatures on the EEG. Despite the strong correlation between oscillations and the anesthetic state, the fundamental mechanisms of this unconsciousness remain unknown. On the EEG, propofol elicits alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz), slow oscillations (0.5-2.0 Hz), and dose-dependent phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between these rhythms. A low enough dose causes "trough-max" PAC, where alpha oscillation amplitude is consistently maximal during slow troughs; this occurs at the same time as arousable unconsciousness. A high enough dose causes consistent "peak-max" PAC, where alpha amplitude is maximal during the slow peak, at the same time as unarousable unconsciousness. Much of the anesthetic state is dominated by a mixture of both states. Using thalamocortical Hodgkin-Huxley simulations, we show that, in addition to propofol effects on GABAA synapses and thalamocortical H-currents, propofol-induced changes to neuromodulation may generate LFP oscillations and their dose-dependent coupling. We show this for acetylcholine specifically, though other neuromodulators may produce the same effects. We find that LFP- and EEG- relevant synapses of local thalamocortical circuits stochastically display either trough-max or peak-max PAC on any given slow cycle. Trough-max PAC signals are present only in thalamocortical synaptic currents, and not identifiable via membrane potentials alone. PAC preference depends critically on the neuromodulatory state, which is dose-dependent: high doses are associated with statistically more peak-max than trough-max, and vice-versa. This is caused by increased cortical synchronization at higher doses. Our results have important consequences for analyzing LFP/EEG data, in that local network trough- or peak-max may only be seen on a cycle-by-cycle basis, and not when averaging. We hypothesize that this increased cortical synchronization leads to an inability to process signals in a flexible manner needed for awake cognition.

	<p>Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor, and its prognosis is poor. Glioma cells are highly invasive to the brain parenchyma. It is difficult to achieve complete resection due to the nature of the brain tissue, and tumors that invade the parenchyma often recur. The invasiveness of tumor cells has been studied from various aspects, and the related molecular mechanisms are gradually becoming clear. Cell adhesion factors and extracellular matrix factors have a strong influence on glioma invasion. The molecular mechanisms that enhance the invasiveness of glioma stem cells, which have been investigated in recent years, have also been clarified. In addition, it has been discussed from both basic and clinical perspectives that current therapies can alter the invasiveness of tumors, and there is a need to develop therapeutic approaches to glioma invasion in the future. In this review, we will summarize the factors that influence the invasiveness of glioma based on the environment of tumor cells and tissues, and describe the impact of the treatment of glioma on invasion in terms of molecular biology, and the novel therapies for invasion that are currently being developed.</p>

	<p>The consequences of the pandemic on mental health are among the most important side effects of COVID-19. Wide concerns have emerged both regarding vaccine hesitation in the general population, and the vaccine&amp;amp;rsquo;s implementation plan. The aim of this study is to evaluate how the scientific community has investigated the relationship between the COVID-19 vaccine and mental disorders. Contrary to expectations, having a full-blown psychiatric pathology seems to positively affect the attitude towards the vaccine, except for PTSD. The intense fear that accompanied the current world emergency has made this pandemic unique; we discuss how it might be one of the factors involved in this result. Further experimental investigations are needed to estimate how personality traits, hyperarousal, and negative emotions influence vaccine compliance both in the general population and in people living with mental disorders.</p>

                Exposure to pesticides in humans increases the risk of Parkinsons disease (PD), but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. To elucidate these pathways, we dosed C57BL/6J mice with a combination of the pesticides maneb and paraquat (MNPQ). Behavioral analysis revealed motor deficits consistent with PD. Single cell RNA sequencing of substantia nigra pars compacta revealed both cell-type specific genes and genes expressed differentially between pesticide and control, including Fam241b, Emx2os, Bivm, Gm1439, Prdm15 and Rai2. Neurons had the largest number of significant differentially expressed genes, but comparable numbers were found in astrocytes and less so in oligodendrocytes. In addition, network analysis revealed enrichment in functions related to the extracellular matrix. These findings emphasize the importance of support cells in pesticide-induced PD and refocus our attention away from neurons as the sole agent of this disorder.

                Three-dimensional retinal organoids (3D-retinas) are a promising graft source for transplantation therapy. We previously developed self-organizing culture for 3D-retina generation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Here we present a quality control method and preclinical studies for tissue-sheet transplantation. Self-organizing hPSCs differentiated into both retinal and off-target tissues. Gene expression analyses identified the major off-target tissues as eye-related, cortex-like, and spinal cord-like tissues. For quality control, we developed a qPCR-based test in which each hPSC- derived neuroepithelium was dissected into two tissue-sheets: inner-central sheet for transplantation and outer-peripheral sheet for qPCR to ensure retinal tissue selection. During qPCR, tissue-sheets were stored for 3-4 days using a newly developed preservation method. In a rat tumorigenicity study, no transplant-related adverse events were observed. In retinal degeneration model rats, retinal transplants differentiated into mature photoreceptors and exhibited light responses in electrophysiology assays. These results demonstrate our rationale toward self-organizing retinal sheet transplantation therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interplay between external inputs and recurrent dynamics during movement preparation and execution in a network model of motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                The primary motor cortex has been shown to coordinate movement preparation and execution through computations in approximately orthogonal subspaces. The underlying network mechanisms, and in particular the roles played by external and recurrent connectivity, are central open questions that need to be answered to understand the neural substrates of motor control. We develop a recurrent neural network model that recapitulates the temporal evolution of single-unit activity recorded from M1 of a macaque monkey during an instructed delayed-reach task. We explore the hypothesis that the observed dynamics of neural covariation with the direction of motion emerges from a synaptic connectivity structure that depends on the preferred directions of neurons in both preparatory and movement-related epochs. We constrain the strength both of synaptic connectivity and of external input parameters by using the data as well as an external input minimization cost. Our analysis suggests that the observed patterns of covariance are shaped by external inputs that are tuned to neurons preferred directions during movement preparation, and they are dominated by strong direction-specific recurrent connectivity during movement execution, in agreement with recent experimental findings on the relationship between motor-cortical and motor-thalamic activity, both before and during movement execution. We also demonstrate that the manner in which single-neuron tuning properties rearrange over time can explain the level of orthogonality of preparatory and movement-related subspaces. We predict that the level of orthogonality is small enough to prevent premature movement initiation during movement preparation; however, it is not zero, which allows the network to encode a stable direction of motion at the population level without direction-specific external inputs during movement execution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Larger lesion volume in people with multiple sclerosis is associated with increased transition energies between brain states and decreased entropy of brain activity</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundNeuronal loss, demyelination, and inflammation in the brains of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) can cause impairment or disability across a range of domains. However, the mapping between severity or location of this brain tissue damage and an individuals impairment remains challenging. Advanced neuroimaging techniques may enable us to better understand the neuropathological or compensatory mechanisms in MS and quantify the link between the brains functional activity and its structural backbone. One recently developed approach uses network control theory to characterize the brains energetic landscape using an individuals structural connectome and brain activity dynamics. While brain activity dynamics have previously been analyzed in MS cohorts, investigating how structural network damage, one of the hallmarks of MS, relates to shifts in activity dynamics has not yet been performed.

AimsWe apply brain activity dynamics analysis and network control theory (NCT) to functional time series and structural connectomes in healthy controls (HC) and pwMS with and without disability and compare the three groups resulting metrics. We also assessed the entropy of the three groups brain activity time series. Our hypotheses were that pwMS with disability would have increased brain state transition energies compared to pwMS without disability and controls, and that greater energies would be related to greater lesion burden and decreased entropy of brain activity.

Materials and MethodsNinety-nine pwMS and 19 HC were included in our study; individuals underwent MRI, including anatomical, diffusion and resting-state functional scans. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to assess disability; 66 pwMS with EDSS<2 were considered as not having disability. Commonly recurring brain states were identified using k-means clustering of the regional brain activity time series. NCT was used to compute the energy required to transition between each pair of states or to remain in the same state, taking into account an individuals structural connectome. The entropy of brain activity time series was quantified and correlated with overall transition energy and lesion volume. Finally, logistic regression with ridge regularization was used to classify the groups using transition energies and demographics/clinical information and the models feature importance assessed.

ResultsSix brain states were identified, including pairs of states with high and low visual (VIS+/-), ventral attention (VAN)+/- and somatomotor (SOM+/-) network activity. Global entropy was negatively correlated with lesion volume (r=-0.20, p=0.03) as was global transition energy (r=-0.18, p=0.04) in pwMS. Smaller transition energies were associated with pwMS without disability, while larger transition energies were associated with pwMS with disability.

DiscussionWe conjecture that functional compensation of brain activity in pwMS without disability results in decreased transition energies between states compared to controls, but, as this mechanism diminishes, transition energies increase and disability occurs. We also conjecture that larger volumes of MS-related lesions result in greater energetic demands to transition between brain states which then leads to lower overall entropy of brain activity.

Immune activation is abundant in the striatum of HD patients. Detection of active microglia at presymptomatic stages suggests that microgliosis is a key early driver of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Recent studies showed that deletion of Tyrobp, a microglial-enriched protein, ameliorates neuronal function in Alzheimers disease amyloid and tauopathy mouse models while decreasing components of the complement subnetwork, thus raising the possibility that Tyrobp deletion can be beneficial for HD.

METHODSTo test the hypothesis that Tyrobp deficiency would be beneficial in a HD model, we placed the Q175 HD mouse model on a Tyrobp-null background. We characterized these mice with a combination of behavioral testing, immunohistochemistry, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling. Further, we evaluated the Q175 microglia-specific gene signature, with and without Tyrobp, by purifying microglia from these mice for transcriptomics.

RESULTSComprehensive analysis of publicly available transcriptomic HD human data revealed that TYROBP network is overactivated in HD putamen. The Q175 mice showed morphologic microglial activation, reduced levels of post-synaptic density-95 protein and motor deficits at 6 and 9 months of age, all of which were ameliorated on the Tyrobp-null background. Gene expression analysis revealed that lack of Tyrobp in the Q175 model does not prevent the decrease in the expression of striatal neuronal genes but reduces pro-inflammatory pathways that are specifically active in HD human brain. Integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data identified that astrogliosis and complement system pathway were reduced after Tyrobp deletion. Results were further validated by immunofluorescence analysis. Microglia-specific HD gene dysregulation, characterized by overexpression of neuronal genes, was also not corrected by Tyrobp deletion.

CONCLUSIONSOur data provide molecular and functional support demonstrating that Tyrobp deletion prevents many of the abnormalities in the Q175 HD mouse model, in the absence of correction of striatal neuronal gene expression, suggesting that the Tyrobp pathway is a potential therapeutic candidate for Huntingtons disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of sleep by trafficking of lipids through the Drosophila blood brain barrier</a></h4>

              
                Endocytosis through Drosophila glia is a significant determinant of sleep amount and occurs preferentially during sleep in glia of the blood brain barrier (BBB). To identify metabolites whose trafficking is mediated by sleep-dependent endocytosis, we conducted metabolomic analysis of flies that have increased sleep due to a block in glial endocytosis. We report that acylcarnitines, molecules that conjugate with long chain fatty acids to promote their transport, accumulate in heads of these animals. In parallel, to identify transporters and receptors whose loss contributes to the sleep phenotype caused by blocked endocytosis, we screened genes enriched in barrier glia for effects on sleep. We find that knockdown of lipid transporters LRP1&2 as well as carnitine transporters ORCT1&2 increases sleep. In support of the idea that the block in endocytosis affects trafficking through specific transporters, knockdown of LRP or ORCT transporters also increases acylcarnitines in heads. We propose that lipid species, such as acylcarnitines, are trafficked through the BBB via sleep-dependent endocytosis, and their accumulation in the brain increases the need for sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Experience-dependent learning and myelin plasticity in individuals with stroke</a></h4>

              
                Injury to brain myelin disrupts motor performance and learning, however it is not clear if myelination is modulated by skilled motor practice or by recovery after stroke. Multi-component relaxation imaging can be used to measure water trapped between myelin bilayers which is expressed as myelin water fraction.The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of experience-dependent learning on myelin plasticity using multi-component relaxation imaging in individuals with stroke. Thirty-two individuals with chronic stroke (>6 months) and twenty-seven healthy controls completed 4 weeks of skilled motor practice using a complex, gamified reaching task. Multi-component relaxation imaging-derived myelin water fraction was obtained before and after training. Seven brain regions associated with motor learning and sensorimotor function were investigated. All participants improved task-specific reaching movements after training. In individuals with stroke: 1) pre-training myelin water fraction was lower in motor brain regions but higher in the cingulum compared to controls, 2) pre-training myelin water fraction in motor and sensorimotor regions was positively associated with learning rate, and 3) myelin water fraction was increased in the ipsilesional (contralateral to the trained arm) superior longitudinal fasciculus following skilled motor practice. Findings indicate that after stroke, myelin water fraction is related to measures of motor learning and modulated by 4 weeks of skilled motor practice with the paretic limb. Myelin water fraction can be enhanced in the chronic stage of stroke and may be an important target for upper-limb motor recovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid motor adaptation to bounce perturbations in online Pong game is independent from the visual tilt of the bouncing surface</a></h4>

              
                Motor adaptation describes the ability of the motor system to counteract repeated perturbations in order to reduce movement errors. Most research in the field investigated adaptation in response to perturbations affecting the moving hand. Fewer studies looked at the effect of a perturbation applied to the movement target, however they used simplistic visual stimuli. In this study, we examined motor adaptation to perturbations affecting the motion of dynamic targets. In addition, we asked whether external visual cues in the environment could facilitate this process. To do so, participants were asked to play an online version of the Pong game in which they intercepted a ball bouncing off a wall using a paddle. A perturbation was applied to alter the post-bounce trajectory of the ball and the wall orientation was manipulated to be consistent or not with the ball trajectory. The "trained tilt" group (n = 34) adapted to the consistent condition and the "trained horizontal" group (n = 36) adapted to the inconsistent condition. In case participants optimally integrate external visual cues, the "trained tilt" group is expected to exhibit faster and/or more complete adaptation than the "trained horizontal" group. We found that the perturbation reduced interception accuracy. Participants showed large interception errors when the perturbation was introduced, followed by rapid error decrease and aftereffects (errors in the opposite direction) once the perturbation was removed. Although both experimental groups showed these typical markers of motor adaptation, we did not find differences in interception success rates or errors between the "trained tilt" and "trained horizontal" groups. Our results demonstrate that participants quickly adapted to the dynamics of the pong ball. However, the visual tilt of the bouncing surface did not enhance their performance. The present study highlights the ability of the motor system to adapt to external perturbations applied to a moving target in a more dynamical environment and in online settings. These findings underline the prospects of further research on sensorimotor adaptation to unexpected changes in the environment using more naturalistic and complex real-world or virtual reality tasks as well as gamified paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interaction mechanism between the HSV-1 glycoprotein B and the antimicrobial peptide Amyloid-β</a></h4>

              
                Unravelling the mystery of Alzheimer Disease (AD) requires urgent resolution given the worldwide increase of the aging population. There is a growing concern that the current leading AD hypothesis, the amyloid cascade hypothesis, does not stand up to validation with respect to emerging new data. Indeed, several paradoxes are being discussed in the literature, for instance, both the deposition of the Amyloid-Beta peptide (A{beta}) and the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) could occur within the brain without any cognitive pathology. Thus, these paradoxes suggest that something more fundamental is at play in the onset of the disease and other key and related pathomechanisms have to be investigated. The present study follows our previous investigations on the infectious hypothesis, which posits that some pathogens are linked to late onset AD. Our studies also build upon the shattering finding that A{beta} is a powerful antimicrobial agent capable of inhibiting pathogens as observed in in vitro experiments. Herein, we ask what are the molecular mechanisms in play when A{beta} neutralizes infectious pathogens? To answer this question, we probed at nanoscale lengths with FRET (Forster Resonance Energy Transfer), the interaction between A{beta} peptides and glycoprotein B (responsible of virus-cell binding) within the HSV-1 virion. We concluded that there is indeed a close interaction, likely nonspecific or semi-specific, between the two types of molecules, which participate in virus neutralization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interaction Interface between 5-HT3A serotonin receptor and chaperone RIC-3</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors type 3 (5-HT3) belong to the family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), which also includes other neurotransmitter-gated ion channels such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, {gamma}-amino butyric acid A receptors, and glycine receptors. pLGICs have been long-standing clinical targets for treating psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction, and neurological diseases like Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. Due to the highly-homologous structures of pLGICs extracellular and transmembrane domains, clinical trials for drug candidates targeting these domains have been largely hampered by undesired effects mediated by off-subunit modulation. With the present study, we explore the interaction interface of the 5-HT3A intracellular domain (ICD) with the resistance to inhibitors of choline esterase (RIC-3) chaperone. Protein-protein interactions are attractive and successful targets for contemporary drug development. Previously, we have shown that RIC-3 physically interacts with 5-HT3A subunits, and we identified the L1-MX fragment of the ICD fused to maltose-binding protein as sufficient for interaction. For the present study, synthetic L1-MX-based fragments and Ala-scanning were used to probe binding to RIC-3 using a pull-down assay. In complementary studies with full-length 5-HT3A subunits, we investigated the impact of these substitutions on modulation of functional surface expression by RIC-3 using two-electrode voltage-clamp recording after expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Our data demonstrate that the 5-HT3A-MX segment contains the interaction interface, and that residues W347, R349, and L353 are critical for the interaction with RIC-3.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sexually dimorphic architecture and function of a mechanosensory circuit in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                How sensory perception is processed by the two sexes of an organism is still only partially understood. Despite some evidence for sexual dimorphism in auditory and olfactory perception, whether touch is sensed in a dimorphic manner has not been addressed. Here we find that the neuronal circuit for tail mechanosensation in C. elegans is wired differently in the two sexes and employs a different combination of sex-shared sensory neurons and interneurons in each sex. Reverse genetic screens uncovered cell- and sex-specific functions of the alpha-tubulin mec-12 and the sodium channel tmc-1 in sensory neurons, and of the glutamate receptors nmr-1 and glr-1 in interneurons, revealing the underlying molecular mechanisms that mediate tail mechanosensation. Moreover, we show that only in males, the sex-shared interneuron AVG is strongly activated by tail mechanical stimulation, and accordingly is crucial for their behavioral response. Importantly, sex reversal experiments demonstrate that the sexual identity of AVG determines both the behavioral output of the mechanosensory response and the molecular pathways controlling it. Our results present for the first time extensive sexual dimorphism in a mechanosensory circuit at both the cellular and molecular levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Silencing KCC2 in mouse dorsal hippocampus compromises spatial and contextual memory</a></h4>

              
                Delayed upregulation of the neuronal chloride extruder KCC2 underlies the progressive shift in GABA signaling polarity during development. Conversely, KCC2 is downregulated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders often associated with cognitive impairment. Reduced KCC2 expression and function in mature networks may disrupt GABA signaling and promote anomalous network activities underlying these disorders. However, the causal link between KCC2 downregulation, altered brain rhythmogenesis and cognitive function remains elusive. Here, by combining behavioral exploration with in vivo electrophysiology we assessed the impact of chronic KCC2 silencing in mouse dorsal hippocampus and showed it compromises both spatial and contextual memory. This was associated with altered hippocampal rhythmogenesis and neuronal hyperexcitability, with increased CA1 pyramidal cell burst firing during non-REM sleep. Reducing neuronal excitability with terbinafine, a specific Task-3 leak potassium channel activator, occluded the impairment of contextual memory upon KCC2 silencing. Our results establish a causal relationship between KCC2 expression and cognitive performance and suggest that impaired rhythmopathies and neuronal hyperexcitability are central to the deficits caused by KCC2 silencing in the adult mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">D2 dopamine receptor expression, sensitivity to rewards, and reinforcement learning in a complex value-based decision-making task</a></h4>

              
                In the basal ganglia, different dopamine subtypes have opposing dynamics at post-synaptic receptors, with the ratio of D1 to D2 receptors determining the relative sensitivity to gains and losses, respectively, during value-based learning. This effective sensitivity to reward feedback interacts with phasic dopamine levels to determine the effectiveness of learning, particularly in dynamic feedback situations where frequency and magnitude of rewards need to be integrated over time to make optimal decisions. Using both simulations and behavioral data in humans, we evaluated how reduced sensitivity to losses, relative to gains, leads to suboptimal learning in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a complex value-learning task. In the behavioral data, we tested individuals with a variant of the human dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2; -141C Ins/Del and Del/Del) gene that associates with lower levels of D2 receptor expression (N=119) and compared their performance to non-carrier controls (N=319). The magnitude of the reward response was measured by looking at ventral striatal (VS) reactivity to rewards in the Cards task using fMRI. DRD2 variant carriers had generally lower performance in the IGT than non-carriers, consistent with reduced sensitivity to losses. There was also a positive association between VS reactivity and performance in the IGT, however, we found no statistically significant difference in this effect between DRD2 carriers and non-carriers. Thus, while reduced D2 receptor expression was associated with less efficient learning in the IGT, we did not find evidence for the moderation of this effect by the magnitude of the reward response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain signatures for neuropsychological and everyday memory achieve high replicability and explanatory power in two data cohorts</a></h4>

              
                Background: The brain signature of cognition concept has garnered interest as a data-driven, exploratory approach to better understand key brain regions involved in specific cognitive functions, with the potential to maximally characterize brain substrates of clinical outcomes. However, to be a robust brain phenotype, the signature approach requires a statistical foundation showing that model performance replicates across a variety of cohorts. Here, we outline a procedure that provides this foundation for a signature models of two memory-related behavioral domains. Method: In each of two independent data cohorts, we derived regional brain gray matter thickness associations for neuropsychological and everyday cognition memory, testing for replicability. In each cohort we computed regional association to outcome in 40 randomly selected discovery subsets of size 400; we generated spatial overlap frequency maps and selected high-frequency regions as consensus signature masks for each cohort. We tested replicability by comparing cohort-based consensus model fits in all discovery sets. We tested explanatory power in each full cohort, compare signature model fits with competing standard models of each outcome. Result: Spatial replications produced strongly convergent consensus signature regions derived from UCD and ADNI. Consensus model fits were highly correlated in 40 random subsets of each cohort indicating high replicability. In comparisons over each full cohort, signature models outperformed other models with one exception. Conclusion: Multiple random model generations, followed by consensus selection of regional brain substrates, produced signature models that replicated model fits to outcome and outperformed other commonly used measures. Robust biomarkers of cognition and everyday function may be achievable by this method.

	<p>The attentional response to eye-gaze stimuli is still largely unexplored in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, we focused on an attentional phenomenon according to which a direct-gaze face can hold attention in a perceiver. Individuals with OCD and a group of matched healthy controls were asked to discriminate, through a speeded manual response, a peripheral target. Meanwhile, a task-irrelevant face displaying either direct gaze (in the eye-contact condition) or averted gaze (in the no-eye-contact condition) was also presented at the centre of the screen. Overall, the latencies were slower for faces with direct gaze than for faces with averted gaze; however, this difference was reliable in the healthy control group but not in the OCD group. This suggests the presence of an unusual attentional response to direct gaze in this clinical population.</p>

	<p>After cerebellar stroke, cognition can be impaired, as described within the framework of the so-called Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome (CCAS). However, it remains unclear whether visual neglect can also be part of CCAS. We describe the case of a patient with a subacute cerebellar stroke after thrombosis of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), who showed a left-sided visual neglect, indicating that the cerebellum also has a modulatory function on visual attention. The neglect, however, was mild and only detectable when using the sensitive neuro-psychological Five-Point Test as well as video-oculography assessment, yet remained unnoticed when evaluated with common neglect-specific paper-pencil tests. Three weeks later, follow-up assessments revealed an amelioration of neglect symptoms. Therefore, these findings suggest that visual neglect may be a part of CCAS, but that the choice of neglect assessments and the time delay since stroke onset may be crucial. Although the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear, we propose cerebellar&amp;amp;ndash;cerebral diaschisis as a possible explanation of why neglect can occur on the ipsilateral side. Further research applying sensitive assessment tools at different post-stroke stages is needed to investigate the incidence, lesion correlates, and pathophysiology of neglect after cerebellar lesions.</p>

	<p>Non-invasive focused ultrasound stimulation (FUS) is a non-ionizing neuromodulatory technique that employs acoustic energy to acutely and reversibly modulate brain activity of deep-brain structures. It is currently being investigated as a potential novel treatment for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). This scoping review was carried out to map available evidence pertaining to the provision of FUS as a PD neuromodulatory tool. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews, a search was applied to Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on 13 January 2022, with no limits applied. In total, 11 studies were included: 8 were from China and 1 each from Belgium, South Korea and Taiwan. All 11 studies were preclinical (6 in vivo, 2 in vitro, 2 mix of in vivo and in vitro and 1 in silico). The preclinical evidence indicates that FUS is safe and has beneficial neuromodulatory effects on motor behaviour in PD. FUS appears to have a therapeutic role in influencing the disease processes of PD, and therefore holds great promise as an attractive and powerful neuromodulatory tool for PD. Though these initial studies are encouraging, further study to understand the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms is required before FUS can be routinely used in PD.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contains the largest population of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the central nervous system. 5-HT, synthesized via tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2), is a widely functioning neuromodulator implicated in fear learning. Here, we sought to investigate whether DRN 5-HT is necessary to reduce fear via negative prediction error (&ndash;PE). Using male and female TPH2-cre rats, DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells were selectively deleted via cre-caspase (rAAV5-Flex-taCasp3-TEVp) in experiment 1. Rats then underwent fear discrimination during which three cues were associated with unique foot shock probabilities: safety <I>p</I> = 0.00, uncertainty <I>p</I> = 0.375, and danger <I>p</I> = 1.00. Rats then received selective extinction to the uncertainty cue, a behavioral manipulation designed to probe &ndash;PE. Deleting DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells had no impact on initial discrimination but slowed selective extinction. In experiment 2, we used a within-subjects optogenetic inhibition design to causally implicate DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells in prediction error signaling. Male and female TPH2-cre rats received intra-DRN infusions of cre-dependent halorhodopsin (rAAV5-Ef1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP) or cre-YFP. DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells were inhibited specifically during the time of prediction error or a control period. Illumination during either positive prediction error (+PE) or control periods had no impact on fear to the uncertainty cue. Inhibition of DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells at the time of &ndash;PE did not impact immediate fear, but facilitated selective extinction in postillumination sessions. Together, these results demonstrate a role for DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells in using, but not generating, &ndash;PE to weaken cue-shock associations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Kv3 Channels Contribute to the Excitability of Subpopulations of Spinal Cord Neurons in Lamina VII</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Autonomic parasympathetic preganglionic neurons (PGNs) drive contraction of the bladder during micturition but remain quiescent during bladder filling. This quiescence is postulated to be because of recurrent inhibition of PGN by fast-firing adjoining interneurons. Here, we defined four distinct neuronal types within Lamina VII, where PGN are situated, by combining whole cell patch clamp recordings with k-means clustering of a range of electrophysiological parameters. Additional morphologic analysis separated these neuronal classes into parasympathetic preganglionic populations (PGN) and a fast-firing interneuronal population. Kv3 channels are voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) that allow fast and precise firing of neurons. We found that blockade of Kv3 channels by tetraethylammonium (TEA) reduced neuronal firing frequency and isolated high-voltage-activated Kv currents in the fast-firing population but had no effect in PGN populations. Furthermore, Kv3 blockade potentiated the local and descending inhibitory inputs to PGN indicating that Kv3-expressing inhibitory neurons are synaptically connected to PGN. Taken together, our data reveal that Kv3 channels are crucial for fast and regulated neuronal output of a defined population that may be involved in intrinsic spinal bladder circuits that underpin recurrent inhibition of PGN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characteristics of back pain in young adults and their relationship with dehydration: a cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the major factors impairing the quality of life and is the most frequent cause of disability. Inadequate water intake is believed to be the predisposing factor for LBP particularly in the younger population. It is commonly seen that the incidence of LBP has been on the rise in people between 20-40 years of age. Thus, the basic aim of this study is to find a potential relationship between dehydration and LBP among young adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from medical students and practicing doctors of 21-39 years from March-May 2019. Characteristics of pain along with the daily activities of patients were assessed. The severity was assessed by using the Graded Chronic pain scale (GCPS). Results: Out of a total of 426 participants, 84.74% had LBP. Of these, 44.3% complained of having it more than once a week, with a duration usually between 1-7 days. More than half of the patients had their routines disturbed because of this pain. Most of the participants complained of an episodic increase in summers. The majority (75.9%, n=274) drank 5-9 glasses of water a day, 64.5% of them were of opinion that their daily water consumption was enough, while 61.5% felt an association between dehydration and LBP. According to the GCPS, one-third of the population had chronic pain of grade I, and the other third had grade IV. Conclusions: It can be concluded that with the increase in the pace of life, many of the young adults have a reduced intake of water, and due to a probable relationship between LBP and dehydration, this might be a reason for the increasing propensity of LBP in them. There is a need for further work in this regard.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Modulation of lateral septal and dorsomedial striatal neurons by hippocampal sharp‐wave ripples, theta rhythm, and running speed</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Single units were recorded in hippocampus, lateral septum (LS), and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) while freely behaving rats (<i>n</i> = 3) ran trials in a T-maze task and rested in a holding bucket between trials. In LS, 28% (64/226) of recorded neurons were excited and 14% (31/226) were inhibited during sharp wave ripples (SWRs). LS neurons that were excited during SWRs fired preferentially on the downslope of hippocampal theta rhythm and had firing rates that were positively correlated with running speed; LS neurons that were inhibited during SWRs fired preferentially on the upslope of hippocampal theta rhythm and had firing rates that were negatively correlated with running speed. In DMS, only 3.3% (12/366) of recorded neurons were excited and 5.7% (21/366) were inhibited during SWRs. As in LS, DMS neurons that were excited by SWRs tended to have firing rates that were positively modulated by running speed, whereas DMS neurons that were inhibited by SWRs tended to have firing rates that were negatively modulated by running speed. But in contrast with LS, these two DMS subpopulations did not clearly segregate their spikes to different phases of the theta cycle. Based on these results and a review of prior findings, we discuss how concurrent activation of spatial trajectories in hippocampus and motor representations in LS and DMS may contribute to neural computations that support reinforcement learning and value-based decision making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Retrospective memory integration accompanies reconfiguration of neural cell assemblies</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory is a dynamic process that is based on and can be altered by experiences. Integrating memories of multiple experiences (memory integration) is the basis of flexible and complex decision-making. However, the mechanism of memory integration in neural networks of the brain remains poorly understood. In this study, we built a recurrent spiking network model and investigated the neural mechanism of memory integration before a decision is made (retrospective memory integration) at the neural circuit level. Our simulations suggest that retrospective memory integration accompanies reconfiguration of neural cell assemblies. Additionally, partially blocking neural network plasticity leads to failure of memory integration. These findings can potentially guide the experimental investigation of the neural mechanism of retrospective memory integration and serve as the basis for developing new artificial intelligence algorithms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Gradual decorrelation of CA3 ensembles associated with contextual discrimination learning is impaired by Kv1.2 insufficiency</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The associative network of hippocampal CA3 is thought to contribute to rapid formation of contextual memory from one-trial learning, but the network mechanisms underlying decorrelation of neuronal ensembles in CA3 is largely unknown. Kv1.2 expressions in rodent CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3-PCs) are polarized to distal apical dendrites, and its downregulation specifically enhances dendritic responses to perforant pathway (PP) synaptic inputs. We found that haploinsufficiency of Kv1.2 (<i>Kcna2</i>+/−) in CA3-PCs, but not Kv1.1 (<i>Kcna1</i>+/−), lowers the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP) at PP-CA3 synapses, and that the <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice are normal in discrimination of distinct contexts but impaired in discrimination of similar but slightly distinct contexts. We further examined the neuronal ensembles in CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG), which represent the two similar contexts using in situ hybridization of immediate early genes, Homer1a and Arc. The size and overlap of CA3 ensembles activated by the first visit to the similar contexts were not different between wild type and <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice, but these ensemble parameters diverged over training days between genotypes, suggesting that abnormal plastic changes at PP-CA3 synapses of <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice is responsible for the impaired pattern separation. Unlike CA3, DG ensembles were not different between two genotype mice. The DG ensembles were already separated on the first day, and their overlap did not further evolve. Eventually, the <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice exhibited larger CA3 ensemble size and overlap upon retrieval of two contexts, compared to wild type or <i>Kcna1</i>+/− mice. These results suggest that sparse LTP at PP-CA3 synapse probably supervised by mossy fiber inputs is essential for gradual decorrelation of CA3 ensembles.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Regular aerobic exercise is positively associated with hippocampal structure and function in young and middle‐aged adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Regular exercise has numerous benefits for brain health, including the structure and function of the hippocampus. The hippocampus plays a critical role in memory function, and is altered in a number of psychiatric disorders associated with memory impairments (e.g., depression and schizophrenia), as well as healthy aging. While many studies have focused on how regular exercise may improve hippocampal integrity in older individuals, less is known about these effects in young to middle-aged adults. Therefore, we assessed the associations of regular exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness with hippocampal structure and function in these age groups. We recruited 40 healthy young to middle-aged adults, comprised of two groups (n = 20) who self-reported either high or low levels of exercise, according to World Health Organization guidelines. We assessed cardiorespiratory fitness using a graded exercise test (VO<sub>2</sub>max) and hippocampal structure via manual tracing of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. We also assessed hippocampal function using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to derive estimates of <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate concentration and hippocampal-dependent associative memory and pattern separation tasks. We observed evidence of increased <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate concentration and associative memory performance in individuals engaging in high levels of exercise. However, no differences in hippocampal volume or pattern separation capacity were observed between groups. Cardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with left and right hippocampal volume and <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate concentration. However, no associations were observed between cardiorespiratory fitness and associative memory or pattern separation. Therefore, we provide evidence that higher levels of exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with improved hippocampal structure and function. Exercise may provide a low-risk, effective method of improving hippocampal integrity in an early-to-mid-life stage.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The hippocampus supports high‐precision binding in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It is well established that the hippocampus is critical for long-term episodic memory, but a growing body of research suggests that it also plays a critical role in supporting memory over very brief delays as measured in tests of working memory (WM). However, the circumstances under which the hippocampus is necessary for WM and the specific processes that it supports remain controversial. We propose that the hippocampus supports WM by binding together high-precision properties of an event, and we test this claim by examining the precision of color-location bindings in a visual WM task in which participants report the precise color of studied items using a continuous color wheel. Amnestic patients with hippocampal damage were significantly impaired at retrieving these colors after a 1-s delay, and these impairments reflected a reduction in the precision of those memories rather than increases in total memory failures or binding errors. Moreover, a parallel fMRI study in healthy subjects revealed that neural activity in the head and body of the hippocampus was directly related to the precision of visual WM decisions. Together, these results indicate that the hippocampus is critical in complex high-precision binding that supports memory over brief delays.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Plasticity impairment exposes CA3 vulnerability in a hippocampal network model of mild traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Proper function of the hippocampus is critical for executing cognitive tasks such as learning and memory. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other neurological disorders are commonly associated with cognitive deficits and hippocampal dysfunction. Although there are many existing models of individual subregions of the hippocampus, few models attempt to integrate the primary areas into one system. In this work, we developed a computational model of the hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1. The subregions are represented as an interconnected neuronal network, incorporating well-characterized ex vivo slice electrophysiology into the functional neuron models and well-documented anatomical connections into the network structure. In addition, since plasticity is foundational to the role of the hippocampus in learning and memory as well as necessary for studying adaptation to injury, we implemented spike-timing-dependent plasticity among the synaptic connections. Our model mimics key features of hippocampal activity, including signal frequencies in the theta and gamma bands and phase-amplitude coupling in area CA1. We also studied the effects of spike-timing-dependent plasticity impairment, a potential consequence of TBI, in our model and found that impairment decreases broadband power in CA3 and CA1 and reduces phase coherence between these two subregions, yet phase-amplitude coupling in CA1 remains intact. Altogether, our work demonstrates characteristic hippocampal activity with a scaled network model of spiking neurons and reveals the sensitive balance of plasticity mechanisms in the circuit through one manifestation of mild traumatic injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Outcome of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Treated by Interleukin‐7</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Restoring anti-JC virus (JCV) immunity is the only treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Interleukin-7 is a cytokine that increases number and function of T cells. We analyzed a population of PML patients who received recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) to estimate survival and its determinants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>After exclusion of patients with missing data or receiving other immunotherapies, findings from 64 patients with proven PML who received rhIL-7 between 2007 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze variables associated with one-year survival.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Underlying conditions were HIV/AIDS (n = 27, 42%), hematological malignancies (n = 16, 25%), primary immunodeficiencies (n = 13, 20%), solid organ transplantation (n = 4, 6%) and chronic inflammatory diseases (n = 4, 6%). One-year survival was 54.7% and did not differ by underlying condition. Survival was not associated with baseline characteristics, but with a &gt;50% increase in blood lymphocytes (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.2–14.9) and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (OR 5.9, 95%CI 1.7–23.3), and a &gt; 1 log copies/mL decrease in cerebrospinal fluid JCV DNA (OR 7.6, 95%CI 1.6–56.1) during the first month after rhIL-7 initiation. Side effects were mainly local and flu-like symptoms (n = 8, 12.5%) and PML-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (n = 5, 8%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this non-controlled retrospective study, survival did not differ from that expected in HIV/AIDS patients, but might have been improved in those with hematological malignancies, primary immunodeficiencies and transplant recipients. RhIL-7 might have contributed to the increase in blood lymphocytes and decrease in CSF JCV replication that were associated with better survival. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Introduction The efficacy of antiretroviral medicines to improve health outcomes and wellbeing depends largely on how soon they are prescribed and how PLHIV adhere to their prescribed regimens. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to examine adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to assess perceived health and wellbeing among people living with HIV(PLHIV) in two regions in Ghana.  Methods Quantitative data were collected from 301 PLHIV at three HIV clinics in Volta and Oti regions in Ghana using descriptive cross-sectional study design. Data collected included sociodemographic characteristics, ART initiation and adherence, and perception of health and wellbeing and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Demographic and categorical variables were analyzed using descriptive statistics while Chi-squared analyses and binary logistics regression were used to determine variables that correlated with adherence to ART regimen. A Mann–Whitney U-test was used to measure differences in perception of health and wellbeing between male and female participants. Results 80% initiated ART within a month following diagnosis and 97.3% reported adhering to their ART regimens consistently. A Pearson χ2 revealed that the availability of alternatives to the current ART medications showed a significant association with ART adherence (χ2 =12.078, p= 0.002). 90% reported improvement in their health and personal wellbeing. High ART adherence and positive perceived health and wellbeing were found. Conclusion Regular supply of ART and investment in LA-ART to ensure more effective, efficient, and stress-free adherence to ART for PLHIV regardless of their residence in the country.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Phylogenetic inference of changes in amino acid propensities with single-position resolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Galya V. Klink, Olga V. Kalinina, Georgii A. Bazykin</p>

Fitness conferred by the same allele may differ between genotypes and environments, and these differences shape variation and evolution. Changes in amino acid propensities at protein sites over the course of evolution have been inferred from sequence alignments statistically, but the existing methods are data-intensive and aggregate multiple sites. Here, we develop an approach to detect individual amino acids that confer different fitness in different groups of species from combined sequence and phylogenetic data. Using the fact that the probability of a substitution to an amino acid depends on its fitness, our method looks for amino acids such that substitutions to them occur more frequently in one group of lineages than in another. We validate our method using simulated evolution of a protein site under different scenarios and show that it has high specificity for a wide range of assumptions regarding the underlying changes in selection, while its sensitivity differs between scenarios. We apply our method to the <i>env</i> gene of two HIV-1 subtypes, A and B, and to the HA gene of two influenza A subtypes, H1 and H3, and show that the inferred fitness changes are consistent with the fitness differences observed in deep mutational scanning experiments. We find that changes in relative fitness of different amino acid variants within a site do not always trigger episodes of positive selection and therefore may not result in an overall increase in the frequency of substitutions, but can still be detected from changes in relative frequencies of different substitutions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Specificity of Loxosceles α clade phospholipase D enzymes for choline-containing lipids: Role of a conserved aromatic cage</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Emmanuel E. Moutoussamy, Qaiser Waheed, Greta J. Binford, Hanif M. Khan, Shane M. Moran, Anna R. Eitel, Matthew H. J. Cordes, Nathalie Reuter</p>

Spider venom GDPD-like phospholipases D (<i>SicTox</i>) have been identified to be one of the major toxins in recluse spider venom. They are divided into two major clades: the α clade and the β clade. Most α clade toxins present high activity against lipids with choline head groups such as sphingomyelin, while activities in β clade toxins vary and include preference for substrates containing ethanolamine headgroups (<i>Sicarius terrosus</i>, St_βIB1). A structural comparison of available structures of phospholipases D (PLDs) reveals a conserved aromatic cage in the α clade. To test the potential influence of the aromatic cage on membrane-lipid specificity we performed molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of the binding of several PLDs onto lipid bilayers containing choline headgroups; two <i>SicTox</i> from the α clade, <i>Loxosceles intermedia</i> αIA1 (Li_αIA) and <i>Loxosceles laeta</i> αIII1 (Ll_αIII1), and one from the β clade, St_βIB1. The simulation results reveal that the aromatic cage captures a choline-headgroup and suggest that the cage plays a major role in lipid specificity. We also simulated an engineered St_βIB1, where we introduced the aromatic cage, and this led to binding with choline-containing lipids. Moreover, a multiple sequence alignment revealed the conservation of the aromatic cage among the α clade PLDs. Here, we confirmed that the i-face of α and β clade PLDs is involved in their binding to choline and ethanolamine-containing bilayers, respectively. Furthermore, our results suggest a major role in choline lipid recognition of the aromatic cage of the α clade PLDs. The MD simulation results are supported by <i>in vitro</i> liposome binding assay experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantitative modeling identifies critical cell mechanics driving bile duct lumen formation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paul Van Liedekerke, Lila Gannoun, Axelle Loriot, Tim Johann, Frédéric P. Lemaigre, Dirk Drasdo</p>

Biliary ducts collect bile from liver lobules, the smallest functional and anatomical units of liver, and carry it to the gallbladder. Disruptions in this process caused by defective embryonic development, or through ductal reaction in liver disease have a major impact on life quality and survival of patients. A deep understanding of the processes underlying bile duct lumen formation is crucial to identify intervention points to avoid or treat the appearance of defective bile ducts. Several hypotheses have been proposed to characterize the biophysical mechanisms driving initial bile duct lumen formation during embryogenesis. Here, guided by the quantification of morphological features and expression of genes in bile ducts from embryonic mouse liver, we sharpened these hypotheses and collected data to develop a high resolution individual cell-based computational model that enables to test alternative hypotheses in silico. This model permits realistic simulations of tissue and cell mechanics at sub-cellular scale. Our simulations suggest that successful bile duct lumen formation requires a simultaneous contribution of directed cell division of cholangiocytes, local osmotic effects generated by salt excretion in the lumen, and temporally-controlled differentiation of hepatoblasts to cholangiocytes, with apical constriction of cholangiocytes only moderately affecting luminal size.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The correlation between cell and nucleus size is explained by an eukaryotic cell growth model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yufei Wu, Adrian F. Pegoraro, David A. Weitz, Paul Janmey, Sean X. Sun</p>

In eukaryotes, the cell volume is observed to be strongly correlated with the nuclear volume. The slope of this correlation depends on the cell type, growth condition, and the physical environment of the cell. We develop a computational model of cell growth and proteome increase, incorporating the kinetics of amino acid import, protein/ribosome synthesis and degradation, and active transport of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. We also include a simple model of ribosome biogenesis and assembly. Results show that the cell volume is tightly correlated with the nuclear volume, and the cytoplasm-nucleoplasm transport rates strongly influence the cell growth rate as well as the cell/nucleus volume ratio (C/N ratio). Ribosome assembly and the ratio of ribosomal proteins to mature ribosomes also influence the cell volume and the cell growth rate. We find that in order to regulate the cell growth rate and the cell/nucleus volume ratio, the cell must optimally control groups of kinetic and transport parameters together, which could explain the quantitative roles of canonical growth pathways. Finally, although not explicitly demonstrated in this work, we point out that it is possible to construct a detailed proteome distribution using our model and RNAseq data, provided that a quantitative cell division mechanism is known.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Towards the prediction of non-peptidic epitopes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paul F. Zierep, Randi Vita, Nina Blazeska, Aurélien F. A. Moumbock, Jason A. Greenbaum, Bjoern Peters, Stefan Günther</p>

In-silico methods for the prediction of epitopes can support and improve workflows for vaccine design, antibody production, and disease therapy. So far, the scope of B cell and T cell epitope prediction has been directed exclusively towards peptidic antigens. Nevertheless, various non-peptidic molecular classes can be recognized by immune cells. These compounds have not been systematically studied yet, and prediction approaches are lacking. The ability to predict the epitope activity of non-peptidic compounds could have vast implications; for example, for immunogenic risk assessment of the vast number of drugs and other xenobiotics. Here we present the first general attempt to predict the epitope activity of non-peptidic compounds using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) as a source for positive samples. The molecules stored in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database were chosen as background samples. The molecules were clustered into eight homogeneous molecular groups, and classifiers were built for each cluster with the aim of separating the epitopes from the background. Different molecular feature encoding schemes and machine learning models were compared against each other. For those models where a high performance could be achieved based on simple decision rules, the molecular features were then further investigated. Additionally, the findings were used to build a web server that allows for the immunogenic investigation of non-peptidic molecules (http://tools-staging.iedb.org/np_epitope_predictor). The prediction quality was tested with samples from independent evaluation datasets, and the implemented method received noteworthy Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) values, ranging from 0.69–0.96 depending on the molecule cluster.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis network profoundly shapes the protein sequence space accessible to HIV envelope</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jimin Yoon, Emmanuel E. Nekongo, Jessica E. Patrick, Tiffani Hui, Angela M. Phillips, Anna I. Ponomarenko, Samuel J. Hendel, Rebecca M. Sebastian, Yu Meng Zhang, Vincent L. Butty, C. Brandon Ogbunugafor, Yu-Shan Lin, Matthew D. Shoulders</p>

The sequence space accessible to evolving proteins can be enhanced by cellular chaperones that assist biophysically defective clients in navigating complex folding landscapes. It is also possible, at least in theory, for proteostasis mechanisms that promote strict quality control to greatly constrain accessible protein sequence space. Unfortunately, most efforts to understand how proteostasis mechanisms influence evolution rely on artificial inhibition or genetic knockdown of specific chaperones. The few experiments that perturb quality control pathways also generally modulate the levels of only individual quality control factors. Here, we use chemical genetic strategies to tune proteostasis networks via natural stress response pathways that regulate the levels of entire suites of chaperones and quality control mechanisms. Specifically, we upregulate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to test the hypothesis that the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis network shapes the sequence space accessible to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) protein. Elucidating factors that enhance or constrain Env sequence space is critical because Env evolves extremely rapidly, yielding HIV strains with antibody- and drug-escape mutations. We find that UPR-mediated upregulation of ER proteostasis factors, particularly those controlled by the IRE1-XBP1s UPR arm, globally reduces Env mutational tolerance. Conserved, functionally important Env regions exhibit the largest decreases in mutational tolerance upon XBP1s induction. Our data indicate that this phenomenon likely reflects strict quality control endowed by XBP1s-mediated remodeling of the ER proteostasis environment. Intriguingly, and in contrast, specific regions of Env, including regions targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies, display enhanced mutational tolerance when XBP1s is induced, hinting at a role for host proteostasis network hijacking in potentiating antibody escape. These observations reveal a key function for proteostasis networks in decreasing instead of expanding the sequence space accessible to client proteins, while also demonstrating that the host ER proteostasis network profoundly shapes the mutational tolerance of Env in ways that could have important consequences for HIV adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of 567,758 randomized controlled trials published over 30 years reveals trends in phrases used to discuss results that do not reach statistical significance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Willem M. Otte, Christiaan H. Vinkers, Philippe C. Habets, David G. P. van IJzendoorn, Joeri K. Tijdink</p>

The power of language to modify the reader’s perception of interpreting biomedical results cannot be underestimated. Misreporting and misinterpretation are pressing problems in randomized controlled trials (RCT) output. This may be partially related to the statistical significance paradigm used in clinical trials centered around a <i>P</i> value below 0.05 cutoff. Strict use of this <i>P</i> value may lead to strategies of clinical researchers to describe their clinical results with <i>P</i> values approaching but not reaching the threshold to be “almost significant.” The question is how phrases expressing nonsignificant results have been reported in RCTs over the past 30 years. To this end, we conducted a quantitative analysis of English full texts containing 567,758 RCTs recorded in PubMed between 1990 and 2020 (81.5% of all published RCTs in PubMed). We determined the exact presence of 505 predefined phrases denoting results that approach but do not cross the line of formal statistical significance (<i>P</i> < 0.05). We modeled temporal trends in phrase data with Bayesian linear regression. Evidence for temporal change was obtained through Bayes factor (BF) analysis. In a randomly sampled subset, the associated <i>P</i> values were manually extracted. We identified 61,741 phrases in 49,134 RCTs indicating almost significant results (8.65%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.58% to 8.73%). The overall prevalence of these phrases remained stable over time, with the most prevalent phrases being “marginally significant” (in 7,735 RCTs), “all but significant” (7,015), “a nonsignificant trend” (3,442), “failed to reach statistical significance” (2,578), and “a strong trend” (1,700). The strongest evidence for an increased temporal prevalence was found for “a numerical trend,” “a positive trend,” “an increasing trend,” and “nominally significant.” In contrast, the phrases “all but significant,” “approaches statistical significance,” “did not quite reach statistical significance,” “difference was apparent,” “failed to reach statistical significance,” and “not quite significant” decreased over time. In a random sampled subset of 29,000 phrases, the manually identified and corresponding 11,926 <i>P</i> values, 68,1% ranged between 0.05 and 0.15 (CI: 67. to 69.0; median 0.06). Our results show that RCT reports regularly contain specific phrases describing marginally nonsignificant results to report <i>P</i> values close to but above the dominant 0.05 cutoff. The fact that the prevalence of the phrases remained stable over time indicates that this practice of broadly interpreting <i>P</i> values close to a predefined threshold remains prevalent. To enhance responsible and transparent interpretation of RCT results, researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and editors may reduce the focus on formal statistical significance thresholds and stimulate reporting of <i>P</i> values with corresponding effect sizes and CIs and focus on the clinical relevance of the statistical difference found in RCTs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identification of a novel cationic glycolipid in Streptococcus agalactiae that contributes to brain entry and meningitis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luke R. Joyce, Haider S. Manzer, Jéssica da C. Mendonça, Ricardo Villarreal, Prescilla E. Nagao, Kelly S. Doran, Kelli L. Palmer, Ziqiang Guan</p>

Bacterial membrane lipids are critical for membrane bilayer formation, cell division, protein localization, stress responses, and pathogenesis. Despite their critical roles, membrane lipids have not been fully elucidated for many pathogens. Here, we report the discovery of a novel cationic glycolipid, lysyl-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Lys-Glc-DAG), which is synthesized in high abundance by the bacterium <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i> (Group B <i>Streptococcus</i>, GBS). To our knowledge, Lys-Glc-DAG is more positively charged than any other known lipids. Lys-Glc-DAG carries 2 positive net charges per molecule, distinct from the widely described lysylated phospholipid lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG) that carries one positive net charge due to the presence of a negatively charged phosphate moiety. We use normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) and genetic approaches to determine that Lys-Glc-DAG is synthesized by the enzyme MprF in GBS, which covalently modifies the neutral glycolipid Glc-DAG with the cationic amino acid lysine. GBS is a leading cause of neonatal meningitis, which requires traversal of the endothelial blood–brain barrier (BBB). We demonstrate that GBS strains lacking <i>mprF</i> exhibit a significant decrease in the ability to invade BBB endothelial cells. Further, mice challenged with a GBSoΔ<i>mprF</i> mutant developed bacteremia comparably to wild-type (WT) infected mice yet had less recovered bacteria from brain tissue and a lower incidence of meningitis. Thus, our data suggest that Lys-Glc-DAG may contribute to bacterial uptake into host cells and disease progression. Importantly, our discovery provides a platform for further study of cationic lipids at the host–pathogen interface.

Posttranscriptional control of gene expression by microRNA (miRNA) has recently emerged as an essential genetic element for T<sub>reg</sub> cell function. Here, we report that mice with T<sub>reg</sub> cell–specific ablation of <i>miR-142</i> (hereafter <i>Foxp3</i><sup>Cre</sup><i>miR-142</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice) developed a fatal systemic autoimmune disorder due to a breakdown in peripheral T-cell tolerance. <i>Foxp3</i><sup>Cre</sup><i>miR-142</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice displayed a significant decrease in the abundance and suppressive capacity of T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Expression profiling of <i>miR-142</i>–deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells revealed an up-regulation of multiple genes in the interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling network. We identified several of these IFNγ-associated genes as direct miR-142-3p targets and observed excessive IFNγ production and signaling in <i>miR-142</i>–deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells. <i>Ifng</i> ablation rescued the T<sub>reg</sub> cell homeostatic defect and alleviated development of autoimmunity in <i>Foxp3</i><sup>Cre</sup><i>miR-142</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Thus, our findings implicate <i>miR-142</i> as an indispensable regulator of T<sub>reg</sub> cell homeostasis that exerts its function by attenuating IFNγ responses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Stacked deep analytic model for human activity recognition on a UCI HAR database [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Owing to low cost and ubiquity, human activity recognition using smartphones is emerging as a trendy mobile application in diverse appliances such as assisted living, healthcare monitoring, etc. Analysing this one-dimensional time-series signal is rather challenging due to its spatial and temporal variances. Numerous deep neural networks (DNNs) are conducted to unveil deep features of complex real-world data. However, the drawback of DNNs is the un-interpretation of the network's internal logic to achieve the output. Furthermore, a huge training sample size (i.e. millions of samples) is required to ensure great performance. Methods In this work, a simpler yet effective stacked deep network, known as Stacked Discriminant Feature Learning (SDFL), is proposed to analyse inertial motion data for activity recognition. Contrary to DNNs, this deep model extracts rich features without the prerequisite of a gigantic training sample set and tenuous hyper-parameter tuning. SDFL is a stacking deep network with multiple learning modules, appearing in a serialized layout for multi-level feature learning from shallow to deeper features. In each learning module, Rayleigh coefficient optimized learning is accomplished to extort discriminant features. A subject-independent protocol is implemented where the system model (trained by data from a group of users) is used to recognize data from another group of users. Results Empirical results demonstrate that SDFL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including DNNs like Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Belief Network, etc., with ~97% accuracy from the UCI HAR database with thousands of training samples. Additionally, the model training time of SDFL is merely a few minutes, compared with DNNs, which require hours for model training. Conclusions The supremacy of SDFL is corroborated in analysing motion data for human activity recognition requiring no GPU but only a CPU with a fast- learning rate.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A novel method for measuring sublingual temperature using conventional non-contact forehead thermometer [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sublingual temperature measurement is a quick and accurate representation of oral temperature and corresponds closely with core temperature. Sub-lingual temperature measurement using non-contact infrared thermometers has not been studied for this purpose and if accurate they would be a reliable and convenient way of recording temperature of a patient very quickly. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of recording sublingual temperature using an infrared non-contact thermometer and establish its accuracy by comparing the readings with tympanic thermometer recordings. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 29 patients (328 paired recordings from sublingual and tympanic sites simultaneously). Subjects were requested to keep their mouth closed for five minutes before recording the temperature. Sublingual recordings were performed for each patient at different times of the day using an infrared thermometer. The infrared thermometer was quickly brought 1cm away from the sublingual part of the tongue and the recordings were then done immediately. Readings were compared with the corresponding tympanic temperature. Results: The non-contact sublingual temperature correlated very closely with tympanic temperature (r=0.86, p<0.001). The mean difference between the infrared sublingual and tympanic temperature was 0.21°C (standard deviation [SD]:0.48°C, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.16-0.27). The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) between core and sublingual temperatures was 0.830 (95% CI: 0.794 to 0.861) p<0.001. The sensitivity of sublingual IR (infrared) temperature of 37.65°C was 90% and specificity was 89% for core temperature >38°C. Conclusions: This innovative modification of using the forehead infrared thermometer to measure the sublingual temperature offers an accurate, rapid and non-contact estimation of core temperature.

                Background The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the new minimal invasive (MINE) browlift technique with possibly superior results and minimal visible scarring. Methods A prospective observational study will be performed on all available data from patients who will undergo a browlift procedure in the Haaglanden Medical Center from 1-6-2021 till 31-5-2022. Our goal is to include at least 50 patients (1 per week). Inclusion criteria are: patients with medical (i.e. brow-ptosis, facial paralysis) or cosmetic indication, patients with sufficient understanding of the Dutch or English language and willingness to participate in extra study specific follow-up moments and filling in of questionnaires. Exclusion criteria are: <18 years of age and patients with previous brow or eyelid surgery. Patients will be photographed pre- and postoperatively using the VECTRA camera. The database management software Castor will be used to store and collect the data from the questionnaire. The Medical Research Ethics Committee found this study not eligible to be submitted to the Dutch Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Acts (WMO). Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients. Results Outcomes measures to be evaluated include: scarring after procedure; functionality of eyebrow movement; amount of correction in brow ptosis, measured in VECTRA; longevity of procedure in months; aesthetic result as assessed by questionnaires; and adverse effects of the procedure.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate novel plasma p-tau231 and p-tau181, as well as Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> assays as indicators of tau and Aβ pathologies measured with positron emission tomography (PET), and their association with cognitive change, in cognitively unimpaired older adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 244 older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) owing to a family history of AD dementia, we measured single molecule array (Simoa)-based plasma tau biomarkers (p-tau231 and p-tau181), Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> with immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry, and Simoa neurofilament light (NfL). A subset of 129 participants underwent amyloid-β (<sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET assessments. We investigated plasma biomarker associations with Aβ and tau PET at the global and voxel level and tested plasma biomarker combinations for improved detection of Aβ-PET positivity. We also investigated associations with 8-year cognitive change.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Plasma p-tau biomarkers correlated with flortaucipir binding in medial temporal, parietal, and inferior temporal regions. P-tau231 showed further associations in lateral parietal and occipital cortices. Plasma Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> explained more variance in global Aβ-PET binding than Aβ<sub>42</sub> alone. P-tau231 also showed strong and widespread associations with cortical Aβ-PET binding. Combining Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> with p-tau231 or p-tau181 allowed for good distinction between Aβ-negative and -positive participants (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] range = 0.81–0.86). Individuals with low plasma Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> and high p-tau experienced faster cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Plasma p-tau231 showed more robust associations with PET biomarkers than p-tau181 in presymptomatic individuals. The combination of p-tau and Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> biomarkers detected early AD pathology and cognitive decline. Such markers could be used as prescreening tools to reduce the cost of prevention trials.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Imaging net retrograde axonal transport in vivo: a physiological biomarker</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study is to develop a novel method for monitoring the integrity of motor neurons <i>in vivo</i> by quantifying net retrograde axonal transport.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The method uses single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to quantify retrograde transport to spinal cord of tetanus toxin fragment C (<sup>125</sup>I-TTC) following intramuscular injection. We characterized the transport profiles in three transgenic mouse models carrying ALS-associated genes, aging mice, and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mice following CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Lastly, we studied the effect of prior immunization of tetanus toxoid on the transport profile of TTC.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This technique defines a quantitative profile of net retrograde axonal transport of TTC in living mice. The profile is distinctly abnormal in transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice as young as 65 days (presymptomatic) and worsens with disease progression. Moreover, this method detects a distinct therapeutic benefit of gene editing in transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice well before other clinical parameters (e.g. grip strength) show improvement. Symptomatic transgenic PFN1<sup>C71G/C71G</sup> ALS mice display gross reductions in net retrograde axonal transport, which is also disturbed in asymptomatic mice harboring a human <i>C9ORF72</i> transgene with an expanded GGGGCC repeat motif. In wild-type mice, net retrograde axonal transport declines with aging. Lastly, prior immunization with tetanus toxoid does not preclude use of this assay.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This assay of net retrograde axonal transport has broad potential clinical applications and should be particularly valuable as a physiological biomarker that permits early detection of benefit from potential therapies for motor neuron diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Genetic architecture of stroke of undetermined source: overlap with known stroke etiologies and associations with modifiable risk factors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke etiology remains undetermined in 30% of cases. We explored the genetic architecture of stroke classified as undetermined to test if mechanisms and risk factors underlying large-artery atherosclerotic (LAAS), cardioembolic (CES), and small-vessel stroke (SVS) contribute to its pathogenesis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed genome-wide data from 16,851 ischemic stroke cases and 32,473 controls. Using polygenic risk scores for LAAS, CES, and SVS we assessed the genetic overlap with stroke of undetermined source and used pairwise GWAS to search for shared loci. We then applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify potentially causal risk factors of stroke of undetermined source.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetic risk for LAS, CES, and SVS was associated with stroke of undetermined source pointing to overlap in their genetic architecture. Pairwise analyses revealed 19 shared loci with LAAS, 2 with CES, and 5 with SVS that have been implicated in atherosclerosis-related phenotypes. Genetic liability to both carotid atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation was associated with stroke of undetermined source, but the association with atrial fibrillation was attenuated after excluding cases with incomplete diagnostic workup. MR analyses showed effects of genetically determinants of blood pressure, diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, inflammatory pathways (IL-6 signaling, MCP-1/CCL2 levels), and factor XI levels on stroke of undetermined source.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Stroke of undetermined source shares genetic and vascular risk factors with other stroke subtypes, especially LAAS, thus highlighting the diagnostic limitations of current subtyping approaches. The potentially causal associations with carotid atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic risk factors might have implications for prevention strategies targeting these mechanisms.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to identify the risk of bleeding events and potential risk factors within 90 days in patients who carried <i>CYP2C19</i> loss-of-function alleles and received dual antiplatelet therapy after minor stroke or transient ischemic attack.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 6,412 patients were enrolled from the CHANCE-2 (Clopidogrel with Aspirin in High-Risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events II) trial. The main outcome was any bleeding within 90 days defined by the criteria from GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 250 (3.9%) bleeding events were reported, which occurred mainly within the 21 days of dual antiplatelet therapy (200 cases, 3.1%). Minor bleeding of the skin bruises, epistaxis, and gum bleeding were most frequent. Multivariate analysis showed that treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin was associated with increased bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.68–2.89, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Current smoking was associated with a lower risk of bleeding (HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52–0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Additionally, ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin was associated with higher risk of bleeding in patients aged &lt;65 years (HR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.95–4.22) and those without diabetes mellitus (HR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.88–3.73; <i>p</i> for interaction = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Bleeding events mostly occurred within the 21-day dual antiplatelet therapy stage and were generally mild. The risk of bleeding was greater in nonsmoking patients, and was associated with treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin, particularly in patients aged &lt;65 years and nondiabetic patients.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to describe cerebrovascular, neuropathic, and autonomic features of post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 ((COVID-19) PASC).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This retrospective study evaluated consecutive patients with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and orthostatic intolerance consistent with PASC. Controls included patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and healthy participants. Analyzed data included surveys and autonomic (Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, sudomotor, and tilt tests), cerebrovascular (cerebral blood flow velocity [CBFv] monitoring in middle cerebral artery), respiratory (capnography monitoring), and neuropathic (skin biopsies for assessment of small fiber neuropathy) testing and inflammatory/autoimmune markers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine patients with PASC were evaluated 0.8 ± 0.3 years after a mild COVID-19 infection, and were treated as home observations. Autonomic, pain, brain fog, fatigue, and dyspnea surveys were abnormal in PASC and POTS (n = 10), compared with controls (n = 15). Tilt table test reproduced the majority of PASC symptoms. Orthostatic CBFv declined in PASC (−20.0 ± 13.4%) and POTS (−20.3 ± 15.1%), compared with controls (−3.0 ± 7.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and was independent of end-tidal carbon dioxide in PASC, but caused by hyperventilation in POTS. Reduced orthostatic CBFv in PASC included both subjects without (n = 6) and with (n = 3) orthostatic tachycardia. Dysautonomia was frequent (100% in both PASC and POTS) but was milder in PASC (<i>p</i> = 0.002). PASC and POTS cohorts diverged in frequency of small fiber neuropathy (89% vs 60%) but not in inflammatory markers (67% vs 70%). Supine and orthostatic hypocapnia was observed in PASC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PASC following mild COVID-19 infection is associated with multisystem involvement including: (1) cerebrovascular dysregulation with persistent cerebral arteriolar vasoconstriction; (2) small fiber neuropathy and related dysautonomia; (3) respiratory dysregulation; and (4) chronic inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Reduction in Cognitive Processing Speed Surrounding Multiple Sclerosis Relapse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the longitudinal relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses and information processing efficiency among persons with relapsing–remitting MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a Swedish nationwide cohort study of persons with incident relapsing–remitting MS (2001–2019). Relapse information and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) scores were obtained from the Swedish MS Registry. Follow-up was categorized into 2 periods based on relapse status: “relapse” (90 days pre-relapse to 730 days post-relapse, subdivided into 10 periods) and “remission.” Linear mixed models compared SDMT scores during the relapse periods to SDMT scores recorded during remission (reference) with results reported as β-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for age, sex, SDMT type (written vs oral), time-varying, disease-modifying therapy exposure and sequence of SDMT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.7 (4.3) years, 31,529 distinct SDMTs were recorded among 3,877 persons with MS. There was a significant decline in information processing efficiency that lasted from 30 days pre-relapse up to 550 days post-relapse, with the largest decline occurring 0 to 30 days post-relapse (β-coefficient: −4.00 (95% CI = −4.61 to −3.39), relative to the period of remission.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found evidence of cognitive change up to 1 month prior to relapse onset. The reduction in SDMT lasted 1.5 years and was clinically significant up to 3 months post-relapse. These results suggest that the effects of a relapse on cognition are longer than previously thought and highlight the importance of reducing relapse rates as a potential means of preserving cognitive function.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to compare the rate of change in cognition between glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA</i>) mutation carriers and noncarriers with and without subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and genetic data from 12 datasets were examined. Global cognition was assessed using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS). Subjects were examined for mutations in <i>GBA</i> and categorized as <i>GBA</i> carriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>+DBS+, <i>GBA</i>+DBS-), and noncarriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>-DBS+, <i>GBA</i>-DBS-). <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers were subcategorized according to mutation severity (risk variant, mild, severe). Linear mixed modeling was used to compare rate of change in MDRS scores over time among the groups according to <i>GBA</i> and DBS status and then according to <i>GBA</i> severity and DBS status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Data were available for 366 subjects (58 <i>GBA</i>+DBS+, 82 <i>GBA</i>+DBS-, 98 <i>GBA</i>-DBS+, and 128 <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects), who were longitudinally followed (range = 36–60 months after surgery). Using the MDRS, <i>GBA</i>+DBS+ subjects declined on average 2.02 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects (95% confidence interval [CI] = −2.35 to −1.69), 1.71 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>+DBS- subjects (95% CI = −2.14 to −1.28), and 1.49 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS+ subjects (95% CI = −1.80 to −1.18).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although not randomized, this composite analysis suggests that the combined effects of <i>GBA</i> mutations and STN-DBS negatively impact cognition. We advise that DBS candidates be screened for <i>GBA</i> mutations as part of the presurgical decision-making process. We advise that <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers be counseled regarding potential risks associated with STN-DBS so that alternative options may be considered.

                <p>Since 2016, 3 innovative therapies for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have changed the face of the disease. Although these therapies often result in remarkable improvements in infants and children, benefits in adults are modest and treatment is not curative. Concerns have been raised about the enormous costs of these medications, the ultimate burden to taxpayers, and the costs to society of withholding treatments and sacrificing or disadvantaging some individuals. Physicians are best positioned to serve our patients by carefully considering the costs, benefits, implications for quality of life (QOL), and the interplay of these factors within the framework of core ethical principles that guide clinical care.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to follow up predictive factors for α-synuclein–related neurodegenerative diseases in a multicenter cohort of idiopathic/isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD from 12 centers underwent a detailed assessment for potential environmental and lifestyle risk factors via a standardized questionnaire at baseline. Patients were then prospectively followed and received assessments for parkinsonism or dementia during follow-up. The cumulative incidence of parkinsonism or dementia was estimated with competing risk analysis. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictive value of environmental/lifestyle factors over a follow-up period of 11 years, adjusting for age, sex, and center.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 319 patients who were free of parkinsonism or dementia, 281 provided follow-up information. After a mean follow-up of 5.8 years, 130 (46.3%) patients developed neurodegenerative disease. The overall phenoconversion rate was 24.2% after 3 years, 44.8% after 6 years, and 67.5% after 10 years. Patients with older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.05) and nitrate derivative use (aHR = 2.18) were more likely to phenoconvert, whereas prior pesticide exposure (aHR = 0.21–0.64), rural living (aHR = 0.53), lipid-lowering medication use (aHR = 0.59), and respiratory medication use (aHR = 0.36) were associated with lower phenoconversion risk. Risk factors for those converting to primary dementia and parkinsonism were generally similar, with dementia-first converters having lower coffee intake and beta-blocker intake, and higher occurrence of family history of dementia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings elucidate the predictive values of environmental factors and comorbid conditions in identifying RBD patients at higher risk of phenoconversion. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:404–416</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cardiac arrest (CA) is a major health burden with brain damage being a significant contributor to mortality. We found lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), including a species containing docosahexaenoic acid (LPC-DHA), was significantly decreased in plasma post-CA, supplementation of which significantly improved neurological outcomes. The aim of this study is to understand the protective role of LPC-DHA supplementation on the brain post-CA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We first evaluated associations between the plasma level of LPC-DHA and neurological injury and outcomes of human patients with CA. We then utilized a rat CA model and cell cultures to investigate therapeutic and mechanistic aspects of plasma LPC-DHA supplementation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that decreased plasma LPC-DHA was strongly associated with neurological outcomes and disappearance of the difference between gray and white matter in the brain after CA in human patients. In rats, the decreased plasma LPC-DHA was associated with decreased levels of brain LPC-DHA after CA, and supplementing plasma LPC-DHA normalized brain levels of LPC-DHA and alleviated neuronal cell death, activation of astrocytes, and expression of various inflammatory and mitochondrial dynamics genes. We also observed deceased severity of metabolic alterations with LPC-DHA supplementation using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Furthermore, LPC treatment showed a similar protective effect for neurons and astrocytes in mixed primary brain cell cultures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed neuroprotection accompanied with normalized brain LPC-DHA level by plasma supplementation implicate the importance of preventing the decrease of brain LPC-DHA post-CA for attenuating brain injury. Furthermore, the data supports the causative role of decreased plasma LPC-DHA for brain damage after CA. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:389–403</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence from invasive cortical stimulation mapping and noninvasive neuroimaging studies indicates that brain function may be preserved within brain tumors. However, a noninvasive approach to accurately and comprehensively delineate individual-specific functional networks in the whole brain, especially in brain tissues within and surrounding tumors, is still lacking. The purpose of the study is to develop a clinically useful technique that can map functional regions within tumoral brains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed an individual-specific functional network parcellation approach using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) that effectively captured functional networks within and nearby tumors in 20 patients. We examined the accuracy of the functional maps using invasive cortical stimulation and task response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that approximately 33.2% of the tumoral mass appeared to be functionally active and demonstrated robust functional connectivity with non-tumoral brain regions. Functional networks nearby tumors were validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping. Intratumoral sensorimotor networks mapped by our technique could be distinguished by their distinct cortico-cerebellar connectivity patterns and were consistent with hand movement evoked fMRI task activations. Furthermore, in some patients, cognitive networks that were detected in the tumor mass showed long-distance and distributed functional connectivity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our noninvasive approach to mapping individual-specific functional networks using rsfMRI represents a promising new tool for identifying regions with preserved functional connectivity within and surrounding brain tumors, and could be used as a complement to presurgical planning for patients undergoing tumor resection surgery.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to elucidate the molecular features of inclusion body myositis (IBM).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed RNA sequencing analysis of muscle biopsy samples from 67 participants, consisting of 58 myositis patients with the pathological finding of CD8-positive T cells invading non-necrotic muscle fibers expressing major histocompatibility complex class I (43 IBM, 6 polymyositis, and 9 unclassifiable myositis), and 9 controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and pathway analysis showed that differentially expressed genes and pathways identified in IBM and polymyositis were mostly comparable. However, pathways related to cell adhesion molecules were upregulated in IBM as compared with polymyositis and controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Notably, <i>CDH1</i>, which encodes the epidermal cell junction protein cadherin 1, was overexpressed in the muscles of IBM, which was validated by another RNA sequencing dataset from previous publications. Western blotting confirmed the presence of mature cadherin 1 protein in the muscles of IBM. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the positivity for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in the muscles of IBM, whereas there was no muscle fiber positive for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, antisynthetase syndrome, and controls. The fibers stained with anti-cadherin 1 antibody did not have rimmed vacuoles or abnormal protein accumulation. Experimental skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation systems showed that <i>CDH1</i> is expressed during skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>CDH1</i> was detected as a differentially expressed gene, and immunohistochemistry showed that cadherin 1 exists in the muscles of IBM, whereas it was rarely seen in those of other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Cadherin 1 upregulation in muscle could provide a valuable clue to the pathological mechanisms of IBM. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:317–328</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">B Cell Depletion and SARS‐CoV‐2 Vaccine Responses in Neuroimmunologic Patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The study was undertaken to assess the impact of B cell depletion on humoral and cellular immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in patients with various neuroimmunologic disorders on anti-CD20 therapy. This included an analysis of the T cell vaccine response to the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated prospectively humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in 82 patients with neuroimmunologic disorders on anti-CD20 therapy and 82 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. For quantification of antibodies, the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) immunoassay against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) was used. IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays were performed to assess T cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and the Delta variant.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were found less frequently in patients (70% [57/82]) compared with controls (82/82 [100%], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In patients without detectable B cells (&lt;1 B cell/mcl), seroconversion rates and antibody levels were lower compared to nondepleted (≥1 B cell/mcl) patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). B cell levels ≥1 cell/mcl were sufficient to induce seroconversion in our cohort of anti-CD20 treated patients. In contrast to the antibody response, the T-cell response against the Wuhan strain and the Delta variant was more pronounced in frequency (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and magnitude (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) in B-cell depleted compared to nondepleted patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinnation can be attained in patients on anti-CD20 therapy by the onset of B cell repopulation. In the absence of B cells, a strong T cell response is generated which may help to protect against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this high-risk population.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cortical Correlates of Gait Compensation Strategies in Parkinson Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gait impairment in persons with Parkinson disease is common and debilitating. Compensation strategies (eg, external cues) are an essential part of rehabilitation, but their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we explored the cortical correlates of 3 categories of strategies: external cueing, internal cueing, and action observation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eighteen participants with Parkinson disease and gait impairment were included. We recorded 126-channel EEG during both stance and gait on a treadmill under 4 conditions: (1) uncued, (2) external cueing (listening to a metronome), (3) internal cueing (silent rhythmic counting), and (4) action observation (observing another person walking). To control for the effects of sensory processing of the cues, we computed relative power changes as the difference in power spectral density between walking and standing for each condition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Relative to uncued gait, the use of all 3 compensation strategies induced a decrease of beta band activity in sensorimotor areas, indicative of increased cortical activation. Parieto-occipital alpha band activity decreased with external and internal cueing, and increased with action observation. Only internal cueing induced a change in frontal cortical activation, showing a decrease of beta band activity compared to uncued gait.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The application of compensation strategies resulted in changed cortical activity compared to uncued gait, which could not be solely attributed to sensory processing of the cueing modality. Our findings suggest there are multiple routes to control gait, and different compensation strategies seem to rely on different cortical mechanisms to achieve enhanced central motor activation in persons with Parkinson disease.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Dynamic coupling of oscillatory neural activity and its roles in visual attention</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory neural activity is believed to have a central role in information processing in the mammalian brain. While early studies often focussed on the function of individual frequency bands, there is emerging appreciation for the role of simultaneous activity in many distinct frequency bands and the interactions between them in high-level cognitive functions. Here, we focus on the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in visual attention. First, we propose a framework that reconciles previous contrasting findings, showing how CFC could have a functional role on both intra- and interareal scales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-EM structures reveal high-resolution mechanism of a DNA polymerase sliding clamp loader</a></h4>

              
                Sliding clamps are ring-shaped protein complexes that are integral to the DNA replication machinery of all life. Sliding clamps are opened and installed onto DNA by clamp loader AAA+ ATPase complexes. However, how a clamp loader opens and closes the sliding clamp around DNA is still unknown. Here, we describe structures of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC) bound to its cognate sliding clamp Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) en route to successful loading. RFC first binds to PCNA in a dynamic, closed conformation that blocks both ATPase activity and DNA binding. RFC then opens the PCNA ring through a large-scale 'crab-claw' expansion of both RFC and PCNA that explains how RFC prefers initial binding of PCNA over DNA. Next, the open RFC:PCNA complex binds DNA and interrogates the primer-template junction using a surprising base-flipping mechanism. Our structures indicate that initial PCNA opening and subsequent closure around DNA do not require ATP hydrolysis, but are driven by binding energy. ATP hydrolysis, which is necessary for RFC release, is triggered by interactions with both PCNA and DNA, explaining RFC’s switch-like ATPase activity. Our work reveals how a AAA+ machine undergoes dramatic conformational changes for achieving binding preference and substrate remodeling.

                Hypertrophic chondrocytes give rise to osteoblasts during skeletal development; however, the process by which these non-mitotic cells make this transition is not well understood. Prior studies have also suggested that skeletal stem and progenitor cells (SSPCs) localize to the surrounding periosteum and serve as a major source of marrow associated SSPCs, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and adipocytes during skeletal development. To further understand the cell transition process by which hypertrophic chondrocytes contribute to osteoblasts or other marrow associated cells, we utilized inducible and constitutive hypertrophic chondrocyte lineage tracing and reporter mouse models (<i>Col10a1CreERT2; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></i><sup> </sup>and <i>Col10a1Cre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></i>) in combination with a <i>PDGFRa<sup>H2B-GFP </sup></i>transgenic line, single cell RNA-sequencing, bulk RNA-sequencing, immunofluorescence staining, and cell transplantation assays. Our data demonstrate that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo a process of dedifferentiation to generate marrow associated SSPCs that serve as a primary source of osteoblasts during skeletal development. These hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs commit to a CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cell phenotype during skeletal development and demonstrate unique abilities to recruit vasculature and promote bone marrow establishment, while also contributing to the adipogenic lineage.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mosaic cis-regulatory evolution drives transcriptional partitioning of HERVH endogenous retrovirus in the human embryo</a></h4>

              
                The human endogenous retrovirus type-H (HERVH) family is expressed in the preimplantation embryo. A subset of these elements are specifically transcribed in pluripotent stem cells where they appear to exert regulatory activities promoting self-renewal and pluripotency. How HERVH elements achieve such transcriptional specificity remains poorly understood. To uncover the sequence features underlying HERVH transcriptional activity, we performed a phyloregulatory analysis of the long terminal repeats (LTR7) of the HERVH family, which harbor its promoter, using a wealth of regulatory genomics data. We found that the family includes at least 8 previously unrecognized subfamilies that have been active at different timepoints in primate evolution and display distinct expression patterns during human embryonic development. Notably, nearly all HERVH elements transcribed in ESCs belong to one of the youngest subfamilies we dubbed LTR7up. LTR7 sequence evolution was driven by a mixture of mutational processes, including point mutations, duplications, and multiple recombination events between subfamilies, that led to transcription factor binding motif modules characteristic of each subfamily. Using a reporter assay, we show that one such motif, a predicted SOX2/3 binding site unique to LTR7up, is essential for robust promoter activity in induced pluripotent stem cells. Together these findings illuminate the mechanisms by which HERVH diversified its expression pattern during evolution to colonize distinct cellular niches within the human embryo.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative mapping of keratin networks in 3D</a></h4>

              
                Mechanobiology requires precise quantitative information on processes taking place in specific 3D microenvironments. Connecting the abundance of microscopical, molecular, biochemical and cell mechanical data with defined topologies has turned out to be extremely difficult. Establishing such structural and functional 3D maps needed for biophysical modeling is a particular challenge for the cytoskeleton, which consists of long and interwoven filamentous polymers coordinating subcellular processes and interactions of cells with their environment. To date, useful tools are available for the segmentation and modeling of actin filaments and microtubules but comprehensive tools for the mapping of intermediate filament organization are still lacking. In this work, we describe a workflow to model and examine the complete 3D arrangement of the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton in canine, murine and human epithelial cells both, in vitro and in vivo. Numerical models are derived from confocal Airyscan high resolution 3D imaging of fluorescence-tagged keratin filaments. They are interrogated and annotated at different length scales using different modes of visualization including immersive virtual reality. In this way, information is provided on network organization at the subcellular level including mesh arrangement, density and isotropic configuration as well as details on filament morphology such as bundling, curvature and orientation. We show that the comparison of these parameters helps to identify, in quantitative terms, similarities and differences of keratin network organization in epithelial cell types defining subcellular domains, notably basal, apical, lateral and perinuclear systems. The described approach and the presented data are pivotal for generating mechanobiological models that can be experimentally tested.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cannabidiol activates neuronal Kv7 channels</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical found in the <i>Cannabis sativa</i> plant, is a clinically effective antiepileptic drug whose mechanism of action is unknown. Using a fluorescence-based thallium flux assay, we performed a large-scale screen and found enhancement of flux through heterologously expressed human Kv7.2/7.3 channels by CBD. Patch-clamp recordings showed that CBD acts at submicromolar concentrations to shift the voltage dependence of Kv7.2/7.3 channels in the hyperpolarizing direction, producing a dramatic enhancement of current at voltages near –50 mV. CBD enhanced native M-current in mouse superior cervical ganglion starting at concentrations of 30 nM and also enhanced M-current in rat hippocampal neurons. The potent enhancement of Kv2/7.3 channels by CBD may contribute to its effectiveness as an antiepileptic drug by reducing neuronal hyperexcitability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The m6A reader YTHDF2 is a negative regulator for dendrite development and maintenance of retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                The precise control of growth and maintenance of the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrite arborization is critical for normal visual functions in mammals. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we find that the m<sup>6</sup>A reader YTHDF2 is highly expressed in the mouse RGCs. Conditional knockout (cKO) of <i>Ythdf2</i> in the retina leads to increased RGC dendrite branching, resulting in more synapses in the inner plexiform layer. Interestingly, the <i>Ythdf2</i> cKO mice show improved visual acuity compared with control mice. We further demonstrate that <i>Ythdf2</i> cKO in the retina protects RGCs from dendrite degeneration caused by the experimental acute glaucoma model. We identify the m<sup>6</sup>A-modified YTHDF2 target transcripts which mediate these effects. This study reveals mechanisms by which YTHDF2 restricts RGC dendrite development and maintenance. YTHDF2 and its target mRNAs might be valuable in developing new treatment approaches for glaucomatous eyes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The transcription factor Xrp1 orchestrates both reduced translation and cell competition upon defective ribosome assembly or function</a></h4>

              
                Ribosomal Protein (<i>Rp</i>) gene haploinsufficiency affects translation rate, can lead to protein aggregation, and causes cell elimination by competition with wild type cells in mosaic tissues. We find that the modest changes in ribosomal subunit levels observed were insufficient for these effects, which all depended on the AT-hook, bZip domain protein Xrp1. Xrp1 reduced global translation through PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α. eIF2α phosphorylation was itself sufficient to enable cell competition of otherwise wild type cells, but through Xrp1 expression, not as the downstream effector of Xrp1. Unexpectedly, many other defects reducing ribosome biogenesis or function (depletion of TAF1B, eIF2, eIF4G, eIF6, eEF2, eEF1α1, or eIF5A), also increased eIF2α phosphorylation and enabled cell competition. This was also through the Xrp1 expression that was induced in these depletions. In the absence of Xrp1, translation differences between cells were not themselves sufficient to trigger cell competition. Xrp1 is shown here to be a sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates transposable elements as well as single-copy genes. Thus, Xrp1 is the master regulator that triggers multiple consequences of ribosomal stresses, and is the key instigator of cell competition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Influence of sensory modality and control dynamics on human path integration</a></h4>

              
                Path integration is a sensorimotor computation that can be used to infer latent dynamical states by integrating self-motion cues. We studied the influence of sensory observation (visual/vestibular) and latent control dynamics (velocity/acceleration) on human path integration using a novel motion-cueing algorithm. Sensory modality and control dynamics were both varied randomly across trials, as participants controlled a joystick to steer to a memorized target location in virtual reality. Visual and vestibular steering cues allowed comparable accuracies only when participants controlled their acceleration, suggesting that vestibular signals, on their own, fail to support accurate path integration in the absence of sustained acceleration. Nevertheless, performance in all conditions reflected a failure to fully adapt to changes in the underlying control dynamics, a result that was well explained by a bias in the dynamics estimation. This work demonstrates how an incorrect internal model of control dynamics affects navigation in volatile environments in spite of continuous sensory feedback.

Here we review and discuss the impact of sex on human circadian and sleep physiology, and we uncover a data gap in the field investigating the non-visual effects of light in humans. A virtual workshop on the biomedical implications of sex differences in sleep and circadian physiology then led to the following imperatives for future research: (1) design research to be inclusive and accessible, (2) implement recruitment strategies that lead to a sex-balanced sample, (3) use data visualization to grasp the effect of sex, (4) implement statistical analyses that include sex as a factor and/or perform group analyses by sex, where possible, (5) make participant-level data open and available to facilitate future meta-analytic efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A meta-analysis of the association between male dimorphism and fitness outcomes in humans</a></h4>

              
                Humans are sexually dimorphic: men and women differ in body build and composition, craniofacial structure, and voice pitch, likely mediated in part by developmental testosterone. Sexual selection hypotheses posit that, ancestrally, more 'masculine' men may have acquired more mates and/or sired more viable offspring. Thus far, however, evidence for either association is unclear. Here, we meta-analyze the relationships between six masculine traits and mating/reproductive outcomes (96 studies, 474 effects, <i>N</i> = 177,044). Voice pitch, height, and testosterone all predicted mating; however, strength/muscularity was the strongest and only consistent predictor of both mating and reproduction. Facial masculinity and digit ratios did not significantly predict either. There was no clear evidence for any effects of masculinity on offspring viability. Our findings support arguments that strength/muscularity may be sexually selected in humans, but cast doubt regarding selection for other forms of masculinity and highlight the need to increase tests of evolutionary hypotheses outside of industrialized populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hematodinium sp. infection does not drive collateral disease contraction in a crustacean host</a></h4>

              
                Host, pathogen, and environment are determinants of the disease triangle, the latter being a key driver of disease outcomes and persistence within a community. The dinoflagellate genus <i>Hematodinium</i> is detrimental to crustaceans globally – considered to suppress the innate defences of hosts, making them more susceptible to co-infections. Evidence supporting immune suppression is largely anecdotal and sourced from diffuse accounts of compromised decapods. We used a population of shore crabs (<i>Carcinus maenas</i>), where <i>Hematodinium</i> sp. is endemic, to determine the extent of collateral infections across two distinct environments (open-water, semi-closed dock). Using a multi-resource approach (PCR, histology, haematology, population genetics, eDNA), we identified 162 <i>Hematodinium-</i>positive crabs and size/sex-matched these to 162 <i>Hematodinium-</i>free crabs out of 1191 analysed. Crabs were interrogated for known additional disease-causing agents; haplosporidians, microsporidians, mikrocytids, <i>Vibrio</i> spp., fungi, <i>Sacculina</i>, trematodes, and haemolymph bacterial loads. We found no significant differences in occurrence, severity, or composition of collateral infections between <i>Hematodinium</i>-positive and <i>Hematodinium</i>-free crabs at either site, but crucially, we recorded site-restricted blends of pathogens. We found no gross signs of host cell immune reactivity towards <i>Hematodinium</i> in the presence or absence of other pathogens. We contend <i>Hematodinium</i> sp. is not the proximal driver of co-infections in shore crabs, which suggests an evolutionary drive towards latency in this environmentally plastic host.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visualizing cellular and tissue ultrastructure using Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx)</a></h4>

              
                Expansion microscopy (ExM) is a powerful technique to overcome the diffraction limit of light microscopy that can be applied in both tissues and cells. In ExM, samples are embedded in a swellable polymer gel to physically expand the sample and isotropically increase resolution in x, y, and z. The maximum resolution increase is limited by the expansion factor of the gel, which is four-fold for the original ExM protocol. Variations on the original ExM method have been reported that allow for greater expansion factors but at the cost of ease of adoption or versatility. Here, we systematically explore the ExM recipe space and present a novel method termed Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx) that, like the original ExM method, requires no specialized equipment or procedures. We demonstrate that TREx gels expand 10-fold, can be handled easily, and can be applied to both thick mouse brain tissue sections and cultured human cells enabling high-resolution subcellular imaging with a single expansion step. Furthermore, we show that TREx can provide ultrastructural context to subcellular protein localization by combining antibody-stained samples with off-the-shelf small-molecule stains for both total protein and membranes.

                Prefrontal cortical influence over the mesolimbic system - including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) - is implicated in various cognitive processes and behavioral malfunctions. The functional versatility of this system could be explained by an underlying anatomical complexity; however, the detailed characterization of the medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) innervation of the NAc and VTA is still lacking. Therefore, combining classical retrograde and conditional viral tracing techniques with multiple fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we sought to deliver a precise, cell- and layer-specific anatomical description of the cortico-mesolimbic pathways. We demonstrated that NAc- (mPFCNAc) and VTA-projecting mPFC (mPFCVTA) populations show different laminar distribution (layers 2/3-5a and 5b-6, respectively) and express different molecular markers. Specifically, calbindin and Ntsr1 are specific to mPFCNAc neurons, while mPFCVTA neurons express high levels of Ctip2 and FoxP2, indicating that these populations are mostly separated at the cellular level. We directly tested this with double retrograde tracing and Canine adenovirus type 2-mediated viral labelling and found that there is indeed minimal overlap between the two populations. Furthermore, whole-brain analysis revealed that the projection patter of these populations is also different throughout the brain. Taken together, we demonstrated that the NAc and the VTA are innervated by two, mostly non-overlapping mPFC populations with different laminar distribution and molecular profile. These results can contribute to the advancement in our understanding of mesocorticolimbic functions and its disorders in future studies.

                Behaviors emerge via a combination of experience and innate predispositions. As the brain matures, it undergoes major changes in cellular, network and functional properties that can be due to sensory experience as well as developmental processes. In normal birdsong learning, neural sequences emerge to control song syllables learned from a tutor. Here, we disambiguate the role of experience and development in neural sequence formation by delaying exposure to a tutor. Using functional calcium imaging, we observe neural sequences in the absence of tutoring, demonstrating that experience is not necessary for the formation of sequences. However, after exposure to a tutor, pre-existing sequences can become tightly associated with new song syllables. Since we delayed tutoring, only half our birds learned new syllables following tutor exposure. The birds that failed to learn were the birds in which pre-tutoring neural sequences were most 'crystallized', that is, already tightly associated with their (untutored) song.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced variability of bursting activity during working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memories have long been thought to be maintained by persistent spiking. However, mounting evidence from multiple-electrode recording (and single-trial analyses) shows that the underlying spiking is better characterized by intermittent bursts of activity. A counterargument suggested this intermittent activity is at odds with observations that spike-time variability reduces during task performance. However, this counterargument rests on assumptions, such as randomness in the timing of the bursts, that may not be correct. Thus, we analyzed spiking and LFPs from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys to determine if task-related reductions in variability can co-exist with intermittent spiking. We found that it does because both spiking and associated gamma bursts were task-modulated, not random. In fact, the task-related reduction in spike variability could be explained by a related reduction in gamma burst variability. Our results provide further support for the intermittent activity models of working memory as well as novel mechanistic insights into how spike variability is reduced during cognitive tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hyperactivity of indirect pathway-projecting spiny projection neurons drives compulsive behavior</a></h4>

              
                Compulsive behaviors are a hallmark symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Striatal hyperactivity has been linked to compulsive behavior generation in correlative studies in humans and causal studies in rodents. However, the contribution of the two distinct striatal output populations to the generation and treatment of compulsive behavior is unknown. These populations of direct and indirect pathway-projecting spiny projection neurons (SPNs) have classically been thought to promote or suppress actions, respectively, leading to a long-held hypothesis that increased output of direct relative to indirect pathway promotes compulsive behavior. Contrary to this hypothesis, here we find that indirect pathway hyperactivity drives compulsive grooming in the Sapap3-knockout mouse model of OCD-relevant behavior. Furthermore, we show that suppression of indirect pathway activity using optogenetics or treatment with the first-line OCD pharmacotherapy fluoxetine is associated with reduced compulsive behavior. Together, these findings highlight the striatal indirect pathway as a potential new treatment target for compulsive behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dyslexia linked to profound impairment in the magnocellular medial geniculate nucleus</a></h4>

              
                The neurological basis of dyslexia, a common reading disorder, remains unclear but is hypothesized to be caused by either dysfunction of the magnocellular system in the brain, abnormal temporal processing, and/or deficient phonological skills. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured activity in the magnocellular portion of the medial geniculate nucleus, the auditory relay in the thalamus, and observed profoundly attenuated responses to non-linguistic transient but not sustained sounds in every subject with dyslexia we tested, compared to normal readers. Our finding unifies these three hypotheses and identifies a core deficit causing dyslexia.

	<p>Facial expression processing mainly depends on whether the facial features related to expressions can be fully acquired, and whether the appropriate processing strategies can be adopted according to different conditions. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulty accurately recognizing facial expressions and responding appropriately, which is regarded as an important cause of their social disorders. This study used eye tracking technology to explore the internal processing mechanism of facial expressions in children with ASD under the influence of spatial frequency and inversion effects for improving their social disorders. The facial expression recognition rate and eye tracking characteristics of children with ASD and typical developing (TD) children on the facial area of interest were recorded and analyzed. The multi-factor mixed experiment results showed that the facial expression recognition rate of children with ASD under various conditions was significantly lower than that of TD children. TD children had more visual attention to the eyes area. However, children with ASD preferred the features of the mouth area, and lacked visual attention and processing of the eyes area. When the face was inverted, TD children had the inversion effect under all three spatial frequency conditions, which was manifested as a significant decrease in expression recognition rate. However, children with ASD only had the inversion effect under the LSF condition, indicating that they mainly used a featural processing method and had the capacity of configural processing under the LSF condition. The eye tracking results showed that when the face was inverted or facial feature information was weakened, both children with ASD and TD children would adjust their facial expression processing strategies accordingly, to increase the visual attention and information processing of their preferred areas. The fixation counts and fixation duration of TD children on the eyes area increased significantly, while the fixation duration of children with ASD on the mouth area increased significantly. The results of this study provided theoretical and practical support for facial expression intervention in children with ASD.</p>

	<p>Background. Numerous neuropsychological studies have shown that cannabis use during adolescence and young adulthood led to deficits in sustained and selective attention. However, few studies have examined functional connectivity in attentional networks among young cannabis users, nor have characterized relationships with cannabis use patterns following abstinence. Methods. Differences in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the dorsal (DAN) and ventral (VAN) attention networks were examined in 36 adolescent and young adult cannabis users and 39 non-substance using controls following two weeks of monitored abstinence. Observed connectivity differences were then correlated with past-year and lifetime cannabis use, length of abstinence, age of regular use onset, and Cannabis Use Disorder symptoms (CUD). Results. After controlling for alcohol and nicotine use, cannabis users had lower RSFC within the DAN network, specifically between right inferior parietal sulcus and right anterior insula, as well as white matter, relative to controls. This region was associated with more severe cannabis use measures, including increased lifetime cannabis use, shorter length of abstinence, and more severe CUD symptoms. Conclusions. Findings demonstrate that regular cannabis use by adolescents and young adults is associated with subtle differences in resting state connectivity within the DAN, even after two weeks of monitored abstinence. Notably, more severe cannabis use markers (greater lifetime use, CUD symptoms, and shorter abstinence) were linked with this reduced connectivity. Thus, findings support public policy aimed at reducing and delaying cannabis use and treatments to assist with sustained abstinence. Future longitudinal studies are needed to investigate causation.</p>

	<p>Research on attention in sport using eye-tracking methodology has highlighted that the highest levels of expertise and performance are characterized by a specific gaze behavior consisting of a perception&amp;amp;ndash;action variable named quiet eye. The present study aimed to understand the role of quiet eye during the three-point shot, especially in game conditions in which even a single point may determine victory or defeat. Twenty-one basketball players (twelve competitive elites and nine semi-elites) with a high-shooting style performed three-point shots in four game scenarios different from each other for the time available (time pressure) and the relevance of the score (performance pressure). The results showed that competitive elites performed a longer quiet eye online duration and a shorter QE preprogramming duration than semi-elites, especially in the highest-pressure condition. On the one hand, these results suggest that quiet eye during three-point shots could fulfill an online control function. On the other hand, the findings stressed the importance of implementing experimental conditions that can resemble as closely as possible actual sport situations. Finally, we suggest that sport professionals interested in administering to athletes a quiet eye training protocol in order to improve three-point shot performance consider the shooting style of the players.</p>

	<p>Body awareness (BA) has long been proposed as a working mechanism of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), yet research on the mediating role of BA is scarce. Hence, the present study assesses the impact of an 8-week MBI on self-reported and indirect measures of BA, investigates the potential mediating role of BA in the relationship between an MBI and symptomatology, evaluates the impact of an MBI on important psychological processes (i.e., experiential avoidance, rumination, self-efficacy, and self-discrepancy), and explores whether these variables act alongside BA in mediating the relationship between an MBI and symptomatology. A non-randomized controlled trial was conducted with 148 participants (n = 89 in the MBI group; n = 59 in the control group) who completed questionnaires assessing BA and the above-mentioned psychological processes before and after an MBI. A sub-sample of participants (n = 86) completed a task that evaluates BA indirectly. Results showed a significant effect of MBI on the self-reported BA but not on the indirect measure of BA. The MBI significantly reduced symptomatology, and this effect was mediated by regulatory and belief-related dimensions of BA. Multiple mediator models showed a significant mediation via various pathways involving improved BA and various transdiagnostic psychological processes.</p>

	<p>In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish display an extraordinary capacity to heal injuries and repair damage in the central nervous system. Pivotal for the regenerative capacity of the zebrafish brain at adult stages is the precise control of neural stem cell (NSC) behavior and the maintenance of the stem cell pool. The gene mdka, a member of a small family of heparin binding growth factors, was previously shown to be involved in regeneration in the zebrafish retina, heart, and fin. Here, we investigated the expression pattern of the gene mdka and its paralogue mdkb in the zebrafish adult telencephalon under constitutive and regenerative conditions. Our findings show that only mdka expression is specifically restricted to the telencephalic ventricle, a stem cell niche of the zebrafish telencephalon. In this brain region, mdka is particularly expressed in the quiescent stem cells. Interestingly, after brain injury, mdka expression remains restricted to the resting stem cell, which might suggest a role of mdka in regulating stem cell quiescence.</p>

                In order to target threatening pathogens, the adaptive immune system performs a continuous reorganization of its lymphocyte repertoire. Following an immune challenge, the B cell repertoire can evolve cells of increased specificity for the encountered strain. This process of affinity maturation generates a memory pool whose diversity and size remain...

                Cancer metabolism, including in mitochondria, is a disease hallmark and therapeutic target, but its regulation is poorly understood. Here, we show that many human tumors have heterogeneous and often reduced levels of Mic60, or Mitofilin, an essential scaffold of mitochondrial structure. Despite a catastrophic collapse of mitochondrial integrity, loss of...

                Expression of Itgax (encoding the CD11c surface protein) and Spp1 (encoding osteopontin; OPN) has been associated with activated microglia that can develop in healthy brains and some neuroinflammatory disorders.
