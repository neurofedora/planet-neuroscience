                arXiv:2409.02957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study aims to investigate the similarities and differences in the brain damage caused by Hypoxia-Ischemia (HI), Hypoglycemia, and Epilepsy. Hypoglycemia poses a significant challenge in improving glycemic regulation for insulin-treated patients, while HI brain disease in neonates is associated with low oxygen levels. The study examines the possibility of using a combination of medical data and Electroencephalography (EEG) measurements to predict outcomes over a two-year period. The study employs a multilevel fusion of data features to enhance the accuracy of the predictions. Therefore this paper suggests a hybridized classification model for Hypoxia-Ischemia and Hypoglycemia, Epilepsy brain injury (HCM-BI). A Support Vector Machine is applied with clinical details to define the Hypoxia-Ischemia outcomes of each infant. The newborn babies are assessed every two years again to know the neural development results. A selection of four attributes is derived from the Electroencephalography records, and SVM does not get conclusions regarding the classification of diseases. The final feature extraction of the EEG signal is optimized by the Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to get the clear health condition of Hypoglycemia and Epilepsy patients. Through monitoring and assessing physical effects resulting from Electroencephalography, The Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) is used to extract the test samples with the most log data and to report hypoglycemia and epilepsy Keywords- Hypoxia-Ischemia , Hypoglycemia , Epilepsy , Multilevel Fusion of Data Features , Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) , Support Vector Machine (SVM)

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03710">Inverse decision-making using neural amortized Bayesian actors</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.03710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian observer and actor models have provided normative explanations for many behavioral phenomena in perception, sensorimotor control, and other areas of cognitive science and neuroscience. They attribute behavioral variability and biases to different interpretable entities such as perceptual and motor uncertainty, prior beliefs, and behavioral costs. However, when extending these models to more complex tasks with continuous actions, solving the Bayesian decision-making problem is often analytically intractable. Moreover, inverting such models to perform inference over their parameters given behavioral data is computationally even more difficult. Therefore, researchers typically constrain their models to easily tractable components, such as Gaussian distributions or quadratic cost functions, or resort to numerical methods. To overcome these limitations, we amortize the Bayesian actor using a neural network trained on a wide range of different parameter settings in an unsupervised fashion. Using the pre-trained neural network enables performing gradient-based Bayesian inference of the Bayesian actor model's parameters. We show on synthetic data that the inferred posterior distributions are in close alignment with those obtained using analytical solutions where they exist. Where no analytical solution is available, we recover posterior distributions close to the ground truth. We then show that identifiability problems between priors and costs can arise in more complex cost functions. Finally, we apply our method to empirical data and show that it explains systematic individual differences of behavioral patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03749">Dynamics of Supervised and Reinforcement Learning in the Non-Linear Perceptron</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.03749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of a brain or a neural network to efficiently learn depends crucially on both the task structure and the learning rule. Previous works have analyzed the dynamical equations describing learning in the relatively simplified context of the perceptron under assumptions of a student-teacher framework or a linearized output. While these assumptions have facilitated theoretical understanding, they have precluded a detailed understanding of the roles of the nonlinearity and input-data distribution in determining the learning dynamics, limiting the applicability of the theories to real biological or artificial neural networks. Here, we use a stochastic-process approach to derive flow equations describing learning, applying this framework to the case of a nonlinear perceptron performing binary classification. We characterize the effects of the learning rule (supervised or reinforcement learning, SL/RL) and input-data distribution on the perceptron's learning curve and the forgetting curve as subsequent tasks are learned. In particular, we find that the input-data noise differently affects the learning speed under SL vs. RL, as well as determines how quickly learning of a task is overwritten by subsequent learning. Additionally, we verify our approach with real data using the MNIST dataset. This approach points a way toward analyzing learning dynamics for more-complex circuit architectures.

                arXiv:2310.07543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing judgments of similarity within a perceptual or semantic domain, and making inferences about the underlying structure of this domain from these judgments, has an increasingly important role in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We present a new framework for this purpose that makes limited assumptions about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments. The approach starts from a dataset of empirical judgments of relative similarities: the fraction of times that a subject chooses one of two comparison stimuli to be more similar to a reference stimulus. These empirical judgments provide Bayesian estimates of underling choice probabilities. From these estimates, we derive indices that characterize the set of judgments in three ways: compatibility with a symmetric dis-similarity, compatibility with an ultrametric space, and compatibility with an additive tree. Each of the indices is derived from rank-order relationships among the choice probabilities that, as we show, are necessary and sufficient for local consistency with the three respective characteristics. We illustrate this approach with simulations and example psychophysical datasets of dis-similarity judgments in several visual domains and provide code that implements the analyses at https://github.com/jvlab/simrank.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17334">Role of Data-driven Regional Growth Model in Shaping Brain Folding Patterns</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.17334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface morphology of the developing mammalian brain is crucial for understanding brain function and dysfunction. Computational modeling offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms for early brain folding. Recent findings indicate significant regional variations in brain tissue growth, while the role of these variations in cortical development remains unclear. In this study, we unprecedently explored how regional cortical growth affects brain folding patterns using computational simulation. We first developed growth models for typical cortical regions using machine learning (ML)-assisted symbolic regression, based on longitudinal real surface expansion and cortical thickness data from prenatal and infant brains derived from over 1,000 MRI scans of 735 pediatric subjects with ages ranging from 29 post-menstrual weeks to 24 months. These models were subsequently integrated into computational software to simulate cortical development with anatomically realistic geometric models. We comprehensively quantified the resulting folding patterns using multiple metrics such as mean curvature, sulcal depth, and gyrification index. Our results demonstrate that regional growth models generate complex brain folding patterns that more closely match actual brains structures, both quantitatively and qualitatively, compared to conventional uniform growth models. Growth magnitude plays a dominant role in shaping folding patterns, while growth trajectory has a minor influence. Moreover, multi-region models better capture the intricacies of brain folding than single-region models. Our results underscore the necessity and importance of incorporating regional growth heterogeneity into brain folding simulations, which could enhance early diagnosis and treatment of cortical malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy and autism.

                arXiv:2305.10937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian models of perception and learning feature prominently in contemporary cognitive neuroscience where, for example, they inform computational concepts of mental disorders. This includes predictive coding and hierarchical Gaussian filtering (HGF), which differ in the nature of hierarchical representations. Predictive coding assumes that higher levels in a given hierarchy influence the state (value) of lower levels. In HGF, however, higher levels determine the rate of change at lower levels. Here, we extend the space of generative models underlying HGF to include a form of nonlinear hierarchical coupling between state values akin to predictive coding and artificial neural networks in general. We derive the update equations corresponding to this generalization of HGF and conceptualize them as connecting a network of (belief) nodes where parent nodes either predict the state of child nodes or their rate of change. This enables us to (1) create modular architectures with generic computational steps in each node of the network, and (2) disclose the hierarchical message passing implied by generalized HGF models and to compare this to comparable schemes under predictive coding. We find that the algorithmic architecture instantiated by the generalized HGF is largely compatible with that of predictive coding but extends it with some unique predictions which arise from precision and volatility related computations. Our developments enable highly flexible implementations of hierarchical Bayesian models for empirical data analysis and are available as open source software.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03187">How noise affects memory in linear recurrent networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of noise on memory in a linear recurrent network are theoretically investigated. Memory is characterized by its ability to store previous inputs in its instantaneous state of network, which receives a correlated or uncorrelated noise. Two major properties are revealed: First, the memory reduced by noise is uniquely determined by the noise's power spectral density (PSD). Second, the memory will not decrease regardless of noise intensity if the PSD is in a certain class of distribution (including power law). The results are verified using the human brain signals, showing good agreement.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03328">Pareto Set Prediction Assisted Bilevel Multi-objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization problems comprise an upper level optimization task that contains a lower level optimization task as a constraint. While there is a significant and growing literature devoted to solving bilevel problems with single objective at both levels using evolutionary computation, there is relatively scarce work done to address problems with multiple objectives (BLMOP) at both levels. For black-box BLMOPs, the existing evolutionary techniques typically utilize nested search, which in its native form consumes large number of function evaluations. In this work, we propose to reduce this expense by predicting the lower level Pareto set for a candidate upper level solution directly, instead of conducting an optimization from scratch. Such a prediction is significantly challenging for BLMOPs as it involves one-to-many mapping scenario. We resolve this bottleneck by supplementing the dataset using a helper variable and construct a neural network, which can then be trained to map the variables in a meaningful manner. Then, we embed this initialization within a bilevel optimization framework, termed Pareto set prediction assisted evolutionary bilevel multi-objective optimization (PSP-BLEMO). Systematic experiments with existing state-of-the-art methods are presented to demonstrate its benefit. The experiments show that the proposed approach is competitive across a range of problems, including both deceptive and non-deceptive problems

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03368">Training-free Conversion of Pretrained ANNs to SNNs for Low-Power and High-Performance Applications</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.03368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising substitute for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their advantages of fast inference and low power consumption. However, the lack of efficient training algorithms has hindered their widespread adoption. Existing supervised learning algorithms for SNNs require significantly more memory and time than their ANN counterparts. Even commonly used ANN-SNN conversion methods necessitate re-training of ANNs to enhance conversion efficiency, incurring additional computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training-free ANN-SNN conversion pipeline. Our approach directly converts pre-trained ANN models into high-performance SNNs without additional training. The conversion pipeline includes a local-learning-based threshold balancing algorithm, which enables efficient calculation of the optimal thresholds and fine-grained adjustment of threshold value by channel-wise scaling. We demonstrate the scalability of our framework across three typical computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. This showcases its applicability to both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we have evaluated the energy consumption of the converted SNNs, demonstrating their superior low-power advantage compared to conventional ANNs. Our training-free algorithm outperforms existing methods, highlighting its practical applicability and efficiency. This approach simplifies the deployment of SNNs by leveraging open-source pre-trained ANN models and neuromorphic hardware, enabling fast, low-power inference with negligible performance reduction.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07136">STCSNN: High energy efficiency spike-train level spiking neural networks with spatio-temporal conversion</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2307.07136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neuron networks (SNNs) have attracted widespread research interest due to their low power features, high biological plausibility, and strong spatiotemporal information processing capability. Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed STCSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed STCSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15409">Painful intelligence: What AI can tell us about human suffering</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2205.15409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book uses the modern theory of artificial intelligence (AI) to understand human suffering or mental pain. Both humans and sophisticated AI agents process information about the world in order to achieve goals and obtain rewards, which is why AI can be used as a model of the human brain and mind. This book intends to make the theory accessible to a relatively general audience, requiring only some relevant scientific background.
  The book starts with the assumption that suffering is mainly caused by frustration. Frustration means the failure of an agent (whether AI or human) to achieve a goal or a reward it wanted or expected. Frustration is inevitable because of the overwhelming complexity of the world, limited computational resources, and scarcity of good data. In particular, such limitations imply that an agent acting in the real world must cope with uncontrollability, unpredictability, and uncertainty, which all lead to frustration.
  Fundamental in such modelling is the idea of learning, or adaptation to the environment. While AI uses machine learning, humans and animals adapt by a combination of evolutionary mechanisms and ordinary learning. Even frustration is fundamentally an error signal that the system uses for learning. This book explores various aspects and limitations of learning algorithms and their implications regarding suffering.
  At the end of the book, the computational theory is used to derive various interventions or training methods that will reduce suffering in humans. The amount of frustration is expressed by a simple equation which indicates how it can be reduced. The ensuing interventions are very similar to those proposed by Buddhist and Stoic philosophy, and include mindfulness meditation. Therefore, this book can be interpreted as an exposition of a computational theory justifying why such philosophies and meditation reduce human suffering.

	<p>Tai Chi (TC) practice has been shown to improve both cognitive and physical function in older adults. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the benefits of TC remain unclear. Our primary aims are to explore whether distinct age-related and TC-practice-related relationships can be identified with respect to either temporal or spatial (within/between-network connectivity) differences. This cross-sectional study examined recurrent neural network dynamics, employing an adaptive, data-driven thresholding approach to source-localized resting-state EEG data in order to identify meaningful connections across time-varying graphs, using both temporal and spatial features derived from a hidden Markov model (HMM). Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests assessed between-group differences in temporal and spatial features by age and TC practice using either healthy younger adult controls (YACs, n = 15), healthy older adult controls (OACs, n = 15), or Tai Chi older adult practitioners (TCOAs, n = 15). Our results showed that aging is associated with decreased within-network and between-network functional connectivity (FC) across most brain networks. Conversely, TC practice appears to mitigate these age-related declines, showing increased FC within and between networks in older adults who practice TC compared to non-practicing older adults. These findings suggest that TC practice may abate age-related declines in neural network efficiency and stability, highlighting its potential as a non-pharmacological intervention for promoting healthy brain aging. This study furthers the triple-network model, showing that a balancing and reorientation of attention might be engaged not only through higher-order and top-down mechanisms (i.e., FPN/DAN) but also via the coupling of bottom-up, sensory&amp;amp;ndash;motor (i.e., SMN/VIN) networks.</p>

                <p>Musicians can have better abilities to understand speech in adverse condition such as background noise than non-musicians. However, the neural mechanisms behind such enhanced behavioral performances remain largely unclear. Studies have found that the subcortical frequency-following response to the fundamental frequency of speech and its higher harmonics (speech-FFR) may be involved since it is larger in people with musical training than in those without. Recent research has shown that the speech-FFR consists of a cortical contribution in addition to the subcortical sources. Both the subcortical and the cortical contribution are modulated by selective attention to one of two competing speakers. However, it is unknown whether the strength of the cortical contribution to the speech-FFR, or its attention modulation, is influenced by musical training. Here we investigate these issues through magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of 52 subjects (18 musicians, 25 non-musicians, and 9 neutral participants) listening to two competing male speakers while selectively attending one of them. The speech-in-noise comprehension abilities of the participants were not assessed. We find that musicians and non-musicians display comparable cortical speech-FFRs and additionally exhibit similar subject-to-subject variability in the response. Furthermore, we also do not observe a difference in the modulation of the neural response through selective attention between musicians and non-musicians. Moreover, when assessing whether the cortical speech-FFRs are influenced by particular aspects of musical training, no significant effects emerged. Taken together, we did not find any effect of musical training on the cortical speech-FFR.</p>

                Background Tonsillectomy is among the standard procedures performed on the head and neck. Acute pain following tonsillectomy impairs recovery and contributes to physical discomfort. Adequate pharmacological management of post-operative pain increases the satisfaction and well-being of a patient. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacological management of acute pain post-tonsillectomy in the otorhinolaryngology department at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) Methods A hospital-based prospective cohort study was carried out among 72 patients. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from selected patients who underwent cold tonsillectomy. Postoperative pain assessment was conducted at six, 12, and 18 hours from initiation of pharmacological management following tonsillectomy. An interviewer-administered numerical rating scale was used for assessing postoperative pain scores. Results A total of 72 patients were enrolled, of which most were female (73.6%). The majority of patients were in the age group of 8–15 years (50%). Paracetamol was the commonest analgesia prescribed (37.5%) post-tonsillectomy. The majority of patients experienced moderate pain at six- and 12-hours following tonsillectomy, 55.6% and 65.3%, respectively, whereas 88.9% of patients had mild pain at 18 hours after initial analgesic administration. Pain relief was attained by all patients aged 16–23 years (96.6%), all being female patients, and these differences were statistically insignificant. Paracetamol achieved pain reduction from moderate pain (59.3%) and severe pain (37.0%) at six hours to mild pain at 18 hours (88.9%). Conclusions Paracetamol was the commonly prescribed analgesic following tonsillectomy with majority of patients attaining moderate pain; however, there was no significant difference between the use of combined drugs and single drug use. This could be influenced by the sample size of the studied population and individual variations in pain perception.

                Background Digital elevation models (DEMs) are important in many fields, such as geomatics and water conservation in mountainous areas. Geomorphic feature lines are necessary for topography interpolation and computation from DEMs. Methods Instead of a parameter space, we propose a novel automatic extraction of geomorphic feature lines in the feature space from discrete airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data by the tensor voting method (TVM), which was originally developed for image data. A tensor field for discrete airborne LiDAR points was first established, and then, utilizing the TVM, a new geometric feature metric of data, the line feature strength, was captured. A practical line-growing method based on the local maxima line feature strength is proposed in this study. Results Compared with general line growing, which is based on a certain threshold, our line growing method is quite effective, particularly for the extraction of primary and minor ridge and valley lines in mountainous areas. Conclusions The method presented in this paper is fast and automated, and can furnish operators with a wealth of detailed information about minor line features. This enables the extraction of ridge and valley lines that are tailored to specific requirements.

                SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1, otherwise known as SMOC-1, is a secreted glycoprotein involved in various cell biological processes including cell-matrix interactions, osteoblast differentiation, embryonic development, and homeostasis. SMOC-1 was found to be elevated in asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patient cortex as well as being enriched in amyloid plaques and in AD patientcerebrospinal fluid, arguing for SMOC-1 as a promising biomarker for AD. Having access to high-quality SMOC-1 antibodies is crucial for the scientific community. It can ensure the consistency and reliability of SMOC-1 research, and further the exploration of its potential as both a therapeutic target or diagnostic marker.. In this study, we characterized seven SMOC-1 commercial antibodies for Western blot and immunoprecipitation, using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified successful antibodies in the tested applications and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

                Background Dendritic spines are tiny protrusions found along the dendrites of neurons, and their number is a measure of the density of synaptic connections. Altered density and morphology is observed in several pathologies, and spine formation as well as morphological changes correlate with learning and memory. The detection of spines in microscopy images and the analysis of their morphology is therefore a prerequisite for many studies. We have developed a new open-source, freely available, plugin for ImageJ/FIJI, called Spot Spine, that allows detection and morphological measurements of spines in three dimensional images. Method Local maxima are detected in spine heads, and the intensity distribution around the local maximum is computed to perform the segmentation of each spine head. Spine necks are then traced from the spine head to the dendrite. Several parameters can be set to optimize detection and segmentation, and manual correction gives further control over the result of the process. Results The plugin allows the analysis of images of dendrites obtained with various labeling and imaging methods. Quantitative measurements are retrieved including spine head volume and surface, and neck length. Conclusion The plugin and instructions for use are available at https://imagej.net/plugins/spot-spine.

Surveillance systems that monitor pathogen genome sequences are critical for rapidly detecting the introduction and emergence of pathogen variants. To evaluate how interactions between surveillance capacity, variant properties, and the epidemiological context influence the timeliness of pathogen variant detection, we developed a geographically explicit stochastic compartmental model to simulate the transmission of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant in New York City. We measured the impact of (1) testing and sequencing volume, (2) geographic targeting of testing, (3) the timing and location of variant emergence, and (4) the relative variant transmissibility on detection speed and on the undetected disease burden. Improvements in detection times and reduction of undetected infections were driven primarily by increases in the number of sequenced samples. The relative transmissibility of the new variant and the epidemic context of variant emergence also influenced detection times, showing that individual surveillance strategies can result in a wide range of detection outcomes, depending on the underlying dynamics of the circulating variants. These findings help contextualize the design, interpretation, and trade-offs of genomic surveillance strategies of pandemic respiratory pathogens.

                <p>by Hao Duan, Qingchen Zhang, Feifei Cui, Quan Zou, Zilong Zhang</p>

Spatial transcriptome technology can parse transcriptomic data at the spatial level to detect high-throughput gene expression and preserve information regarding the spatial structure of tissues. Identifying spatial domains, that is identifying regions with similarities in gene expression and histology, is the most basic and critical aspect of spatial transcriptome data analysis. Most current methods identify spatial domains only through a single view, which may obscure certain important information and thus fail to make full use of the information embedded in spatial transcriptome data. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised clustering framework based on multiview graph convolutional networks (MVST) to achieve accurate spatial domain recognition by the learning graph embedding features of neighborhood graphs constructed from gene expression information, spatial location information, and histopathological image information through multiview graph convolutional networks. By exploring spatial transcriptomes from multiple views, MVST enables data from all parts of the spatial transcriptome to be comprehensively and fully utilized to obtain more accurate spatial expression patterns. We verified the effectiveness of MVST on real spatial transcriptome datasets, the robustness of MVST on some simulated datasets, and the reasonableness of the framework structure of MVST in ablation experiments, and from the experimental results, it is clear that MVST can achieve a more accurate spatial domain identification compared with the current more advanced methods. In conclusion, MVST is a powerful tool for spatial transcriptome research with improved spatial domain recognition.

                <p>by Caterina Millevoi, Damiano Pasetto, Massimiliano Ferronato</p>

Compartmental models provide simple and efficient tools to analyze the relevant transmission processes during an outbreak, to produce short-term forecasts or transmission scenarios, and to assess the impact of vaccination campaigns. However, their calibration is not straightforward, since many factors contribute to the rapid change of the transmission dynamics. For example, there might be changes in the individual awareness, the imposition of non-pharmacological interventions and the emergence of new variants. As a consequence, model parameters such as the transmission rate are doomed to vary in time, making their assessment more challenging. Here, we propose to use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to track the temporal changes in the model parameters and the state variables. PINNs recently gained attention in many engineering applications thanks to their ability to consider both the information from data (typically uncertain) and the governing equations of the system. The ability of PINNs to identify unknown model parameters makes them particularly suitable to solve ill-posed inverse problems, such as those arising in the application of epidemiological models. Here, we develop a reduced-split approach for the implementation of PINNs to estimate the temporal changes in the state variables and transmission rate of an epidemic based on the SIR model equation and infectious data. The main idea is to split the training first on the epidemiological data, and then on the residual of the system equations. The proposed method is applied to five synthetic test cases and two real scenarios reproducing the first months of the Italian COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that the split implementation of PINNs outperforms the joint approach in terms of accuracy (up to one order of magnitude) and computational times (speed up of 20%). Finally, we illustrate that the proposed PINN-method can also be adopted to produced short-term forecasts of the dynamics of an epidemic.

                <p>by Ariel Rokem</p>

As large, high-dimensional data have become more common, software development is playing an increasingly important role in research across many different fields. This creates a need to adopt software engineering practices in research settings. Code review is the engineering practice of giving and receiving detailed feedback on a computer program. Consistent and continuous examination of the evolution of computer programs by others has been shown to be beneficial, especially when reviewers are familiar with the technical aspects of the software and also when they possess relevant domain expertise. The rules described in the present article provide information about the why, when, and how of code review. They provide the motivation for continual code reviews as a natural part of a rigorous research program. They provide practical guidelines for conducting review of code both in person, as a “lab meeting for code,” as well as asynchronously, using industry-standard online tools. A set of guidelines is provided for the nitty-gritty details of code review, as well as for the etiquette of such a review. Both the technical and the social aspects of code review are covered to provide the reader with a comprehensive approach that facilitates an effective, enjoyable, and educational approach to code review.

                <p>by Gustavo Menesse, Joaquín J. Torres</p>

The relation between electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, brain functions, and behavioral correlates is well-established. Some physiological mechanisms underlying rhythm generation are understood, enabling the replication of brain rhythms <i>in silico</i>. This offers a pathway to explore connections between neural oscillations and specific neuronal circuits, potentially yielding fundamental insights into the functional properties of brain waves. Information theory frameworks, such as Integrated information Decomposition (Φ-ID), relate dynamical regimes with informational properties, providing deeper insights into neuronal dynamic functions. Here, we investigate wave emergence in an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balanced network of <i>integrate and fire</i> neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity. This model produces a diverse range of EEG-like rhythms, from low <i>δ</i> waves to high-frequency oscillations. Through Φ-ID, we analyze the network’s information dynamics and its relation with different emergent rhythms, elucidating the system’s suitability for functions such as robust information transfer, storage, and parallel operation. Furthermore, our study helps to identify regimes that may resemble pathological states due to poor informational properties and high randomness. We found, e.g., that <i>in silico</i> <i>β</i> and <i>δ</i> waves are associated with maximum information transfer in inhibitory and excitatory neuron populations, respectively, and that the coexistence of excitatory <i>θ</i>, <i>α</i>, and <i>β</i> waves is associated to information storage. Additionally, we observed that high-frequency oscillations can exhibit either high or poor informational properties, potentially shedding light on ongoing discussions regarding physiological versus pathological high-frequency oscillations. In summary, our study demonstrates that dynamical regimes with similar oscillations may exhibit vastly different information dynamics. Characterizing information dynamics within these regimes serves as a potent tool for gaining insights into the functions of complex neuronal networks. Finally, our findings suggest that the use of information dynamics in both model and experimental data analysis, could help discriminate between oscillations associated with cognitive functions and those linked to neuronal disorders.

                <p>by Artemy Bakulin, Noam B. Teyssier, Martin Kampmann, Matvei Khoroshkin, Hani Goodarzi</p>

Inferring the driving regulatory programs from comparative analysis of gene expression data is a cornerstone of systems biology. Many computational frameworks were developed to address this problem, including our iPAGE (information-theoretic Pathway Analysis of Gene Expression) toolset that uses information theory to detect non-random patterns of expression associated with given pathways or regulons. Our recent observations, however, indicate that existing approaches are susceptible to the technical biases that are inherent to most real world annotations. To address this, we have extended our information-theoretic framework to account for specific biases and artifacts in biological networks using the concept of conditional information. To showcase pyPAGE, we performed a comprehensive analysis of regulatory perturbations that underlie the molecular etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). pyPAGE successfully recapitulated several known AD-associated gene expression programs. We also discovered several additional regulons whose differential activity is significantly associated with AD. We further explored how these regulators relate to pathological processes in AD through cell-type specific analysis of single cell and spatial gene expression datasets. Our findings showcase the utility of pyPAGE as a precise and reliable biomarker discovery in complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.

How can inter-individual variability be quantified? Measuring many features per experiment raises the question of choosing them to recapitulate high-dimensional data. Tackling this challenge on spindle elongation phenotypes, we showed that only three typical elongation patterns describe spindle elongation in <i>C. elegans</i> one-cell embryo. These archetypes, automatically extracted from the experimental data using principal component analysis (PCA), accounted for more than 95% of inter-individual variability of more than 1600 experiments across more than 100 different conditions. The two first archetypes were related to spindle average length and anaphasic elongation rate. The third archetype, accounting for 6% of the variability, was novel and corresponded to a transient spindle shortening in late metaphase, reminiscent of kinetochore function-defect phenotypes. Importantly, these three archetypes were robust to the choice of the dataset and were found even considering only non-treated conditions. Thus, the inter-individual differences between genetically perturbed embryos have the same underlying nature as natural inter-individual differences between wild-type embryos, independently of the temperatures. We thus propose that beyond the apparent complexity of the spindle, only three independent mechanisms account for spindle elongation, weighted differently in the various conditions. Interestingly, the spindle-length archetypes covered both metaphase and anaphase, suggesting that spindle elongation in late metaphase is sufficient to predict the late anaphase length. We validated this idea using a machine-learning approach. Finally, given amounts of these three archetypes could represent a quantitative phenotype. To take advantage of this, we set out to predict interacting genes from a seed based on the PCA coefficients. We exemplified this firstly on the role of <i>tpxl-1</i> whose homolog <i>tpx2</i> is involved in spindle microtubule branching, secondly the mechanism regulating metaphase length, and thirdly the central spindle players which set the length at anaphase. We found novel interactors not in public databases but supported by recent experimental publications.

Centrosome amplification is a feature of cancer cells associated with chromosome instability and invasiveness. Enhancing chromosome instability and subsequent cancer cell death via centrosome unclustering and multipolar divisions is an aimed-for therapeutic approach. Here, we show that centrosome amplification potentiates responses to conventional chemotherapy in addition to its effect on multipolar divisions and chromosome instability. We perform single-cell live imaging of chemotherapy responses in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and observe increased cell death when centrosome amplification is induced. By correlating cell fate with mitotic behaviors, we show that enhanced cell death can occur independently of chromosome instability. We identify that cells with centrosome amplification are primed for apoptosis. We show they are dependent on the apoptotic inhibitor BCL-XL and that this is not a consequence of mitotic stresses associated with centrosome amplification. Given the multiple mechanisms that promote chemotherapy responses in cells with centrosome amplification, we assess such a relationship in an epithelial ovarian cancer patient cohort. We show that high centrosome numbers associate with improved treatment responses and longer overall survival. Our work identifies apoptotic priming as a clinically relevant consequence of centrosome amplification, expanding our understanding of this pleiotropic cancer cell feature.

                Abstract* Background Digital addictions are a major problem worldwide, which has increased considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this scenario, two important impact factors to explain this problem are stress and anxiety because of COVID-19. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of distress and anxiety due to COVID-19 on digital addictions. Methods cross-sectional, explanatory study. A total of 802 students from public and private universities residing in the city of Lima and Callao (Peru), with a mean age of 21.68 (SD = 3.11), selected by convenience sampling, participated in the study. The MULTICAGE CAD-4 questionnaire, the distress scale, and the COVID-19 worry scale were applied. Results two models examined with structural equation modeling showed good fit indices (CFI and TLI > .95, RMSEA and SRMR < .06). The first model shows that the latent variables distress and anxiety due to COVID-19 have direct effects on digital addictions as a general construct (R2 = 22%). The second model shows that the exogenous latent variables (stress and anxiety) have direct effects of different magnitudes on each digital technology, so the variance explained on smartphone addiction was higher (R2 = 25%) with respect to internet (R2 = 19%) and video game addiction (R2 = 6%). It was also found that for every male, there are two females with high levels of distress and anxiety. Regarding the problematic use of smartphones and internet, there is a prevalence of 40% regardless of sex; but as for the problematic use of video games, there is a marked difference between males (18.8%) and females (2.7%). Conclusion the distress and anxiety caused by COVID-19 have a direct impact in aggravating digital addictions.

<p>Immune cell-derived IL-4 induces Ly6C<sup>+</sup> macrophages to express BDNF. Following the injection of IL-4 neutralizing antibody into the infarct, the BDNF, IL-4 protein lev and the quantity of BDNF<sup>+</sup>/Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells significantly decreased.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We reported that infiltrated Ly6C<sup>+</sup> macrophages express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) only at the cerebral cortex infarct in a rat dMCAO model. However, the changein neuron-expressed BDNF, the niche components that induce the Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells to express BDNF, and the cellular sources of these components, remain unclear. In this study, immunofluorescence double staining was performed to label BDNF and Ly6C on brain sections at 3, 24, and 48 h following distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) of male rats, and to stain BDNF with Ly6C, IL-4R, and IL-10R. A neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibody was injected into the infarct, and the IL-4 and BDNF concentrations in the subareas of the infarct were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To find out the cellular sources of IL-4, the markers for microglia, T cells, and neurons were co-stained with IL-4 separately. In certain infarct subareas, the main BDNF-expressing cells shifted quickly from NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons to Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells during 24–48 h post-stroke, and the Ly6C<sup>+</sup>/BDNF<sup>+</sup> cells mostly expressed IL-4 receptor. Following IL-4 neutralizing antibody injection, the BDNF, IL-4 protein levels, and BDNF<sup>+</sup>/Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells decreased significantly. The main IL-4-expressing cell type in this infarct subarea is not neuron either, but immune cells, including microglia, monocyte, macrophages, and T cells. The neurons, maintained BDNF and IL-4 expression in the peri-infarct area. In conclusion, in a specific cerebral subarea of the rat dMCAO model, IL-4 secreted by immune cells is one of the main inducers for Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells to express BDNF.</p>

     alt="Thorny and Tufted Retinal Ganglion Cells Express the Transcription Factor Forkhead Proteins Foxp1 and Foxp2 in Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)"/>
<p>We identify a novel ganglion cell type in marmoset retina, named tufted cell, which expresses the transcription factor Foxp2. Tufted cells are characterized by bare primary dendrites which branch frequently in the peripheral dendritic field to form dense tufts. The dendritic stratification and overall dendritic field size of tufted cells is otherwise comparable to that of broad thorny ganglion cells. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The transcription factor forkhead/winged-helix domain proteins Foxp1 and Foxp2 have previously been studied in mouse retina, where they are expressed in retinal ganglion cells named F-mini and F-midi. Here we show that both transcription factors are expressed by small subpopulations (on average less than 10%) of retinal ganglion cells in the retina of the marmoset monkey (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). The morphology of Foxp1- and Foxp2-expressing cells was revealed by intracellular DiI injections of immunofluorescent cells. Foxp1- and Foxp2-expressing cells comprised multiple types of wide-field ganglion cells, including broad thorny cells, narrow thorny cells, and tufted cells. The large majority of Foxp2-expressing cells were identified as tufted cells. Tufted cells stratify broadly in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. They resemble broad thorny cells but their proximal dendrites are bare of branches and the distal dendrites branch frequently forming dense dendritic tufts. Double labeling with calretinin, a previously established marker for broad thorny and narrow thorny cells, showed that only a small proportion of ganglion cells co-expressed calretinin and Foxp1 or Foxp2 supporting the idea that the two markers are differentially expressed in retinal ganglion cells of marmoset retina.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We have investigated the hippocampal connectivity of the marmoset presubiculum (PreS) and reported that major connections of PreS in the rat were conserved in the marmoset. Moreover, our results indicated the presence of several additional projections that were almost absent in the rat brain, but abundant in the marmoset, such as direct projections from CA1 to PreS. However, little is known about the connectivity between the frontal brain regions and PreS or hippocampal formation. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of cells of the origins and terminals of the presubicular and hippocampal projections in the marmoset frontal brain regions using the retrograde and anterograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit. In cases of tracer injections into all layers of PreS, many neurons and terminals were labeled in the claustrum–endopiriform (Cl–En) complex almost entirely along the rostrocaudal axis. Even in cases where the injection site involved the superficial (not deep) layers of PreS, labeled neurons and terminals were distributed over a wide rostrocaudal range of the Cl–En complex, but their number and density were significantly lower than the whole-layer injection cases. In cases where the injection site was confined to the hippocampal formation, labeled cells and terminals were localized at a restricted portion of the Cl–En complex. Here, we demonstrate for what we believe to be the first time the strong, reciprocal connections of the Cl–En complex with PreS and projections from the Cl–En complex to the hippocampal regions (CA1 and the subiculum) in the marmoset. Our findings indicate that the Cl–En complex may exert a strong influence on the cortical and subcortical outputs from PreS and, in turn, the entire memory circuitry in the marmoset brain.</p>

     alt="Sources of Rapid and Delayed New Lower Jaw Input in the Forepaw Barrel Subfield (FBS) in Rat Primary Somatosensory Cortex (SI) Following Forelimb Deafferentation"/>
<p>The rat's forepaw is represented in the forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) of the somatosensory cortex. After forelimb input loss, the anterior FBS immediately responds to lower jaw stimulation, with the entire FBS doing so in 7 weeks. The lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF) supplies immediate input, whereas the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamus provides new delayed input to the posterior FBS.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Previously, we reported an immediate emergence of new lower jaw input to the anterior forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) following forelimb deafferentation. However, a delay of 7 weeks or more post-amputation results in the presence of this new input to both anterior and posterior FBS. The immediate change suggests pre-existing latent lower jaw input in the FBS, whereas the delayed alteration implies the involvement of alternative sources. One possible source for immediate lower jaw responses is the neighboring lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF). We used anatomical tracers to investigate the possible projection of LJBSF to the FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats. Our findings are as follows: (1) anterograde tracer injection into LJBSF in normal and amputated rats labeled fibers and terminals exclusively in the anterior FBS; (2) retrograde tracer injection in the anterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, heavily labeled cell bodies predominantly in the posterior LJBSF, with fewer in the anterior LJBSF; (3) retrograde tracer injection in the posterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, sparsely labeled cell bodies in the posterior LJBSF; (4) retrograde tracer injection in anterior and posterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, labeled cells exclusively in ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus and posterior thalamus (PO); (5) retrograde tracer injection in LJBSF-labeled cell bodies exclusively in ventral posterior medial thalamic nucleus and PO. These findings suggest that LJBSF facilitates rapid lower jaw reorganization in the anterior FBS, whereas VPL and/or other subcortical sites provide a likely substrate for delayed reorganization observed in the posterior FBS.</p>

     alt="Scaled Complexity of Mammalian Astrocytes: Insights From Mouse and Macaque"/>
<p>We used a multi-technique approach (including immunohistochemistry, AAV-mediated transduction of astrocytes, diOlistics, confocal imaging, and electron microscopy) to label astrocytes in mice and rhesus macaques and conducted a comprehensive morphological analysis. 

</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Astrocytes intricately weave within the neuropil, giving rise to characteristic bushy morphologies. Pioneering studies suggested that primate astrocytes are more complex due to increased branch numbers and territory size compared to rodent counterparts. However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of astrocyte morphology across species. We employed several techniques to investigate astrocyte morphology and directly compared them between mice and rhesus macaques in cortical and subcortical regions. We assessed astrocyte density, territory size, branching structure, fine morphological complexity, and interactions with neuronal synapses using a combination of techniques, including immunohistochemistry, adeno-associated virus–mediated transduction of astrocytes, diOlistics, confocal imaging, and electron microscopy. We found significant morphological similarities between primate and rodent astrocytes, suggesting that astrocyte structure has scaled with evolution. Our findings show that primate astrocytes are larger and more numerous than those in rodents but contest the view that primate astrocytes are morphologically far more complex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1550/v2?src=rss">Sample size variation in single-time post-dose assessment vs multi-time post-dose assessment [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many randomized trials measure a continuous outcome simultaneously at baseline and after taking the drug. For a single continuous post-treatment outcome, the sample size calculation is simple, but if there are assessments at multiple time points post-treatment then this longitudinal data may give more insights by analyzing the data using the repeated measures method. Also, if the sample size is calculated using the single time-point method for longitudinal data, it may lead to a larger than required sample size, increasing the cost and time. Methods: In this research, an effort is made to determine the size of the sample for repeated measures case and then compared with the single post-baseline case. The sample sizes were examined under different scenarios for the continuous type of response variable. Under Mean contrast and Diff contrast the sample sizes were calculated with different correlations. These two scenarios were again examined under compound symmetry as well as Auto regressive of order 1 type of correlation structure in longitudinal data. The graphical presentation is given for better visualization of the scenarios. Results: Sample size required for highly correlated longitudinal data using multi timepoint sample size derivation method led to much smaller sample size requirement as compared to single timepoint sample size calculation method. Conclusions: This study will help researchers to make better decisions in choosing the right method for sample size determination which may reduce the time and cost of carrying out the experiment. Also, we must carefully assess which method to go with when the correlation is weak. More complex correlation structures are not studied in this article but can be studied in the same fashion.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1216/v2?src=rss">Are numerical scores important for grant assessment? A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the evaluation of research proposals, reviewers are often required to provide their opinions using various forms of quantitative and qualitative criteria. In 2020, the European Commission removed, for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training Networks (ITN) funding scheme, the numerical scores from the individual evaluations but retained them in the consensus report. This study aimed to assess whether there were any differences in reviewer comments’ linguistic characteristics after the numerical scoring was removed, compared to comments from 2019 when numerical scoring was still present. Methods: This was an observational study and the data were collected for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training Networks (ITN) evaluation reports from the calls of 2019 and 2020, for both individual and consensus comments and numerical scores about the quality of the research proposal on three evaluation criteria: Excellence, Impact and Implementation. All comments were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. Results: For both years, the comments for proposal’s strengths were written in a style that reflects objectivity, clout, and positive affect, while in weaknesses cold and objective style dominated, and that pattern remained stable across proposal status and research domains. Linguistic variables explained a very small proportion of the variance of the differences between 2019 and 2020 (McFadden R2=0.03). Conclusions: Removing the numerical scores was not associated with the differences in linguistic characteristics of the reviewer comments. Future studies should adopt a qualitative approach to assess whether there are conceptual changes in the content of the comments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1217/v2?src=rss">Insomnia in teachers at the time of resumption of in-person instruction at schools amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected people's economies, lifestyles, and physical, emotional, and sleep health. This research aimed to estimate the prevalence of insomnia and symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression among teachers with the resumption of in-person instruction at schools following a hiatus after COVID-19 lockdowns in India. We also studied the association of teachers' insomnia with psychological symptoms and demographic variables. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between October –November 2021 after schools had reopened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data was collected using standard questionnaires online among schoolteachers. We explored the association of insomnia with teachers' symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, sex, school boards, and age groups. Results: Of 124 schoolteachers surveyed, the prevalence of insomnia was 37.9% (subthreshold in 25% and clinical in 12.9%). The prevalence of stress, depression, and anxiety was 20.2%, 30.6%, and 45.2%, respectively. There was a significant association (p<0.001) of insomnia with symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression in univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, we found that those feeling stressed had a 6.4 times higher risk of insomnia (95% CI: 1.5-28.3, p - 0.01). There was no association of insomnia with age, sex, school educational boards, and type of institution. Conclusions: Over one-third (37.9%) of teachers reported having trouble sleeping when they returned to the school's typical face-to-face instruction modalities through COVID-19 times, and insomnia was more prevalent in those with stress.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1009/v1?src=rss">Perceptions and attitudes of medical students and doctors on Euthanasia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The concept of euthanasia has recently come into the spotlight, and cases such as those of Aruna Shanbaug have heavily influenced people’s opinions on the topic. Whether euthanasia is performed with the intention of ending suffering that otherwise cannot be helped should truly be supported. The thoughts on this topic- especially of those who work closely with patients who suffer from terminal illnesses- healthcare providers must be analyzed. Their perception and views on legalizing the procedure and their hesitancy or lack thereof to perform such a procedure would give the rest of the world a clearer picture- a better standpoint to understand what to do. This study attempted to quantify and analyze the views of doctors and medical students regarding euthanasia. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 212 doctors and medical students at a private medical college in South India was conducted to determine their attitudes toward euthanasia. Results Most participants (66%) supported the practice of euthanasia. The majority of participants also believed that euthanasia should only be performed with the explicit consent of the patient (71.7%). It was also observed that those who had heard about euthanasia via hearsay mostly agreed that it must only be performed with the explicit consent of the patient. Moreover, the study showed that those who had heard about it from hearsay and news mostly stood for it. Conclusion It has been noted that news and media all around us heavily influence people’s opinions. It is concluded that these opinions have changed from the past, and will likely do so depending on the environment and media around the topic.

                A major aim of neuroscience is to identify and model the functional properties of neural cells whose dysfunction underlie neuropsychiatric illness. In this article, we propose that human-derived monoclonal autoantibodies (HD-mAbs) are well positioned to selectively target and manipulate neural subpopulations as defined by their protein expression; that is, cellular proteotypes. Recent technical advances allow for efficient cloning of autoantibodies from neuropsychiatric patients. These HD-mAbs can be introduced into animal models to gain biological and pathobiological insights about neural proteotypes of interest. Protein engineering can be used to modify, enhance, silence, or confer new functional properties to native HD-mAbs, thereby enhancing their versatility. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations confronting HD-mAbs as experimental research tools for neuroscience.

                To study how the representation of space and time interact in the episodic memory system, Chen et al. showed that hippocampal CA1 neurons simultaneously represented space and elapsed time, and the neuronal firing reflected a trade-off or competition between space and time by shifting their fields in space or time.

                In multi-month recordings of the mouse hippocampus, McGregor et al. ask which homeostatic set-points in neuronal activity are undermined by tauopathy. Criticality, an emergent endpoint, is severely disrupted by the disease, while the activity of underlying individual neurons appears unaffected. These findings suggest a dynamical locus by which tauopathy disrupts neuronal function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94181">UPRER–immunity axis acts as physiological food evaluation system that promotes aversion behavior in sensing low-quality food</a></h4>

              
                To survive in challenging environments, animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. However, the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system, which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior, are still not fully understood. Here, we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed <i>E. coli</i> (HK-<i>E. coli),</i> a low-sugar food, triggers cellular UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune response. This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPR<sup>ER</sup> -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93789">Analysis of fast calcium dynamics of honey bee olfactory coding</a></h4>

              
                Odour processing exhibits multiple parallels between vertebrate and invertebrate olfactory systems. Insects, in particular, have emerged as relevant models for olfactory studies because of the tractability of their olfactory circuits. Here, we used fast calcium imaging to track the activity of projection neurons in the honey bee antennal lobe (AL) during olfactory stimulation at high temporal resolution. We observed a heterogeneity of response profiles and an abundance of inhibitory activities, resulting in various response latencies and stimulus-specific post-odour neural signatures. Recorded calcium signals were fed to a mushroom body (MB) model constructed implementing the fundamental features of connectivity between olfactory projection neurons, Kenyon cells (KC), and MB output neurons (MBON). The model accounts for the increase of odorant discrimination in the MB compared to the AL and reveals the recruitment of two distinct KC populations that represent odorants and their aftersmell as two separate but temporally coherent neural objects. Finally, we showed that the learning-induced modulation of KC-to-MBON synapses can explain both the variations in associative learning scores across different conditioning protocols used in bees and the bees' response latency. Thus, it provides a simple explanation of how the time contingency between the stimulus and the reward can be encoded without the need for time tracking. This study broadens our understanding of olfactory coding and learning in honey bees. It demonstrates that a model based on simple MB connectivity rules and fed with real physiological data can explain fundamental aspects of odour processing and associative learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97096">Identification of novel myelodysplastic syndromes prognostic subgroups by integration of inflammation, cell-type composition, and immune signatures in the bone marrow</a></h4>

              
                Mutational profiles of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have established that a relatively small number of genetic aberrations, including SF3B1 and SRSF2 spliceosome mutations, lead to specific phenotypes and prognostic subgrouping. We performed a multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) on two published MDS cohorts of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) and CD34 + cells with three data modalities (clinical, genotype, and transcriptomics). Seven different views, including immune profile, inflammation/aging, retrotransposon (RTE) expression, and cell-type composition, were derived from these modalities to identify the latent factors with significant impact on MDS prognosis. SF3B1 was the only mutation among 13 mutations in the BMMNC cohort, indicating a significant association with high inflammation. This trend was also observed to a lesser extent in the CD34 + cohort. Interestingly, the MOFA factor representing the inflammation shows a good prognosis for MDS patients with high inflammation. In contrast, SRSF2 mutant cases show a granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) pattern and high levels of senescence, immunosenescence, and malignant myeloid cells, consistent with their poor prognosis. Furthermore, MOFA identified RTE expression as a risk factor for MDS. This work elucidates the efficacy of our integrative approach to assess the MDS risk that goes beyond all the scoring systems described thus far for MDS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97267">Circular RNA HMGCS1 sponges MIR4521 to aggravate type 2 diabetes-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Noncoding RNA plays a pivotal role as novel regulators of endothelial cell function. Type 2 diabetes, acknowledged as a primary contributor to cardiovascular diseases, plays a vital role in vascular endothelial cell dysfunction due to induced abnormalities of glucolipid metabolism and oxidative stress. In this study, aberrant expression levels of <i>circHMGCS1</i> and <i>MIR4521</i> were observed in diabetes-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell dysfunction. Persistent inhibition of <i>MIR4521</i> accelerated development and exacerbated vascular endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, <i>circHMGCS1</i> upregulated arginase 1 by sponging <i>MIR4521</i>, leading to decrease in vascular nitric oxide secretion and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, and an increase in the expression of adhesion molecules and generation of cellular reactive oxygen species, reduced vasodilation and accelerated the impairment of vascular endothelial function. Collectively, these findings illuminate the physiological role and interacting mechanisms of <i>circHMGCS1</i> and <i>MIR4521</i> in diabetes-induced cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that modulating the expression of <i>circHMGCS1</i> and <i>MIR4521</i> could serve as a potential strategy to prevent diabetes-associated cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, our findings provide a novel technical avenue for unraveling ncRNAs regulatory roles of ncRNAs in diabetes and its associated complications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89996">Asymmetric distribution of color-opponent response types across mouse visual cortex supports superior color vision in the sky</a></h4>

              
                Color is an important visual feature that informs behavior, and the retinal basis for color vision has been studied across various vertebrate species. While many studies have investigated how color information is processed in visual brain areas of primate species, we have limited understanding of how it is organized beyond the retina in other species, including most dichromatic mammals. In this study, we systematically characterized how color is represented in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice. Using large-scale neuronal recordings and a luminance and color noise stimulus, we found that more than a third of neurons in mouse V1 are color-opponent in their receptive field center, while the receptive field surround predominantly captures luminance contrast. Furthermore, we found that color-opponency is especially pronounced in posterior V1 that encodes the sky, matching the statistics of natural scenes experienced by mice. Using unsupervised clustering, we demonstrate that the asymmetry in color representations across cortex can be explained by an uneven distribution of green-On/UV-Off color-opponent response types that are represented in the upper visual field. Finally, a simple model with natural scene-inspired parametric stimuli shows that green-On/UV-Off color-opponent response types may enhance the detection of ‘predatory’-like dark UV-objects in noisy daylight scenes. The results from this study highlight the relevance of color processing in the mouse visual system and contribute to our understanding of how color information is organized in the visual hierarchy across species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97150">A robust brain network for sustained attention from adolescence to adulthood that predicts later substance use</a></h4>

              
                Substance use, including cigarettes and cannabis, is associated with poorer sustained attention in late adolescence and early adulthood. Previous studies were predominantly cross-sectional or under-powered and could not indicate if impairment in sustained attention was a predictor of substance use or a marker of the inclination to engage in such behavior. This study explored the relationship between sustained attention and substance use across a longitudinal span from ages 14 to 23 in over 1000 participants. Behaviors and brain connectivity associated with diminished sustained attention at age 14 predicted subsequent increases in cannabis and cigarette smoking, establishing sustained attention as a robust biomarker for vulnerability to substance use. Individual differences in network strength relevant to sustained attention were preserved across developmental stages and sustained attention networks generalized to participants in an external dataset. In summary, brain networks of sustained attention are robust, consistent, and able to predict aspects of later substance use.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84698">Mir221/222 drive synovial hyperplasia and arthritis by targeting cell cycle inhibitors and chromatin remodeling components</a></h4>

              
                miRNAs constitute fine-tuners of gene expression and are implicated in a variety of diseases spanning from inflammation to cancer. miRNA expression is deregulated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, their specific role in key arthritogenic cells such as the synovial fibroblast (SF) remains elusive. Previous studies have shown that <i>Mir221/222</i> expression is upregulated in RA SFs. Here, we demonstrate that TNF and IL-1β but not IFN-γ activated <i>Mir221</i>/222 gene expression in murine SFs. SF-specific overexpression of <i>Mir221/222</i> in huTNFtg mice led to further expansion of SFs and disease exacerbation, while its total ablation led to reduced SF expansion and attenuated disease. <i>Mir221/222</i> overexpression altered the SF transcriptional profile igniting pathways involved in cell cycle and ECM (extracellular matrix) regulation. Validation of targets of <i>Mir221/222</i> revealed cell cycle inhibitors <i>Cdkn1b</i> and <i>Cdkn1c</i>, as well as the epigenetic regulator <i>Smarca1</i>. Single-cell ATAC-seq data analysis revealed increased <i>Mir221</i>/222 gene activity in pathogenic SF subclusters and transcriptional regulation by <i>Rela</i>, <i>Relb</i>, <i>Junb</i>, <i>Bach1</i>, and <i>Nfe2l2</i>. Our results establish an SF-specific pathogenic role of <i>Mir221/222</i> in arthritis and suggest that its therapeutic targeting in specific subpopulations could lead to novel fibroblast-targeted therapies.

">Deciphering the nanoscale architecture of presynaptic actin using a micropatterned presynapse-on-glass model</a></h4>

              
                Chemical synapses are fundamental units for the transmission of information throughout the nervous system. The cytoskeleton allows to build, maintain and transform both pre- and postsynaptic contacts, yet its organization and the role of its unique synaptic nanostructures are still poorly understood. Here we present a presynapse-on-glass model where presynaptic specializations are robustly induced along the axons of cultured neurons by micropatterned dots of neuroligin, allowing the controlled orientation and easy optical visualization of functional induced presynapses. We demonstrate the relevance and usefulness of this presynapse-on-glass model for the study of presynaptic actin architecture, showing that a majority of induced presynapses are enriched in actin, with this enrichment being correlated to higher synaptic cycling activity. We confirm our previous results on bead-induced presynapses by identifying the same distinct actin nanostructures within presynapses: corrals, rails and mesh. Furthermore, we leverage the controlled orientation of the presynapse-on-glass model, visualizing the arrangement of these actin structures relative to the active zone nanoclusters using multicolor 3D Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM), and relative to the sub-diffractive localization exocytic events using a correlative live-cell and SMLM approach.

">A hypothalamus-brainstem circuit governs the prioritization of safety over essential needs</a></h4>

              
                Animals continously adapt their behavior to balance survival and fulfilling essential needs. This balancing act involves prioritization of safety over the pursuit of other needs. However, the specific deep brain circuits that regulate safety-seeking behaviors in conjuction with motor circuits remain poorly understood. Here we identify a class of glutamatergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) that target the midbrain locomotor-promoting pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). Upon activation, this LHA-PPN pathway orchestrates context-dependent locomotion, prioritizing safety-directed movement over other essential needs such as foraging or mating. Remarkably, the neuronal activity of these circuits correlates directly with safety-seeking behavior. These circuits may respond to both intrinsic and external cues, playing a pivotal role in ensuring survival. Our findings uncover a circuit motif within the lateral hypothalamus that when recruited, prioritizes critical needs through the recruitment of an appropriate motor action.

">Dissociable dynamic effects of expectation during statistical learning.</a></h4>

              
                The brain is thought to generate internal predictions, based on previous statistical regularities in the environment, to optimise behaviour. Predictive processing has been repeatedly demonstrated and seemingly explains expectation suppression (ES), or the attenuation of neural activity in response to expected stimuli. However, the mechanisms behind ES are unclear and various models of the mechanisms supporting ES have been suggested with conflicting evidence. Sharpening models propose that expectations suppress neurons that are not tuned to the expected stimulus, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for expected stimuli. In contrast, dampening models posit that expectations suppress neurons that are tuned to the expected stimuli, increasing the relative response amplitude for unexpected stimuli. Previous studies have used decoding analyses to examine these effects, with increases in decoding accuracy interpreted in terms of sharpening and decreases related to dampening. The opposing process theory (OPT) has suggested that both processes may occur at different time points, namely that initial sharpening is followed by later dampening of the neural representations of the expected stimulus as learning progresses. In this study we aim to test this theory and shed light on the dynamics of expectation effects, both at single trial level and over time. Thirty-one participants completed a statistical learning task consisting of paired scene categories whereby a 'leading' image from one category is quickly followed by a 'trailing' image from a different category. Multivariate EEG analyses focussed on decoding stimulus information related to the trailing image category. Within-trial, decoding analyses showed that stimulus expectation increased decoding accuracy at early latencies and decreased decoding accuracy at later latencies, in line with OPT. However, across trials, stimulus expectation decreased decoding accuracy in initial trials and increased decoding accuracy in later trials. We theorise that these dissociable dynamics of expectation effects within and across trials can be explained in the context of hierarchical learning mechanisms. Our single trial results provide evidence for the OPT, while our results over time suggest that sharpening and dampening effects emerge at different stages of learning.

">Hippocampal neuronal activity is aligned with action plans</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the hippocampus are correlated with different variables, including space, time, sensory cues, rewards, and actions, where the extent of tuning depends on ongoing task demands. However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or if a more generic computation can account for these observations. To disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice where space, auditory tones, rewards, and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans toward deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.

">Using TMS-EEG to study the intricate interplay between GABAergic inhibition and glutamatergic excitation during reactive and proactive motor inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Background: Combining Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) enables assess TMS-evoked potentials (TEP) and estimate {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamatergic neurotransmission across the entire motor inhibition network. The N45 and N100 TEP peaks are associated with GABAa and GABAb signaling, respectively, whereas the N15, P30 and P60 TEPs reflect glutamatergic neurotransmission. This study applied TMS-EEG to investigate modulation of TEP components during reactive and proactive inhibition and whether individual differences in GABA and glutamate signaling predict inhibitory performance. Methods: Twenty-four healthy participants completed two TMS-EEG sessions, targeting either the left primary motor cortex (M1) or the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) at rest and during a stop-signal task. We compared TEP peak amplitudes across TMS (active/sham) and Trial Type (stop/go trials) and assessed their relationship with task performance. Results: Participants with a higher N45 amplitude at rest over M1, reflecting increased GABAa signaling, demonstrated a faster stop-signal reaction time. TMS during motor inhibition revealed higher N15 amplitudes over preSMA, reflecting increased glutamatergic neurotransmission, for successful stops versus go trials. Similarly, N15 was higher for uncertain than certain go trials suggesting that an early excitatory signal from preSMA is crucial for both reactive and proactive motor inhibition. Conclusion: Higher GABAa inhibitory signaling in M1 at rest is linked to faster reactive inhibition. The preSMA likely plays a key role in both reactive and proactive motor inhibition. Here we provide novel direct empirical insights into the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, highlighting a functional relevance of early glutamatergic excitatory signals for successful motor inhibition.

">Nonlinear dendritic integration supports Up-Down states in single neurons</a></h4>

              
                Changes in the activity profile of cortical neurons are due to phenomena at the scale of local and long-range networks. Accordingly, the states of cortical neurons and their, often abrupt, transitions - a phenomenon known as Up/Down states - are attributed to variations in the afferent neurons' activity. However, cellular physiology and morphology may also play a role. This study examines the impact of dendritic nonlinearities, in the form of voltage-gated NMDA receptors, on the response of cortical neurons to balanced excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs. Using a neuron model with two segregated dendritic compartments, we compare cells with and without dendritic nonlinearities. Our analysis shows that NMDA receptors boost somatic firing in the balanced condition and increase the correlation of membrane potentials across the three compartments of the neuron model. Then we introduce controlled fluctuations in excitatory inputs and quantify the ensuing bimodality of the somatic membrane potential. We show that dendritic nonlinearities are crucial for detecting these fluctuations and initiating Up-Down states whose shape and statistics closely resemble electrophysiological data. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying cortical bistability and highlight the complex interplay between dendritic integration and network dynamics in shaping neuronal behavior.

">Computer vision guided rapid and precise automated cranial microsurgeries in rodents</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscientists employ various experimental procedures to interface with the brain to study and perturb the neural activity during behavior. A common procedure that allows such physical interfacing is cranial microsurgery, wherein small to large craniotomies are performed in the overlying skull for insertion of neural interfaces or implantation of optically clear windows for long-term cranial observation. Performing craniotomies is, however, a skilled task that requires significant time and practice and further needs to be carried out precisely to ensure that the procedure does not cause damage to the underlying brain and dura. Here, we present a computer vision-guided craniotomy robot (CV-Craniobot) that utilizes machine learning to accurately estimate the dorsal skull anatomy from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Instantaneous information of the skull morphology is used by a robotic mill to rapidly and precisely remove the skull from a desired craniotomy location. We show that the CV-Craniobot can perform small (2 - 4 mm diameter) craniotomies with near 100% success rates within 2 minutes and large craniotomies encompassing most of the dorsal cortex in less than 5 minutes. Thus, the CV-Craniobot enables rapid and precise craniotomies, significantly reducing surgery time as compared to human practitioners and eliminating the need for long training.

">Oxytocin salvages context-specific hyperaltruistic preference through moral framing</a></h4>

              
                An intriguing advancement in recent moral decision-making research suggests that people are more willing to sacrifice monetary gains to spare others from suffering than to spare themselves, yielding a hyperaltruistic tendency. Other studies, however, indicate an opposite egoistic bias in that subjects are less willing to harm themselves for the benefits of others than for their own benefits. These results highlight the delicate inner workings of moral decision and call for a mechanistic account of hyperaltruistic preference. We investigated the boundary conditions of hyperaltruism by presenting subjects with trade-off choices combing monetary gains and painful electric shocks, or, choices combing monetary losses and shocks. We first showed in study 1 that switching the decision context from gains to losses effectively eliminated the hyperaltruistic preference and the decision context effect was associated with the altered relationship between subjects' instrumental harm (IH) trait attitudes and their relative pain sensitivities. In the pre-registered study 2, we tested whether oxytocin, a neuropeptide linked to parochial altruism, might salvage the context-dependent hyperaltruistic preference. We found that oxytocin increased subjects' reported levels of framing the task as harming (vs. helping) others, which mediated the correlation between IH and relative pain sensitivities. Thus, the loss decision context and oxytocin nullified and restored the mediation effect of subjective harm framing, respectively. Our results help to elucidate the psychological processes underpinning the contextual specificity of hyperaltruism and carry implications in promoting prosocial interactions in our society.

">Peripheral Inflammation is accompanied by Cerebral Hypoperfusion in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Chronic pain is a disabling condition that is accompanied by neuropsychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline. While the peripheral alterations are well-studied, we lack an understanding of how these peripheral changes can result in long-lasting brain alterations and the ensuing behavioral phenotypes. This study aims to quantify changes in cerebral blood perfusion using laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) in the murine Complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) model of unilateral peripheral inflammation. Methods: Twenty female and 24 male adult C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to control (0.05ml saline) or 1 of 3 experimental groups receiving CFA (0.01ml, 0.05ml, and 0.1ml) on the right hindpaw. Three days after the intraplantar injections, animals were assessed for signs of pain (von Frey), working memory (y-maze), and anxiety (zero maze and open field), and subjected to craniotomy and in vivo LSCI of the parietal-temporal lobes. Results: Unilateral administration of CFA resulted in signs of local inflammation, decreased mechanical thresholds on the affected hindpaw, signs of anxiety in the zero maze, as well as cerebral hypoperfusion in dose-dependent manner. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study using laser speckle contrast imaging to examine the effects of CFA-induced peripheral inflammation on cerebral blood perfusion. It serves as a first step in delineating the path by which insult to peripheral tissues can cause long-lasting brain plasticity via vascular mechanisms.

                Sound symbolism, the idea that the sound of a word alone can convey its meaning, is often studied using auditory pseudowords. For example, people reliably assign the auditory pseudowords /bouba/ and /kiki/ to rounded and pointed shapes, respectively. Previously we showed that representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) of the shape ratings of auditory pseudowords correlated significantly with RDMs of acoustic parameters reflecting spectro-temporal variations; the ratings also correlated significantly with voice quality features. Here, participants rated auditory pseudowords on scales representing categorical opposites across seven meaning domains, including shape. Examination of the relationships of the perceptual ratings to spectro-temporal and vocal parameters of the pseudowords essentially replicated our previous findings for shape while varying patterns emerged for the other domains. Thus, the spectro-temporal and vocal properties of spoken pseudowords contribute differentially to sound-symbolic mapping depending on the meaning domain.

">A flexible high-precision photoacoustic retinal prosthesis</a></h4>

              
                Retinal degenerative diseases of photoreceptors are a leading cause of blindness with no effective treatment. Retinal prostheses seek to restore sight by stimulating remaining retinal cells. We here present a photoacoustic retinal stimulation technology. We designed a polydimethylsiloxane and carbon-based flexible film that converts near-infrared laser pulses into a localized acoustic field, aiming at high-precision acoustic activation of mechanosensitive retinal cells. This photoacoustic stimulation of wild-type and degenerated ex vivo retinae resulted in robust and localized retinal ganglion cell activation with sub-100-m resolution in both wild-type and degenerated ex vivo retinae. Our millimeter-size photoacoustic film generated neural activation in vivo along the visual pathway to the superior colliculus, as measured by functional ultrasound imaging when the film was implanted in the rat subretinal space and stimulated by pulsed laser. Biosafety of the film was indicated by absence of short-term adverse effect under optical coherence tomography retinal imaging, while local thermal increase was measured below 1 {degrees}C. These findings demonstrate the potential of our photoacoustic stimulation for visual restoration in blind patients with a high spatial precision and a large field of view.

                Serial Two photon tomography (STPT) imaging is a technique to image a mass of tissue in its three-dimensional shape by combining two-photon imaging with automatic stage control and microtome slicing. We successfully implemented this technique for tracing the axonal projections in the marmoset brain. Here we describe the detailed experimental procedures that realized reliable volumetric imaging of the whole marmoset brain. We also introduce auxiliary histological techniques including visualization of myelin structure by simple light reflection, and immunological detection of non-fluorescent anterograde and retrograde tracers, which further enhance the utility of STPT data.

">Policy shaping based on the learned preferences of others accounts for risky decision-making under social observation</a></h4>

              
                Observing others' choices influences individuals' decisions, often leading them to follow others. However, it is repeatedly reported that being observed by others tends to make people act more riskily. We hypothesized that this discrepancy arises from individuals' belief that others prefer riskier choices than they do. To examine this hypothesis, we used a gambling task where on some trials, individuals were informed that their choices would be observed by a risk-averse or seeking partner. Most important, individuals were given chances to learn each partner's preference beforehand. As expected, individuals initially believed that partners would make relatively riskier choices than they would. Against two alternative explanations, we found that individuals simulated partners' choices and weighed these simulated choices in making their own choices. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that decision probabilities adjusted with the simulated partners' choices were represented in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Moreover, individual differences in the functional connectivity between the TPJ and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were explained by the interaction between model-estimated social reliance and sensitivity to social cues in the mPFC. These findings provide a neuromechanistic account of how being observed by others affects individuals' decision-making, highlighting the roles of the mPFC and TPJ in simulating social contexts based on individuals' beliefs.

">Immediate Modulation of the Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent Signals by Dual-Site Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Propagates Across the Whole Brain</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is assumed to target specific brain regions and modulate their activity. Recent discussions of tACS propose that, entraining the phase of brain activity to the stimulation current, stimulation effects extend globally across the whole brain based on phase differences. However, immediate online spatiotemporal propagation of resting-state blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals within the brain due to multi-region stimulation remains unclear. The objectives of the present study were three-fold: 1) to elucidate the immediate online effect of tACS on BOLD signal, 2) to examine the extent of the influence on the brain when applying tACS, and 3) to explore whether variations in the phase difference between two brain regions result in differential effects on the stimulated areas and the whole brain. Through two experiments involving high-definition tACS with simultaneous measurements using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we revealed that the immediate online stimulation effects not only altered BOLD signals in the stimulated regions but also propagated across the whole brain in specific spatiotemporal patterns (functional networks). Stimulation effects were observed specifically in regions rich in neural fibres, including the grey and white matter, with no effect in regions containing cerebrospinal fluid. The timing of the signal value peaks depended on the stimulated region and functional networks, with a notable trend observed. Thus, tACS with a specific phase difference in two anatomically connected brain regions can immediately modulate online neural dynamics at both local and global scales.

">Circuit function is more robust to changes in synaptic than intrinsic conductances</a></h4>

              
                Circuit function results from both intrinsic conductances of network neurons and the synaptic conductances that connect them. In models of neural circuits, different combinations of maximal conductances can give rise to similar activity. We compared the robustness of a neural circuit to changes in their intrinsic versus synaptic conductances. To address this, we performed a sensitivity analysis on a population of conductance-based models of the pyloric network from the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG). The model network consists of three neurons with nine currents: a sodium current (Na), three potassium currents (Kd, KCa, A-type), two calcium currents (CaS and CaT), a hyperpolarization-activated current (H), a non-voltage-gated leak current (leak), and a neuromodulatory current (MI). The model cells are connected by seven synapses of two types, glutamatergic and cholinergic. We produced one hundred models of the pyloric network that displayed similar activities with values of maximal conductances distributed over wide ranges. We evaluated the robustness of each model to changes in their maximal conductances. We found that individual models have different sensitivities to changes in their maximal conductances, both in their intrinsic and synaptic conductances. As expected the models become less robust as the extent of the changes increase. Despite quantitative differences in their robustness, we found that in all cases, the model networks are more sensitive to the perturbation of their intrinsic conductances than their synaptic conductances.

">Brain-Body Interactions Influence the Transition from Mind Wandering to Awareness of Ongoing Thought</a></h4>

              
                Our thoughts are inherently dynamic and often wander far from our current situation (mind wandering, MW). Although previous research revealed that the ascending arousal system shapes neural dynamics to mediate awareness of ongoing thoughts, the physiological states and afferent signals altered by this activation and its effects on awareness are unknown. In this study, we examined electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and respiration data before participants were aware of MW during a task in which they focused on external or internal stimuli. We showed that the transition from MW to awareness was characterized by decreased alpha and beta activity and increased heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes. In addition, the participants were more likely to be in the exhalation phase becoming aware, and in the inhalation phase at the time of MW reports. Moreover, changes in cardiac activity and HEP accompanied this pattern when participants were asked to focus on respiration. Based on these findings, we suggest that the release from the increased cognitive load with sustained MW and catching these changes as physiological alterations supporting awareness of MW; moreover, the modulation of the respiratory cycle by focusing on breathing enhances these changes.

                Controlled placement of single cells, spheroids and organoids is important for in vitro research, especially for bottom-up biology and for lab-on-a-chip and organ-on-a-chip applications. This study utilised FluidFM technology in order to automatically pick and place neuronal spheroids and single cells. Both single cells and spheroids of interest could be selected using light microscopy or fluorescent staining. A process flow was developed to automatically pick and pattern these neurons on flat surfaces, as well as to deposit them into polydimethylsiloxane microstructures on microelectrode arrays. It was shown that highly accurate and reproducible neuronal circuits can be built using the FluidFM automated workflow.

">Sensory context of initiation-cue modulates action goal-relevant neural representations</a></h4>

              
                The ability to produce goal-directed movement relies on the integration of diverse sources of sensory information specific to the task goal. Neural representations of goal-relevant features, such as target location and gaze direction, have been well studied in sensorimotor areas. It remains less clear whether goal-relevant motor representations are influenced by sensory changes to initiation-relevant information, such as a go-cue that provides no information about target location. We used Bayesian pattern component modelling of fMRI data during a delayed reach task with either visual or audiovisual go-cues to explore whether neural representations of goal-related features in sensorimotor areas are modulated by changes to initiation-relevant sensory information. We found that representations of target direction and gaze direction in the primary sensory areas, motor areas, and posterior parietal cortex, were sensitive to whether a reach was cued with a visual or audiovisual go-cue. These findings indicate that the central nervous system flexibly delegates the tasks of 'where' to move and 'when' to move based on available sensory context, even if initiation-relevant stimuli provide no additional information about target location.

">Porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles alter neuronal architecture and Tau phosphorylation in the embryonic mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) is an oral bacterial pathogen that has been associated with systemic inflammation and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight and pre-term birth. Pg drives these sequalae through virulence factors decorating the outer membrane that are present on non-replicative outer membrane vesicles (OMV) that are suspected to be transmitted systemically. Given that Pg abundance can increase during pregnancy, it is not well known whether Pg-OMV can have deleterious effects on the brain of the developing fetus. We tested this possibility by treating pregnant C57/Bl6 mice with PBS (control) and OMV from ATCC 33277 by tail vein injection every other day from gestational age 3 to 17. At gestational age 18.5, we measured dam and pup weights and collected pup brains to quantify changes in inflammation, cortical neuron density, and Tau phosphorylated at Thr231. Dam and pup weights were not altered by Pg-OMV exposure, but pup brain weight was significantly decreased in the Pg-OMV treatment group. We found a significant increase of Iba-1, indicative of microglia activation, although the overall levels of IL-1{beta}, IL-6, TNF, IL-4, IL-10, and TGF{beta} mRNA transcripts were not different between the treatment groups. Differences in IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF concentrations by ELISA showed IL-6 was significantly lower in Pg-OMV brains. Cortical neuron density was modified by treatment with Pg-OMV as immunofluorescence showed significant decreases in Cux1 and SatB2. Overall Thr231 was increased in pups exposed to Pg-OMV with the appearance of a secondary band of 60 kD. Together these results demonstrate that Pg-OMV can significantly modify the embryonic brain and suggests that Pg may impact offspring development via multiple mechanisms.

">Decoupling Coldness and Softness in Tactile Wetness Perception Using Tunable Hydrogels</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the perception of tactile wetness, a complex sensation experienced by humans. Previous research has primarily focused on either thermal or mechanical cues separately, or has used textiles as stimuli whose parameters are difficult to control. Here, we employed polyacrylamide hydrogels with varying stiffness levels soaked in liquids of distinct thermal conductivities. By psychophysically evaluating participants' perception of wetness, we showed that the wetness judgments for the samples exhibit a transitive relationship based on the mechanical and thermal cues from an intrinsically tunable organic material. We developed a prediction model of human wetness judgment with an accuracy of 90% and found that the best metrics for the most accurate model were those that were the most human-adjacent: change in temperature at the skin-sample interface (thermal) and compressive force from 2 mm indentation of the sample (mechanical). Given these parameters, we developed a perceptual space capable of recreating 7 distinct levels of wetness perception with the physical parameters used in this study. The results provide insights into the relative contributions of mechanical and thermal stimulus properties in wetness perception. Most notably, this work highlights that the physical characteristics of the skin-stimulus interface can provide ample information for creating a wetness perceptual space, as opposed to the chemical composition of the hydrogels.

">Single-shot detection of microscale tactile features</a></h4>

              
                Tactile detection of very small features requires relative motion between the fingertip and a surface. The specific movement strategies that people use may be critical to maximize detection ability but little is known about the movement strategies people employ to support such detection. Here, human participants actively scanned a fingertip across a pair of silica wafers to detect which of the two contained a microscale feature (2, 6, and 10 m height and 525 m diameter). We constrained fingertip movement to ensure that participants would always contact the feature and would only contact the feature once. These procedures encouraged participants to use strategies that optimized detection rather than search and thus allowed us to more directly link movement strategies to detection. We also investigated the effects of fingertip movement direction and the finger used on detection. We found that participants were able to consistently detect microscale features as small as 2 m on the basis of a single contact event. The contact forces that participants used were substantially higher than those observed in previous studies focused on tactile search or geometric feature extraction. Scanning speeds were slower than those found during tactile search but faster than those reported during geometric feature extraction. Taken in conjunction with the associations between detection and finger used as well as scan direction, our results suggest that control and consistency of fingertip movement may be a primary consideration for movement strategies that optimize tactile detection.

">Properties of Alzheimers disease brain-derived tau aggregates define tau processing by human astrocytes.</a></h4>

              
                The templated misfolding of tau proteins accounts for tau pathology spread in Alzheimers disease (AD). Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific residues, are closely linked with tau seeding ability and clinical disease progression. Increasing evidence supports a contributing role for astrocytes in tau spread. This study demonstrates that tau aggregates from postmortem AD brain are internalized and processed by human astrocytes. Differences in the efficiency of tau internalization, clearance and/or seeding were noted, which may reflect molecular properties of tau. Notably, we observed a direct relationship between alterations in tau handling by astrocytes and astrocyte responses, which were evident in transcriptomic data. Dysregulated genes include several previously identified as upregulated in reactive astrocytes in AD brain, as well as being implicated in pathological tau clearance by autophagy and other pathways. The study provides new insights into the complex interplay between tau molecular diversity and astrocyte responses in AD.

">The Aquaporin-4 expression and localization in the olfactory epithelium modulate the odorant-evoked responses and olfactory driven behavior</a></h4>

              
                Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a water-selective channel expressed in glial cells throughout the central nervous system. It serves as the main water channel in the neuropil, and is involved in various physiological functions, ranging from regulating water homeostasis by adjusting cell volume to modulating neuronal activity. Different isoforms of AQP4 are expressed in glial-like cells known as sustentacular cells (SUSs) of the olfactory epithelium (OE). Interestingly, mice lacking all AQP4 isoforms exhibit impaired olfactory abilities. Hence, we aim to uncover the physiological role of two AQP4 isoforms, the perivascular AQP4ex isoform and the Orthogonal Array of Particle (OAP)-forming isoform (AQP4M23) in the OE. Primarily, we investigated the impact of AQP4 isoforms on OE protein expression, finding reduced levels of mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in mice lacking AQP4ex (AQP4ex-KO) or OAPs (OAP-null). Moreover, the reduced number of OSNs, SUSs, and globose basal cells (GBCs) suggests that AQP4 isoforms are involved in maintaining an optimal microenvironment in the OE, preserving the overall cell density. Then, we explored the role of AQP4 in modulating odorant-evoked responses through electro-olfactogram recordings, finding reduced odorant responses in mice lacking AQP4 isoforms. Olfactory ability assessments revealed deficits in odor-guided food-seeking test in AQP4ex-KO and OAP-null mice. Furthermore, AQP4ex-KO mice showed a reduced ability to discriminate between different odorants, while OAP-null mice were unable to recognize them as distinct. Overall, our data highlight the role of AQP4 isoforms in modulating neuronal homeostasis, affecting odorant-evoked responses and cell density in the OE. These results shed light on SUSs involvement in mediating these processes and establish a foundation for further understanding their role in controlling OE physiology.

">Satellite glial cells modulate proprioceptive neuron activity in dorsal root ganglia</a></h4>

              
                Proprioception, the sense of body and limb position, is mediated by proprioceptors and is crucial for important motor functions such as standing and walking. Proprioceptor cell bodies reside within the peripheral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and are tightly enveloped by satellite glial cells (SGCs). SCGs express a number of Gq protein-coupled receptors (Gq GPCRs), but their functional consequences on proprioceptor activity is unknown. Using a combination of chemogenetics, genetics, Ca2+ imaging, pharmacology, immunohistochemistry, and biochemistry, we provide evidence that SGC Gq GPCR signaling is sufficient to drive purinergic receptor-mediated Ca2+ responses in proprioceptor cell bodies. Our findings suggest a potential role for SGC Gq GPCR signaling in shaping proprioceptor information processing. Furthermore, this demonstration of SGC-induced proprioceptor activation has profound implications with SGC Gq GPCR signaling and purinergic receptors representing potential therapeutic targets for alleviating some proprioceptor and sensorimotor impairments associated with spinal muscular atrophy or Friedreich's ataxia.

">Arc/Arg3.1 binds the nuclear polyadenylate-binding protein RRM and regulates neuronal activity-dependent formation of nuclear speckles</a></h4>

              
                Arc is a neuronal activity-induced protein interaction hub with critical roles in synaptic plasticity and memory. Arc localizes to synapses and the nucleus, but its nuclear functions are little known. We show that Arc accumulates in the interchromatin space of dentate granule cell nuclei and the nucleosol subcellular fraction following seizure activity and in vivo dentate gyrus LTP. Proteomic analysis of affinity-purified Arc complexes identified proteins with functions in post-transcriptional mRNA processing. During LTP, Arc undergoes enhanced complex formation with polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) and paraspeckle splicing factor (PSF) in the nucleosol. In vitro peptide binding arrays show selective binding of Arc to the PABPN1 polyA RNA recognition motif. In hippocampal neuronal cultures, Arc knockdown increases formation of PABPN1 nuclear speckles and blocks chemical-LTP associated increases in small PABPN1 foci. These results implicate Arc in basal and neuronal activity-dependent regulation of PABPN1 speckles involved in mRNA processing and polyadenylation.

">Prenatal exposure to valproic acid induces sex-specific alterations in cortical and hippocampal neuronal structure and function in rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: There are substantial differences in the characteristics of males and females with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet there is little knowledge surrounding the mechanistic underpinnings of these differences. The valproic acid (VPA) rodent model is the most widely used model for the study of idiopathic ASD, but almost all of the studies have used male rodents. Method: To fill this knowledge gap, we evaluated sex differences for neuronal activity, morphology, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) signaling in primary cortical (CTX) and hippocampal (HIP) neurons prepared from rats exposed to VPA in utero. In vivo, sex-specific VPA-induced alterations in the frontal CTX transcriptome at birth were also determined. Results: Overall, VPA induced more robust changes in neuronal function and structure in the CTX than in the HIP. Male- and female-derived primary CTX neurons from rats exposed to prenatal VPA had elevated activity and showed more disorganized firing. In the HIP, only the female VPA neurons showed elevated firing, while the male VPA neurons exhibited disorganized activity. Dendritic arborization of CTX neurons from VPA rats was less complex in both sexes, though this was more pronounced in the females. Conversely, both female and male HIP neurons from VPA rats showed elevated complexity distal to the soma. Female VPA CTX neurons also had an elevated number of dendritic spines. The relative activity of the  and {beta} isoforms of GSK-3 were suppressed in both female and male VPA CTX neurons, with no changes in the HIP neurons. On postnatal day 0, alterations in CTX genes associated with neuropeptides (e.g., penk, pdyn) and receptors (e.g., drd1, adora2a) were seen in both sexes, though they were downregulated in females and upregulated in males. Limitations: Primary neuron studies may not recapitulate findings performed in vivo or at later stages of development. Conclusion: Together these findings suggest that substantial sex differences in neuronal structure and function in the VPA model may have relevance to the reported sex differences in idiopathic ASD.

">Spike frequency adaptation in primate lateral prefrontal cortex neurons results from interplay between intrinsic properties and circuit dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Recordings of cortical neurons isolated from brain slices and dissociated from their networks, display intrinsic spike frequency adaptation (I-SFA) to a constant current input. Interestingly, extracellular recordings in behaving subjects also show extrinsic-SFA (E-SFA) in response to sustained visual stimulation. Because neurons are isolated from brain networks in slice recordings, it is challenging to infer how I-SFA contributes to E-SFA in interconnected brains during behavior. To investigate this, we recorded responses of macaque lateral prefrontal cortex neurons in vivo during a visually guided saccade task and in acute brain slices in vitro. Broad spiking (BS) putative pyramidal cells and narrow spiking (NS) putative inhibitory interneurons exhibited E-SFA in vivo. In acute brain slices, both cell types displayed I-SFA though their magnitudes differed. To investigate how in vitro I-SFA contributes to in vivo E-SFA, we developed a data-driven hybrid circuit model in which local NS neurons are driven by BS input. We observed that model NS cell responses show longer SFA than observed in vivo. Introducing inhibition of NS cells to the model circuit removed this discrepancy. Our results indicate that both I-SFA and inhibitory circuit dynamics contribute to E-SFA in LPFC neurons. They highlight the contribution of single neuron and network dependent computations to neural activity underlying behavior.

                The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and adjacent midline nuclei are important for cognition and mental illness, but their cellular composition is not well defined. Using single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics, we identified a conserved excitatory neuron gradient, with distinct spatial mapping of individual clusters. One end of the gradient was expanded in human MD compared to mice, which may be related to the expansion of granular prefrontal cortex in hominids. Moreover, neurons preferentially mapping onto the parvocellular division MD were associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Midbrain-derived inhibitory interneurons were enriched in human MD and implicated in genetic risk for major depressive disorder.

                Background. The caudate and putamen have previously been implicated in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, previous studies have not investigated the relationship between the caudate and putamen with executive function (EF). The current study investigated the clinical relevance of the caudate and putamen with respect to EF. Method. We studied 49 children (24 ADHD/25 typically developing children (TDC)). All participants in the ADHD group had to undergo a 48-hour stimulant medication washout period. Participants completed cognitive tasks related to working memory/inhibition and underwent a T1-weighted MRI sequence. All parents completed behaviour rating scales using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Second Edition (BRIEF-2). Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of covariance, Pearson correlations, and linear regressions. Results. Children with ADHD demonstrated a higher frequency of perseverative errors compared to TDC (p <.05), and their parents reported significantly more EF challenges (p <.001). No difference was observed in the working memory tasks. No significant volumetric differences were seen in the caudate or the putamen. A linear regression model suggested that the right caudate volume accounted for 10.3% of the variance in emotion regulation as reported by parents on the BRIEF-2 in the overall sample. Discussion. We observed significant EF challenges without volumetric differences. However, the right caudate was correlated to parent ratings of emotional regulation, highlighting the need to consider emotional regulation difficulties in ADHD.

">Developmental changes in hippocampal neurite colocalize with the expression of genes involved in modulating low-theta oscillations</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a critical brain structure that supports the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories, yet the intricate development of its microstructure in humans remains unknown. Understanding this microstructural maturation and how it relates with the maturation of hippocampal function may provide critical insight into the basic mechanisms underlying memory and their disruption in disease. To address this gap, we non-invasively estimated the density and branching complexity of neurite (dendrites, axons, glial processes) using diffusion-weighted MRI in 364 participants aged 8-21. We found that these microstructural measures differ between subfields and along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Notably, we observed spatially heterogeneous increases in the branching complexity of neurite until approximately 15 years of age, with prominence in CA1, stratum radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare, subiculum, and the anterior hippocampus. Furthermore, our imaging transcriptomics analysis shed light on the molecular underpinnings of these developmental dynamics. Regions exhibiting substantial age-related increases in neurite orientation dispersion also tend to express genes associated with the modulation of low-theta oscillations during memory encoding. These results suggest that the protracted maturation of hippocampal microstructure may be linked to the development of low-theta oscillation modulations during encoding.

The internal consistency and test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability of the MASA-IT were assessed, and its concurrent validity was examined through Pearson correlation coefficients with the Italian versions of two established gold standard scales for dysphagia assessment: the Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) and the De Pippo Test&amp;amp;mdash;Three Oz Water Swallow. The MASA-IT was administered to 78 participants. The items demonstrated excellent internal consistency, with Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha ranging between 0.86 and 0.89. The interclass correlation coefficient was 0.98 for inter-rater reliability and 0.99 for intra-rater reliability, indicating high reproducibility. Regarding concurrent validity, the MASA-IT showed a strong direct correlation with the DOSS scale (r = 0.949, p = 0.01) and an inverse correlation with the De Pippo Test (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.783, p = 0.01), confirming its good concurrent validity. The Italian version of the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA-IT) is a reliable and valid tool for assessing swallowing ability in post-stroke patients. Its strong psychometric properties make it well suited for clinical use in Italy.</p>

	<p>The role of mitochondria in neurodegenerative diseases is crucial, and recent developments have highlighted its significance in cell therapy. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s diseases. Understanding the impact of mitochondrial biology on these conditions can provide valuable insights for developing targeted cell therapies. This mini-review refocuses on mitochondria and emphasizes the potential of therapies leveraging mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, stem cell&amp;amp;ndash;derived secretions, and extracellular vesicles. Mesenchymal stem cell&amp;amp;ndash;mediated mitochondria transfer is highlighted for restoring mitochondrial health in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria. Additionally, attention is paid to gene-editing techniques such as mito-CRISPR, mitoTALENs, mito-ZNFs, and DdCBEs to ensure the safety and efficacy of stem cell treatments. Challenges and future directions are also discussed, including the possible tumorigenic effects of stem cells, off-target effects, disease targeting, immune rejection, and ethical issues.</p>

	<p>The Coanda effect is a fluid dynamics phenomenon in which a fluid jet adheres to a convex or flat surface. This effect occurs when a liquid or gas jet emerging from an orifice clings to an adjacent surface and entrains the surrounding fluid, creating a lower-pressure region along its path that maintains its attachment to the surface. The Coanda effect accounts for the behavior of blood flow in the fetal right atrium and the dispersion of eccentric mitral regurgitation jets along atrial walls. This series of interesting images depicting a large 4 &amp;amp;times; 3.75 cm saccular intracranial aneurysm suggests that the Coanda effect may play a role in the pathophysiology of intracranial aneurysms and could be an underlying factor in their formation, progression, or rupture.</p>

	<p>Spatial orientation and navigation are complex cognitive functions that integrate sensory information, attention, and memory, enabling individuals to locate themselves in their environment. These abilities decline with age, signaling cognitive impairment in neurological patients, and significantly limit the autonomy of the elderly. Current neuropsychological assessments fall short in accurately measuring everyday wayfinding abilities, particularly in borderline cases of cognitive decline. This paper reviews various neuropsychological assessments, including Benton&amp;amp;rsquo;s Judgment of Line Orientation Test, the Almeria Spatial Memory Recognition Test, the Spatial Span subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale, and the Spatial Orientation in Immersive Virtual Environment Maze Test, evaluating their effectiveness in delineating spatial orientation and navigation skills. The review identifies significant gaps in the validity and reliability of these tests, particularly in their shortened versions, and highlights the potential of virtual reality environments as promising tools for improving diagnostic precision. The findings underscore the need for further research to refine these tools, ensuring they accurately capture cognitive decline and improve the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Such advancements hold promise for enhancing the quality of care and autonomy for the elderly.</p>

                <p>Monocular deprivation (MD) causes an initial decrease in synaptic responses to the deprived eye in juvenile mouse primary visual cortex (V1) through Hebbian long-term depression (LTD). This is followed by a homeostatic increase, which has been attributed either to synaptic scaling or to a slide threshold for Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) rather than scaling. We therefore asked in mice of all sexes whether the homeostatic increase during MD requires GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor activity, which is required to slide the plasticity threshold but not for synaptic scaling. Selective GluN2B blockade from 2&ndash;6&nbsp;d after monocular lid suture prevented the homeostatic increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude in monocular V1 of acute slices and prevented the increase in visually evoked responses in binocular V1 in vivo<I>.</I> The decrease in mEPSC amplitude and visually evoked responses during the first 2&nbsp;d of MD also required GluN2B activity. Together, these results support the idea that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors first play a role in LTD immediately following eye closure and then promote homeostasis during prolonged MD by sliding the plasticity threshold in favor of LTP.</p>

                <p>Brain nuclei are traditionally defined by their anatomy, activity, and expression of specific markers. The hypothalamus contains discrete neuronal populations that coordinate fundamental behavioral functions, including sleep and wakefulness, in all vertebrates. Particularly, the diverse roles of hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt)-releasing neurons suggest functional heterogeneity among Hcrt neurons. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and high-resolution imaging of the adult male and female zebrafish hypothalamic periventricular zone, we identified 21 glutamatergic and 28 GABAergic cell types. Integration of zebrafish and mouse scRNA-seq revealed evolutionary conserved and divergent hypothalamic cell types. The expression of specific genes, including <I>npvf</I>, which encodes a sleep-regulating neuropeptide, was enriched in subsets of glutamatergic Hcrt neurons in both larval and adult zebrafish. The genetic profile, activity, and neurite processing of the neuronal subpopulation that coexpresses both Hcrt and Npvf (Hcrt+Npvf+) differ from other Hcrt neurons. These interspecies findings provide a unified annotation of hypothalamic cell types and suggest that the heterogeneity of Hcrt neurons enables multifunctionality, such as consolidation of both wake and sleep by the Hcrt- and Npvf-releasing neuronal subpopulation.</p>

                <p>The developed human brain shows remarkable plasticity following perceptual learning, resulting in improved visual sensitivity. However, such improvements commonly require extensive stimuli exposure. Here we show that efficiently enhancing visual perception with minimal stimuli exposure recruits distinct neural mechanisms relative to standard repetition-based learning. Participants (<I>n</I> = 20, 12 women, 8 men) encoded a visual discrimination task, followed by brief memory reactivations of only five trials each performed on separate days, demonstrating improvements comparable with standard repetition-based learning (<I>n</I> = 20, 12 women, 8 men). Reactivation-induced learning engaged increased bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity relative to repetition-based learning. Complementary evidence for differential learning processes was further provided by temporal&ndash;parietal resting functional connectivity changes, which correlated with behavioral improvements. The results suggest that efficiently enhancing visual perception with minimal stimuli exposure recruits distinct neural processes, engaging higher-order control and attentional resources while leading to similar perceptual gains. These unique brain mechanisms underlying improved perceptual learning efficiency may have important implications for daily life and in clinical conditions requiring relearning following brain damage.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/36/e0325242024?rss=1">Sleep Consolidation Potentiates Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Contrary to its well-established role in declarative learning, the impact of sleep on motor memory consolidation remains a subject of debate. Current literature suggests that while motor skill learning benefits from sleep, consolidation of sensorimotor adaptation (SMA) depends solely on the passage of time. This has led to the proposal that SMA may be an exception to other types of memories. Here, we addressed this ongoing controversy in humans through three comprehensive experiments using the visuomotor adaptation paradigm (<I>N</I> = 290, 150 females). In Experiment 1, we investigated the impact of sleep on memory retention when the temporal gap between training and sleep was not controlled. In line with the previous literature, we found that memory consolidates with the passage of time. In Experiment 2, we used an anterograde interference protocol to determine the time window during which SMA memory is most fragile and, thus, potentially most sensitive to sleep intervention. Our results show that memory is most vulnerable during the initial hour post-training. Building on this insight, in Experiment 3, we investigated the impact of sleep when it coincided with the critical first hour of memory consolidation. This manipulation unveiled a benefit of sleep (30% memory enhancement) alongside an increase in spindle density and spindle&ndash;SO coupling during NREM sleep, two well-established neural markers of sleep consolidation. Our findings reconcile seemingly conflicting perspectives on the active role of sleep in motor learning and point to common mechanisms at the basis of memory formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/36/e0355242024?rss=1">Association between Inhibitory-Excitatory Balance and Brain Activity Response during Cognitive Flexibility in Young and Older Individuals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive flexibility represents the capacity to switch among different mental schemes, providing an adaptive advantage to a changing environment. The neural underpinnings of this executive function have been deeply studied in humans through fMRI, showing that the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) are crucial. Here, we investigated the inhibitory&ndash;excitatory balance in these regions by means of -aminobutyric acid (GABA+) and glutamate + glutamine (Glx), measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, during a cognitive flexibility task and its relationship with the performance level and the local task-induced blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response in 40 young (18&ndash;35&nbsp;years; 26 female) and 40 older (18&ndash;35&nbsp;years; 21 female) human adults. As the IFC and the IPL are richly connected regions, we also examined whole-brain effects associated with their local metabolic activity. Results did not show absolute metabolic modulations associated with flexibility performance, but the performance level was related to the direction of metabolic modulation in the IPL with opposite patterns in young and older individuals. The individual inhibitory&ndash;excitatory balance modulation showed an inverse relationship with the local BOLD response in the IPL. Finally, the modulation of inhibitory&ndash;excitatory balance in IPL was related to whole-brain effects only in older individuals. These findings show disparities in the metabolic mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility in young and older adults and their association with the performance level and BOLD response. Such metabolic differences are likely to play a role in executive functioning during aging and specifically in cognitive flexibility.</p>

                <p>Multiple mutations in the <I>Rhodopsin</I> gene cause sector retinitis pigmentosa in humans and a corresponding light-exacerbated retinal degeneration (RD) in animal models. Previously we have shown that T4K rhodopsin requires photoactivation to exert its toxic effect. Here we further investigated the mechanisms involved in rod cell death caused by T4K rhodopsin in mixed male and female <I>Xenopus laevis</I>. In this model, RD was prevented by rearing animals in constant darkness but surprisingly also in constant light. RD was maximized by light cycles containing at least 1&nbsp;h of darkness and 20&nbsp;min of light exposure, light intensities &gt;750&nbsp;lux, and by a sudden light onset. Under conditions of frequent light cycling, RD occurred rapidly and synchronously, with massive shedding of ROS fragments into the RPE initiated within hours and subsequent death and phagocytosis of rod cell bodies. RD was minimized by reduced light levels, pretreatment with constant light, and gradual light onset. RD was prevented by genetic ablation of the retinal isomerohydrolase RPE65 and exacerbated by ablation of phototransduction components GNAT1, SAG, and GRK1. Our results indicate that photoactivated T4K rhodopsin is toxic, that cell death requires synchronized photoactivation of T4K rhodopsin, and that toxicity is mitigated by interaction with other rod outer segment proteins regardless of whether they participate in activation or shutoff of phototransduction. In contrast, RD caused by P23H rhodopsin does not require photoactivation of the mutant protein, as it was exacerbated by RPE65 ablation, suggesting that these phenotypically similar disorders may require different treatment strategies.</p>

                <p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is crucial for tracking various aspects of expected outcomes, thereby helping to guide choices and support learning. Our previous study showed that the effects of reward timing and size on the activity of single units in OFC were dissociable when these attributes were manipulated independently ( <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B9">Roesch et al., 2006</cross-ref>). However, in real-life decision-making scenarios, outcome features often change simultaneously, so here we investigated how OFC neurons in male rats integrate information about the timing and identity (flavor) of reward and respond to changes in these features, according to whether they were changed simultaneously or separately. We found that a substantial number of OFC neurons fired differentially to immediate versus delayed reward and to the different reward flavors. However, contrary to the previous study, selectivity for timing was strongly correlated with selectivity for identity. Taken together with the previous research, these results suggest that when reward features are correlated, OFC tends to "pack" them into unitary constructs, whereas when they are independent, OFC tends to "crack" them into separate constructs. Furthermore, we found that when both reward timing and flavor were changed, reward-responsive OFC neurons showed unique activity patterns preceding and during the omission of an expected reward. Interestingly, this OFC activity is similar and slightly preceded the ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA DA) activity observed in a previous study ( <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B22">Takahashi et al., 2023</cross-ref>), consistent with the role of OFC in providing predictive information to VTA DA neurons.</p>

                <p>An interoceptive homeostatic reflex monitors levels of CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup> to maintain blood gas homeostasis and rapidly regulate tissue acid&ndash;base balance by driving lung ventilation and CO<SUB>2</SUB> excretion&mdash;this CO<SUB>2</SUB>-evoked increase in respiration is the hypercapnic ventilatory reflex (HCVR). Retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons provide crucial excitatory drive to downstream respiratory rhythm/pattern-generating circuits, and their activity is directly modulated by changes in CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup>. RTN neurons express GPR4 and TASK-2, global deletion of which abrogates CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup> activation of RTN neurons and the HCVR. It has not been determined if the intrinsic pH sensitivity of these proton detectors is required for these effects. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate mice with mutations in either of two pH-sensing histidine residues in GPR4 to determine effects on RTN neuronal CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup> sensitivity and the HCVR. In global GPR4(H81F) and GPR4(H167F) mice, CO<SUB>2</SUB>-stimulated breathing and CO<SUB>2</SUB>-induced RTN neuronal activation were strongly blunted, with no effect on hypoxia-stimulated breathing. In brainstem slices from GPR4(H81F) mice, peak firing of RTN neurons during bath acidification was significantly reduced compared with GPR4 wild-type mice, and a subpopulation of RTN neurons was rendered pH-insensitive, phenocopying previous results from GPR4-deleted mice. These effects were independent of changes in RTN number/distribution, neuronal excitability or transcript levels for GPR4 and TASK-2. CO<SUB>2</SUB>-stimulated breathing was reduced to a similar extent in GPR4(H81F) and TASK-2-deleted mice, with combined mutation yielding no additional deficit in the HCVR. Together, these data demonstrate that the intrinsic pH sensitivity of GPR4 is necessary for full elaboration of the HCVR.</p>

                <p>Acetylation of histone proteins by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and the resultant change in gene expression, is a well-established mechanism necessary for long-term memory (LTM) consolidation, which is not required for short-term memory (STM). However, we previously demonstrated that the HAT p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) also influences hippocampus (HPC)-dependent STM in male rats. In addition to their epigenetic activity, HATs acetylate nonhistone proteins involved in nongenomic cellular processes, such as estrogen receptors (ERs). Given that ERs have rapid, nongenomic effects on HPC-dependent STM, we investigated the potential interaction between ERs and PCAF for STM mediated by the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC). Using a series of pharmacological agents administered directly into the dHPC, we reveal a functional interaction between PCAF and ER&alpha; in the facilitation of short-term object-in-place memory in male but not female rats. This interaction was specific to ER&alpha;, while ER&beta; agonism did not enhance STM. It was further specific to dHPC STM, as the effect was not present in the dHPC for LTM or in the perirhinal cortex. Further, while STM required local (i.e., dHPC) estrogen synthesis, the facilitatory interaction effect appeared independent of estrogens. Finally, western blot analyses demonstrated that PCAF activation in the dHPC rapidly (5 min) activated downstream estrogen-related cell signaling kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-related kinase). Collectively, these findings indicate that PCAF, which is typically implicated in LTM through epigenetic processes, also influences STM in the dHPC, possibly via nongenomic ER activity. Critically, this novel PCAF&ndash;ER interaction might exist as a male-specific mechanism supporting STM.</p>

                <p>While the influence of context on long-term memory (LTM) is well documented, its effects on the interaction between working memory (WM) and LTM remain less understood. In this study, we explored these interactions using a delayed match-to-sample task, where participants (6 males, 16 females) encountered the same target object across six consecutive trials, facilitating the transition from WM to LTM. During half of these target repetitions, the background color changed. We measured the WM storage of the target using the contralateral delay activity in electroencephalography. Our results reveal that task-irrelevant context changes trigger the reactivation of long-term memories in WM. This reactivation may be attributed to content&ndash;context binding in WM and hippocampal pattern separation.</p>

                <p>Sensory processing disruptions are a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurological disorders. The acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition (PPI) are common metrics used to assess disruptions in sensory processing and sensorimotor gating in clinical studies and animal models. However, often there are inconsistent findings on ASD-related PPI deficits across different studies. Here, we used a novel method for assessing changes in startle and PPI in rodents, using the <I>Cntnap2</I> knock-out (KO) rat model for neurodevelopmental disorder/ASD that has consistently shown PPI disruptions in past studies. We discovered that not only sex and prepulse intensity but also the intensity of the startle stimulus profoundly impacts whether PPI deficits are evident in the <I>Cntnap2</I> KO rat or not. We show that rats do not universally exhibit a PPI deficit; instead, impaired PPI is contingent on specific testing conditions. Notably, at lower startle stimulus intensities, <I>Cntnap2</I> KO rats not only demonstrated intact PPI but also exhibited evidence of enhanced PPI compared with their wild-type counterparts. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering specific testing conditions when evaluating startle and PPI in the context of ASD and other neuropsychiatric conditions and might explain some of the inconsistencies between different studies.</p>

                <p>Generalized epilepsy (GE) encompasses a heterogeneous group of hyperexcitability disorders that clinically manifest as seizures. At the whole-brain level, distinct seizure patterns as well as interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) reflect key signatures of hyperexcitability in magneto- and electroencephalographic (M/EEG) recordings. Moreover, it had been suggested that aperiodic activity, specifically the slope of the 1/<I>f<sup>x</sup></I> decay function of the power spectrum, might index neural excitability. However, it remained unclear if hyperexcitability as encountered at the cellular level directly translates to putative large-scale excitability signatures, amenable to M/EEG. In order to test whether the power spectrum is altered in hyperexcitable states, we recorded resting-state MEG from male and female GE patients (<I>n</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;51; 29 females; 28.82 &plusmn; 12.18&nbsp;years; mean &plusmn; SD) and age-matched healthy controls (<I>n</I> = 49; 22 females; 32.10 &plusmn; 12.09&nbsp;years). We parametrized the power spectra using FOOOF ("fitting oscillations and one over <I>f</I>") to separate oscillatory from aperiodic activity to directly test whether aperiodic activity is systematically altered in GE patients. We further identified IEDs to quantify the temporal dynamics of aperiodic activity around overt epileptic activity. The results demonstrate that aperiodic activity indexes hyperexcitability in GE at the whole-brain level, especially during epochs when no IEDs were present (<I>p</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0130; <I>d</I> = 0.52). Upon IEDs, large-scale circuits transiently shifted to a less excitable network state (<I>p</I> = 0.001; <I>d</I> = 0.68). In sum, these results uncover that MEG background activity might index hyperexcitability based on the current brain state and does not rely on the presence of epileptic waveforms.</p>

                <p>The accurate estimation of limb state is necessary for movement planning and execution. While state estimation requires both feedforward and feedback information, we focus here on the latter. Prior literature has shown that integrating visual and proprioceptive feedback improves estimates of static limb position. However, differences in visual and proprioceptive feedback delays suggest that multisensory integration could be disadvantageous when the limb is moving. We formalized this hypothesis by modeling feedback-based state estimation using the long-standing maximum likelihood estimation model of multisensory integration, which we updated to account for sensory delays. Our model predicted that the benefit of multisensory integration was largely lost when the limb was passively moving. We tested this hypothesis in a series of experiments in human subjects that compared the degree of interference created by discrepant visual or proprioceptive feedback when estimating limb position either statically at the end of the movement or dynamically at movement midpoint. In the static case, we observed significant interference: discrepant feedback in one modality systematically biased sensory estimates based on the other modality. However, no interference was seen in the dynamic case: participants could ignore sensory feedback from one modality and accurately reproduce the motion indicated by the other modality. Together, these findings suggest that the sensory feedback used to compute a state estimate differs depending on whether the limb is stationary or moving. While the former may tend toward multimodal integration, the latter is more likely to be based on feedback from a single sensory modality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1006/v1?src=rss">Posterior palatal seal recording: fact and reasons among Iraqi dentists [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Backgrounds The retention of the maxillary complete denture may be influenced by adequate recording in the patient’s mouth, marking, and carving of the post-dam on the maxillary cast. Failure to do so may lead to loss of retention. Successful denture construction with patient’s comfort could be achieved by effective methods of recording, marking, and carving of the post-dam. The aim of the study was to assess Iraqi dentists in their knowledge and application of the post-dam in maxillary complete dentures. Methods Questionnaires were distributed randomly through online Google Forms and 118 Iraqi dentists with different academic degree participated in the study. A multinomial logistic regression model was also used to assess the nominal outcome variables. Results A High percentage of 90.7% of Iraqi dentists with different academic degree stated that they had the knowledge about the vibrating lines and their location and 84.7% stated that they mark the post-dam on the master cast, while 15.3% stated that the dental technician marks it. More the half (52.5%) of the participants carved the post-dam, while 47.5% of the participants stated that the dental technician did it. For participants not marking the post-dam, 30.5% of the participants stated they depend on the dental technician in marking and/or carve the post-dam, while the fear of denture failure and loss of retention was observed in 25.4% of the participants, followed by 24.6% of participants forgetting to carve, 10.2% of participants had no information about carving, and 9.3% participants found it was difficult to carve. Conclusions Within the limitations of the study, most Iraqi dentists with different academic degree stated that they had the knowledge on the location of vibrating lines. However, recording and carving the post-dam was influenced by the dentist’s personal preference and their dependency on the dental technician.

                The routine genomic surveillance of pathogens in diverse geographical settings and equitable data sharing are critical to inform effective infection control and therapeutic development. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the importance of routine genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to detect emerging variants of concern. However, the majority of high-income countries sequenced >0.5% of their COVID-19 cases, unlike low- and middle-income countries. By the end of 2022, many countries around the world had managed to establish capacity for pathogen genomic surveillance. Notably, Beta and Omicron; 2 of the 5 current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were first discovered in Africa through an aggressive sequencing campaign led by African scientists. To sustain such infrastructure and expertise beyond this pandemic, other endemic pathogens should leverage this investment. Therefore, countries are establishing multi-pathogen genomic surveillance strategies. Here we provide a catalog of the current landscape of sequenced and publicly shared pathogens in different countries in Africa. Drawing upon our collective knowledge and expertise, we review the ever-evolving challenges and propose innovative recommendations.

                Background: To minimize fracture risk, multimodal training regimens are recommended. However, their effectiveness in community settings remains uncertain. This study evaluated the feasibility of 19-weeks of multimodal training in a local community center with emphasis on musculoskeletal health in postmenopausal women. Methods: In a controlled trial, 28 postmenopausal women (53-68-years-old) were assigned to a multimodal training group (MMT, n=15) or a control group (CON, n=13). The training consisted of high- and odd-impact, resistance and balance-coordination training 1-2 hours weekly. The outcomes were attendance rate, regional and total bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), bone turnover markers (BTM), body composition, functional muscle strength and power, and dynamic balance. All were determined at baseline and after 19 weeks of training. BTM was assessed after three weeks. Results: Overall, 22(79%) participants (MMT, n=9; CON, n=13) completed the study, and the mean attendance rate for MMT was 65.5% of the maximum sessions (2) offered. Only right trochanter BMD increased (p<0.05) by 1.0±1.1% in MMT, which was higher(p<0.05) than CON. While whole-body BMC was not changed at 19 weeks from baseline in MMT, it decreased (p<0.05) in CON resulting in a significant difference (p<0.05) in whole-body BMC delta values between the two groups. Compared to baseline, body fat percentage(%BF), fat mass(FM), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-mass and -volume were decreased (p<0.01) in MMT, and were larger (p<0.05) than CON. No significant changes were observed in BTM, muscle strength and power, and dynamic balance after 19 weeks. Conclusions: Nineteen weeks of multimodal training 1-2 hours per week in a local community had a health-enhancing effect on %BF, FM, and VAT, whereas the musculoskeletal health impact was modest. We hypothesize that the reason might be too low training volume and frequency and supposedly too low musculoskeletal training intensity for some participants. Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05164679 (21/12/2021).

                Background COVID-19 pandemics increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk during hospitalization, despite prophylactic anticoagulation. Limited radiological diagnosis in pandemic requires a guided protocol for anticoagulant adjustment. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center as part of a quality improvement program evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation protocols. The study focused on implementing a guideline for anticoagulant dosing protocol based on dynamic changes in D-dimer levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The dosing guideline allowed for dose escalation from standard prophylactic levels to escalated prophylactic or therapeutic levels, depending on the patient's risk profile for VTE. The primary endpoints included in-hospital survival comparing between fix and dynamic adjustment treatment groups. Secondary endpoints encompassed major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events, incidence of breakthrough thrombosis, length of hospitalization and ICU stay, days of mechanical ventilator use, and survival duration. Findings Among the 260 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020. The patients received fixed anticoagulant dosage in 188, 72.3%) patients, while 72 (27.7%) were up-titrated according to the protocol. In-hospital survival at 30 days demonstrated superiority among patients whose anticoagulation was up-titrated to either escalated prophylactic or therapeutic (80.2%) compared to receiving fixed anticoagulant dosage (51.3%) (p=0.01). Bleeding events were significantly higher in up-titrate group (12.5%) compared to fixed anticoagulant dosage group (2.13%). Most of them are CRNMB. Conclusion A dynamic, D-dimer-based dose escalation of anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 holds promise in improving in-hospital mortality rates without a significant increase in fatal bleeding events.

                Background Learning to thinking critically about health information and choices can protect people from unnecessary suffering, harm, and resource waste. Earlier work revealed that children can learn these skills, but printing costs and curricula compatibility remain important barriers to school implementation. We aimed to develop a set of digital learning resources for students to think critically about health that were suitable for use in Kenyan, Rwandan, and Ugandan secondary schools. Methods We conducted work in two phases collaborating with teachers, students, schools, and national curriculum development offices using a human-centred design approach. First, we conducted context analyses and an overview of teaching strategies, prioritised content and collected examples. Next, we developed lessons and guidance iteratively, informed by data from user-testing, individual and group interviews, and school pilots. Results Final resources include online lesson plans, teachers’ guide, and extra resources, with lesson plans in two modes, for use in a classroom equipped with a blackboard/ﬂip-chart and a projector. The resources are accessible offline for use when electricity or Internet is lacking. Teachers preferred the projector mode, as it provided structure and a focal point for class attention. Feedback was largely positive, with teachers and students appreciating the learning and experiencing it as relevant. Four main challenges included time to teach lessons; incorrect comprehension; identifying suitable examples; and technical, logistical, and behavioural challenges with a student-computer mode that we piloted. We resolved challenges by simplifying and combining lessons; increasing opportunities for review and assessment; developing teacher training materials, creating a searchable set of examples; and deactivating the student-computer mode. Conclusion Using a human-centred design approach, we created digital resources for teaching secondary school students to think critically about health actions and for training teachers. Be smart about your health resources are open access and can be translated or adapted to other settings.

                Background The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing overtime, potentially leading to various severe health complications and mortality. Despite therapeutic agents have currently been developed, unexpected adverse effects are inevitable. Hence, safe and effective medications such as those of plant origin are critical to prevent unexpected complication in DM sufferers. Etlingera elatior has been widely used as spice and traditional medicine to treat diabetes in Aceh Province, Indonesia. However, study regarding α-glucosidase inhibitory effect of E. elatior growing in Gayo highlands, Aceh, Indonesia, is completely lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro α-glucosidase inhibitory effect of E. elatior ethanol extracts (EEEE) growing in Gayo highlands, Aceh Province, Indonesia. Methods Antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH procedure, whereas α-glucosidase inhibition assay was carried out using spectrophotometric method. Data analysis was performed using One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Duncan’s multiple range test at α=0.05. Results Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of total phenolic (TPC), total flavonoid (TFC), and total tannin (TTC) content in all E. elatior plant parts, in which the highest TPC was found in the stem (158.38 GAE/g), whereas the highest TFC and TTC was obtained in the rhizome extracts. The extract of fruit showed the strongest antioxidant activities, followed by the stem and leaf, with IC50 of 2.381 μg/mL, 6.966 μg/mL, and 19.365 μg/mL, respectively. All E. elatior extracts revealed a significant inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase at the concentration of 500 μg/mL, in which the stem extract showed the most effective α-glucosidase inhibitory effect with IC50 value of 5.15 μg/mL, suggesting its promising potential as antidiabetic agent. Conclusions This study highlights E. elatior potency as a novel source of antioxidant and natural antidiabetic compounds that are useful for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.

                The polysaccharides pectin and chitosan are derived from the fruit peels and exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects, respectively. Their biocompatibility and renewability make them suitable for use in food products. The size of the swelling and degradation of these cells can be controlled using different combinations. Pectin and chitosan are useful as medication delivery systems, where they can be integrated to control the dosages and residence times of pharmaceuticals. They have a wide range of applications such as wound dressings, body fat reducers, tissue engineering agents, and drug delivery agents. Addressing teeth loss with the use of dental implants is a critical element of dental care. In most cases, healing is time-consuming and painful. As a result of adding new materials to the implant surface, the healing process would accelerate, and medications would be delivered to the implant site with greater efficiency.

                <p>by Clémence Bergerot, Wolfram Barfuss, Pawel Romanczuk</p>

Humans tend to give more weight to information confirming their beliefs than to information that disconfirms them. Nevertheless, this apparent irrationality has been shown to improve individual decision-making under uncertainty. However, little is known about this bias’ impact on decision-making in a social context. Here, we investigate the conditions under which confirmation bias is beneficial or detrimental to decision-making under social influence. To do so, we develop a Collective Asymmetric Reinforcement Learning (CARL) model in which artificial agents observe others’ actions and rewards, and update this information asymmetrically. We use agent-based simulations to study how confirmation bias affects collective performance on a two-armed bandit task, and how resource scarcity, group size and bias strength modulate this effect. We find that a confirmation bias benefits group learning across a wide range of resource-scarcity conditions. Moreover, we discover that, past a critical bias strength, resource abundance favors the emergence of two different performance regimes, one of which is suboptimal. In addition, we find that this regime bifurcation comes with polarization in small groups of agents. Overall, our results suggest the existence of an optimal, moderate level of confirmation bias for decision-making in a social context.

                <p>by Olav N. L. Aga, Morten Brun, Kazeem A. Dauda, Ramon Diaz-Uriarte, Konstantinos Giannakis, Iain G. Johnston</p>

Accumulation processes, where many potentially coupled features are acquired over time, occur throughout the sciences, from evolutionary biology to disease progression, and particularly in the study of cancer progression. Existing methods for learning the dynamics of such systems typically assume limited (often pairwise) relationships between feature subsets, cross-sectional or untimed observations, small feature sets, or discrete orderings of events. Here we introduce HyperTraPS-CT (Hypercubic Transition Path Sampling in Continuous Time) to compute posterior distributions on continuous-time dynamics of many, arbitrarily coupled, traits in unrestricted state spaces, accounting for uncertainty in observations and their timings. We demonstrate the capacity of HyperTraPS-CT to deal with cross-sectional, longitudinal, and phylogenetic data, which may have no, uncertain, or precisely specified sampling times. HyperTraPS-CT allows positive and negative interactions between arbitrary subsets of features (not limited to pairwise interactions), supporting Bayesian and maximum-likelihood inference approaches to identify these interactions, consequent pathways, and predictions of future and unobserved features. We also introduce a range of visualisations for the inferred outputs of these processes and demonstrate model selection and regularisation for feature interactions. We apply this approach to case studies on the accumulation of mutations in cancer progression and the acquisition of anti-microbial resistance genes in tuberculosis, demonstrating its flexibility and capacity to produce predictions aligned with applied priorities.

                <p>by Israel Luis, Maarten Afschrift, Elena M. Gutierrez-Farewik</p>

Recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in assistive exoskeletons; both passive and active devices have reduced metabolic costs near preferred walking speed by assisting muscle actions. Metabolic reductions at multiple speeds should thus also be attainable. Musculoskeletal simulation can potentially predict the interaction between assistive moments, muscle-tendon mechanics, and walking energetics. In this study, we simulated devices’ optimal assistive moments based on minimal muscle activations during walking with prescribed kinematics and dynamics. We used a generic musculoskeletal model with tuned muscle-tendon parameters and computed metabolic rates from muscle actions. We then simulated walking across multiple speeds and with two ideal actuation modes–motor-based and spring-based–to assist ankle plantarflexion, knee extension, hip flexion, and hip abduction and compared computed metabolic rates. We found that both actuation modes considerably reduced physiological joint moments but did not always reduce metabolic rates. Compared to unassisted conditions, motor-based ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion assistance reduced metabolic rates, and this effect was more pronounced as walking speed increased. Spring-based hip flexion and abduction assistance increased metabolic rates at some walking speeds despite a moderate decrease in some muscle activations. Both modes of knee extension assistance reduced metabolic rates to a small extent, even though the actuation contributed with practically the entire net knee extension moment during stance. Motor-based hip abduction assistance reduced metabolic rates more than spring-based assistance, though this reduction was relatively small. Our study also suggests that an assistive strategy based on minimal muscle activations might result in a suboptimal reduction of metabolic rates. Future work should experimentally validate the effects of assistive moments and refine modeling assumptions accordingly. Our computational workflow is freely available online.

Integrins are fundamental for cell adhesion and the formation of focal adhesions (FA). Accordingly, these receptors guide embryonic development, tissue maintenance, and haemostasis but are also involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. A detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that drive integrin activation, FA assembly, and downstream signalling cascades is critical. Here, we reveal a direct association of paxillin, a marker protein of FA sites, with the cytoplasmic tails of the integrin β1 and β3 subunits. The binding interface resides in paxillin’s LIM3 domain, where based on the NMR structure and functional analyses, a flexible, 7-amino acid loop engages the unstructured part of the integrin cytoplasmic tail. Genetic manipulation of the involved residues in either paxillin or integrin β3 compromises cell adhesion and motility of murine fibroblasts. This direct interaction between paxillin and the integrin cytoplasmic domain identifies an alternative, kindlin-independent mode of integrin outside-in signalling particularly important for integrin β3 function.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion/deletions syndrome (MDDS) comprises a group of diseases caused by primary autosomal defects of mtDNA maintenance. Our objective was to study the etiology of MDDS in 4 patients who lack pathogenic variants in known genetic causes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing of the probands was performed to identify pathogenic variants. We validated the mitochondrial defect by analyzing mtDNA, mitochondrial dNTP pools, respiratory chain activities, and GUK1 activity. To confirm pathogenicity of GUK1 deficiency, we expressed 2 GUK1 isoforms in patient cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified biallelic <i>GUK1</i> pathogenic variants in all 4 probands who presented with ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and myopathic proximal limb weakness, as well as variable hepatopathy and altered T-lymphocyte profiles. Muscle biopsies from all probands showed mtDNA depletion, deletions, or both, as well as reduced activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes. <i>GUK1</i> encodes guanylate kinase, originally identified as a cytosolic enzyme. Long and short isoforms of GUK1 exist. We observed that the long isoform is intramitochondrial and the short is cytosolic. In probands’ fibroblasts, we noted decreased GUK1 activity causing unbalanced mitochondrial dNTP pools and mtDNA depletion in both replicating and quiescent fibroblasts indicating that GUK1 deficiency impairs de novo and salvage nucleotide pathways. Proband fibroblasts treated with deoxyguanosine and/or forodesine, a purine phosphatase inhibitor, ameliorated mtDNA depletion, indicating potential pharmacological therapies.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Primary GUK1 deficiency is a new and potentially treatable cause of MDDS. The cytosolic isoform of GUK1 may contribute to the T-lymphocyte abnormality, which has not been observed in other MDDS disorders. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Neuroinflammation is a feature of both neurodegenerative disease and normal brain aging. The roles of type I interferon (IFN-I) in the aged brain are incompletely understood. A recent article by Roy et al. reveals pervasive IFN-I activity in normal mouse brain aging, and highlights the importance of microglial IFN-I signaling in neuroinflammation.

                A workhorse tool of economic decision-making has long sought to get inside people’s heads through careful examination of their choices. In this issue of Neuron, Carandini flips the script, showing how it can model how the brain makes sensory choices.

                By establishing semaphorin 6D expression in the amygdala as a central coordinator of brain, metabolic, and immunologic function, the Neuron publication by Nakanishi et al. provides new insight to how primary brain deficiency impacts physiological systems beyond the brain.

                In this issue of Neuron, Torres-Berrío et al. show that stress-susceptible mice exhibit elevated H3K27me1 levels in nucleus accumbens neurons due to the action of the SUZ12 VEFS domain, strengthening the link between specific epigenetic changes and long-lasting stress-induced social, emotional, and cognitive alterations.

                Genetic risk for schizophrenia spans the entire genome. Borcuk et al. show that network neighbors of risk genes also harbor risk, most evidently in excitatory neurons. They leverage this property to propose potential risk genes that are “guilty by association.” Stem cell data support the link between these genes and schizophrenia risk.

                Apps et al. use systems immunology to assess H5N1 vaccination with and without the AS03 adjuvant, revealing dynamic response patterns associated with the adjuvant and vaccine immunogenicity. Independent of AS03, some early responses persisted to 100 days after vaccination. These persistent signatures evaluated pre-vaccination predict vaccine immunogenicity in another cohort.
