              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Medicinal properties of Morus alba for the control of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The objective of this review was to evaluate the medicinal potential of Morus alba leaves on the control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The research question was: what is the therapeutic potential of Morus alba leaves for the control of DM2? Methods: This systematic review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The included studies were extracted from Scopus, Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Scielo, and Google Scholar; January 2015 to July 2021. Key search terms were MeSH and DeCS: Morus alba, mulberry, hypoglycemic agent. The inclusion criteria were: studies in rats administered Morus alba leaf extracts; studies that included the dimensions of lipidemia and glycemia; studies that included indicators such as fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, total cholesterol, and insulin resistance. Exclusion criteria: studies in which Morus alba leaves were administered with other plants; studies with other parts of the Morus alba plant; proteomic studies, cancer, duplicate studies, in vitro studies, and evaluation of included studies. All included investigations were evaluated for biases. Results: Of 253 studies found, 29 were included. The extracts of Morus alba leaves at the phytochemical level improve glucose uptake. Chlorogenic acid, isoquercitrin, and quercitrin, present in the leaves of Morus alba, have hypoglycemic properties and an ameliorating effect on diabetic nephropathy. This leaf has pharmacological effects such as glucose absorption, insulin secretion production, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic activities, and obesity management. Conclusions: Morus alba leaves have pharmacological effects on DM2 that include glucose absorption, production of insulin secretion, antioxidant agent, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic activities, and obesity control. Beyond these results, there is a lack of studies on the potential and synergistic effects of Morus alba leaves' components, limiting the possibility of a more effective therapy using the plant's leaves.

	<p>Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) is one of the causative genes for early onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD). Recently, emerging studies have reported several novel PSEN1 mutations among Asians. In this study, a PSEN1 Val96Phe mutation was discovered in two siblings from Malaysia with a strong family history of disease. This is the second report of PSEN1 Val96Phe mutation among EOAD patients in Asia and in the world. Patients presented symptomatic changes in their behaviors and personality, such as apathy and withdrawal in their 40s. Previous cellular studies with COS1 cell lines revealed the mutation increased the amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) productions. In the present study, whole-exome sequencing was performed on the two siblings with EOAD, and they were analyzed against the virtual panel of 100 genes from various neurodegenerative diseases. In silico modeling was also performed on PSEN1 Val96Phe mutation. This mutation was located on the first transmembrane helix of PSEN1 protein, resulting significant intramolecular stresses in the helices. This helical domain would play a significant role in γ-secretase cleavage for the increased Aβ42 productions. Several other adjacent mutations were reported in this helical domain, including Ile83Thr or Val89Leu. Our study suggested that perturbations in TMI-HLI-TMII regions could also be associated with C-terminal fragment accumulation of APP and enhanced amyloid productions.</p>

                Background: Postoperative hypotension associated with postoperative morbidity and early mortality has been studied previously. Hypertension and other hemodynamic, respiratory, and temperature abnormalities have comparatively understudied during the first postoperative days. Methods: This bi-centre observational cohort study will include 114 adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery hospitalized on an unmonitored general care floor and wearing a multi-signal wearable sensor, allowing remote monitoring (Biobeat Technologies Ltd, Petah Tikva, Israel). The study will cover the first 72 hours after discharge of the patient from the post-anaesthesia care unit. Several thresholds will be used for each variable (arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and skin temperature). Data obtained using the sensor will be compared to data obtained during the routine nurse follow-up. The primary outcome is hemodynamic abnormality. The secondary outcomes are postoperative respiratory and temperature abnormalities, artefacts and blank/null outputs from the wearable device, postoperative complications, and finally, the ease of use of the device. We hypothesize that remote monitoring will detect abnormalities in vital signs more often or more quickly than the detection by nurses’ routine surveillance. Discussion: A demonstration of the ability of wireless sensors to outperform standard monitoring techniques paves the way for the creation of a loop which includes this monitoring mode, the automated creation of alerts, and the sending of these alerts to caregivers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Paranoia, self-deception and overconfidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rosa A. Rossi-Goldthorpe, Yuan Chang Leong, Pantelis Leptourgos, Philip R. Corlett</p>

Self-deception, paranoia, and overconfidence involve misbeliefs about the self, others, and world. They are often considered mistaken. Here we explore whether they might be adaptive, and further, whether they might be explicable in Bayesian terms. We administered a difficult perceptual judgment task with and without social influence (suggestions from a cooperating or competing partner). Crucially, the social influence was uninformative. We found that participants heeded the suggestions most under the most uncertain conditions and that they did so with high confidence, particularly if they were more paranoid. Model fitting to participant behavior revealed that their prior beliefs changed depending on whether the partner was a collaborator or competitor, however, those beliefs did not differ as a function of paranoia. Instead, paranoia, self-deception, and overconfidence were associated with participants’ perceived instability of their own performance. These data are consistent with the idea that self-deception, paranoia, and overconfidence flourish under uncertainty, and have their roots in low self-esteem, rather than excessive social concern. The model suggests that spurious beliefs can have value–self-deception is irrational yet can facilitate optimal behavior. This occurs even at the expense of monetary rewards, perhaps explaining why self-deception and paranoia contribute to costly decisions which can spark financial crashes and devastating wars.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Narrative event segmentation in the cortical reservoir</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter Ford Dominey</p>

Recent research has revealed that during continuous perception of movies or stories, humans display cortical activity patterns that reveal hierarchical segmentation of event structure. Thus, sensory areas like auditory cortex display high frequency segmentation related to the stimulus, while semantic areas like posterior middle cortex display a lower frequency segmentation related to transitions between events. These hierarchical levels of segmentation are associated with different time constants for processing. Likewise, when two groups of participants heard the same sentence in a narrative, preceded by different contexts, neural responses for the groups were initially different and then gradually aligned. The time constant for alignment followed the segmentation hierarchy: sensory cortices aligned most quickly, followed by mid-level regions, while some higher-order cortical regions took more than 10 seconds to align. These hierarchical segmentation phenomena can be considered in the context of processing related to comprehension. In a recently described model of discourse comprehension word meanings are modeled by a language model pre-trained on a billion word corpus. During discourse comprehension, word meanings are continuously integrated in a recurrent cortical network. The model demonstrates novel discourse and inference processing, in part because of two fundamental characteristics: real-world event semantics are represented in the word embeddings, and these are integrated in a reservoir network which has an inherent gradient of functional time constants due to the recurrent connections. Here we demonstrate how this model displays hierarchical narrative event segmentation properties beyond the embeddings alone, or their linear integration. The reservoir produces activation patterns that are segmented by a hidden Markov model (HMM) in a manner that is comparable to that of humans. Context construction displays a continuum of time constants across reservoir neuron subsets, while context forgetting has a fixed time constant across these subsets. Importantly, virtual areas formed by subgroups of reservoir neurons with faster time constants segmented with shorter events, while those with longer time constants preferred longer events. This neurocomputational recurrent neural network simulates narrative event processing as revealed by the fMRI event segmentation algorithm provides a novel explanation of the asymmetry in narrative forgetting and construction. The model extends the characterization of online integration processes in discourse to more extended narrative, and demonstrates how reservoir computing provides a useful model of cortical processing of narrative structure.

This Perspective article argues that as we struggle to combat climate change, with the potential loss of a million species and increasing exposure to thousands of new viruses that could spill over from wildlife to humans (as SARS-CoV-2 likely did), it is time to change course.

Evolving in sync with the computation revolution over the past 30 years, computational biology has emerged as a mature scientific field. While the field has made major contributions toward improving scientific knowledge and human health, individual computational biology practitioners at various institutions often languish in career development. As optimistic biologists passionate about the future of our field, we propose solutions for both eager and reluctant individual scientists, institutions, publishers, funding agencies, and educators to fully embrace computational biology. We believe that in order to pave the way for the next generation of discoveries, we need to improve recognition for computational biologists and better align pathways of career success with pathways of scientific progress. With 10 outlined steps, we call on all adjacent fields to move away from the traditional individual, single-discipline investigator research model and embrace multidisciplinary, data-driven, team science.

The widely held assumption that any important scientific information would be available in English underlies the underuse of non-English-language science across disciplines. However, non-English-language science is expected to bring unique and valuable scientific information, especially in disciplines where the evidence is patchy, and for emergent issues where synthesising available evidence is an urgent challenge. Yet such contribution of non-English-language science to scientific communities and the application of science is rarely quantified. Here, we show that non-English-language studies provide crucial evidence for informing global biodiversity conservation. By screening 419,679 peer-reviewed papers in 16 languages, we identified 1,234 non-English-language studies providing evidence on the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation interventions, compared to 4,412 English-language studies identified with the same criteria. Relevant non-English-language studies are being published at an increasing rate in 6 out of the 12 languages where there were a sufficient number of relevant studies. Incorporating non-English-language studies can expand the geographical coverage (i.e., the number of 2° × 2° grid cells with relevant studies) of English-language evidence by 12% to 25%, especially in biodiverse regions, and taxonomic coverage (i.e., the number of species covered by the relevant studies) by 5% to 32%, although they do tend to be based on less robust study designs. Our results show that synthesising non-English-language studies is key to overcoming the widespread lack of local, context-dependent evidence and facilitating evidence-based conservation globally. We urge wider disciplines to rigorously reassess the untapped potential of non-English-language science in informing decisions to address other global challenges.

                Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that involves persistent challenges in social interaction, speech, and nonverbal communication, in addition to repetitive or restrictive behaviours. For decades, children with ASD have been familiarising themselves with information and communication technologies (ICT) in their training and diagnosis. One of the ICT areas, namely non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR), has become a noticeable tool to help ASD children in their social training. It provides extensive virtual interaction, a safe environment, and is affordable. An NIVR application is developed to assist the intervention on ASD children. However, the whole experiences of the training need to be validated to conclude its effectiveness.   Methods: A case study was employed as the research method. An evaluation of NIVR application using multiple sources of evidence was guided by Kirkpatrick Model of Evaluation (KME) which was executed via questionnaires, pre- and post-test. The main objectives of this research were to evaluate level 1 and 2 of KME. The target for Level 1 is to assess the reactions to the NIVR application. Level 2 is to gauge the knowledge, confidence, or mindset of participants. Level 2 covers the evaluation prior to the training (pre-test) and after the training (post-test).   Results: On average the ASD children had good experiences and were able to improve their social skills with the NIVR application. Therefore, the combination of serious game, analytics and specific VR type provides good data assessment, facilitate comfortable training, and can be an effective intervention for children with ASD.  Conclusion: The positive trend on both levels shows that the application has a good potential to be used in ASD training. The results could be improved in a higher number of participants. Currently, only a limited number of research participants could be obtained due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Characterization and manipulation of Corticothalamic neurons in associative cortices using Syt6‐Cre transgenic mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cortico-thalamic interactions between associative cortices and higher-order thalamic nuclei are involved in high-cognitive functions, such as decision-making and working memory. Corticothalamic neurons (CTn) in the prefrontal cortex and other associative areas have been much less studied than their counterparts in the primary sensory areas. The availability of characterized transgenic tools to study CTn in associative areas will facilitate their study and contribute to overcome the scarcity of data about their properties, network dynamics, and contribution to cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Here, we characterized the Syt6-Cre (KI148Gsat/Mmud) transgenic mouse line, by tracking expression of a Cre-mediated reporter. In this line, Cre-reporter is strongly expressed in the prefrontal, motor, cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices, as well as in other brain areas including the Cerebellum and the Olfactory tubercle. Cortical expression starts embryonically and reaches the adult expression pattern by postnatal day 15. In the cortex, Cre-reporter is expressed by layer 6-CTn, and by layer 5-CTn to a lesser extent. We quantified Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> CTn axon varicosities to estimate the distribution and density of putative corticothalamic driver and modulator inputs to thalamic nuclei in the medial, midline, intralaminar, anterior, and motor groups. Also, we characterized the effect of optogenetic stimulation of Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons in the activity of the prefrontal cortex. CTn stimulation in the prefrontal cortex induces an oscillatory activity in the local field potential that resembles the cortical down-states typically observed during slow-wave sleep or quiet wake.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Methods to measure calcitonin receptor activity, up-regulated in cell stress, apoptosis and autophagy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The expression of the calcitonin receptor (CT Receptor) is widespread throughout the life cycle of mammals and in many diseases, and in these contexts the functions of the common isoforms is largely unknown. The relatively recent development of anti-CT Receptor antibodies that bind separate epitopes on the CTa Receptor and CTb Receptor isoforms has advanced our knowledge and understanding of these events. CT Receptor at the protein level is upregulated in programmed cell death including apoptosis (as described in a previous publication) and autophagy, which is discussed in our upcoming, unpublished review. Incomplete data sets are cited in this review on the upregulation of CACLR (encoding CT Receptor) mRNA, in particular the insert-positive isoform (CTb Receptor), in response to cell stress. Cell stress is induced by growth in depleted foetal bovine serum (dFBS) or without FBS, both of which induce degrees of starvation and autophagy, or dFBS plus staurosporine, which induces apoptosis. Details of the methods deployed to generate these data are described here including measurement of the upregulation of CTb Receptor mRNA with qPCR and nanopore long range sequencing. An anti-CT Receptor antibody also known as CalRexinTM, which binds an epitope in the N-terminal domain, was conjugated to either fluorophore 568, which is accumulated into apoptotic cells as previously reported, or pHrodo Red, a pH dependent fluorescent dye, which is accumulated into autophagic and apoptotic cells.  These conjugates are under development to image programmed cell death. The methods for conjugation and high content imaging on the Operetta platform are described. The high fluorescence intensity at low pH of CalRexin:pHrodo Red in both autophagic and apoptotic cells suggests localisation in autophago-lysosomes and lysosomes respectively. Overall, these observations and the methods that underpin them have contributed to our understanding of the widespread expression of CT Receptor isoforms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase by nucleotide analogs from a single-molecule perspective</a></h4>

              
                The absence of ‘shovel-ready’ anti-coronavirus drugs during vaccine development has exceedingly worsened the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Furthermore, new vaccine-resistant variants and coronavirus outbreaks may occur in the near future, and we must be ready to face this possibility. However, efficient antiviral drugs are still lacking to this day, due to our poor understanding of the mode of incorporation and mechanism of action of nucleotides analogs that target the coronavirus polymerase to impair its essential activity. Here, we characterize the impact of remdesivir (RDV, the only FDA-approved anti-coronavirus drug) and other nucleotide analogs (NAs) on RNA synthesis by the coronavirus polymerase using a high-throughput, single-molecule, magnetic-tweezers platform. We reveal that the location of the modification in the ribose or in the base dictates the catalytic pathway(s) used for its incorporation. We show that RDV incorporation does not terminate viral RNA synthesis, but leads the polymerase into backtrack as far as 30 nt, which may appear as termination in traditional ensemble assays. SARS-CoV-2 is able to evade the endogenously synthesized product of the viperin antiviral protein, ddhCTP, though the polymerase incorporates this NA well. This experimental paradigm is essential to the discovery and development of therapeutics targeting viral polymerases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experience-dependent weakening of callosal synaptic connections in the absence of postsynaptic FMRP</a></h4>

              
                Reduced structural and functional interhemispheric connectivity correlates with the severity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) behaviors in humans. Little is known of how ASD-risk genes regulate callosal connectivity. Here we show that <i>Fmr1</i>, whose loss-of-function leads to Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), cell autonomously promotes maturation of callosal excitatory synapses between somatosensory barrel cortices in mice. Postnatal, cell-autonomous deletion of <i>Fmr1</i> in postsynaptic Layer (L) 2/3 or L5 neurons results in a selective weakening of AMPA receptor- (R), but not NMDA receptor-, mediated callosal synaptic function, indicative of immature synapses. Sensory deprivation by contralateral whisker trimming normalizes callosal input strength, suggesting that experience-driven activity of postsynaptic <i>Fmr1</i> KO L2/3 neurons weakens callosal synapses. In contrast to callosal inputs, synapses originating from local L4 and L2/3 circuits are normal, revealing an input-specific role for postsynaptic <i>Fmr1</i> in regulation of synaptic connectivity within local and callosal neocortical circuits. These results suggest direct cell autonomous and postnatal roles for FMRP in development of specific cortical circuits and suggest a synaptic basis for long-range functional underconnectivity observed in FXS patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mammalian rod synaptic ribbon is essential for Cav channel facilitation and ultrafast synaptic vesicle fusion</a></h4>

              
                Rod photoreceptors (PRs) use ribbon synapses to transmit visual information. To signal 'no light detected' they release glutamate continually to activate post-synaptic receptors. When light is detected glutamate release pauses. How a rod's individual ribbon enables this process was studied here by recording evoked changes in whole-cell membrane capacitance from wild type and ribbonless (<i>Ribeye</i>-ko) mice. Wild type rods filled with high (10 mM) or low (0.5 mM) concentrations of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffer EGTA created a readily releasable pool (RRP) of 87 synaptic vesicles (SVs) that emptied as a single kinetic phase with a τ &lt; 0.4 msec. The lower concentration of EGTA accelerated Ca<sub>v</sub> channel opening and facilitated release kinetics. In contrast, ribbonless rods created a much smaller RRP of 22 SVs, and they lacked Ca<sub>v</sub> channel facilitation; however, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-release coupling remained tight. These release deficits caused a sharp attenuation of rod-driven light responses. We conclude that the synaptic ribbon facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx and establishes a large RRP of SVs.

                Akkermansia muciniphila. East Asian subjects had increased levels of multiple bacterial phyla, fermentative pathways detected by metagenomics, and the short-chain fatty acid end-products acetate, propionate, and isobutyrate. Differences in the gut microbiota between the East Asian and White subjects could not be explained by dietary intake, were more pronounced in lean individuals, and were associated with current geographical location. Microbiome transplantations into germ-free mice demonstrated stable diet- and host genotype-independent differences between the gut microbiotas of East Asian and White individuals that differentially impact host body composition. Taken together, our findings add to the growing body of literature describing variation between ethnicities and provide a starting point for defining the mechanisms through which the microbiome may shape disparate health outcomes in East Asians.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NHE6-depletion corrects ApoE4-mediated synaptic impairments and reduces amyloid plaque load</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the most important and prevalent risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The isoelectric point of ApoE4 matches the pH of the early endosome (EE), causing its delayed dissociation from ApoE receptors and hence impaired endolysosomal trafficking, disruption of synaptic homeostasis and reduced amyloid clearance. We have shown that enhancing endosomal acidification by inhibiting the EE-specific sodium-hydrogen exchanger 6 (NHE6) restores vesicular trafficking and normalizes synaptic homeostasis. Remarkably and unexpectedly, loss of NHE6 (encoded by the gene <i>Slc9a6</i>) in mice effectively suppressed amyloid deposition even in the absence of ApoE4, suggesting that accelerated acidification of early endosomes caused by the absence of NHE6 occludes the effect of ApoE on amyloid plaque formation. NHE6 suppression or inhibition may thus be a universal, ApoE-independent approach to prevent amyloid buildup in the brain. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of AD by which partial NHE6 inhibition reverses the ApoE4 induced endolysosomal trafficking defect and reduces plaque load.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modulation of fracture healing by the transient accumulation of senescent cells</a></h4>

              
                Senescent cells have detrimental effects across tissues with aging but may have beneficial effects on tissue repair, specifically on skin wound healing. However, the potential role of senescent cells in fracture healing has not been defined. Here, we performed an <i>in silico</i> analysis of public mRNAseq data and found that senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) markers increased during fracture healing. We next directly established that the expression of senescence biomarkers increased markedly during murine fracture healing. We also identified cells in the fracture callus that displayed hallmarks of senescence, including distension of satellite heterochromatin and telomeric DNA damage; the specific identity of these cells, however, requires further characterization. Then, using a genetic mouse model (<i>Cdkn2a<sup>LUC</sup></i>) containing a <i>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></i>-driven luciferase reporter, we demonstrated transient <i>in vivo</i> senescent cell accumulation during callus formation. Finally, we intermittently treated young adult mice following fracture with drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells ('senolytics', Dasatinib plus Quercetin), and showed that this regimen both decreased senescence and SASP markers in the fracture callus and significantly accelerated the time course of fracture healing. Our findings thus demonstrate that senescent cells accumulate transiently in the murine fracture callus and, in contrast to the skin, their clearance does not impair but rather improves fracture healing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired trigeminal control of ingestive behavior in the Prrxl1- / - mouse is associated with a lemniscal-biased orosensory deafferentation</a></h4>

              
                Although peripheral deafferentation studies have demonstrated a critical role for trigeminal afference in modulating the orosensorimotor control of eating and drinking, the central trigeminal pathways mediating that control, as well as the timescale of control, remain to be elucidated. In rodents, three ascending somatosensory pathways process and relay orofacial mechanosensory input: the lemniscal, paralemniscal, and extralemniscal. Two of these pathways (the lemniscal and extralemniscal) exhibit highly structured topographic representations of the orofacial sensory surface, as exemplified by the one-to-one somatotopic mapping between vibrissae on the animals face and barrelettes in brainstem, barreloids in thalamus, and barrels in cortex. Here we use the Prrxl1 knockout mouse model to investigate ingestive behavior deficits associated with disruption of the lemniscal pathway. The Prrxl1 deletion disrupts somatotopic patterning and axonal projections throughout the lemniscal pathway but spares patterning in the extralemniscal nucleus. Our data reveal an imprecise and inefficient ingestive phenotype with deficits that span timescales from milliseconds to months, tightly linking trigeminal input with ingestion, from moment-to-moment consummatory to long term appetitive control. We suggest that ordered assembly of trigeminal sensory information along the lemniscal pathway is critical for the rapid and precise modulation of motor circuits driving eating and drinking action sequences.

                The human visual system is capable of detecting extremely small light signals, as little as one single photon. But what is the visual system's minimal exposure threshold to detect meaningful stimuli? Due to hardware limitations, studies examining fast visual processing typically present stimuli for suprathreshold durations and disrupt processing with a mask. Here, we employed a newly developed tachistoscope that enables sub-millisecond presentations. Combining measures of perceptual sensitivity and recordings of neural activity, we find that both the holistic configuration and the emotional expression of a human face have the same minimal required exposure as the minimal required exposure for faces to reach awareness. These findings indicate that conscious awareness is required for processing meaningful visual information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Key Factors in the Cortical Response to Transcranial Electrical Stimulations--A Multi-Scale Modeling Study</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial electrode stimulation (tES), one of the techniques used to apply non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), modulates cortical activities by delivering weak electric currents through scalp-attached electrodes. This emerging technique has gained increasing attention recently; however, the results of tES vary greatly depending upon subjects and the stimulation paradigm, and its cellular mechanism remains uncertain. In particular, there is a controversy over the factors that determine the cortical response to tES. Some studies have reported that the electric field's (EF) orientation is the determining factor, while others have demonstrated that the EF magnitude itself is the crucial factor. In this work, we conducted an in-depth investigation of cortical activity in two types of electrode montages used widely-the conventional (C)-tES and high-definition (HD)-tES-as well as two stimulation waveforms-direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). To do so, we constructed a multi-scale model by coupling an anatomically realistic human head model and morphologically realistic multi-compartmental models of three types of cortical neurons (layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron, layer 4 basket cell, layer 5 pyramidal neuron). Then, we quantified the neuronal response to the C-/HD-tDCS/tACS and explored the relation between the electric field (EF) and the radial field's (RF: radial component of EF) magnitude and the cortical neurons' threshold. The EF tES induced depended upon the electrode montage, and the neuronal responses were correlated with the EF rather than the RF's magnitude. The electrode montages and stimulation waveforms caused a small difference in threshold, but the higher correlation between the EF's magnitude and the threshold was consistent. Further, we observed that the neurons' morphological features affected the degree of the correlation highly. Thus, the EF magnitude was a key factor in the responses of neurons with arborized axons. Our results demonstrate that the crucial factor in neuronal excitability depends upon the neuron models' morphological and biophysical properties. Hence, to predict the cellular targets of NIBS precisely, it is necessary to adopt more advanced neuron models that mimic realistic morphological and biophysical features of actual human cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inflammation modulates regeneration in the acute or chronically damaged zebrafish retina</a></h4>

              
                Unlike mammals, zebrafish regenerate in response to retinal damage. Because microglia are activated by retinal damage, we investigated their role during regeneration following acute or chronic damage. At three weeks-post-fertilization (wpf), fish exhibiting NMDA-induced acute damage or cone photoreceptor-specific chronic degeneration, the gold rush (gosh) mutant, displayed reactive microglia and Muller glia proliferation. Retinas treated to inhibit the immune response lacked reactive microglia and possessed fewer PCNA-positive cells, while LPS treatment increased microglia and PCNA-labeled cells. NMDA-injured retinas upregulated the expression of il-1{beta} and tnf- pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, followed by increased expression of il-10 and arg1 anti-inflammatory/remodeling cytokine genes. An early and transiently TNF- pro-inflammatory microglia population was identified in the NMDA-damaged retina. In contrast, gosh mutant retinas exhibited a mild increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression concurrently with a greater increased in anti-inflammatory/remodeling cytokine gene expression. Few TNF- pro-inflammatory microglia were observed in the gosh retina. How inflammation regulates regeneration in zebrafish would provide important clues towards improving the therapeutic strategies for repairing injured mammalian tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling sexual violence in male rats: The sexual aggression test (SxAT)</a></h4>

              
                Sexual assault and rape are crimes that impact victims worldwide. Although the psychosocial and eco-evolutionary factors associated with this antisocial behavior have repeatedly been studied, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are still unknown mainly due to the lack of an appropriate animal model of sexual aggression (SxA). Here, we established a novel paradigm to provoke and subsequently assess SxA in adult male Wistar rats: the sexual aggression test (SxAT). Briefly, male Wistar rats are sexually aroused by a receptive female, which is exchanged by a non-receptive female immediately after the first intromission. This protocol elicits forced mounting (FM) and aggressive behavior (AB) towards the non-receptive female to different degrees, which can be scored. In a series of experiments we can show that SxA behavior is a relatively stable trait in rats and correlates positively with sexual motivation. Rats with innate abnormal anxiety and aggressive behavior also show abnormal SxA behavior. In addition, central infusion of oxytocin moderately inhibits AB, but increases FM. Finally, we identified the agranular insular cortex to be specifically activated by SxA, and inhibition of this region mildly decreased AB during the SxAT. Altogether, the SxAT is a paradigm that can be readily implemented in behavioral laboratories as a valuable tool to find answers regarding the biological mechanisms underlying SxA in humans, as well as social decision-making in general.

                Sex-specific differences in the aging cerebellum may be related to hormone changes with menopause. We evaluated the influence of reproductive stage on lobular cerebellar network connectivity using data from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience repository. We used raw structural and resting state neuroimaging data and information regarding age, sex, and menopause-related variables. Crus I and II and Lobules V and VI were our cerebellar seeds of interest. We characterized reproductive stage using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria. Results show that postmenopausal females have lower cerebello-striatal and cerebello-cortical connectivity, particularly in frontal regions, along with lower connectivity within the cerebellum, compared to reproductive females. Postmenopausal females also exhibit greater connectivity in some brain areas as well. Differences begin to emerge across transitional stages of menopause. Further, results reveal sex-specific differences in connectivity between female reproductive groups and age-matched male control groups. This suggests that menopause may influence cerebellar network connectivity in aging females, and sex differences in the aging brain may be related to this biological process.

                Gastrointestinal complaints in autism are common and impact the quality of life of affected individuals, yet the underlying mechanisms are understudied. We have found that individuals with mutations in CHD8 present with gastrointestinal disturbances. We have shown that loss of chd8, the sole ortholog of CHD8 in zebrafish, leads to reduced number of enteric neurons and decreased intestinal mobility. However, it remains unclear how chd8 acts during the development of the enteric nervous system and whether CHD8-associated gastrointestinal complaints are solely due to impaired neuronal function in the intestine. Here, utilizing a stable chd8 mutant zebrafish model, we found that the loss of chd8 leads to reduced number of vagal neural crest cells (NCCs), enteric neural progenitors, emigrating from the neural tube and their early migration capability was altered. At later stages, although the intestinal colonization by the NCCs was complete, we found decreased numbers of both NCC-derived serotonergic neurons and serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells, suggesting an intestinal hyposerotonemia in absence of chd8. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed altered expression of key receptors and enzymes in serotonin and acetylcholine signaling pathways. Next, tissue examination of chd8 mutants revealed thinner intestinal epithelium accompanied by accumulation of neutrophils and decreased numbers of goblet cells and eosinophils. Last, single-cell sequencing of whole mid- and posterior intestines showed a global disruption of the immune balance with perturbed expression of inflammatory interleukins and changes in immune cell clusters. Our findings propose a causal developmental link between chd8, serotonergic pathway, intestinal homeostasis, and autism-associated gastrointestinal complaints.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental cell death of cortical projection neurons is controlled by a Bcl11a/Bcl6-dependent pathway</a></h4>

              
                Developmental neuron death plays a pivotal role in refining organization and wiring during neocortex formation. Aberrant regulation of this process results in neurodevelopmental disorders including impaired learning and memory. Underlying molecular pathways are incompletely determined. Loss of Bcl11a in cortical projection neurons induces pronounced cell death in upper-layer cortical projection neurons during postnatal corticogenesis. We used this genetic model to explore genetic mechanisms by which developmental neuron death is controlled. Unexpectedly, we found Bcl6, previously shown to be involved in transition of cortical neurons from progenitor to postmitotic differentiation state to provide a major check point regulating neuron survival during late cortical development. We show that Bcl11a is a direct transcriptional regulator of Bcl6. Deletion of Bcl6 exerts death of cortical projection neurons. In turn, reintroduction of Bcl6 into Bcl11a mutants prevents induction of cell death in these neurons. Together, our data identify a novel Bcl11a/Bcl6-dependent molecular pathway in regulation of developmental cell death during corticogenesis.

                Muller glia (MG) in mammalian retinas are incapable of regenerating neurons after damage, whereas the MG in lower vertebrates regenerate functional neurons. Identification networks that regulate MG-mediated regeneration is key to harnessing the regenerative potential of MG. Here we study how NFkB-signaling influences glial responses to damage and reprogramming of MG into neurons in the rodent retina. We find activation of NFkB and dynamic expression of NFkB-associated genes in MG after damage, however NFkB activity is inhibited by microglia ablation. Knockout of NFkB in MG suppressed the accumulation of immune cells after damage. Inhibition of NFkB following NMDA-damage significantly enhanced the reprogramming of Ascl1-overexpressing MG into neuron-like cells. scRNA-seq of retinal glia following inhibition of NFkB reveals coordination with signaling via TGFb2 and suppression of NFI and Id transcription factors. Inhibition of Smad3 or Id transcription factors increased numbers of neuron-like cells produced by Ascl1-overexpressing MG. We conclude that NFkB is a key signaling hub that is activated in MG after damage, mediates the accumulation of immune cells, and suppresses the neurogenic potential of MG.

                Geosmin is an odorant produced by bacteria in moist soil. It has been found to be extraordinarily relevant to some insects, but the reasons for this are not yet fully understood. Here we report the first tests of the effect of geosmin on honey bees. A stinging assay showed that the defensive behaviour elicited by the bee's alarm pheromone is strongly suppressed by geosmin. Surprisingly, the suppression is, however, only present at very low geosmin concentrations, and completely disappears at higher concentrations. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of the behavioural change at the level of the olfactory receptor neurons by means of electroantennography and at the level of the antennal lobe output via calcium imaging. Unusual effects were observed at both levels. The responses of the olfactory receptor neurons to mixtures of geosmin and the alarm pheromone component isoamyl acetate (IAA) were lower than to pure IAA, suggesting an interaction of both compounds at the olfactory receptor level. In the antennal lobe, the neuronal representation of geosmin showed a glomerular activation that decreased with increasing concentration, correlating well with the concentration dependence of the behaviour. Computational modelling of odour transduction and odour coding in the antennal lobe suggests that a broader than usual activation of different olfactory receptor types by geosmin in combination with lateral inhibition in the antennal lobe could lead to the observed non-monotonic increasing-decreasing responses to geosmin and thus underlie the specificity of the behavioural response to low geosmin concentrations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential geometry methods for constructing manifold-targeted recurrent neural networks.</a></h4>

              
                Neural computations can be framed as dynamical processes, whereby the structure of the dynamics within a neural network are a direct reflection of the computations that the network performs. A key step in generating mechanistic interpretations within this computation through dynamics framework is to establish the link between network connectivity, dynamics and computation. This link is only partly understood. Recent work has focused on producing algorithms for engineering artificial recurrent neural networks (RNN) with dynamics targeted to a specific goal manifold. Some of these algorithms only require a set of vectors tangent to the target manifold to be computed, and thus provide a general method that can be applied to a diverse set of problems. Nevertheless, computing such vectors for an arbitrary manifold in a high dimensional state space remains highly challenging, which in practice limits the applicability of this approach. Here we demonstrate how topology and differential geometry can be leveraged to simplify this task, by first computing tangent vectors on a low-dimensional topological manifold and then embedding these in state space. The simplicity of this procedure greatly facilitates the creation of manifold-targeted RNNs, as well as the process of designing task-solving on-manifold dynamics. This new method should enable the application of network engineering-based approaches to a wide set of problems in neuroscience and machine learning. Furthermore, our description of how fundamental concepts from differential geometry can be mapped onto different aspects of neural dynamics is a further demonstration of how the language of differential geometry can enrich the conceptual framework for describing neural dynamics and computation.

                Hierarchical temporal dynamics are a fundamental computational property of the brain; however, there are no whole-brain, noninvasive investigations into timescales of neural processing in animal models. To that end, we used the spatial resolution and sensitivity of ultra-high field fMRI to probe timescales across the whole macaque brain. We uncovered within-species consistency between timescales estimated from fMRI and electrophysiology. Crucially, we were not only able to demonstrate that we can replicate existing electrophysiological hierarchies, but we extended these to whole brain topographies. Our results validate the complementary use of hemodynamic and electrophysiological intrinsic timescales, establishing a basis for future translational work. Second, with those results in hand, we were able to show that one facet of the high-dimensional FC topography of any region in the brain is closely related to hierarchical temporal dynamics. We demonstrated that intrinsic timescales are organized along spatial gradients that closely match functional connectivity gradient topographies across the whole brain. We conclude that intrinsic timescales are an unifying organizational principle of neural processing across the whole brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Novel and Functionally Diverse Class of Acetylcholine-gated Ion Channels</a></h4>

              
                Fast cholinergic neurotransmission is mediated by pentameric acetylcholine-gated ion channels; in particular, cationic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play well-established roles in virtually all nervous systems. Acetylcholine-gated anion channels have also been identified in some invertebrate phyla, yet their roles in the nervous system are less well-understood. Here we describe the functional properties of five previously-uncharacterized acetylcholine-gated anion channels from C. elegans, including four from a novel nematode specific subfamily known as the diverse group. In addition to their activation by acetylcholine, these diverse group channels are activated at physiological concentrations by other ligands; three, encoded by the lgc-40, lgc-57 and lgc-58 genes, are activated by choline, while lgc-39 encoded channels are activated by octopamine and tyramine. Intriguingly, these and other acetylcholine-gated anion channels show extensive co-expression with cation-selective nicotinic receptors, implying that many cholinergic synapses may have both excitatory and inhibitory potential. Thus, the evolutionary expansion of cholinergic ligand-gated ion channels may enable complex synaptic signalling in an anatomically compact nervous system.

                Predatory animals first detect, then pursue, and ultimately capture prey. Sensory cues, including scent emitted by prey, are detected by the predator and used to guide pursuit. Because the pursuit phase can last for extended periods of time, it is critical for predators to persist in the chase even when prey is difficult to detect in a noisy sensory land-scape. It is equally important for predators to abandon pursuit if enough time has elapsed that prey capture is unlikely to occur. We studied prey detection and sustained pursuit in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a micropredator of humans. These animals first detect hu-mans through sensory cues that are emitted at a distance such as carbon dioxide in breath and odor from skin. As the mosquito approaches a human, additional cues such as body heat and visual contrast signal the promise of a blood meal, which females need to produce eggs. To study how initial prey detection influences the duration of pursuit, we developed optogenetic tools to induce a brief fictive sensation of carbon dioxide and used machine learning-based classification of behavior to investigate how mosquitoes respond to subsequent human cues. We found that a 5-second optogenetic pulse of fictive carbon dioxide induced a persistent behavioral state in female mosquitoes that lasted for more than 10 minutes. This state is highly specific to females searching for a blood meal and was not induced in recently blood-fed females or in males, who do not feed on blood. In males that lack the gene fruitless, which controls persistent social behaviors in other insects, fictive carbon dioxide induced a long-lasting behavior response resembling the predatory state of females. Finally, we show that the persistent state triggered by detection of fictive carbon dioxide enabled females to engorge on a blood meal mimic offered up to 14 minutes after the initial stimulus. Our results demonstrate that a persistent internal state allows female mosquitoes to integrate multiple human sensory cues over long timescales, an ability that is key to their success as an apex micropredator of humans

                Theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) are dynamically modulated by speed and direction in freely moving animals. However, due to the paucity of electrophysiological recordings of freely moving humans, this mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we combined mobile-EEG with fully immersive virtual-reality to investigate theta dynamics in twenty-two healthy adults (aged 18-29 years old) freely navigating a T-maze to find rewards. Our results revealed three dynamic periods of theta modulation: 1) theta power increases coincided with the participants' decision-making period; 2) theta power increased for fast and leftward trials as subjects approached the goal location; and 3) feedback onset evoked two phase-locked theta bursts over the right temporal and frontal-midline channels. These results suggest that recording scalp EEG in freely moving humans navigating a simple virtual T-maze can be utilized as a powerful translational model by which to map theta dynamics during "real-life" goal-directed behavior in both health and disease.

                Perceptual learning (PL) involves long-lasting improvement in perceptual tasks following extensive training. Such improvement has been found to correlate with modifications in neuronal response properties in early as well as late sensory cortical areas. A major challenge is to dissect the causal relation between modification of the neural circuits and the behavioral changes. Previous theoretical and computational studies of PL have largely focused on single-layer model networks, and thus did not address salient characteristics of PL arising from the multiple-staged "deep" structure of the perceptual system. Here we develop a theory of PL in a deep neuronal network architecture, addressing the questions of how changes induced by PL are distributed across the multiple stages of cortex, and how do the respective changes determine the performance in fine discrimination tasks. We prove that in such tasks, modifications of synaptic weights of early sensory areas are both sufficient and necessary for PL. In addition, optimal synaptic weights in the deep network are not unique but span a large space of solutions. We postulate that, in the brain, plasticity throughout the deep network is distributed such that the resultant perturbation on prior circuit structures is minimized. In contrast to most previous models of PL, the minimum perturbation (MP) learning does not change the network readout weights. Our results provide mechanistic and normative explanations for several important physiological features of PL and reconcile apparently contradictory psychophysical findings.

                Training of autobiographical memory has been proposed as intervention to improve cognitive functions. The neural substrates for such improvements are poorly understood. Several brain networks have been previously linked to autobiographical recollections, including the default mode network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network. Here we tested the hypothesis that different neural networks support distinct aspects of memory improvement in response to training on a group of 59 subjects. We found that memory training increases DMN connectivity, and this associates with improved recollection of cue-specific memories. On the contrary, training decreased connectivity in the sensorimotor network, a decrease that correlated with improved ability for voluntary recall. Moreover, only decreased sensorimotor connectivity associated with training-induced decrease in the TNFalpha; immunological factor, which has been previously linked to improved cognitive performance. We identified functional and biochemical factors that associate with distinct memory processes improved by autobiographical training. Pathways which connect autobiographical memory to both high level cognition and somatic physiology are discussed.

                The understanding of brain network interactions in cognitively healthy older adults informs how brain characteristics vary as individuals age and how these variations affect cognitive functioning. A functional connectivity analysis can reveal important insight into the brain's organization, which is crucial to examining cognitive aging. We investigated functional network properties in 146 cognitively healthy participants aged 85+ in the McKnight Brain Aging Registry. We found that the segregation of the cortical association system and the segregation of the fronto-parietal network (FPN) were stronger predictors of cognition and executive function. Compared to other network metrics, the segregation of networks may be more closely linked with cognitive performance and age-related dedifferentiation. We also provide a healthy oldest-old (85+) cortical parcellation that can be used in future work in this age group. This study shows that network segregation of the oldest-old brain supports cognition. Specifically, the FPN plays an important role in supporting overall cognition and executive function in an aging population. By studying network dynamics and cognitive abilities of healthy brain aging, we advance the literature on dedifferentiation in the oldest-old.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multifunctional Cre-dependent transgenic mice for high-precision all-optical interrogation of neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                Causally relating the detailed structure and function of neural circuits to behavior requires the ability to precisely and simultaneously write-in and read-out neural activity. All optical systems that combine two photon (2p) calcium imaging and targeted photostimulation provide such an approach, but require co-expression of an activity indicator, such as GCaMP, and an optogenetic actuator, ideally a potent soma-targeted opsin. In the mammalian brain, such co-expression has so far been achieved by viral transduction, which is invasive and can produce variable, focal, and sometimes toxic overexpression. To overcome this challenge, we developed and validated a Cre-reporter mouse ("Ai203") that conditionally expresses a soma-targeted opsin, ChroME, fused to GCaMP7s. 1p or 2p illumination of expressing neurons in vitro and in vivo produces powerful, precise activation comparable to viral expression of ChroME. The soma-targeted GCaMP7s provides sensitive activity measurements for tracking physiological activity, and the soma-targeted ChroME provides powerful control over neural ensemble activity with holographic optogenetics. We further demonstrate the use of the Ai203 reporter line in 1p optogenetic manipulation of performance on a cortex-dependent visual task and in 2p synaptic connectivity mapping. This new transgenic line could thus greatly facilitate the study of neural circuits by providing a flexible, convenient, and stable tool for all-optical access to large, cell-type specific neural populations throughout the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence of individual differences in motives for nicotine seeking in classical nicotine self-administration and associated outcomes of varenicline administration</a></h4>

              
                Background Smokers vary in their motives for tobacco seeking, suggesting that they could benefit from personalized treatments. However, these variations have received little attention in animal models for the study of tobacco dependence. In the most classically used model, ie. intravenous self-administration of nicotine in the rat, seeking behaviour is reinforced by the combination of intravenous nicotine with a discrete stimulus (eg. discrete cue light). In both human and animals, two types of psychopharmacological interactions between nicotine and environmental stimuli have been evidenced. Whether these two types of interactions contribute equally to nicotine seeking in all individuals is unknown. Methods We combined behavioural pharmacology and clustering analysis. In an outbred male rat population, we tested whether nicotine and the discrete nicotine-associated cue light contributed equally to self-administration in all individuals. Two clusters of rats were identified, in which we further studied the nature of the psychopharmacological interaction between nicotine and the cue, as well as the response to the cessation aid varenicline when nicotine was withdrawn. Results Notably, withdrawing nicotine produced drastic opposed effects on seeking behavior in the two identified clusters of rats; a 50% increase vs a 18% decrease, respectively. The first cluster of rats sought for the primary reinforcing effects of nicotine and the discrete cue light that has gained nicotine-like secondary reinforcing properties. The second cluster sought nicotine for its ability to enhance the primary reinforcing effects of the discrete cue light. Critically, the approved cessation aid Varenicline counteracted the absence of nicotine in both, but eventually decreasing seeking in the former but increasing it in the latter. Conclusions Classical rodent models for the study of the reinforcing and addictive effects of nicotine hide individual variations in the psychopharmacological motives supporting seeking behavior. These variations may be a decisive asset for improving their predictive validity in the perspective of precision medicine for smoking cessation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Attractor Decision Network with Selective Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                The ability to decide swiftly and accurately in an urgent scenario is crucial for an organism's survival. The neural mechanisms underlying the perceptual decision and trade-off between speed and accuracy have been extensively studied in the past few decades. Among several theoretical models, the attractor neural network model has successfully captured both behavioral and neuronal data observed in many decision experiments. However, a recent experimental study revealed additional details that were not considered in the original attractor model. In particular, the study shows that the inhibitory neurons in the posterior parietal cortex of mice are as selective to decision making results as the excitatory neurons, whereas the original attractor model assumes the inhibitory neurons to be unselective. In this study, we investigate a more general attractor model with selective inhibition, and analyze in detail how the computational ability of the network changes with selectivity. We proposed a reduced model for the selective model, and showed that selectivity adds a time-varying component to the energy landscape. This time dependence of the energy landscape allows the selective model to integrate information carefully in initial stages, then quickly converge to an attractor once the choice is clear. This results in the selective model having a more efficient speed-accuracy trade-off that is unreachable by unselective models.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Oxytocin‐like receptor expression in evolutionarily conserved nodes of a vocal network associated with male courtship in a teleost fish</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptides, including oxytocin-like peptides, are a conserved group of hormones that regulate a wide range of social behaviors, including vocal communication. In the current study, we evaluate whether putative brain sites for the actions of isotocin (IT), the oxytocin (OT) homolog of teleost fishes, are associated with vocal courtship and circuitry in the plainfin midshipman fish (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>). During the breeding season, nesting males produce advertisement calls known as ‘hums’ to acoustically court females at night and attract them to nests. We first identify IT receptor (ITR) mRNA in evolutionarily conserved regions of the forebrain preoptic area (POA), anterior hypothalamus (AH), and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), and in two topographically separate populations within the hindbrain vocal pattern generator– duration-coding vocal prepacemaker (VPP) and amplitude-coding vocal motor (VMN) nuclei that also innervate vocal muscles. We also verify that ITR expression overlaps known distribution sites of OT-like immunoreactive fibers. Next, using phosphorylated ribosomal subunit 6 (pS6) as a marker for activated neurons, we demonstrate that ITR-containing neurons in the anterior parvocellular POA, AH, PAG, VPP, and VMN are activated in humming males. Posterior parvocellular and magno/gigantocellular divisions of the POA remain constitutively active in non-humming males that are also in a reproductive state. Together with prior studies of midshipman fish and other vertebrates, our findings suggest that IT-signaling influences male courtship behavior, in part, by acting on brain regions that broadly influence behavioral state (POA) as well as the initiation (POA, PAG) and temporal structure (VPP, VMN) of advertisement hums.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Regulates the Genesis of Displaced Retinal Ganglion Cells3</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) proteins (GSK3&alpha; and GSK3&beta;) are key mediators of signaling pathways, with crucial roles in coordinating fundamental biological processes during neural development. Here we show that the complete loss of GSK3 signaling in mouse retinal progenitors leads to microphthalmia with broad morphologic defects. A single wild-type allele of either <I>Gsk3&alpha;</I> or <I>Gsk3&beta;</I> is able to rescue this phenotype. In this genetic context, all cell types are present in a functional retina. However, we unexpectedly detected a large number of cells in the inner nuclear layer expressing retinal ganglion cell (RGC)-specific markers (called displaced RGCs, dRGCs) when at least one allele of <I>Gsk3&alpha;</I> is expressed. The excess of dRGCs leads to an increased number of axons projecting into the ipsilateral medial terminal nucleus, an area of the brain belonging to the non-image-forming visual circuit and poorly targeted by RGCs in wild-type retina. Transcriptome analysis and optomotor response assay suggest that at least a subset of dRGCs in <I>Gsk3</I> mutant mice are direction-selective RGCs. Our study thus uncovers a unique role of GSK3 in controlling the production of ganglion cells in the inner nuclear layer, which correspond to dRGCs, a rare and poorly characterized retinal cell type.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Type 2 Diabetes Factor Methylglyoxal Mediates Axon Initial Segment Shortening and Alters Neuronal Function at the Cellular and Network Levels</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that alteration of axon initial segment (AIS) geometry (i.e., length or location along the axon) contributes to CNS dysfunction in neurological diseases. For example, AIS length is shorter in the prefrontal cortex of type 2 diabetic mice with cognitive impairment. To determine the key type 2 diabetes-related factor that produces AIS shortening we modified levels of insulin, glucose, or the reactive glucose metabolite methylglyoxal in cultures of dissociated cortices from male and female mice and quantified AIS geometry using immunofluorescent imaging of the AIS proteins AnkyrinG and &beta;IV spectrin. Neither insulin nor glucose modification altered AIS length. Exposure to 100 but not 1 or 10 &mu;<scp>m</scp> methylglyoxal for 24 h resulted in accumulation of the methylglyoxal-derived advanced glycation end-product hydroimidazolone and produced reversible AIS shortening without cell death. Methylglyoxal-evoked AIS shortening occurred in both excitatory and putative inhibitory neuron populations and in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). In single-cell recordings resting membrane potential was depolarized at 0.5&ndash;3 h and returned to normal at 24 h. In multielectrode array (MEA) recordings methylglyoxal produced an immediate ~300% increase in spiking and bursting rates that returned to normal within 2 min, followed by a ~20% reduction of network activity at 0.5&ndash;3 h and restoration of activity to baseline levels at 24 h. AIS length was unchanged at 0.5&ndash;3 h despite the presence of depolarization and network activity reduction. Nevertheless, these results suggest that methylglyoxal could be a key mediator of AIS shortening and disruptor of neuronal function during type 2 diabetes.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Gustometers have made it possible to deliver liquids in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) settings for decades, and mouthpieces are a critical part of these taste delivery systems. Here, we propose an innovative 3D-printed fMRI mouthpiece inspired by children&rsquo;s pacifiers, allowing human participants to swallow while lying down in an MRI scanner. We used a large sample to validate the effectiveness of our method. The results suggest that the mouthpiece can be used to deliver taste stimuli by showing significant clusters of activation in the insular and piriform cortex, which are regions that have been consistently identified in taste processing. This mouthpiece fulfills several criteria guaranteeing a gustatory stimulus of quality, making the delivery precise and reliable. Moreover, this new pacifier-shaped design is simple and cheap to manufacture, hygienic, comfortable to keep in the mouth, and flexible to use in diverse cases. We hope that this new method will promote and facilitate the study of taste and flavor perception in the context of reward processing in affective neuroscience, and thus, help provide an integrative approach to the study of the emotional nature of rewards.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Photoreceptor cKO of OTX2 Enhances OTX2 Intercellular Transfer in the Retina and Causes Photophobia</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In the mature mouse retina, <I>Otx2</I> is expressed in both retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor (PR) cells, and <I>Otx2</I> knock-out (KO) in the RPE alone results in PR degeneration. To study the cell-autonomous function of OTX2 in PRs, we performed PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> KO (cKO) in adults. As expected, the protein disappears completely from PR nuclei but is still observed in PR inner and outer segments while its level concomitantly decreases in the RPE, suggesting a transfer of OTX2 from RPE to PRs in response to <I>Otx2</I> ablation in PRs. The ability of OTX2 to transfer from RPE to PRs was verified by viral expression of tagged-OTX2 in the RPE. Transferred OTX2 distributed across the PR cytoplasm, suggesting functions distinct from nuclear transcription regulation. PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> cKO did not alter the structure of the retina but impaired the translocation of PR arrestin-1 on illumination changes, making mice photophobic. RNA-seq analyses following <I>Otx2</I> KO revealed downregulation of genes involved in the cytoskeleton that might account for the arrestin-1 translocation defect, and of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) and signaling factors that may participate in the enhanced transfer of OTX2. Interestingly, several RPE-specific OTX2 target genes involved in melanogenesis were downregulated, lending weight to a decrease of OTX2 levels in the RPE following PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> cKO. Our study reveals a new role of endogenous OTX2 in PR light adaptation and demonstrates the existence of OTX2 transfer from RPE to PR cells, which is increased on PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> ablation and might participate in PR neuroprotection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Axonal CB1 Receptors Mediate Inhibitory Bouton Formation via cAMP Increase and PKA</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experience-dependent formation and removal of inhibitory synapses are essential throughout life. For instance, GABAergic synapses are removed to facilitate learning, and strong excitatory activity is accompanied by the formation of inhibitory synapses to maintain coordination between excitation and inhibition. We recently discovered that active dendrites trigger the growth of inhibitory synapses via CB1 receptor-mediated endocannabinoid signaling, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Using two-photon microscopy to monitor the formation of individual inhibitory boutons in hippocampal organotypic slices from mice (both sexes), we found that CB1 receptor activation mediated the formation of inhibitory boutons and promoted their subsequent stabilization. Inhibitory bouton formation did not require neuronal activity and was independent of G<SUB>i/o</SUB>-protein signaling, but was directly induced by elevating cAMP levels using forskolin and by activating G<SUB>s</SUB>-proteins using DREADDs. Blocking PKA activity prevented CB1 receptor-mediated inhibitory bouton formation. Our findings reveal that axonal CB1 receptors signal via unconventional downstream pathways and that inhibitory bouton formation is triggered by an increase in axonal cAMP levels. Our results demonstrate an unexpected role for axonal CB1 receptors in axon-specific, and context-dependent, inhibitory synapse formation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Coordination between excitation and inhibition is required for proper brain function throughout life. It was previously shown that new inhibitory synapses can be formed in response to strong excitation to maintain this coordination, and this was mediated by endocannabinoid signaling via CB1 receptors. As activation of CB1 receptors generally results in the suppression of synaptic transmission, it remained unclear how CB1 receptors can mediate the formation of inhibitory synapses. Here we show that CB1 receptors on inhibitory axons signal via unconventional intracellular pathways and that inhibitory bouton formation is triggered by an increase in axonal cAMP levels and requires PKA activity. Our findings point to a central role for axonal cAMP signaling in activity-dependent inhibitory synapse formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">MicroRNA-Dependent Control of Sensory Neuron Function Regulates Posture Behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>All what we see, touch, hear, taste, or smell must first be detected by the sensory elements of our nervous system. Sensory neurons, therefore, represent a critical component in all neural circuits and their correct function is essential for the generation of behavior and adaptation to the environment. Here, we report that the evolutionarily-conserved microRNA (miRNA) <I>miR-263b</I> plays a key behavioral role in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> through effects on the function of larval sensory neurons. Several independent experiments (in 50:50 male:female populations) support this finding: first, miRNA expression analysis, via reporter expression and fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, demonstrate <I>miR-263b</I> expression in larval sensory neurons. Second, behavioral tests in <I>miR-263b</I> null mutants show defects in self-righting, an innate and evolutionarily conserved posture-control behavior that allows larvae to rectify their position if turned upside-down. Third, competitive inhibition of <I>miR-263b</I> in sensory neurons using a <I>miR-263b</I> "sponge" leads to self-righting defects. Fourth, systematic analysis of sensory neurons in <I>miR-263b</I> mutants shows no detectable morphologic defects in their stereotypic pattern, while genetically-encoded calcium sensors expressed in the sensory domain reveal a reduction in neural activity in <I>miR-263b</I> mutants. Fifth, <I>miR-263b</I> null mutants show reduced "touch-response" behavior and a compromised response to sound, both characteristic of larval sensory deficits. Furthermore, bioinformatic miRNA target analysis, gene expression assays, and behavioral phenocopy experiments suggest that <I>miR-263b</I> might exert its effects, at least in part, through repression of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor <I>Atonal</I>. Altogether, our study suggests a model in which miRNA-dependent control of transcription factor expression affects sensory function and behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory neurons are key to neural circuit function, but how these neurons acquire their specific properties is not well understood. Here, we examine this problem, focusing on the roles played by microRNAs (miRNAs). Using <I>Drosophila</I>, we demonstrate that the evolutionarily-conserved miRNA <I>miR-263b</I> controls sensory neuron function allowing the animal to perform an adaptive, elaborate three-dimensional movement. Our work thus shows that microRNAs can control complex motor behaviors by modulating sensory neuron physiology, and suggests that similar miRNA-dependent mechanisms may operate in other species. The work contributes to advance the understanding of the molecular basis of behavior and the biological roles of microRNAs within the nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CDK14 Promotes Axon Regeneration by Regulating the Noncanonical Wnt Signaling Pathway in a Kinase-Independent Manner</a></h4>

              
                <p>The postinjury regenerative capacity of neurons is known to be mediated by a complex interaction of intrinsic regenerative pathways and external cues. In <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, the initiation of axon regeneration is regulated by the nonmuscle myosin light chain-4 (MLC-4) phosphorylation signaling pathway. In this study, we have identified <I>svh-16</I>/<I>cdk-14</I>, a mammalian CDK14 homolog, as a positive regulator of axon regeneration in motor neurons. We then isolated the CDK-14-binding protein MIG-5/Disheveled (Dsh) and found that EGL-20/Wnt and the MIG-1/Frizzled receptor (Fz) are required for efficient axon regeneration. Further, we demonstrate that CDK-14 activates EPHX-1, the <I>C. elegans</I> homolog of the mammalian ephexin Rho-type GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), in a kinase-independent manner. EPHX-1 functions as a GEF for the CDC-42 GTPase, inhibiting myosin phosphatase, which maintains MLC-4 phosphorylation. These results suggest that CDK14 activates the RhoGEF&ndash;CDC42&ndash;MLC phosphorylation axis in a noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway that promotes axon regeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Noncanonical Wnt signaling is mediated by Frizzled receptor (Fz), Disheveled (Dsh), Rho-type GTPase, and nonmuscle myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. This study identified <I>svh-16</I>/<I>cdk-14</I>, which encodes a mammalian CDK14 homolog, as a regulator of axon regeneration in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> motor neurons. We show that CDK-14 binds to MIG-5/Dsh, and that EGL-20/Wnt, MIG-1/Fz, and EPHX-1/RhoGEF are required for axon regeneration. The phosphorylation-mimetic MLC-4 suppressed axon regeneration defects in <I>mig-1</I>, <I>cdk-14</I>, and <I>ephx-1</I> mutants. CDK-14 mediates kinase-independent activation of EPHX-1, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for CDC-42 GTPase. Activated CDC-42 inactivates myosin phosphatase and thereby maintains MLC phosphorylation. Thus, the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway controls axon regeneration via the CDK-14&ndash;EPHX-1&ndash;CDC-42&ndash;MLC phosphorylation axis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">mTOR Signaling Regulates Metabolic Function in Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells and Promotes Efficient Brain Remyelination in the Cuprizone Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>In demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, primary loss of myelin and subsequent neuronal degeneration throughout the CNS impair patient functionality. While the importance of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling during developmental myelination is known, no studies have yet directly examined the function of mTOR signaling specifically in the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage during remyelination. Here, we conditionally deleted <I>Mtor</I> from adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) using <I>Ng2-Cre<sup>ERT</sup></I> in male adult mice to test its function in new OLs responsible for remyelination. During early remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination, mice lacking mTOR in adult OPCs had unchanged OL numbers but thinner myelin. Myelin thickness recovered by late-stage repair, suggesting a delay in myelin production when <I>Mtor</I> is deleted from adult OPCs. Surprisingly, loss of mTOR in OPCs had no effect on efficiency of remyelination after lysophosphatidylcholine lesions in either the spinal cord or corpus callosum, suggesting that mTOR signaling functions specifically in a pathway dysregulated by cuprizone to promote remyelination efficiency. We further determined that cuprizone and inhibition of mTOR cooperatively compromise metabolic function in primary rat OLs undergoing differentiation. Together, our results support the conclusion that mTOR signaling in OPCs is required to overcome the metabolic dysfunction in the cuprizone-demyelinated adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Impaired remyelination by oligodendrocytes contributes to the progressive pathology in multiple sclerosis, so it is critical to identify mechanisms of improving remyelination. The goal of this study was to examine mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in remyelination. Here, we provide evidence that mTOR signaling promotes efficient remyelination of the brain after cuprizone-mediated demyelination but has no effect on remyelination after lysophosphatidylcholine demyelination in the spinal cord or brain. We also present novel data revealing that mTOR inhibition and cuprizone treatment additively affect the metabolic profile of differentiating oligodendrocytes, supporting a mechanism for the observed remyelination delay. These data suggest that altered metabolic function may underlie failure of remyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions and that mTOR signaling may be of therapeutic potential for promoting remyelination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decapentaplegic Acutely Defines the Connectivity of Central Pacemaker Neurons in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rhythmic rest-activity cycles are controlled by an endogenous clock. In <I>Drosophila</I>, this clock resides in ~150 neurons organized in clusters whose hierarchy changes in response to environmental conditions. The concerted activity of the circadian network is necessary for the adaptive responses to synchronizing environmental stimuli. Thus far, work was devoted to unravel the logic of the coordination of different clusters focusing on neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. We further explored communication in the adult male brain through ligands belonging to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. Herein we show that the lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) express the small morphogen decapentaplegic (DPP). DPP expression in the large LNvs triggered a period lengthening phenotype, the downregulation of which caused reduced rhythmicity and affected anticipation at dawn and dusk, underscoring DPP per se conveys time-of-day relevant information. Surprisingly, DPP expression in the large LNvs impaired circadian remodeling of the small LNv axonal terminals, likely through local modulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio. These findings open the provocative possibility that the BMP pathway is recruited to strengthen/reduce the connectivity among specific clusters along the day and thus modulate the contribution of the clusters to the circadian network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The circadian clock relies on the communication between groups of so-called clock neurons to coordinate physiology and behavior to the optimal times across the day, predicting and adapting to a changing environment. The circadian network relies on neurotransmitters and neuropeptides to fine-tune connectivity among clock neurons and thus give rise to a coherent output. Herein we show that decapentaplegic, a ligand belonging to the BMP retrograde signaling pathway required for coordinated growth during development, is recruited by a group of circadian neurons in the adult brain to trigger structural remodeling of terminals on a daily basis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Inner Hemispheric and Interhemispheric Connectivity Balance in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>The connectome of the brain has a great impact on the function of the brain as the structure of the connectome affects the speed and efficiency of information transfer. As a highly energy-consuming organ, an efficient network structure is essential. A previous study has shown consistent overall brain connectivity across a large variety of species. This connectivity conservation was explained by a balance between interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connections; that is, spices with highly connected hemispheres appear to have weaker interhemisphere connections. This study examines this connectivity trade-off in the human brain using diffusion-based tractography and network analysis in the Human Connectome Project (970 subjects, 527 female). We explore the biological origins of this phenomenon, heritability, and the effect on cognitive measures.</p>
<p>The proportion of commissural fibers in the brain had a negative correlation to hemispheric efficiency, pointing to a trade-off between inner hemispheric and interhemispheric connectivity. Network hubs including anterior and middle cingulate cortex, superior frontal areas, medial occipital areas, the parahippocampal gyrus, post- and precentral gyri, and the precuneus had the strongest contribution to this phenomenon. Other results show a high heritability as well as a strong connection to crystalized intelligence. This work presents cohort-based network analysis research, spanning a large variety of samples and exploring the overall architecture of the human connectome. Our results show a connectivity conservation phenomenon at the base of the overall brain network architecture. This network structure may explain much of the functional, behavioral, and cognitive variability among different brains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The network structure of the brain is at the basis of every brain function as it dictates the characteristics of information transfer. Understanding the patterns and mechanisms that guide the connectome structure is crucial to understanding the brain itself. Here we unravel the mechanism at the base of the connectivity conservation phenomenon by exploring the interaction between hemispheric and commissural connectivity in a large-scale cohort-based connectivity study. We describe the trade-off between the two components and examine the origins of the trade-off and observe the effect on cognitive abilities and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ultra-High-Field Neuroimaging Reveals Fine-Scale Processing for 3D Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Binocular disparity provides critical information about three-dimensional (3D) structures to support perception and action. In the past decade significant progress has been made in uncovering human brain areas engaged in the processing of binocular disparity signals. Yet, the fine-scale brain processing underlying 3D perception remains unknown. Here, we use ultra-high-field (7T) functional imaging at submillimeter resolution to examine fine-scale BOLD fMRI signals involved in 3D perception. In particular, we sought to interrogate the local circuitry involved in disparity processing by sampling fMRI responses at different positions relative to the cortical surface (i.e., across cortical depths corresponding to layers). We tested for representations related to 3D perception by presenting participants (male and female, <I>N</I> = 8) with stimuli that enable stable stereoscopic perception [i.e., correlated random dot stereograms (RDS)] versus those that do not (i.e., anticorrelated RDS). Using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we demonstrate cortical depth-specific representations in areas V3A and V7 as indicated by stronger pattern responses for correlated than for anticorrelated stimuli in upper rather than deeper layers. Examining informational connectivity, we find higher feedforward layer-to-layer connectivity for correlated than anticorrelated stimuli between V3A and V7. Further, we observe disparity-specific feedback from V3A to V1 and from V7 to V3A. Our findings provide evidence for the role of V3A as a key nexus for disparity processing, which is implicated in feedforward and feedback signals related to the perceptual estimation of 3D structures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Binocular vision plays a significant role in supporting our interactions with the surrounding environment. The fine-scale neural mechanisms that underlie the brain's skill in extracting 3D structures from binocular signals are poorly understood. Here, we capitalize on recent advances in ultra-high-field functional imaging to interrogate human brain circuits involved in 3D perception at submillimeter resolution. We provide evidence for the role of area V3A as a key nexus for disparity processing, which is implicated in feedforward and feedback signals related to the perceptual estimation of 3D structures from binocular signals. These fine-scale measurements help bridge the gap between animal neurophysiology and human fMRI studies investigating cross-scale circuits, from micro circuits to global brain networks for 3D perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual and Semantic Representations at Encoding Contribute to True and False Recognition of Objects</a></h4>

              
                <p>When encoding new episodic memories, visual and semantic processing is proposed to make distinct contributions to accurate memory and memory distortions. Here, we used fMRI and preregistered representational similarity analysis to uncover the representations that predict true and false recognition of unfamiliar objects. Two semantic models captured coarse-grained taxonomic categories and specific object features, respectively, while two perceptual models embodied low-level visual properties. Twenty-eight female and male participants encoded images of objects during fMRI scanning, and later had to discriminate studied objects from similar lures and novel objects in a recognition memory test. Both perceptual and semantic models predicted true memory. When studied objects were later identified correctly, neural patterns corresponded to low-level visual representations of these object images in the early visual cortex, lingual, and fusiform gyri. In a similar fashion, alignment of neural patterns with fine-grained semantic feature representations in the fusiform gyrus also predicted true recognition. However, emphasis on coarser taxonomic representations predicted forgetting more anteriorly in the anterior ventral temporal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and, in an exploratory analysis, left perirhinal cortex. In contrast, false recognition of similar lure objects was associated with weaker visual analysis posteriorly in early visual and left occipitotemporal cortex. The results implicate multiple perceptual and semantic representations in successful memory encoding and suggest that fine-grained semantic as well as visual analysis contributes to accurate later recognition, while processing visual image detail is critical for avoiding false recognition errors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People are able to store detailed memories of many similar objects. We offer new insights into the encoding of these specific memories by combining fMRI with explicit models of how image properties and object knowledge are represented in the brain. When people processed fine-grained visual properties in occipital and posterior temporal cortex, they were more likely to recognize the objects later and less likely to falsely recognize similar objects. In contrast, while object-specific feature representations in fusiform gyrus predicted accurate memory, coarse-grained categorical representations in frontal and temporal regions predicted forgetting. The data provide the first direct tests of theoretical assumptions about encoding true and false memories, suggesting that semantic representations contribute to specific memories as well as errors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gait-Phase Modulates Alpha and Beta Oscillations in the Pedunculopontine Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is a reticular collection of neurons at the junction of the midbrain and pons, playing an important role in modulating posture and locomotion. Deep brain stimulation of the PPN has been proposed as an emerging treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) who have gait-related atypical parkinsonian syndromes. In this study, we investigated PPN activities during gait to better understand its functional role in locomotion. Specifically, we investigated whether PPN activity is rhythmically modulated by gait cycles during locomotion. PPN local field potential (LFP) activities were recorded from PD or MSA patients with gait difficulties during stepping in place or free walking. Simultaneous measurements from force plates or accelerometers were used to determine the phase within each gait cycle at each time point. Our results showed that activities in the alpha and beta frequency bands in the PPN LFPs were rhythmically modulated by the gait phase within gait cycles, with a higher modulation index when the stepping rhythm was more regular. Meanwhile, the PPN&ndash;cortical coherence was most prominent in the alpha band. Both gait phase-related modulation in the alpha/beta power and the PPN&ndash;cortical coherence in the alpha frequency band were spatially specific to the PPN and did not extend to surrounding regions. These results suggest that alternating PPN modulation may support gait control. Whether enhancing alternating PPN modulation by stimulating in an alternating fashion could positively affect gait control remains to be tested.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The therapeutic efficacy of pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) and the extent to which it can improve quality of life are still inconclusive. Understanding how PPN activity is modulated by stepping or walking may offer insight into how to improve the efficacy of PPN DBS in ameliorating gait difficulties. Our study shows that PPN alpha and beta activity was modulated by the gait phase, and that this was most pronounced when the stepping rhythm was regular. It remains to be tested whether enhancing alternating PPN modulation by stimulating in an alternating fashion could positively affect gait control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Medial Frontal Cortex Activity Predicts Information Sampling in Economic Choice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Decision-making not only requires agents to decide what to choose but also how much information to sample before committing to a choice. Previously established frameworks for economic choice argue for a deliberative process of evidence accumulation across time. These tacitly acknowledge a role of information sampling in that decisions are only made once sufficient evidence is acquired, yet few experiments have explicitly placed information sampling under the participant's control. Here, we use fMRI to investigate the neural basis of information sampling in economic choice by allowing participants (<I>n</I> = 30, sex not recorded) to actively sample information in a multistep decision task. We show that medial frontal cortex (MFC) activity is predictive of further information sampling before choice. Choice difficulty (inverse value difference, keeping sensory difficulty constant) was also encoded in MFC, but this effect was explained away by the inclusion of information sampling as a coregressor in the general linear model. A distributed network of regions across the prefrontal cortex encoded key features of the sampled information at the time it was presented. We propose that MFC is an important controller of the extent to which information is gathered before committing to an economic choice. This role may explain why MFC activity has been associated with evidence accumulation in previous studies in which information sampling was an implicit rather than explicit feature of the decision.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The decisions we make are determined by the information we have sampled before committing to a choice. Accumulator frameworks of decision-making tacitly acknowledge the need to sample further information during the evidence accumulation process until a decision boundary is reached. However, relatively few studies explicitly place this decision to sample further information under the participant's control. In this fMRI study, we find that MFC activity is related to information sampling decisions in a multistep economic choice task. This suggests that an important role of evidence representations within MFC may be to guide adaptive sequential decisions to sample further information before committing to a final decision.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">PI3K{gamma}/AKT Signaling in High Molecular Weight Hyaluronan (HMWH)-Induced Anti-Hyperalgesia and Reversal of Nociceptor Sensitization</a></h4>

              
                <p>High molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWH), a well-established treatment for osteoarthritis pain, is anti-hyperalgesic in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. HMWH-induced anti-hyperalgesia is mediated by its action at cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), the cognate hyaluronan receptor, which can signal via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a large family of kinases involved in diverse cell functions. We demonstrate that intrathecal administration of an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) antisense to mRNA for PI3K (a Class I PI3K isoform) expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), and intradermal administration of a PI3K-selective inhibitor (AS605240), markedly attenuates HMWH-induced anti-prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB> (PGE<SUB>2</SUB>) hyperalgesia, in male and female rats. Intradermal administration of inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; rapamycin) and protein kinase B (AKT; AKT Inhibitor IV), signaling molecules downstream of PI3K, also attenuates HMWH-induced anti-hyperalgesia. <I>In vitro</I> patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments on cultured nociceptors from male rats demonstrate that some HMWH-induced changes in generation of action potentials (APs) in nociceptors sensitized by PGE<SUB>2</SUB> are PI3K dependent (reduction in AP firing rate, increase in latency to first AP and increase in slope of current ramp required to induce AP) and some are PI3K independent [reduction in recovery rate of AP afterhyperpolarization (AHP)]. Our demonstration of a role of PI3K in HMWH-induced anti-hyperalgesia and reversal of nociceptor sensitization opens a novel line of research into molecular targets for the treatment of diverse pain syndromes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We have previously demonstrated that high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWH) attenuates inflammatory hyperalgesia, an effect mediated by its action at cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), the cognate hyaluronan receptor, and activation of its downstream signaling pathway, in nociceptors. In the present study, we demonstrate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and downstream signaling pathway, protein kinase B (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), are crucial for HMWH to induce anti-hyperalgesia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Asymmetric Frequency-Specific Feedforward and Feedback Information Flow between Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex during Verbal Memory Encoding and Recall</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits are thought to play a prominent role in human episodic memory, but the precise nature, and electrophysiological basis, of directed information flow between these regions and their role in verbal memory formation has remained elusive. Here we investigate nonlinear causal interactions between hippocampus and lateral PFC using intracranial EEG recordings (26 participants, 16 females) during verbal memory encoding and recall tasks. Direction-specific information theoretic analysis revealed higher causal information flow from the hippocampus to PFC than in the reverse direction. Crucially, this pattern was observed during both memory encoding and recall, and the strength of causal interactions was significantly greater during memory task performance than resting baseline. Further analyses revealed frequency specificity of interactions with greater causal information flow from hippocampus to the PFC in the delta-theta frequency band (0.5-8 Hz); in contrast, PFC to hippocampus causal information flow were stronger in the beta band (12-30 Hz). Across all hippocampus-PFC electrode pairs, propagation delay between the source and target signals was estimated to be 17.7 ms, which is physiologically meaningful and corresponds to directional signal interactions on a timescale consistent with monosynaptic influence. Our findings identify distinct asymmetric feedforward and feedback signaling mechanisms between the hippocampus and PFC and their dissociable roles in memory recall, demonstrate that these regions preferentially use different frequency channels, and provide novel insights into the electrophysiological basis of directed information flow during episodic memory formation in the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal-PFC circuits play a critical role in episodic memory in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. Investigations using noninvasive fMRI techniques have provided insights into coactivation of the hippocampus and PFC during memory formation; however, the electrophysiological basis of dynamic causal hippocampal-PFC interactions in the human brain is poorly understood. Here, we use data from a large cohort of intracranial EEG recordings to investigate the neurophysiological underpinnings of asymmetric feedforward and feedback hippocampal-PFC interactions and their nonlinear causal dynamics during both episodic memory encoding and recall. Our findings provide novel insights into the electrophysiological basis of directed bottom-up and top-down information flow during episodic memory formation in the human brain.</p>

                <p>Microglia are resident myeloid cells of the CNS. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has enabled description of a disease-associated microglia (DAM) with a role in neurodegeneration and demyelination. In this study, we use scRNAseq to investigate the temporal dynamics of immune cells harvested from the epicenter of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) induced in female mice. We find that as a consequence of SCI, baseline microglia undergo permanent transcriptional reprogramming into a previously uncharacterized subtype of microglia with striking similarities to previously reported DAM as well as a distinct microglial state found during development. Using a microglia depletion model we showed that DAM in SCI are derived from baseline microglia and strongly enhance recovery of hindlimb locomotor function following injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although disease-associated microglia (DAM) have been the subject of strong research interest during recent years (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B14">Keren-Shaul, 2017</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B13">Jord&atilde;o, 2019</cross-ref>), their cellular origin and their role in "normal" acute injury processes is not well understood. Our work directly addresses the origin and the role of DAM in traumatic injury response. Further, we use a microglia depletion model to prove that DAM in spinal cord injury (SCI) are indeed derived from homeostatic microglia, and that they strongly enhance recovery. Thus, in this work we significantly expand the knowledge of immune response to traumatic injury, demonstrate the applicability to human injury via our unique access to injured human spinal cord tissue, and provide the community with a comprehensive dataset for further exploration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling mode I failure at crack tip with verifications using digital image correlation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) applies to sharp cracks, although crack sites such as holes and slots are often blunt cracks with nonzero widths. The advancement in finite element method (FEM) has enabled the calculation of stress intensity factor (SIF) for unstable crack growth prediction, regardless of crack shape and size, but the calculations often differ from contour to contour. Hence, the purpose of this work is to determine if SIFs computed using commercial FEM have experimentally verifiable advantages over the traditional stress-based modelling approaches in predicting Mode I brittle failure at blunt crack tip. Methods: Experiments and simulations were conducted on brittle Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) plastic to compare the actual and predicted strain fields and SIFs at crack tip, and the critical force at which unstable crack growth initiates. A centrally straight cracked Brazilian disc made of PMMA was subjected to purely Mode I fracture. Its strain fields were measured from deformed speckle patterns using digital image correlation software. The same disc was modelled using plane stress model in FEM. By applying the critical force, SIFs were then computed using ANSYS pre-meshed crack method at different contours away from the crack tip. The effects of element type, mesh size and crack width on the simulated SIFs were investigated. Results: It was found that the experimental critical load agreed well with LEFM prediction based on PMMA fracture toughness in published literature. Disc failure happened at the first sign of tensile yield at the crack tip in the finite element model with a triangle mesh. Digital image correlation clearly shows the occurrence of unstable crack growth at critical force. It also shows comparable far field strain responses to the FEM model. Conclusions: The computed SIFs were inconsistent, and their usefulness in predicting unstable crack growth requires further investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comprehensive analysis of lectin-glycan interactions reveals determinants of lectin specificity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel E. Mattox, Chris Bailey-Kellogg</p>

Lectin-glycan interactions facilitate inter- and intracellular communication in many processes including protein trafficking, host-pathogen recognition, and tumorigenesis promotion. Specific recognition of glycans by lectins is also the basis for a wide range of applications in areas including glycobiology research, cancer screening, and antiviral therapeutics. To provide a better understanding of the determinants of lectin-glycan interaction specificity and support such applications, this study comprehensively investigates specificity-conferring features of all available lectin-glycan complex structures. Systematic characterization, comparison, and predictive modeling of a set of 221 complementary physicochemical and geometric features representing these interactions highlighted specificity-conferring features with potential mechanistic insight. Univariable comparative analyses with weighted Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests revealed strong statistical associations between binding site features and specificity that are conserved across unrelated lectin binding sites. Multivariable modeling with random forests demonstrated the utility of these features for predicting the identity of bound glycans based on generalized patterns learned from non-homologous lectins. These analyses revealed <i>global</i> determinants of lectin specificity, such as sialic acid glycan recognition in deep, concave binding sites enriched for positively charged residues, in contrast to high mannose glycan recognition in fairly shallow but well-defined pockets enriched for non-polar residues. Focused <i>fine specificity</i> analysis of hemagglutinin interactions with human-like and avian-like glycans uncovered features representing both known and novel mutations related to shifts in influenza tropism from avian to human tissues. As the approach presented here relies on co-crystallized lectin-glycan pairs for studying specificity, it is limited in its inferences by the quantity, quality, and diversity of the structural data available. Regardless, the systematic characterization of lectin binding sites presented here provides a novel approach to studying lectin specificity and is a step towards confidently predicting new lectin-glycan interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A metric for evaluating biological information in gene sets and its application to identify co-expressed gene clusters in PBMC</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason Bennett, Mikhail Pomaznoy, Akul Singhania, Bjoern Peters</p>

Recent technological advances have made the gathering of comprehensive gene expression datasets a commodity. This has shifted the limiting step of transcriptomic studies from the accumulation of data to their analyses and interpretation. The main problem in analyzing transcriptomics data is that the number of independent samples is typically much lower (<100) than the number of genes whose expression is quantified (typically >14,000). To address this, it would be desirable to reduce the gathered data’s dimensionality without losing information. Clustering genes into discrete modules is one of the most commonly used tools to accomplish this task. While there are multiple clustering approaches, there is a lack of informative metrics available to evaluate the resultant clusters’ biological quality. Here we present a metric that incorporates known ground truth gene sets to quantify gene clusters’ biological quality derived from standard clustering techniques. The GECO (Ground truth Evaluation of Clustering Outcomes) metric demonstrates that quantitative and repeatable scoring of gene clusters is not only possible but computationally lightweight and robust. Unlike current methods, it allows direct comparison between gene clusters generated by different clustering techniques. It also reveals that current cluster analysis techniques often underestimate the number of clusters that should be formed from a dataset, which leads to fewer clusters of lower quality. As a test case, we applied GECO combined with k-means clustering to derive an optimal set of co-expressed gene modules derived from PBMC, which we show to be superior to previously generated modules generated on whole-blood. Overall, GECO provides a rational metric to test and compare different clustering approaches to analyze high-dimensional transcriptomic data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Molecular mechanism of proton-coupled ligand translocation by the bacterial efflux pump EmrE</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jakub Jurasz, Maciej Bagiński, Jacek Czub, Miłosz Wieczór</p>

The current surge in bacterial multi-drug resistance (MDR) is one of the largest challenges to public health, threatening to render ineffective many therapies we rely on for treatment of serious infections. Understanding different factors that contribute to MDR is hence crucial from the global “one health” perspective. In this contribution, we focus on the prototypical broad-selectivity proton-coupled antiporter EmrE, one of the smallest known ligand transporters that confers resistance to aromatic cations in a number of clinically relevant species. As an asymmetric homodimer undergoing an “alternating access” protomer-swap conformational change, it serves as a model for the mechanistic understanding of more complex drug transporters. Here, we present a free energy and solvent accessibility analysis that indicates the presence of two complementary ligand translocation pathways that remain operative in a broad range of conditions. Our simulations show a previously undescribed desolvated apo state and anticorrelated accessibility in the ligand-bound state, explaining on a structural level why EmrE does not disrupt the pH gradient through futile proton transfer. By comparing the behavior of a number of model charged and/or aromatic ligands, we also explain the origin of selectivity of EmrE towards a broad class of aromatic cations. Finally, we explore unbiased pathways of ligand entry and exit to identify correlated structural changes implicated in ligand binding and release, as well as characterize key intermediates of occupancy changes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sarc-Graph: Automated segmentation, tracking, and analysis of sarcomeres in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bill Zhao, Kehan Zhang, Christopher S. Chen, Emma Lejeune</p>

A better fundamental understanding of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) has the potential to advance applications ranging from drug discovery to cardiac repair. Automated quantitative analysis of beating hiPSC-CMs is an important and fast developing component of the hiPSC-CM research pipeline. Here we introduce “Sarc-Graph,” a computational framework to segment, track, and analyze sarcomeres in fluorescently tagged hiPSC-CMs. Our framework includes functions to segment z-discs and sarcomeres, track z-discs and sarcomeres in beating cells, and perform automated spatiotemporal analysis and data visualization. In addition to reporting good performance for sarcomere segmentation and tracking with little to no parameter tuning and a short runtime, we introduce two novel analysis approaches. First, we construct spatial graphs where z-discs correspond to nodes and sarcomeres correspond to edges. This makes measuring the network distance between each sarcomere (i.e., the number of connecting sarcomeres separating each sarcomere pair) straightforward. Second, we treat tracked and segmented components as fiducial markers and use them to compute the approximate deformation gradient of the entire tracked population. This represents a new quantitative descriptor of hiPSC-CM function. We showcase and validate our approach with both synthetic and experimental movies of beating hiPSC-CMs. By publishing Sarc-Graph, we aim to make automated quantitative analysis of hiPSC-CM behavior more accessible to the broader research community.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Grey-box modeling and hypothesis testing of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based cerebrovascular reactivity to anodal high-definition tDCS in healthy humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yashika Arora, Pushpinder Walia, Mitsuhiro Hayashibe, Makii Muthalib, Shubhajit Roy Chowdhury, Stephane Perrey, Anirban Dutta</p>

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to evoke hemodynamics response; however, the mechanisms have not been investigated systematically using systems biology approaches. Our study presents a grey-box linear model that was developed from a physiologically detailed multi-compartmental neurovascular unit model consisting of the vascular smooth muscle, perivascular space, synaptic space, and astrocyte glial cell. Then, model linearization was performed on the physiologically detailed nonlinear model to find appropriate complexity (Akaike information criterion) to fit functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based measure of blood volume changes, called cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), to high-definition (HD) tDCS. The grey-box linear model was applied on the fNIRS-based CVR during the first 150 seconds of anodal HD-tDCS in eleven healthy humans. The grey-box linear models for each of the four nested pathways starting from tDCS scalp current density that perturbed synaptic potassium released from active neurons for Pathway 1, astrocytic transmembrane current for Pathway 2, perivascular potassium concentration for Pathway 3, and voltage-gated ion channel current on the smooth muscle cell for Pathway 4 were fitted to the total hemoglobin concentration (tHb) changes from optodes in the vicinity of 4x1 HD-tDCS electrodes as well as on the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. We found that the tDCS perturbation Pathway 3 presented the least mean square error (MSE, median <2.5%) and the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC, median -1.726) from the individual grey-box linear model fitting at the targeted-region. Then, minimal realization transfer function with reduced-order approximations of the grey-box model pathways was fitted to the ensemble average tHb time series. Again, Pathway 3 with nine poles and two zeros (all free parameters), provided the best Goodness of Fit of 0.0078 for Chi-Square difference test of nested pathways. Therefore, our study provided a systems biology approach to investigate the initial transient hemodynamic response to tDCS based on fNIRS tHb data. Future studies need to investigate the steady-state responses, including steady-state oscillations found to be driven by calcium dynamics, where transcranial alternating current stimulation may provide frequency-dependent physiological entrainment for system identification. We postulate that such a mechanistic understanding from system identification of the hemodynamics response to transcranial electrical stimulation can facilitate adequate delivery of the current density to the neurovascular tissue under simultaneous portable imaging in various cerebrovascular diseases.

                <p>by Vladimir Smirnov</p>

Multiple sequence alignment tools struggle to keep pace with rapidly growing sequence data, as few methods can handle large datasets while maintaining alignment accuracy. We recently introduced MAGUS, a new state-of-the-art method for aligning large numbers of sequences. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of enhancements that allow MAGUS to align vastly larger datasets with greater speed. We compare MAGUS to other leading alignment methods on datasets of up to one million sequences. Our results demonstrate the advantages of MAGUS over other alignment software in both accuracy and speed. MAGUS is freely available in open-source form at https://github.com/vlasmirnov/MAGUS.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dopamine, sleep, and neuronal excitability modulate amyloid-β–mediated forgetting in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jenifer C. Kaldun, Shahnaz R. Lone, Ana M. Humbert Camps, Cornelia Fritsch, Yves F. Widmer, Jens V. Stein, Seth M. Tomchik, Simon G. Sprecher</p>

Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of the main causes of age-related dementia and neurodegeneration. However, the onset of the disease and the mechanisms causing cognitive defects are not well understood. Aggregation of amyloidogenic peptides is a pathological hallmark of AD and is assumed to be a central component of the molecular disease pathways. Pan-neuronal expression of <i>Aβ</i><sub>42</sub><sup>Arctic</sup> peptides in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> results in learning and memory defects. Surprisingly, targeted expression to the mushroom bodies, a center for olfactory memories in the fly brain, does not interfere with learning but accelerates forgetting. We show here that reducing neuronal excitability either by feeding Levetiracetam or silencing of neurons in the involved circuitry ameliorates the phenotype. Furthermore, inhibition of the Rac-regulated forgetting pathway could rescue the <i>Aβ</i><sub>42</sub><sup>Arctic</sup>-mediated accelerated forgetting phenotype. Similar effects are achieved by increasing sleep, a critical regulator of neuronal homeostasis. Our results provide a functional framework connecting forgetting signaling and sleep, which are critical for regulating neuronal excitability and homeostasis and are therefore a promising mechanism to modulate forgetting caused by toxic <i>Aβ</i> peptides.

                Background: COVID19 vaccine rejection is a global issue that most developing countries face. A study of COVID-19 vaccine preference among Al-Zahraa University female students will pave the way to resolving the issue of vaccine rejection among students. Students' preferences and refusals of the COVID19 vaccine were evaluated to determine the reasons for their decisions.  Methods: This study involved 198 students from Al-Zahraa University for women. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at Al-Zahraa University in Karbala, Iraq, to find out which Health and Medical Technology students preferred the COVID19 vaccine. Tests based on statistics made use of frequency and rate data.  Results: Most students (95%) were over the age of 19. The COVID-19 vaccine was rejected by 138 people (70.4%).  A total of 43 students (28.5%) believed that the COVID19 vaccine may not be completely safe. 49.3% of students were not aware of the differences between the various types of vaccines.  Pfizer was the most preferred by 64 (34.8%), AstraZeneca by 17 (9.2%), and Chinse-Sinovac by only 11 (6%). 20 students (16.4%) believed that with the vaccine they could return to life as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Covid-19 vaccine acceptance among Al-Zahara University students may be low in part because of myths, and partly because of the fear of side-effects associated with the vaccine.  Conclusion:  Information about COVID-19 vaccines should be transparently communicated to the media by health authorities to help the public make informed decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Culling and mortality of dairy cows: why it happens and how it can be mitigated [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The United Nations estimates that the global population will total 9.7 billion in 2050. Rapid population growth pose a significant obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly eradicating hunger and poverty. In view of the expanding population growth, food production ideally should triple to prevent massive food shortages. Sustainable food and nutrition security is the focal point of the dairy industry. Dairy production plays a pivotal role in addressing and advancing global food and nutrition security. It serves as a major source of protein, calcium, and phosphorus in many families in developing countries with a fast-growing population. Consequently, the dairy industry is expected to grow by approximately 26% in the next 10 years and produce an estimated 1077 million tonnes of milk by 2050. However, the growth and distribution of the dairy industry is limited by many factors such as culling and mortality of dairy cows. Several studies highlight reproduction failures, old age, poor milk yield, diseases (mastitis, lameness, and dystocia), and heat stress as some reasons for culling of dairy cows. Hence, this review highlights the factors influencing culling and mortality in dairy production farms, and discusses mitigating measures to limit culling.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improvement of Cardiac Fibrosis Biomarkers through Inflammation Inhibition by Green Tea and Decaffeinated Light Roasted Green Coffee Extract Combination Administration in Metabolic Syndrome Rat Model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metabolic syndrome is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Green tea and green coffee extracts, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents may participate in metabolic syndrome-induced cardiac fibrosis alleviation. However, the effect of combination of those extracts still needs exploration. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of green tea and decaffeinated light roasted green coffee extracts and their combination in metabolic syndrome-induced cardiac fibrosis rats. Methods: Metabolic syndrome rat model was i1nduced through high-fat high sucrose diets feeding for 8 weeks and injection of low dose streptozotocin at the 2nd week. The metabolic syndrome rats were divided into 4 experimental groups metabolic syndrome rats (MS); metabolic syndrome rats treated with 300 mg/ kg b.w green tea extract (GT); metabolic syndrome rats treated with 200 mg/ kg b.w decaffeinated light roasted green coffee extract (GC); metabolic syndrome rats treated with the combination of the two extracts (CE); and a normal control (NC) group was added. Angiotensin 2 level was analyzed by ELISA method. Gene expression of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, Tgf-β1, Rac-1, and α-sma were analyzed by touchdown polymerase chain reaction methods. Results: Metabolic syndrome rats treated with green tea and decaffeinated light roasted green coffee significantly decreased angiotensin-2 serum level and cardiac inflammation and fibrosis gene expression level (NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, Tgf-β1, Rac-1, and α-sma). More significant alleviation was observed in the combination group. Conclusion: This study suggested that combination of green tea and decaffeinated light roasted green coffee extracts showed better improvement in metabolic syndrome-induced cardiac fibrosis rat model compared to that of single extract administration through inflammation inhibition

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Developmental refinement of visual callosal inputs to ferret area 17</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corticocortical connections link visual cortical areas in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. We studied the postnatal refinement of callosal connections linking multiple cortical areas with ferret area 17 during the period from just before eye opening (4 weeks) to 10 weeks of age. We aimed to determine (a) whether callosal projections from multiple visual cortical areas to area 17 refine with a similar rate and (b) whether the refinement of callosal projections parallels that of intrahemispheric cortical circuits. We injected the bidirectional tracer CTb into area 17, and mapped the areal and laminar distribution of labeled cells in visual areas of the contralateral hemisphere. Like intrahemispheric projections, callosal inputs to area 17 before eye opening are dominated by Suprasylvian area Ssy (with lesser and comparable input from areas 17, 18, 19, and 21), but within two weeks of eye opening are jointly dominated by area 18 Ssy inputs; however, there are fewer labeled cells in the contralateral hemisphere. Unlike intrahemispheric projections, there is no laminar reorganization of callosal inputs; in all visual areas and at all ages studied the greatest proportion of callosal projections arises from the infragranular layers. Also unlike intrahemispheric projections, the peak density of callosal cells in each area projecting to area 17 declines more modestly. These results reveal important similarities and differences in the postnatal reorganization of inter- and intrahemispheric projections to area 17.</p>

                Neuron traditionally publishes a themed collection of reviews to coincide with the Society for Neuroscience’s (SfN) annual meeting. When we were brainstorming potential topics in the spring of 2021, with COVID-19 vaccinations rolling out in many parts of the world offering hope for safely seeing colleagues and friends in person, we envisioned a celebratory reunion at SfN in the fall. We wished to symbolically mark the event with a “Welcome back!” collection, even for those not attending SfN in person.
