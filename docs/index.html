              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19853">Impact of Hill coefficient and time delay on a perceptual decision-making model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a neural mass perceptual decision making model introduced by Piska{\l}a et al. is analyzed. The model describes activity of two neuron populations influenced by each other and external inputs. The groups' activities correspond to the process of making a perceptual binary decision. Existing results are generalized by investigating the impact of both a delay in self-inhibition and a generic Hill coefficient on solutions to the system of differential equations. Several versions of the model with various assumptions are compared using analytical and numerical methods.

                arXiv:2506.20164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological advances in the past decades have begun to enable neuroscientists to address fundamental questions about consciousness in an unprecedented way. Here we review remarkable recent progress in our understanding of cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing in the brain. Of particular interest are the cortical pyramidal neurons -- or "psychic cells" called by Ram\'on y Cajal more than 100 years ago -- which have an intriguing cellular mechanism that accounts for selective disruption of feedback signaling in the brain upon anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness. Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the dendrites of pyramidal cells are highlighted as the key cellular mechanism. After all, Cajal's instinct over a century ago may turn out to be correct -- we may have just begun to understand whether and how psychic cells indeed generate and control our consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20233">Identifying multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley models with high-density extracellular voltage recordings</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley models are biophysical models of how electrical signals propagate throughout a neuron, and they form the basis of our knowledge of neural computation at the cellular level. However, these models have many free parameters that must be estimated for each cell, and existing fitting methods rely on intracellular voltage measurements that are highly challenging to obtain in vivo. Recent advances in neural recording technology with high-density probes and arrays enable dense sampling of extracellular voltage from many sites surrounding a neuron, allowing indirect measurement of many compartments of a cell simultaneously. Here, we propose a method for inferring the underlying membrane voltage, biophysical parameters, and the neuron's position relative to the probe, using extracellular measurements alone. We use an Extended Kalman Filter to infer membrane voltage and channel states using efficient, differentiable simulators. Then, we learn the model parameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood using gradient-based methods. We demonstrate the performance of this approach using simulated data and real neuron morphologies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20489">Brains and language models converge on a shared conceptual space across different languages</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human languages differ widely in their forms, each having distinct sounds, scripts, and syntax. Yet, they can all convey similar meaning. Do different languages converge on a shared neural substrate for conceptual meaning? We used language models (LMs) and naturalistic fMRI to identify neural representations of the shared conceptual meaning of the same story as heard by native speakers of three languages: English, Chinese, and French. We found that LMs trained on entirely different languages converge onto a similar embedding space, especially in the middle layers. We then aimed to find if a similar shared space exists in the brains of different native speakers of the three languages. We trained voxelwise encoding models that align the LM embeddings with neural responses from one group of subjects speaking a single language. We then used the encoding models trained on one language to predict the neural activity in listeners of other languages. We found that models trained to predict neural activity for one language generalize to different subjects listening to the same content in a different language, across high-level language and default-mode regions. Our results suggest that the neural representations of meaning underlying different languages are shared across speakers of various languages, and that LMs trained on different languages converge on this shared meaning. These findings suggest that, despite the diversity of languages, shared meaning emerges from our interactions with one another and our shared world.

                arXiv:2506.20504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI, it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric (persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.

Abstract: Now published in Nature Human Behavior doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02252-z
  Human vision is mediated by a complex interconnected network of cortical brain areas that jointly represent visual information. While these areas are increasingly understood in isolation, their representational relationships remain elusive. Here we developed relational neural control (RNC), and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate fMRI responses of areas across visual cortex. Through RNC we generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. This revealed a typical network-level configuration of representational relationships in which shared or unique representational content varied based on cortical distance, categorical selectivity, and position within the visual hierarchy. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.

                arXiv:2505.05497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cognition has made it possible to model human cognitive processes very effectively, revealing numerous parallels between the properties of conceptual entities tested by the human mind and those of microscopic entities tested by measurement apparatuses. The success of quantum cognition has also made it possible to formulate an interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the conceptuality interpretation, which ascribes to quantum entities a conceptual nature similar to that of human concepts. The present work fits into these lines of research by analyzing a cognitive version of single, double, and triple-slit experiments. The data clearly show the formation of the typical interference fringes between the slits as well as the embryos of secondary fringes. Our analysis also shows that while quantum entities and human concepts may share a same conceptual nature, the way they manifest it in specific contexts can be quite different. This is also evident from the significant deviation from zero observed for the Sorkin parameter, indicating the presence of strong irreducible third-order interference contributions in human decision.

                arXiv:2506.13615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization. Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 64-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19964">Higher-Order Neuromorphic Ising Machines -- Autoencoders and Fowler-Nordheim Annealers are all you need for Scalability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.19964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a higher-order neuromorphic Ising machine that exhibits superior scalability compared to architectures based on quadratization, while also achieving state-of-the-art quality and reliability in solutions with competitive time-to-solution metrics. At the core of the proposed machine is an asynchronous autoencoder architecture that captures higher-order interactions by directly manipulating Ising clauses instead of Ising spins, thereby maintaining resource complexity independent of interaction order. Asymptotic convergence to the Ising ground state is ensured by sampling the autoencoder latent space defined by the spins, based on the annealing dynamics of the Fowler-Nordheim quantum mechanical tunneling. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed higher-order neuromorphic Ising machine, we systematically solved benchmark combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT and MAX-SAT, comparing the results to those obtained using a second-order Ising machine employing the same annealing process. Our findings indicate that the proposed architecture consistently provides higher quality solutions in shorter time frames compared to the second-order model across multiple runs. Additionally, we show that the techniques based on the sparsity of the interconnection matrix, such as graph coloring, can be effectively applied to higher-order neuromorphic Ising machines, enhancing the solution quality and the time-to-solution. The time-to-solution can be further improved through hardware co-design, as demonstrated in this paper using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The results presented in this paper provide further evidence that autoencoders and Fowler-Nordheim annealers are sufficient to achieve reliability and scaling of any-order neuromorphic Ising machines.

                arXiv:2506.20469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often incorporate multi-branch connections, enabling multi-scale feature extraction and enhancing the capture of diverse features. This design improves network capacity and generalisation to unseen data. However, training such DNNs can be computationally expensive. The challenge is further exacerbated by the complexity of identifying optimal network architectures. To address this, we leverage Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to automatically discover high-performing architectures, a process commonly known as neuroevolution. We introduce a novel approach based on Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) to encode multi-branch (MB) connections within DNNs, referred to as NeuroLGP-MB. To efficiently design the DNNs, we use surrogate-assisted EAs. While their application in simple artificial neural networks has been influential, we scale their use from dozens or hundreds of sample points to thousands, aligning with the demands of complex DNNs by incorporating a semantic-based approach in our surrogate-assisted EA. Furthermore, we introduce a more advanced surrogate model that outperforms baseline, computationally expensive, and simpler surrogate models.

                arXiv:2506.20015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and total energy consumption during inference and communication.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335">Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this through a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations, along with a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.

Abstract: Scaffolding Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-agent systems often improves performance on complex tasks, but the safety impact of such scaffolds has not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds. We evaluate discovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In 'blue' mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores. In 'red' mode, we find adversarially weak scaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work demonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/J-Rosser-UK/AgentBreeder.

">Neural correlates of evidence accumulation in social-affective decision-making under perceptual ambiguity</a></h4>

              
                Evidence accumulation models have been successfully applied to decision-making in sensory and cognitive domains; however, it remains unclear how this process is regulated when perceptual ambiguity arises from social-affective content. Here, we integrate computational modeling with multimodal neuroscience to characterize how perceptual ambiguity in emotion judgment shapes decision dynamics. Participants viewed perceptually ambiguous stimuli, morphed images of two categories, such as happy and fearful facial expression, and made binary categorization decisions. Using drift diffusion modeling (DDM), we first demonstrate that drift rate, a key index of evidence accumulation, decreases as perceptual ambiguity increases. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) data reveal that the magnitude of the late positive potential (LPP) tracks the speed of evidence accumulation in both emotional and non-emotional stimulus categories, but only when the ambiguous dimension is relevant to the categorization decision. Similar to LPP magnitude, single unit recordings from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and amygdala show that neuronal firing rates in the two regions also encode drift rate. Moreover, fMRI-based functional connectivity reveals that the strength of connectivity between the amygdala and dmPFC correlates with individual differences in drift rate. To establish the causal role of the dmPFC, we applied anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the dmPFC in patients with schizophrenia and found that stimulation enhanced evidence accumulation speed in emotion categorization under perceptual ambiguity. These findings identify a distributed corticolimbic circuit that dynamically modulates evidence accumulation during social-affective decision-making under perceptual ambiguity. Our results bridge social-affective and perceptual neuroscience, offering a translational framework for understanding emotion recognition and decision-making impairments.

">Anterior cingulate folding pattern is altered in autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging research has identified focal differences in the cerebral cortex of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), particularly in the cortical folds (sulci) within higher-level association cortices. The present study investigated the sulcal patterning and morphology of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in individuals with ASD compared to neurotypical (NT) individuals for the first time. We used neuroimaging data from 50 NT and 50 ASD participants. All participants were under 20 years old and male. The two groups were age-matched. Using established criteria and cortical reconstructions generated from each participant's T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans with FreeSurfer, we identified the defining sulcal feature of ACC, the variably present paracingulate sulcus (PCGS): its presence in the left and right hemispheres, and asymmetry in PCGS presence between hemispheres. Finally, multiple quantitative morphological features (length, depth, and cortical thickness mean and standard deviation) were extracted from the PCGS using FreeSurfer tools. Analyses revealed that NT participants were more likely to have asymmetrical PCGS patterns than ASD participants (controlling for age and scanner site). However, none of the quantitative morphological features differed between groups. These findings suggest the presence of a variation in the prenatal neurodevelopment of ACC in young males with ASD; however, further research is necessary to uncover the role of this observed difference in the pathogenesis of ASD. The present study also adds to the growing literature implicating variations in PCGS patterning as a trait marker across multiple disorders.

">Gamma - Theta - Spike Coupling Coordinates Sequential Memory in Human MTL</a></h4>

              
                It has been suggested that hierarchical synchronization of theta and gamma oscillations coordinates neural activity during sequence memory. Yet, the role of gamma oscillations and their interaction with theta and single - unit activity (SUA) has not been directly examined in humans. We analysed simultaneous micro wire recordings of SUA (N = 1417 units) and local field potentials (N = 917 channels) from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of epilepsy patients performing a visual multi-item sequence memory task. During encoding, both spiking activity and gamma power contained item - specific information and were temporally coupled. During memory maintenance, stimulus-specific gamma and spiking were structured in brief burst periods during which both signals were tightly synchronized and preferentially aligned to similar theta phases predictive of sequential stimulus position. These findings demonstrate that theta - gamma - spike interactions support a phase - based multiplexed code for sequential memories in the human MTL.

">Misinterpreting electrophysiology in human cognitiveneuroscience</a></h4>

              
                An axiomatic view in contemporary neuroscience is that EEG components such as eventrelated brain potentials (ERPs) and oscillations are directly interpretable as manifestations of biological processes that support sensory, motor, and cognitive constructs of interest. This premise justifies and propels research programs in laboratories worldwide, but with a substantial social and economic cost, warranted by the potential for basic-science discovery and the resulting bench-to-bedside transfer for health and disease. But a different premise would be more fruitful. This article proposes that EEG components in psychophysiological experiments relate to cognition indirectly through their more direct relationship with oculomotor action. The common experimental design that includes a baseline ocular fixation period preceding stimulus presentation provides an excellent template with which to develop the present proposal. Electrophysiological and eye-tracking evidence (3 published and 3 new data sets: 6 experiments, Ntotal = 204, in the context of face and affective picture viewing, reading, listening, rest, and microsleep) demonstrates how and why common conclusions, and reliance on them in clinical practice/treatment efficacy and drug development studies, are at best premature. Results indicate that the oculomotor system plays a mediating role between such EEG phenomena and cognition. Present evidence supports a complementary view of how EEG can shape the development of a broader thought horizon in psychophysiological theory and practice.

However, existing microdrives are often heavy, expensive, fragile, and unsuited for long-term studies with multichannel recordings.

It features a detachable, 16-channel tungsten-wire electrode assembly with a 3&nbsp;mm stroke (15&nbsp;&mu;m step displacement) and an integrated optical fiber. This system enables repeated implantation and explantation without surgery, requiring only gas anesthesia. The OptoDrive has demonstrated stable recordings from the lateral hypothalamus of freely behaving mice for nearly 1&nbsp;month and successful optogenetic silencing of neuronal activity. In conclusion, OptoDrive offers a cost-effective, compact solution for long-term electrophysiology and optogenetics in freely moving mice.</p>

                <p>Marker-based motion capture (MBMC) is a powerful tool for precise, high-speed, three-dimensional tracking of animal movements, enabling detailed study of behaviors ranging from subtle limb trajectories to broad spatial exploration. Despite its proven utility in larger animals, MBMC has remained underutilized in mice due to the difficulty of robust marker attachment during unrestricted behavior. In response to this challenge, markerless tracking methods, facilitated by machine learning, have become the standard in small animal studies due to their simpler experimental setup. However, trajectories obtained with markerless approaches at best approximate ground-truth kinematics, with accuracy strongly dependent on video resolution, training dataset quality, and computational resources for data processing. Here, we overcome the primary limitation of MBMC in mice by implanting minimally invasive markers that remain securely attached over weeks of recordings. This technique produces high-resolution, artifact-free trajectories, eliminating the need for extensive post-processing. We demonstrate the advantages of MBMC by resolving subtle drug-induced kinematic changes that become apparent only within specific behavioral contexts, necessitating precise three-dimensional tracking beyond simple flat-surface locomotion. Furthermore, MBMC uniquely captures the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of harmaline-induced tremors, revealing previously inaccessible correlations between body parts and thus significantly improving the translational value of preclinical tremor models. While markerless tracking remains optimal for many behavioral neuroscience studies in which general posture estimation suffices, MBMC removes barriers to investigations demanding greater precision, reliability, and low-noise trajectories. This capability significantly broadens the scope for inquiry into the neuroscience of movement and related fields.</p>

                <p>When a cue is located away from its associated reward, some animals will learn to approach the site of reward (goal-tracking behavior) while others will approach the cue (sign-tracking behavior). The acquisition of sign tracking, but not goal tracking, is dependent on dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and we have previously demonstrated that reward-evoked activity in the NAc core may reflect different patterns of dopamine release in sign tracker versus goal tracker individuals. However, a causal relationship among dopamine release, NAc activity, and sign tracking has not been established. Using male and female TH::Cre rats, we expressed inhibitory or excitatory opsins in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and examined the impact of optical manipulation of dopamine neurons on behavior and concurrent NAc neuronal activity. We found that inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons at the time of reward suppressed the acquisition of sign-tracking, but not goal-tracking, behavior. On the other hand, stimulation of dopamine neurons did not alter the acquisition of sign tracking; however, cessation of stimulation impeded further acquisition of sign tracking. Finally, both inhibition and stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons rapidly modulated activity in a subset of NAc neurons and led to changes in cue- and reward-related activity across sessions. Overall, these findings support the ideas that sign tracking and goal tracking are the products of two different learning processes&mdash;one dopamine-dependent and one not&mdash;and that the impact of VTA dopamine on sign tracking may be mediated by activity in the NAc core.</p>

                <p><I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a crucial role in excitatory neurotransmission, with numerous pathogenic variants identified in the GluN subunits, including their ligand-binding domains (LBDs). The prevailing hypothesis postulates that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control machinery verifies the agonist occupancy of NMDARs, but this was tested in a limited number of studies. Using microscopy and electrophysiology in the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, we found that surface expression of GluN1/GluN2A receptors containing a set of alanine substitutions within the LBDs correlated with the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for glycine (GluN1 subunit mutations) while not correlating with the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for <scp>l</scp>-glutamate (GluN2A subunit mutations). The mutant cycle of GluN1-S688 residue, including the pathogenic GluN1-S688Y and GluN1-S688P variants, showed a correlation between relative surface expression of the GluN1/GluN2A receptors and the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for glycine, as well as with the calculated <I>G</I><SUB>binding</SUB> values for glycine obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast, the mutant cycle of GluN2A-S511 residue did not show any correlation between the relative surface expression of the GluN1/GluN2A receptors and the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for <scp>l</scp>-glutamate or calculated <I>G</I><SUB>binding</SUB> values for <scp>l</scp>-glutamate. Coexpression of both mutated GluN1 and GluN2A subunits led to additive or synergistic alterations in the surface number of GluN1/GluN2A receptors. The synchronized ER release by ARIAD technology confirmed the altered early trafficking of GluN1/GluN2A receptors containing the mutated LBDs. The microscopical analysis from embryonal rat hippocampal neurons (both sexes) corroborated our conclusions from the HEK293 cells.</p>

                <p>A salient neuroanatomical feature of the human brain is its pronounced cortical folding, and there is mounting evidence that sulcal morphology is relevant to functional brain architecture and cognition. However, the relationships between sulcal anatomy, brain activity, and behavior are still poorly understood. We previously found that the depth of three small, shallow sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was linked to reasoning performance during development (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B125">Voorhies et al., 2021</cross-ref>). These findings beg the question: What is the linking mechanism between sulcal morphology and cognition? Here, we investigated functional connectivity among sulci in LPFC and the lateral parietal cortex in participants drawn from the same sample as our previous study. We leveraged manual parcellations (21 sulci/hemisphere, 1,806 total) and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a reasoning task from 43 participants aged 7&ndash;18 years (20 females). We conducted clustering and classification analyses of individual-level functional connectivity among sulci. Broadly, we found that (1) connectivity patterns of individual sulci could be differentiated and more accurately than cortical patches equated for size and shape; (2) sulcal connectivity did not consistently correspond with that of probabilistic labels or large-scale networks; (3) sulci clustered based on connectivity patterns, not dictated by spatial proximity; and (4) across individuals, greater depth was associated with higher network centrality for several sulci under investigation. These results illustrate how sulcal morphology can be functionally relevant and provide proof of concept that using sulci to define an individual coordinate space for functional connectomes is a promising future direction.</p>

                <p>Navigating within our neighborhood or learning a set of concepts requires remembering the relationship between individual items that are presented sequentially. Theta activity in the mammalian hippocampus is related to the encoding and recall of relational structures. However, how theta oscillations are involved in retrieving temporal order information in opposing directionality (forward vs backward) has not been characterized. Here, using intracranial recordings from 10 human epileptic patients of both genders with hippocampal electrodes, we tested the patients with a temporal order memory task in which they learned the spatial relationship among individual items arranged along a circular track and were tested on both forward-cued and backward-cued retrieval conditions. We found that sustained high-power oscillatory events in the hippocampal theta (2&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) band, as quantified by <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> rate, were higher for the backward conditions during the later stage but not in the earlier stage. The theta <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> rate results are consistent with the behavioral memory performance and the theta phase to gamma power cross-frequency coupling. Control analyses on change in theta or gamma power and their peak frequencies, aperiodic activity, hemispheric differences, and <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> duration confirm that elevated theta rhythmic activity carry specific physiological information with respect to experience-dependent (episodic) learning. In contrast, we observed a stronger effect of forward than backward retrieval for the low gamma (30&ndash;70&nbsp;Hz) <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> rate irrespective of stages. Our results revealed how theta oscillations are specifically implicated in the learning process for efficient retrieval of temporal order memories under opposing directionality.</p>

                <p>The neural processes that change when falling asleep are only partially understood. At the cortical level, features of both spontaneous neural activity and sensory responses change between wakefulness and sleep. For example, in the early auditory cortex, sleep increases the occurrence of postonset silent (OFF) periods and elevates population synchrony. However, it remains unknown whether such changes occur abruptly or gradually around sleep onset and awakening. Here, we recorded spontaneous and sound-evoked neuronal spiking activity in the early auditory cortex along with polysomnography during thousands of episodes when male rats fell asleep or woke up. We found that when falling asleep, stimulus-induced neuronal silent periods (OFF periods), characteristic of nonrapid eye movement sleep, increased within a few seconds around sleep onset. In contrast, a gradual increase in neuronal population synchrony built up over tens of seconds until reaching maximal levels. EEG auditory-evoked potentials likely representing stimulus-triggered "K-complexes" changed along with postonset neuronal firing, whereas ongoing EEG slow-wave activity was associated with neuronal population synchrony. Similar effects, but with opposite direction, were observed around awakenings. The results highlight late stimulus-induced neuronal silence as a key feature changing abruptly around transitions between vigilance states, likely reflecting neuronal bistability and manifesting also in EEG-evoked potentials. More generally, these findings emphasize the added value of going beyond monitoring ongoing activity and perturbing the nervous system to reveal its state&mdash;an insight that could also help guide the development of more sensitive noninvasive monitors of falling asleep in humans.</p>

                <p>We report here that microglia exert a surprisingly discrete but functionally critical influence on synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus. Treatment of adult male mice with colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor antagonist PLX5622 (PLX), with resultant depletion of forebrain microglia, did not disturb basal synaptic transmission at four synaptic connections in the hippocampus. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was also intact for three of these sites, but the singular, endocannabinoid-dependent form of LTP expressed by lateral perforant path (LPP) input to the dentate gyrus (DG) was severely impaired. The LPP&ndash;LTP defect occurred in conjunction with a pronounced increase in DG (but not neocortical) levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the retrograde (spine-to-terminal) endocannabinoid messenger that initiates LPP&ndash;LTP. Despite this, concentrations of the 2-AG synthetic enzyme diacylglycerol lipase were not affected by PLX treatment. Synaptic levels of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor, which mediates 2-AG effects on LPP&ndash;LTP, were similarly unaffected. Prior work has implicated the LPP in episodic memory. We determined that the LPP&ndash;LTP impairment in PLX-treated mice was accompanied by a failure to acquire the three basic elements of an episode: the identities, locations, and presentation order for a collection of olfactory cues. Treatment with JZL184, which inhibits the 2-AG degradative enzyme monoglyceride lipase, restored both LPP&ndash;LTP and episodic "What" encoding in PLX-treated mice. We conclude that microglia selectively regulate endocannabinoid transmission at the LPP-&gt;DG synapse and thereby potently influence synaptic plasticity at the initial stage of a corticohippocampal circuit that is critical for episodic memory.</p>

                <p>Speech is a multisensory signal that can be extracted from the voice and the lips. Previous studies suggested that occipital and temporal regions encode both auditory and visual speech features but their location and nature remain unclear. We characterized brain activity using fMRI (13 males and 11 females) to functionally and individually define bilateral fusiform face areas (FFA), the left word-selective ventral occipito-temporal cortex (word-VOTC), an audiovisual speech region in the left superior temporal sulcus (lSTS); and control regions in bilateral scene-selective parahippocampal place areas (PPA). In these regions, we performed multivariate pattern classification of corresponding phonemes (speech sounds) and visemes (lip movements). We observed that the word-VOTC and lSTS represent phonological information from both vision and sounds. The multisensory nature of phonological representations appeared selective to the word-VOTC, as we found viseme but not phoneme representation in adjacent FFA, while PPA did not encode phonology in any modality. Interestingly, cross-modal decoding revealed aligned phonological representations across the senses in lSTS, but not in word-VOTC. A whole-brain cross-modal searchlight analysis additionally revealed aligned audiovisual phonological representations in bilateral pSTS and left somato-motor cortex overlapping with oro-facial articulators. Altogether, our results demonstrate that auditory and visual phonology are represented in the word-VOTC, extending its functional coding beyond orthography. The geometries of auditory and visual representations do not align in the word-VOTC as they do in the STS and left somato-motor cortex, suggesting distinct representations across a distributed multisensory phonological network.</p>

                <p>Changes in the activity profile of cortical neurons are due to effects at the scale of local and long-range networks. Accordingly, abrupt transitions in the state of cortical neurons&mdash;a phenomenon known as Up&ndash;Down states (UDS)&mdash;have been attributed to variation in the activity of afferent neurons. However, cellular physiology and morphology may also play a role in causing UDS. This study examines the impact of dendritic nonlinearities, particularly those mediated by voltage-dependent NMDA receptors, on the response of cortical neurons to balanced excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs. Using a neuron model with two segregated dendritic compartments, we compared cells with and without dendritic nonlinearities. NMDA receptors boosted somatic firing in the balanced condition and increased the correlation between membrane potentials across the compartments of the neuron model. Dendritic nonlinearities elicited strong bimodality in the distribution of the somatic potential when the cell was driven with cortical-like input. Moreover, dendritic nonlinearities could detect small input fluctuations and lead to UDS whose statistics and dynamics closely resemble electrophysiological data. UDS also occurred in recurrent networks with oscillatory firing activity, as in anaesthetized animal models, when dendritic NMDA receptors were partially disabled. These findings suggest that there is a dissociation between cellular and network-level features that could both contribute to the emergence of UDS. Our study highlights the complex interplay between dendritic integration and activity-driven dynamics in the origin of cortical bistability.</p>

                <p>Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial in the tightly regulated process of neurogenesis from radial glial cells (RGCs) to intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) to neurons during embryonic brain development. Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins as important epigenetic readers are implicated in development and diseases, yet their roles in embryonic neurogenesis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we found different PHD finger proteins are differentially expressed along the neurogenesis trajectory. Among them, we investigated the function of PHF23 using mouse models, which is highly expressed in RGCs and IPCs, but not in neurons. Our findings demonstrate that PHF23 is essential for proper neurogenesis, and <I>Phf23</I> knock-out (<I>Phf2</I>3-KO) results in cortical developmental defects due to differentiation blockade of RGCs. Mechanistically, PHF23 bind with HDAC2, inhibiting its deacetylation activity on the active histone mark H3K27ac, thereby promoting the expression of neuronal differentiation pathway genes such as <I>Tcf4</I> and <I>Eya1</I>. Overexpression of <I>Tcf4</I> rescues the differentiation defects of <I>Phf2</I>3-KO NSCs. These results establish PHF23 as a pivotal regulator of neurogenesis, indicating cell type-specific functions of PHD finger proteins.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/26/e2307242025?rss=1">Inhibition of Rho-Associated Kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 as a Therapeutic Strategy to Reactivate the Repressed FXN Gene in Friedreich Ataxia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive damage to the nervous system and severe cardiac abnormalities. The disease is caused by a GAA&bull;TTC triplet repeat expansion in the first intron of the <I>FXN</I> gene, resulting in epigenetic repression of <I>FXN</I> transcription and reduction in FXN (frataxin) protein which results in mitochondrial dysfunction. Factors and pathways that promote <I>FXN</I> repression represent potential therapeutic targets whose inhibition would restore <I>FXN</I> transcription and frataxin protein levels. Here, we performed a candidate-based RNAi screen to identify kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, that when knocked down upregulate <I>FXN</I> expression. Using this approach, we identified Rho kinase ROCK1 as a critical factor required for <I>FXN</I> repression. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of ROCK1, or the related kinase ROCK2, increases <I>FXN</I> mRNA and frataxin protein levels in FA patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated neurons and cardiomyocytes to levels observed in normal cells. We demonstrate that small molecule ROCK inhibitors, including the FDA-approved drug belumosudil and fasudil, reactivate <I>FXN</I> expression in cultured FA iPSCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and FA patient primary fibroblasts and ameliorate the characteristic mitochondrial defects in these cell types. Remarkably, treatment of transgenic FA mice of both sexes with belumosudil or fasudil upregulates <I>FXN</I> expression, ameliorates the mitochondrial defects in the brain and heart tissues, and improves motor coordination and muscle strength. Collectively, our study identifies ROCK kinases as critical repressors of <I>FXN</I> expression and provides preclinical evidence that FDA-approved ROCK inhibitors may be repurposed for treatment of FA.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/26/e2358232025?rss=1">Task-Switch Related Reductions in Neural Distinctiveness in Children and Adults: Commonalities and Differences</a></h4>

              
                <p>Goal-directed behavior requires the ability to flexibly switch between task sets with changing environmental demands. Switching between tasks generally comes at the cost of slower and less accurate responses. Compared with adults, children often show greater switch costs, presumably reflecting the protracted development of the ability to flexibly update task-set representations. To test whether the distinctiveness of neural task-set representations is more strongly affected by a task switch in children compared with adults, we examined multivoxel patterns of fMRI activation in 88 children (8&ndash;11&nbsp;years, 49 girls, 39 boys) and 52 adults (20&ndash;30&nbsp;years, 27 women, 25 men) during a task-switching paradigm. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we investigated whether task-set representations were less distinct on switch than on repeat trials across frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular, and temporo-occipital regions. Children and adults showed lower accuracy and longer response times on switch than on repeat trials. Switch costs were similar across groups. Decoding accuracy was lower on switch than repeat trials, suggesting that switching reduces the distinctiveness of task-set representations. Reliable age differences in switch-related reductions of decoding accuracy were absent. More nuanced analyses using probability measures indicated that the distinctiveness of task sets was more affected by switch demand in children than in adults in a subset of frontal, cingulate, and temporal regions. These results point to a remarkable degree of maturity of neural representations of task-relevant information in late childhood along with more subtle region-specific age differences in the effects of task switching on rule representation.</p>

                Background This study explores the lived experiences of individuals recovering from COVID-19, aiming to deepen understanding and inform supportive measures in future health crises. Methods Fifteen participants were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and non-aggregated behavioral observations. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) guided the analytic process, allowing for in-depth exploration of participants’ meaning-making. Reporting adhered to the COREQ qualitative research guidelines. Results Five superordinate themes emerged: stress, economic and social disruption, social stigma, social support, and the reappraisal of adversity (“finding meaning in misfortune”). Participants’ narratives revealed complex adaptive processes shaped by both contextual hardships and relational resources. Conclusion These findings highlight the need for multidisciplinary care approaches that attend to psychosocial and economic dimensions of illness. Results may inform policies on post-COVID-19 recovery, including supportive training for health and community workers, and the development of integrated response frameworks for future public health emergencies.

                Background As genome sequencing technologies advance, the growing accumulation of sequencing data in public databases highlights the need for more robust and adaptable analysis workflows for chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These workflows must promote reproducibility and replicability of results while effectively leveraging publicly available data to enhance biological insights. Methods Here, we present Rocketchip, a Python-based command-line tool that integrates existing software through Snakemake, enabling efficient, automated, and reproducible analysis of both newly generated chromatin immunoprecipitation data, including chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN), and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) as well as existing datasets. Results Rocketchip can analyze chromatin immunoprecipitation data using any available software combination for any reference genome. It enhances the utilization of existing datasets, promotes replicability in analyses, and serves as a platform for benchmarking algorithms. Conclusions By facilitating the reanalysis of existing data and allowing for flexible analysis of newly generated data, Rocketchip allows researchers to identify and apply the most accurate and efficient analytical approaches to their data.

                Background The farming industry faces continuous threats from pest control and farm security issues because rodents cause significant damage to crops and disrupt farm operations. Traditional pest control methods require continuous human interaction which proves both resource-intensive and inefficient. Modern agricultural practices benefit from sustainable solutions through the combination of renewable energy with smart technologies. Method The research presents an innovative solar-powered motion-sensor system that utilizes OpenCV-based image analysis to detect and classify rodent intruders on farmland autonomously. The system depends on solar panels for energy autonomy while employing computer vision to monitor threats in real time and classify them. Results The system demonstrates its ability to detect and prevent rodent intruders according to initial testing results. The OpenCV system uses motion sensor signals to analyze movement patterns before distinguishing rodents from other detected objects. The solar-powered system operates continuously which decreases human intervention needs and enhances farm surveillance capabilities. The model demonstrates its capability to defend crops from rodent damage and enhance farm resistance against land degradation threats. Conclusion The proposed system demonstrates progress in uniting renewable energy systems with smart surveillance technologies to mitigate agricultural risks. The current system encounters problems with detecting wild animals beyond rodents as well as tracking rodent activity beneath ground level. Future developments could include improved pest capture systems alongside enhanced surveillance features for detecting both unauthorized human intruders and large animals. The research shows that solar power systems need to be connected with automated monitoring technology to create sustainable agricultural operations that are efficient and resilient.

                Background Owing to its combination of speed, tactics, and accuracy, table tennis is becoming a sport exercise that is suitable for older adults. Casual play is fun and relaxing, and more serious table tennis might further develop skills through focused practice. Methods A randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to determine how the practice of competition compared to leisure playing affects the Quality of life (QoL) of people aged 40-70. Selecting subjects at random, one group of subjects undertook a structured competitive regimen, whereas the other group was given time to play recreationally without any structured competition. QoL was measured before and after the intervention using the WHOQOL-BREF, which measures physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains. Data were analyzed using paired and independent t-test. Results The group that received structured competition reported a marked improvement in their QoL indicators, especially in physical health (p < 0.001), psychological health (p < 0.001), and social relationships (p = 0.001), when compared to the control group, which showed few improvements. No significant differences were observed in the environmental domains in either group. Conclusions Regular competitive table tennis practice improves physical condition, emotions, and social relationships, which leads to a higher QoL in older adults. Thus, these results emphasize the utility of competitive sports in the maintenance of active and healthy aging.

                The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has taken some measures to advance collective action to accelerate telehealth in the region. Still, it has encountered the problem of digital readiness and digital health preparedness disparities within the region. To maintain the consolidation of digital health utilization among ASEAN member states, this article offers policy recommendations that help to address the diverse approaches taken and compensate for the capacity diversities among the members. Drawing on insights from published official policies, government health ministry websites of Southeast Asian nations, and ASEAN’s digital health policies, the article first reviews the diversities of digital technologies in a post-pandemic Southeast Asia and then assess measures to enhance regional approaches. Several recommendations are presented: First, ASEAN can standardize regional frameworks on telehealth through the sharing of digital health transformation blueprints and the utilization of ASEAN and ASEAN Plus forums to bridge different understandings and advance the region’s digital health initiatives. Second, ASEAN facilitates investments through a telehealth sandbox and fosters collaborations among different stakeholders. Although the recommendations are consistent with the ‘ASEAN Way,’ concerns over different commitments and expectations, risks of privacy infringements, and misuse of technology in the authoritarian states of the region will be lingering concerns to Southeast Asia’s telehealth landscape.

                Background In Peru, the legalization of Cannabis was given in 2017 and approved in 2019; however, there are discrepancies in the knowledge of the therapeutic use of this plant, causing rejection in its application as an alternative medicine. Methods The research was of a basic type with a quantitative approach and a non-experimental design, with a cross-sectional and descriptive scope. Non-probabilistic sampling was used and a total of 324 people (18 – 60 years old) were estimated as the sample. The instrument used was a virtual questionnaire consisting of closed questions with a KR-20 value of 0.825. Finally, the data were treated with descriptive statistics and frequency and percentage tables were used. Results Participants have a positive perception of the benefits of medical cannabis, although their knowledge of its therapeutic application and dosage is limited. The need for its use to be restricted to prescriptions by specialized physicians and backed by scientific evidence is highlighted. Despite having superficial information on applications in chronic diseases and cancer, there is a moderate acceptance of its regular use under medical supervision. Conclusion The population of Trujillo lacks knowledge about the medical benefits and applications of cannabis highlighting the need for educational campaigns. Although regulation is supported, concerns about safety and abuse remain. More studies should be conducted to obtain more accurate data.

                Background Synthetic data’s utility in benchmark studies depends on its ability to closely mimic real-world conditions and reproduce results from experimental data. Building on Nearing et al.‘s study (1), which assessed 14 differential abundance tests using 38 experimental 16S rRNA datasets in a case-control design, we generated synthetic datasets to verify these findings. We rigorously assessed the similarity between synthetic and experimental data and validated the conclusions on the performance of these tests drawn by Nearing et al. (1). This study adheres to the study protocol: Computational Study Protocol: Leveraging Synthetic Data to Validate a Benchmark Study for Differential Abundance Tests for 16S Microbiome Sequencing Data (2). Methods We replicated Nearing et al.’s (1) methodology, incorporating simulated data using two distinct tools (metaSPARSim (3) and sparseDOSSA2 (4)), mirroring the 38 experimental datasets. Equivalence tests were conducted on a set of 30 data characteristics (DC) comparing synthetic and experimental data, complemented by principal component analysis for overall similarity assessment. The 14 differential abundance tests were applied to synthetic datasets, evaluating the consistency of significant feature identification and the proportion of significant features per tool. Correlation analysis, multiple regression and decision trees were used to explore how differences between synthetic and experimental DCs may affect the results. Conclusions Adhering to a formal study protocol in computational benchmarking studies is crucial for ensuring transparency and minimizing bias, though it comes with challenges, including significant effort required for planning, execution, and documentation. In this study, metaSPARSim (3) and sparseDOSSA2 (4) successfully generated synthetic data mirroring the experimental templates, validating trends in differential abundance tests. Of 27 hypotheses tested, 6 were fully validated, with similar trends for 37%. While hypothesis testing remains challenging, especially when translating qualitative observations from text into testable hypotheses, synthetic data for validation and benchmarking shows great promise for future research.

                Abstract Background This study assessed the functional outcomes and complications of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using pre-contoured superior clavicle locking plates for displaced midshaft clavicular fractures. Methods In a prospective two-center study at Al-Thawra Modern General Hospital and Kuwait University Hospital, Sana’a, Yemen, from January 2018 to September 2024, 65 patients (≥18 years) with closed, displaced midshaft clavicular fractures (displacement >2 cm, shortening >2 cm, comminution, or skin tenting) underwent ORIF. Functional outcomes were evaluated six months postoperatively using the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder rating score. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26. Results The mean patient age was 32.09 years (83.1% male, n=54). Road traffic accidents were the primary mechanism of injury (66.2%, n=43). At 6 months, the mean UCLA score was 32.46 ± 2.54, with 98.5% (n=64) achieving good or excellent outcomes (UCLA score ≥27) and 1.5% (n=1) fair/poor. Complications included hardware irritation (1.5%, n=1), hardware failure (3.1%, n=2), and superficial infections (1.5%, n=1). All patients (100%) reported satisfaction with their outcomes. The UCLA scores varied significantly according to injury mechanism, side, and age, with older patients showing lower scores. Conclusion ORIF with pre-contoured locked plates yielded promising functional outcomes, high patient satisfaction, and low complication rates. However, the observational design, lack of a control group, and 6-month follow-up limit broader conclusions. Larger controlled studies are needed to validate these findings and guide the optimal management of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-620/v1?src=rss">-The Prevalence and Parental Awareness, Perception, and Attitudes towards Eye Diseases in Children Under 18 years old, in Saudi Arabia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Identifying and treating visual impairment in young children is crucial because it has a lasting impact on adults. Estimates put the number of children with vision impairment in the world at 19 million, compared to the estimated 1.4 million who are blind. To battle children’s vision issues, studies on children’s eye disorders have highlighted the significance of raising awareness among parents and educators. So, according to various authors, the awareness, perception, and attitudes of parents towards children’s eye diseases in Saudi Arabia need more research. Aims To determines the prevalence of children’s eye diseases among children aged under 18 years old, in Saudi Arabia, as well as assess the awareness, perception, and attitudes of parents towards children’s eye diseases in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional web survey with a sample (n = 1276) of parents of children in Saudi Arabia was carried out from November 2023 to August 2024. Results This study highlights significant gaps in parental awareness of Childhood Eye Diseases (CED), with 46.5% of parents demonstrating intermediate awareness and 29.4% exhibiting poor awareness. Refractive errors were the most commonly reported eye issue, affecting 44.23% of children, while congenital glaucoma and cataracts were less common. Factors positively correlating with higher awareness included marital status, gender, age (30-50 years), education level (bachelor’s degree), and employment status. Notably, more than half of the children had never undergone an eye exam. Conclusion This study highlights significant gaps in parental awareness of CED, with 46.5% of parents demonstrating intermediate awareness and 29.4% showing poor awareness. Factors such as marital status, gender, age (30-50 years), education level (bachelor’s degree), and employment status positively correlate with higher awareness. These findings underscore the need for targeted educational interventions to improve knowledge and encourage proactive eye health care among parents.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-33/v2?src=rss">Community perspectives on drug promotion on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media and web-based platforms were widely used to promote medicinal substances. To assess community perspectives on drug promotions on social media, we conducted qualitative research using three workshops. The workshops aimed to highlight the public understanding of drug advertising focusing on community perceptions of social media drug promotions, their risks and benefits. Discussions were conducted on the importance of adhering to national drug regulation policies and the World Health Organisation ethical criteria for promotion, advertisement, and publicity of medicines. Methods Participants for the workshops were purposively sampled from local community youth groups and healthcare facilities. Two workshops included ten young adults aged 18-35, while the third workshop involved three healthcare professionals and one traditional healer. Results The study participants’ highlighted the value of honesty and trust in the drug promotions. Gaps in the ethical conduct of advertising were observed and concerns were raised about the reliability of social media information and the omission of valuable details on the drug advertisements. Conclusion Individuals have a right to informed choices that ensure their health safety. This study has highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in pharmaceutical and complementary medicine marketing on social media. Collaboration is needed between regulatory bodies, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers and community members, to make sure that drug advertising upholds ethical standards and public health.

Wastewater and environmental surveillance (WES) is a promising method of detecting infectious diseases in human and animal populations and offers significant advantages over traditional surveillance methods in the early detection of outbreaks. However, WES involves financial and human resources, and public policy decisions must determine whether the benefits of WES outweigh the costs, particularly in low-resource areas. The selection of surveillance sites, sampling frequency, and test sensitivity and specificity are crucial determinants of WES effectiveness and cost-efficiency. We created an analytical model and numerical simulations of disease arrival, spread, and WES strategies to determine the optimal sampling frequency for two interacting patches, each represented by a different sampling site. We show that it is optimal to test in one patch more frequently than it is to test in both patches less frequently if the patches are sufficiently interactive, surveillance is of sufficient sensitivity and specificity, and setup costs are substantial. In our value of information (VOI) assessment, the net value of surveillance information for both patches is non-monotonic with respect to the degree of patch interaction. Increased mixing between the patches allows for quicker surveillance detection but is worse for overall infection burden. Overall, optimizing the value of surveillance information for all patches being surveilled requires coordination and deliberate selection of surveillance sites and sampling frequencies. This paper provides a VOI assessment of WES to determine the optimal number of sites and sampling frequency at a high level of abstraction, leaving opportunity to adapt the model to specific pathogens and populations as needed. Our findings can inform the cost-efficient implementation of WES for infectious diseases, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013171">The roles of feedback loops in the Caenorhabditis elegans rhythmic forward locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peng Zhao, Boyang Wang, Yi Rong, Ye Yuan, Jian Liu, Hong Huo, Zhuyong Liu, Zhaoyu Li, Tao Fang</p>

Rhythmic behaviors are essential in biological systems, particularly in animal locomotion. The central pattern generator and sensory feedback loop mechanism have been instrumental in explaining many rhythmic locomotion patterns, however, it is insufficient to account for the tunability and robustness of frequency and amplitude in certain oscillatory movements. This suggests the involvement of additional, less understood circuit mechanisms. This study employs calcium imaging and neuromechanical modelling to investigate the circuit mechanism responsible for sinusoidal forward locomotion in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We demonstrate that the feedback loop circuit, consisting of motoneurons and muscles, could govern the generation of oscillations and regulate rhythmic forward movement. This circuit is composed of both negative and positive feedback loops, which together regulate the turnability and robustness of oscillations. The oscillatory behavior of <i>C. elegans</i> typically involves a rhythmic alternation of dorsoventral muscles. Our neuromechanical model of the functional oscillatory unit reveals that asymmetric inputs from interneurons to motoneurons, and asymmetric connections from motoneurons to muscles, are essential for this switching mechanism. Our findings suggest that, besides the established roles of existed oscillator mechanisms, circuits formed by both negative and positive feedback loops contribute to the generation and robust modulation of rhythmic behaviors.

                <p>by Roland M. Dries, Kim Y. Renders, Jaap A. Kaandorp</p>

Studying the bending of a cell sheet in vivo, like invagination in embryos, can be complex due to a multitude of cellular processes and properties that interact with each other. Computer simulations can help to unravel this process. 2D computer simulations, however, lack the ability to take into account the effect three-dimensional properties, like endodermal plate shape and cell number, have on the shape of an embryo. Therefore, we developed a 3D cell-based model, that is able to simulate cells as separate deformable entities with a conserved cell volume. A blastula is formed by adhering the cells together as a sphere. The simulation results showed that changing individual mechanical properties, like cell stiffness, cell-cell adhesion, and the apical constriction factor, had a direct effect on the cell’s behavior and future shape. These properties influenced the ability of a cell sheet to bend and eventually change the global shape of the embryo. The observed shape transitions the endodermal region goes through during the inward bending of the cell sheet in the simulation, can give an insight into the mechanisms involved, and timing of events in biological model organisms. Changing geometrical properties (endodermal plate shape, endodermal cell number and the start position of constriction), which is not possible in 2D models, showed that the inwards bending is more dependent on the number of cells involved than on the shape of the endodermal region, and thus that the invagination process is very robust to irregularities. When qualitatively comparing our simulation results to biological data from literature, we saw that our simulations did not exactly reproduce the shapes observed in nature. This might indicate that additional mechanisms are playing a role during invagination.

                <p>by Macha Dussouchaud, Markel Martinez-Carranza, Pierre-Simon Garcia, Martin Clémancey, Geneviève Blondin, Jean Michel Betton, Ahmed Haouz, Simonetta Gribaldo, Sandrine Ollagnier de Choudens, Ludovic Sauguet, Ariel Mechaly, Frédéric Barras</p>

[Fe-S] clusters are ancient and ubiquitous protein co-factors, which contributed to the emergence of life in an anoxic planet. We have recently identified two minimal [Fe-S] biogenesis systems, MIS and SMS, inferred to be ancestral systems dating back to the Last Universal Common Ancestor and which gave rise to the well-studied modern Iron-Sulfur Cluster (ISC), Nitrogen Fixation (NIF), and Sulfur Mobilization (SUF) machineries. The present study focuses on the ancestor SMS from the hyperthermophilic archaeon <i>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</i>. Biochemical and structural studies showed that SMS is made of a SmsC<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> heterotetratmer wherein the SmsC subunit hosts both ATP and [Fe-S] cluster binding sites. Binding of ATP and assembly of [Fe-S] were found to be mutually exclusive allowing for a regulatory coupling between binding of both substrates. Mutagenesis and in vitro transfer experiments revealed the key role of SmsC-contained Cys residues in cluster assembly. Strikingly, the SMS system rescued a non-viable <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain lacking endogenous ISC and SUF systems grown under anoxic conditions, in the presence of Na<sub>2</sub>S, indicating that sulfide is a source of sulfur for SMS. In addition, we predict that most archaea SmsC proteins hold a similar C-terminal [Fe-S] cluster assembly site. Taking into account those unique structural and functional features, we propose a mechanistic model describing how SmsC<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> assembles and distributes [4Fe-4S] clusters. Altogether this study established SMS as a new <i>bona fide</i> [Fe-S] biogenesis system that operated in anaerobic prokaryotes prior to evolve to SUF after the Great Oxydation Event.

An electron-microscopy technique that relies on a phenomenon called inelastic electron scattering has been used to map phonons and temperatures with (sub-)nanometre resolution to characterize heat-transport dynamics across such interfaces.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97874">Investigating working memory updating processes of the human subcortex using 7T MRI</a></h4>

              
                A growing body of research suggests that dopamine is involved in working memory updating and that the striatum takes up a critical role in the subprocess of working memory gating . In this study, we investigated subcortical – in particular, possible dopaminergic – involvement in working memory updating subprocesses using the reference-back task and ultrahigh field 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using a scanning protocol optimized for BOLD sensitivity in the subcortex, we found no evidence of subcortical activation during working memory gate opening, predominantly activations in frontoparietal network regions, which challenges the idea of a striatal gating mechanism. However, during gate closing, subcortical activation was observed. Furthermore, a ready-to-update mode demonstrated large-spread subcortical activation, including basal ganglia nuclei, suggesting that the basal ganglia are engaged in general updating processes rather than specifically controlling the working memory gate. Moreover, substituting new information into working memory elicited activation in dopamine-producing midbrain regions along with the striatum, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex, indicating engagement of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop possibly driven by (potential) dopaminergic activity. These findings expand our understanding of subcortical regions involved in working memory updating, shifting the focus from gate opening to substitution as a midbrain-driven updating process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105152">Disentangling acute motor deficits and adaptive responses evoked by the loss of cerebellar output</a></h4>

              
                Patients with cerebellar damage experience various motor impairments, but the specific sequence of primary and compensatory processes that contribute to these deficits remains unclear. To clarify this, we reversibly blocked cerebellar outflow in monkeys engaged in planar reaching tasks. This intervention led to a spatially selective reduction in hand velocity, primarily due to decreased muscle torque, especially in movements requiring high inter-joint torque coupling. When examining repeated reaches to the same target, we found that the reduced velocity resulted from both an immediate deficit and a gradually developing compensatory slowing to reduce passive inter-joint interactions. However, the slowed hand velocity did not account for the fragmented and variable movement trajectories observed during the cerebellar block. Our findings indicate that cerebellar impairment results in motor deficits due to both inadequate muscle torque and an altered motor control strategy for managing impaired limb dynamics. Additionally, impaired motor control elevates noise, which cannot be entirely mitigated through compensatory strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104278">Tissue-resident memory CD4+ T cells are sustained by site-specific levels of self-renewal and continuous replacement</a></h4>

              
                Tissue-resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) protect from repeat infections within organs and barrier sites. The breadth and duration of such protection are defined at minimum by three quantities: the rate at which new T<sub>RM</sub> are generated from precursors, their rate of self-renewal, and their rate of loss through death, egress, or differentiation. Quantifying these processes individually is challenging. Here we combine genetic fate mapping tools and mathematical models to untangle these basic homeostatic properties of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in the skin and gut lamina propria (LP) of healthy adult mice. We show that CD69<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in skin reside for ∼24 days and self-renew more slowly, such that clones halve in size approximately every 5 weeks, and approximately 2% of cells are replaced daily from precursors. CD69<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in LP have shorter residencies (∼14 days) and are maintained largely by immigration (4–6% per day). We also find evidence that the continuous replacement of CD69<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> at both sites derives from circulating effector-memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in skin possibly via a local CD9<sup>−</sup> intermediate. Our approach maps the ontogeny of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in skin and LP and exposes their dynamic and distinct behaviours, with continuous seeding and erosion potentially impacting the duration of immunity at these sites.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99634">Learning and cognition in highspeed decision making</a></h4>

              
                It is widely accepted that more time and information yield better decisions. However, some decisions manage to be extremely fast and yet accurate. The trick of such highspeed decisions appears to be the use of simplifying heuristics that works well for the most common condition but lacks flexibility otherwise. Here, we describe an unexpected level of flexibility in a complex highspeed decision that is made faster than an Olympic sprinter can respond to the start gun. In this decision, archerfish observe the initial speed, direction, and height of falling prey and then use these initial values to turn right towards where ballistically falling prey would later land. To analyze the limits in flexibility of this highspeed decision, we developed and critically tested a system that allowed us to replace the usual ballistic relation between initial prey motion and the expected landing point with another deterministic rule. We discovered that, surprisingly, adult fish could reprogram their highspeed decision to the new rule. Moreover, after reprogramming their decision fish were immediately able to generalize their decision to novel untrained settings, showing a remarkable degree of abstraction in how the decision circuit represented the novel rule. The decision circuit is even capable of simultaneously using two distinct sets of rules, one for each of two visually distinct objects. The flexibility and level of cognition are unexpected for a decision that lacks a speed-accuracy tradeoff and is made in less than 100 ms. Our findings demonstrate the enormous potential highspeed decision making can have and strongly suggest that we presently underappreciate this form of decision making.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104772">Myosin light chain 3 serves as a receptor for nervous necrosis virus entry into host cells via the macropinocytosis pathway</a></h4>

              
                Nodaviridae infections cause severe mortality in insects and fish, with nervous necrosis virus (NNV) posing significant threats to global fish populations. However, the host factors involved in NNV entry remain poorly understood. We identify myosin light chain 3 from marine medaka (<i>Oryzias melastigma</i>) (MmMYL3) as a novel receptor for red-spotted grouper NNV (RGNNV), facilitating internalization via macropinocytosis. MmMYL3 directly binds the RGNNV capsid protein (CP), which depends on the arm and S domains of CP and the EF-hand2 domain of MmMYL3. In vitro experiments showed that MmMYL3 siRNA, protein, anti-MYL3 antibodies, or the arm domain synthetic peptides blocked RGNNV entry. Moreover, in vivo administration of MmMYL3 protein also inhibited RGNNV infection. Ectopic MmMYL3 expression enabled RGNNV internalization into resistant cells. Notably, MmMYL3 facilitated RGNNV internalization through the macropinocytosis pathway via the IGF1R-Rac1/Cdc42 axis. Collectively, our findings underscore MYL3’s crucial role in NNV entry and its potential as an antiviral target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96285">Atoh1 is required for the formation of lateral line electroreceptors and hair cells, whereas Foxg1 represses an electrosensory fate</a></h4>

              
                In electroreceptive jawed fishes and amphibians, individual lateral line placodes form lines of neuromasts on the head containing mechanosensory hair cells, flanked by fields of ampullary organs containing electroreceptors - modified hair cells that respond to weak electric fields. Extensively shared gene expression between neuromasts and ampullary organs suggests that conserved molecular mechanisms are involved in their development, but a few transcription factor genes are restricted either to the developing electrosensory or mechanosensory lateral line. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in G0-injected sterlet embryos (<i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>, a sturgeon) to test the function of three such genes. We found that the 'hair cell' transcription factor gene <i>Atoh1</i> is required for both hair cell and electroreceptor differentiation in sterlet, and for <i>Pou4f3</i> and <i>Gfi1</i> expression in both neuromasts and ampullary organs. These data support the conservation of developmental mechanisms between hair cells and electroreceptors. Targeting ampullary organ-restricted <i>Neurod4</i> did not yield any phenotype, potentially owing to redundancy with other <i>Neurod</i> genes that we found to be expressed in sterlet ampullary organs. After targeting mechanosensory-restricted <i>Foxg1</i>, ampullary organs formed within neuromast lines, suggesting that Foxg1 normally represses their development, whether directly or indirectly. We speculate that electrosensory organs may be the 'default' developmental fate of lateral line primordia in electroreceptive vertebrates.

                <i>Salmonella</i> Dublin is a host-adapted, invasive nontyphoidal <i>Salmonella</i> (iNTS) serovar that causes bloodstream infections in humans and demonstrates increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Using a global dataset of 1303 genomes, coupled with in vitro assays, we examined the evolutionary, resistance, and virulence characteristics of <i>S</i>. Dublin. Our analysis revealed strong geographical associations between AMR profiles and plasmid types, with highly resistant isolates confined predominantly to North America, linked to IncC plasmids co-encoding AMR and heavy metal resistance. By contrast, Australian isolates were largely antimicrobial-susceptible, reflecting differing AMR pressures. We identified two phylogenetically distinct Australian lineages, ST10 and ST74, with a small number of ST10 isolates harbouring a novel hybrid plasmid encoding both AMR and mercuric resistance. Whereas the ST10 lineage remains globally dominant, the ST74 lineage was less prevalent. ST74 exhibited unique genomic features including a larger pan genome compared to ST10 and the absence of key virulence loci, including <i>Salmonella</i> pathogenicity island (SPI)-19 which encodes a type VI secretion system (T6SS). Despite these genomic differences, the ST74 lineage displayed enhanced intracellular replication in human macrophages and induced less pro-inflammatory responses compared with ST10, suggesting alternative virulence strategies that may support systemic dissemination of ST74. The Vi antigen was absent in all ST10 and ST74 genomes, highlighting challenges for serotyping and vaccine development, and has implications for current diagnostic and control strategies for <i>S.</i> Dublin infections. Collectively, this study represents the most comprehensive investigation of <i>S</i>. Dublin to date and, importantly, has revealed distinct adaptations of two genotypes within the same serovar, leading to different epidemiological success. The regional emergence and evolution of distinct <i>S.</i> Dublin lineages highlight the need to understand the divergence of intra-serovar virulence mechanisms which may impact the development of effective control measures against this important global pathogen.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96904">mirror determines the far posterior domain in butterfly wings</a></h4>

              
                Insect wings, a key innovation that contributed to the explosive diversification of insects, are recognized for their remarkable variation and many splendid adaptations. Classical morphological work subdivides insect wings into several distinct domains along the anteroposterior (AP) axis, each of which can evolve relatively independently to produce the myriad forms we see in nature. Important insights into AP subdivision of insect wings come from work in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>; however, they do not fully explain the diversity of AP domains observed across broad-winged insects. Here, we show that the transcription factor <i>mirror</i> acts as a selector gene to differentiate a far posterior domain in the butterfly wing, classically defined as the vannus, and has effects on wing shape, scale morphology, and color pattern. Our results support models of how selector genes may facilitate evolutionarily individuation of distinct AP domains in insect wings outside of <i>Drosophila</i> and suggest that the <i>D. melanogaster</i> wing blade has been reduced to represent only a portion of the archetypal insect wing.

">Melanocortin-responsive Kiss1 neurons of the arcuate nucleus drive energy expenditure through glutamatergic signaling to the dorsomedial hypothalamus.</a></h4>

              
                Energy expenditure (EE) is essential for metabolic homeostasis, yet its central regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify arcuate Kiss1 neurons as key regulators of EE in male mice. Ablation of these neurons induced obesity, while their chemogenetic activation increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis without affecting food intake. This action is mediated by glutamatergic projections from Kiss1ARC neurons to CART/Lepr-expressing neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus, which activate the raphe pallidus-BAT pathway. CRISPR-mediated deletion of the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) from Kiss1ARC neurons replicated the obesogenic effect. Furthermore, deletion of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) from Kiss1 neurons resulted in obesity, reduced energy expenditure and impaired thermogenesis. Optogenetic stimulation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) fibers evoked inward currents in Kiss1 neurons, that were attenuated by MC4R antagonism. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized neural circuit that mediates melanocortin action on energy expenditure, offering new insights into central mechanisms of metabolic control.

">Multiple autism genes influence GABA neuron remodeling via distinct developmental trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Variation in over 100 genes are now associated with increased risk for autism and related neurodevelopmental condition, but how this variation results in distinct and overlapping behavioral changes is still not well understood. Recent efforts have focused on screening many autism genes at once for functional and phenotypic convergence, and identified subsets that are crucial for many early steps of neurodevelopment. Few studies have screened later steps of neurodevelopment, circuit function, circuit plasticity, or behaviors. We screened twenty conserved autism-associated genes for impact on experience-dependent neuron remodeling in C. elegans. Loss of unc-44/ANK2, set-4/KMT5B, daf-18/PTEN, gap-2/SYNGAP1, and chd-1/CHD8 increased, while CACNA2D3/unc-36 decreased, neurite outgrowth of the GABAergic DVB neuron in adults. Although daf-18/PTEN, set-4/KMD5B, and unc-44/ANK2 had convergent phenotypes, they arise from distinct temporal trajectories with differential impact on DVB pre-synaptic morphology. Screening for the DVB regulated spicule protraction behavior identified multiple autism genes involved, but only unc-44/ANK2 and CACNA2D3/unc-36 were shared between screens. Application of a metric geometry computational framework (CAJAL) to the DVB morphology dataset identified 5 additional genes that impact DVB morphology, including unc-2/CACNA1A and unc-10/RIMS1, which also significantly impacted behavior. This work defines new regulators and molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent neuron remodeling and circuit plasticity, and further links these processes with conserved autism genes. It also demonstrates the utility of using intact, behavior generating circuits in C. elegans, to screen for novel roles for conserved autism genes.

">A scalable, all-optical method for mapping synaptic connectivity with cell-type specificity</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell transcriptomics has uncovered the enormous heterogeneity of cell types that compose each region of the mammalian brain, but describing how such diverse types connect to form functional circuits has remained challenging. Current methods for measuring the probability and strength of cell-type specific connectivity motifs principally rely on low-throughput whole-cell recording approaches. The recent development of optical tools for perturbing and observing neural circuit activity, now notably including genetically encoded voltage indicators, presents an exciting opportunity to employ optical methods to greatly increase the throughput with which circuit connectivity can be mapped physiologically. At the same time, advances in spatial transcriptomics now enable the identification of cell types in situ based on their unique gene expression signatures. Here, we demonstrate how long-range synaptic connectivity can be assayed optically with high sensitivity, high throughput, and cell-type specificity. We apply this approach in the motor cortex to examine cell-type-specific synaptic innervation patterns of long-range thalamic and contralateral input onto more than 1000 motor cortical neurons. We find that even cell types occupying the same cortical lamina receive vastly different levels of synaptic input, a finding which was previously not possible to uncover using lower-throughput approaches that can only describe the connectivity of broad cell types.

">Stimulation modulates cell assemblies linked with gene networks in the human temporal cortex ex vivo</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation of the temporal cortex can enhance learning and memory in the face of cognitive impairment. Despite the potential of such therapies, the neural and genetic mechanisms underlying the effect of stimulation on human brain circuits are not understood. To explicate direct mechanisms of neural modulation elicited by brain stimulation, we developed an ex vivo approach utilizing microelectrode array stimulation and recording of resected temporal cortex from neurosurgical patients. We find that stimulation preferentially increases firing rates in pyramidal cells compared to interneurons and also strengthens cell assemblies. Using single cell multiomics, we link the observed physiological changes to cell type-specific gene expression patterns. We detail gene regulatory networks that indicate preferential involvement of specific excitatory neuron subtypes and the response of non-neurons. We conclude that the overall impact of stimulation on the human temporal cortex is activation of specific excitatory neurons and enhanced cell assembly activity, and that these changes are supported by gene networks involving immediate early, synaptic, and ion channel genes. Our findings establish a foundation to identify targetable cell type-specific genetic signatures that may be harnessed for therapeutic benefit in future neuromodulation strategies.

">Spatial isoform sequencing at sub-micrometer single-cell resolution reveals novel patterns of spatial isoform variability in brain cell types</a></h4>

              
                Spatial long-read technologies are becoming more common but lack nanometer- and therefore often single-cell resolution. This leaves the question unanswered whether spatially variable isoforms represent spatial variability within one cell type or differences in cell-type abundance between different regions. Here, we develop Spl-ISO-Seq2 with 220nm spot size and 500nm resolution, and the accompanying software packages Spl-IsoQuant-2 and Spl-IsoFind and apply it to the adult mouse brain. We compare spatial variability within a fixed cell type by examining (a) differential isoform abundance between known brain regions and (b) spatial isoform patterns that do not align with predefined regions. The former reveals larger numbers of spatial isoform differences, e.g. Rps24 in oligodendrocytes. For the previously appreciated gene with spatially-variable isoforms Snap25, we can now show that this variability exists in excitatory neurons. However, the latter approach reveals patterns that the former cannot conceptually model, e.g., Tnnc1 in excitatory neurons. Taken together, our experimental and analytical methods enrich spatial transcriptomics with a so-far elusive isoform view of spatial variation for individual cell types.

">SLAy-ing oversplitting errors in high-density electrophysiology spike sorting</a></h4>

              
                The growing channel count of silicon probes has substantially increased the number of neurons recorded in electrophysiology (ephys) experiments, rendering traditional manual spike sorting impractical. Instead, modern ephys recordings are processed with automated methods that use waveform template matching to isolate putative single neurons. While scalable, automated methods are subject to assumptions that often fail to account for biophysical changes in action potential waveforms, leading to systematic errors. Consequently, manual curation of these errors, which is both time-consuming and lacks reproducibility, remains necessary. To improve efficiency and reproducibility in the spike-sorting pipeline, we introduce here the Spike-sorting Lapse Amelioration System (SLAy), an algorithm that automatically merges oversplit spike clusters. SLAy employs two novel metrics: (1) a waveform similarity metric that uses a neural network to obtain spatially informed, time-shift invariant low-dimensional waveform representations, and (2) a cross-correlogram significance metric based on the earth-movers distance between the observed and null cross-correlograms. We demonstrate that SLAy achieves ~ 85% agreement with human curators across a diverse set of animal models, brain regions, and probe geometries. To illustrate the impact of spike sorting errors on downstream analyses, we develop a new burst-detection algorithm and show that SLAy fixes spike sorting errors that preclude the accurate detection of bursts in neural data. SLAy leverages GPU parallelization and multithreading for computational efficiency, and is compatible with Phy and NeuroData Without Borders, making it a practical and flexible solution for large-scale ephys data analysis.

">Multi-omics comparative analyses of synucleinopathy models reveal distinct targets and relevance for drug development</a></h4>

              
                Background: The discovery and development of therapeutics for Parkinson's disease (PD) requires preclinical models and an understanding of the disease mechanisms reflected in each model is crucial to success. Objective: To illuminate disease mechanisms and translational value of two commonly utilized rat models of synucleinopathy - AAV-delivered human mutant hA53T alpha synuclein (a-Syn) and a-Syn preformed fibril (PFF) injection - using a top-down, unbiased, large-scale approach. Methods: Tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS), RNA sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses were used to assess proteins, genes, and pathways disrupted in rat striatum and substantia nigra. Comparative analyses were performed with PD drug candidate targets and an existing human PD and dementia with Lewy body (DLB) proteomics dataset. Results: Unbiased proteomics identified 388 proteins significantly altered by hA53T-a-Syn and 1550 by PFF-a-Syn compared to sham controls. Pathway and correlation analyses of these revealed common and distinct pathophysiological processes altered in each model: dopaminergic signaling/metabolism, mitochondria and energy metabolism, and motor processes were disrupted in AAV-hA53T-a-Syn, while immune response, intracellular/secretory vesicles, synaptic vesicles, and autophagy were more impacted by PFF-a-Syn. Synapses, neural growth and remodeling, and protein localization were prominently represented in both models. Analyses revealed potential biomarkers of disease processes and proteins and pathways also altered in patients, elucidating drug targets/ disease mechanisms the models best reflect. Conclusions: Alignment of unbiased multi-omics analyses of AAV-hA53T and PFF-a-Syn models of synucleinopathy with PD and DLB patient data and PD drug development pipeline candidates identifies optimal models for testing novel therapeutics based on biological mechanisms.

">Amphetamine and Nicotine Reduce Sucrose Self-Administration Independent of Sex</a></h4>

              
                Amphetamine and nicotine are two widely used and abused drugs that are taken for legitimate pharmaceutical purposes but are also highly abused through illicit recreational use. Both of these drugs have been widely shown to decrease food intake in both humans and pre-clinical models, and although amphetamine and nicotine clearly affect food intake under normal baseline (homeostatic) conditions, there has been limited examination of the ability of these drugs to affect reward-related (hedonic) aspects of feeding. Furthermore, there are sex differences in the behavioral responses to both drugs, but it is unclear if these sex differences also translate to their effects on feeding. This study examined whether nicotine and amphetamine regulate sucrose intake in a food self-administration paradigm in a sex-dependent manner across both fixed and progressive schedules of reinforcement. Amphetamine reduced operant responding for sucrose pellets and decreased acute intake of sucrose during ad libitum free-feeding access in a dose-dependent manner, whereas nicotine reduced sucrose self-administration and free intake only at higher doses that also impaired locomotor activity in open field tests. The effects of both amphetamine and nicotine did not differ by sex for either drug. Overall, these results suggest that the mechanisms mediating the addictive qualities of these drugs and their appetite suppressing effects may be distinct and therefore could be a potential target for future obesity therapeutics.

                Ultrahigh-density electrocorticography (ECoG) provides unprecedented spatial resolution for recording cortical electrical activity. This study uses simulated scalp projections from an ECoG recording to challenge the assumption that channel-level electroencephalography (EEG) reflects only local field potentials near the recording electrode. Using a 1024-electrode ECoG array placed on the primary motor cortex during finger movements, we applied Adaptive Mixture Independent Component Analysis (AMICA) to decompose activity into maximally independent grid activity components and projected these to 207 simulated EEG scalp electrode channels using a high-definition MR image-based electrical forward-problem head model. Our findings demonstrate how cortical surface-recorded potentials propagate to scalp electrodes both far from and near to the generating location. This work has significant implications for interpreting both EEG and ECoG data in clinical and research applications. Clinical Relevance - This study provides insights for interpreting scalp EEG data, demonstrating that scalp channel activity represents a complex mixture of distributed cortical source activities rather than primarily activity generated nearest to the scalp electrodes. These findings may hopefully spur improvement in EEG-based diagnostics for neurological disorders.

">Does stimulus order affect central tendency and serial dependence in vestibular path integration?</a></h4>

              
                The reproduction of a perceived stimulus, such as a distance or a duration, is often influenced by two biases. Central tendency indicates that reproductions are biased toward the mean of the stimulus distribution. Serial dependence reflects that the reproduction of the current stimulus is influenced by the previous stimulus. Although these biases are well-documented, their origins remain to be determined. Studies on duration reproduction suggest that autocorrelation within a stimulus sequence may play a role. In this study, we explored whether the level of autocorrelation in a stimulus sequence affects central tendency and serial dependence in vestibular path integration. Participants (n = 24) performed a vestibular distance reproduction task in total darkness by actively replicating a passively moved stimulus distance with a linear motion platform. We compared two conditions: a high-autocorrelation condition, where stimulus distances followed a random walk, and a no-autocorrelation condition, where the same distances were presented in a randomly shuffled order. We quantified both biases using two approaches: separate simple linear regressions and a joint multiple linear regression model that accounts for the autocorrelation in the stimulus sequence. Simple linear regressions revealed that central tendency was weaker and serial dependence reversed in the high-autocorrelation condition compared to the no-autocorrelation condition. However, these differences were no longer observed in the multiple linear regression analysis, indicating that these biases were independent of the specific stimulus sequence protocol. We conclude that these perceptual biases in vestibular path integration persist regardless of stimulus autocorrelation, suggesting that they reflect robust strategies of the brain to process vestibular information in self-motion perception.

">Synergistic effects of APOE ϵ4 and Alzheimer's pathology on the neural correlates of episodic remembering in cognitively unimpaired older adults</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau pathology begin accumulating decades before clinical symptoms and are influenced by APOE {epsilon}4, a key genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the presence of A{beta}, tau, and APOE {epsilon}4 are thought to impact brain function, their effects on the neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval in preclinical AD remains unknown. We investigated this question in 159 cognitively unimpaired older adults (mean age, 68.9{+/-}5.8 years; 57% female) in the Stanford Aging and Memory Study. Participants completed an associative memory task concurrent with functional MRI. A{beta} was measured using CSF A{beta}42/A{beta}40 or Florbetaben-PET imaging and tau was measured using CSF pTau181. Hippocampal univariate activity and cortical reinstatement -- that is, reinstatement of patterns of neocortical activity that were present during memory encoding -- were measured during successful memory retrieval. Analyses revealed that APOE {epsilon}4 was independently associated with greater A{beta} and tau burden, and that associations of AD biomarkers with brain function and memory were moderated by APOE {epsilon}4. Among APOE {epsilon}4 non-carriers, A{beta} burden was linked to a pattern of hippocampal hyperactivity. Among APOE {epsilon}4 carriers, CSF pTau181 was linked to weaker cortical reinstatement during memory retrieval and lower memory performance. Thus, abnormal AD biomarkers and genetic risk synergistically impact neural and behavioral expressions of memory in preclinical AD. These findings highlight the critical role of APOE {epsilon}4 in moderating effects of AD pathology on brain function and identify candidate mechanisms that may contribute to increased risk of memory impairment in preclinical AD.

">Activation of Infralimbic cortex neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens shell suppresses discriminative stimulus-triggered relapse to cocaine seeking in rats</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Cocaine addiction is marked by high relapse rates, often triggered by drug-associated cues. These cues can be conditioned stimuli (CSs), which occur after drug intake and are paired with drug effects, and discriminative stimuli (DSs), which signal drug availability, regardless of ongoing drug-seeking behaviour. While projections from the infralimbic cortex (IL) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell are known to regulate CS-induced cocaine relapse, their role in DS-triggered relapse is not known. To investigate this, we examined how activating IL[-&gt;]NAc shell projections influences relapse driven by DSs and CSs during abstinence from intermittent cocaine use. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received viral-mediated gene expression of excitatory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs in the IL. Rats then self-administered cocaine during 12 intermittent-access sessions (5-min cocaine ON/25-min cocaine OFF, 4h/day). A discrete light (DS+) signalled drug-available periods, while a different light (DS-) signalled drug non-availability. During each DS+ period, cocaine infusions were paired with a compound light-tone (CS+). Four weeks later, rats were tested for cue-induced cocaine seeking following response-independent presentation of DS+, CS+ or both. Immediately prior to testing, rats received intra-NAc shell clozapine N-oxide or aCSF to activate IL terminals. DS+ alone and DS+/CS+ combined triggered greater cocaine seeking than did the CS+. Activation of IL[-&gt;]NAc shell projections suppressed relapse behaviour in DS+ and DS+/CS+ conditions. These findings highlight the distinct and powerful influence of DSs on relapse and identify the IL[-&gt;]NAc shell circuit as a promising target for relapse prevention.

">Novel mouse model of cerebral microbleeds created by Crispr/Cas9-mediated Col4a1 deletion in adult brain microvessels</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral small vessel disease is a leading cause of cognitive decline and stroke in the elderly, with cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) as one of the key imaging biomarkers. Our understanding of its pathophysiology remains limited due to the lack of appropriate animal models. We report a novel mouse CMB model created by disrupting collagen IV, a core component of the vascular basement membrane (BM), specifically within brain microvessels. Targeted deletion of Col4a1 was achieved in adult mice using brain endothelial-specific AAV vectors with CRISPR/Cas9. MRI revealed numerous CMBs with distributions similar to those of human CMBs. CMB burden increased progressively over six months following Col4a1 deletion in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by cognitive decline and motor incoordination. Histological examination revealed hemosiderin deposits corresponding to MRI-detected CMBs without evidence of macroscopic hemorrhage or white matter lesions, while ultrastructural analysis demonstrated significant BM thinning in Col4a1-depleted microvessels. Analysis of human MRI and genomic data identified significant associations between CMB susceptibility and genetic variants in TIMP2, an endogenous inhibitor of the matrix-degrading enzyme MMP2, underscoring the clinical relevance of our model. These findings establish a direct causal relationship between microvessel COL4A1 and CMB, suggesting that dysregulated collagen IV homeostasis in BM underlies CMB development.

">Harnessing cell-encapsulated hydrogels to study astrocyte mechanoresponse in 4D</a></h4>

              
                In glaucoma, the optic nerve head (ONH) is exposed to increased biomechanical strain, impacting the resident astrocytes that maintain neural homeostasis. After injury, astrocytes exhibit morphologic and metabolic shifts; however, the specific impact of glaucoma-related biomechanical strains on astrocyte behavior remains poorly understood. To address this, we utilized our previously established 3D cell-encapsulated ECM hydrogel to elucidate ONH astrocyte transcriptomic and cellular responses to varying biomechanical strain levels over time. Murine ONH astrocyte-encapsulated hydrogels were subjected to 0, 3, or 10% cyclic strain for 4h and 24h. Using confocal reflectance microscopy, we observed that hydrogel porosity was adequate for nutrient supplementation, while bulk hydrogel stiffness and cell viability remained unchanged after biomechanical strain. Mechanotranscriptional responses were robustly altered within 4h in a hydrogel region-, strain-, and time-dependent manner. RNA sequencing revealed changes in gene expression related to cell morphology, division, senescence, hypoxia, metabolism, and ECM regulation. Morphometric analyses of strained ONH astrocytes showed reduced F-actin area coverage, increased GFAP, HIF-1, fibronectin, and collagen fibril reorganization. Our findings demonstrate that ONH astrocyte transcriptional responses are highly dependent on duration/magnitude of biomechanical strain and surrounding ECM density, corresponding with altered cell morphology, hypoxia, and ECM modification. This ONH astrocyte-encapsulated hydrogel provides a valuable platform for nuanced future manipulation of porosity, ECM composition, and cellularity to study the impact of biomechanical strain on ONH pathophysiology.

">Creativity Potential Networks: Brain Markers for Novelty and Feasibility of Upcoming Divergent Thinking Solutions</a></h4>

              
                The brain's resting-state activity can serve as an indicator of cognitive flexibility and predict the likelihood of an upcoming Aha experience. This suggests that spontaneous neural dynamics reflect a person's readiness for creative insight and underscore the potential of resting-state measures as biomarkers for anticipating creative breakthroughs. However, solutions accompanied by an Aha experience are not always truly creative, so it may be more valuable to identify biomarkers specifically linked to novelty and usefulness--two key dimensions of creative performance. To achieve this, we recruit 49 participants to complete the Alternative Uses Test, in which unconventional uses for everyday items are generated. We evaluate the responses for both novelty and feasibility using automated GPT-based methods and analyze resting-state EEG prior to the test. We find that creative performance is better predicted by interactions between different brain areas than by the activation of individual regions. Specifically, the degree centrality of theta-band functional connectivity in the right parietal and occipital areas correlates with novelty, while connectivity in the right middle and inferior frontal areas is associated with more feasible answers. These findings highlight distinct resting-state brain networks underlying the ''creative potential'' for novelty and feasibility, which could be leveraged to monitor and enhance brain flexibility.

">Humans Optimally Integrate Cutaneous and Proprioceptive Cues In Haptic Size Perception</a></h4>

              
                Sensory perception often relies on the brain's integration of multiple noisy inputs (cues), a process known as cue combination. Cue combination within the sense of touch has been understudied. Here, we investigated whether humans optimally combine haptic cutaneous and hand configuration cues when discerning the size (e.g., diameter) of a disk held edge-on between the thumb and index fingers. When these two fingers span the diameter of a disk to contact its perimeter, a hand configuration cue (relating to the perceived distance between the fingers) provides information about the disk's size. Less obviously, cutaneous cues to disk size may be provided simultaneously from the indentation of the skin caused by the curvature of the disk (smaller disks cause greater indentation). It is unknown whether humans make use of all these cues when perceiving the size of the held object, and if so, whether they integrate the cues optimally. We considered three hypotheses for how humans might use these cues: they might rely solely on the least noisy cue (Winner-Take-All Model, WTA), combine cues based on a simple arithmetic average (Average-Measurement Model, AVG), or combine cues via an optimal weighted average (Optimally-Weighted Model, OPT). In three experiments involving 34 participants, we measured the reliabilities of these cues and compared participant performance to the predictions of the three models. Each experiment tested participants using a two-interval forced-choice (2IFC) paradigm with 3D printed disk stimuli. On each trial, under occluded vision, participants felt two disks sequentially and responded which felt larger. Participants were tested with each finger's cutaneous cue alone, the configuration cue alone, and all three cues together. In two experiments, the disks presented were circular. In a third experiment, unknown to participants, some of the presented disks were oval-like cue-conflict stimuli. The improvement of accuracy observed in multi-cue conditions over single-cue conditions, and the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) shifts observed in cue-conflict conditions, were consistent with optimal cue combination. We conclude that humans are capable of combining haptic cutaneous and configuration cues optimally to judge the sizes of held objects.

">Regulation of Adult Zebrafish Retinal Regeneration by Lamβ1b-Chain-Containing Laminins</a></h4>

              
                Retinal degenerative diseases are a major cause of blindness in humans that often result in permanent and progressive loss of vision. Unlike humans, zebrafish possess the remarkable ability to regenerate lost retinal neurons through Muller glia (MG) reprogramming and asymmetric cell division to produce multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). While most studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying this regeneration process have focused on intracellular mechanisms, the role of the microenvironment surrounding retinal cells, the extracellular matrix (ECM), has been understudied. Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins, are principal components of the ECM basement membrane, and play important roles in vertebrate retinal development. Here, we examine the role of {beta}1b chain-containing laminins in the regenerative response of the zebrafish retina. We found that the zebrafish lamb1b gene is differentially expressed during MG reprogramming and MG and NPC proliferation during retinal regeneration. Further, we found that {beta}1b-containing laminins play important roles in regulating MG and NPC proliferation and neuroprotection of photoreceptors in light-damaged zebrafish retinas. Finally, Lam{beta}1b plays an important role in regulating the expression of integrin receptors and other laminin genes during the regeneration response. Taken together, Lam{beta}1b, and likely other ECM components, play a critical role in the MG-dependent neuronal regeneration response in the zebrafish retina.

">Blocking somatic repeat expansion and lowering huntingtin via RNA interference synergize to prevent Huntingtons disease pathogenesis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Huntingtons disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no approved therapies. Two major molecular drivers, somatic expansion of inherited CAG repeats and toxic mutant HTT (mHTT) variants, lead to neuronal dysfunction. Despite multiple trials, HTT-lowering strategies have not shown meaningful clinical benefit. Using therapeutic divalent siRNAs, we assessed the long-term impact of silencing MSH3 (a key regulator of somatic expansion), HTT, or both. In Q111 HD mice (>110 CAGs), which exhibit robust expansion, mHTT inclusions, and transcriptional dysregulation by 12 months, long-term MSH3 silencing blocked expansion, reduced inclusions, and reversed gene expression changes. HTT silencing alone had limited effect, but combined MSH3/HTT targeting synergistically eliminated inclusions and restored transcriptomic profiles. Parallel treatment in wild-type mice showed no toxicity, supporting the safety of long-term intervention. These findings position somatic expansion as a promising therapeutic target and demonstrate the potential of RNAi-based co-silencing of MSH3 and HTT as a disease-modifying strategy for HD.

">Spatially resolved mapping of histones reveal selective neuronal response in Rett syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Rett Syndrome (RTT), a severe neurological disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene, results in profound life-long neurological dysfunction. RTT patients live an apparently normal initial life until 12-18 months of age following which, a progressive accumulation of a wide range of phenotypic manifestations sets in. While MeCP2 is known to regulate chromatin, its impact on global histone composition and dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we combine mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and laser capture microdissection (LCM) coupled to LC-MS/MS to systematically profile histone proteoforms in three key brain regions: the dentate gyrus (DG) and cornu ammonis (CA) of the hippocampus, and the cerebellum (Cb). Our analysis reveals striking neuron-specific differences in histone composition between Mecp2-deficient and wildtype (WT) mice. Interestingly, the expression of a pathogenic Mecp2 missense mutant (Y120D) results in subtler changes in histone composition that are distinct from the null mutations. This study provides the first spatially resolved epigenetic atlas of histone proteoforms in RTT and suggests that Mecp2 loss perturbs chromatin homeostasis in a neuron- and mutation-dependent manner. Our findings underscore the critical need for cell-type-resolved analyses to unravel the mechanistic underpinnings of RTT and emphasize the importance of personalised therapeutic strategies that consider both the affected cell-type and particular Mecp2 mutation.

">Contralesional grey matter volume as an index of macrostructural plasticity in patients with brain tumors</a></h4>

              
                This research challenges the traditional localizationist view that brain tumors affect only regions directly associated with the lesion, by examining whether they also induce macrostructural alterations in the contralesional hemisphere. We applied Voxel-Based Morphometry, linear regression, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a cohort of 107 adults, including patients with gliomas in the language-dominant left hemisphere and healthy participants. Unlike previous studies, a subset of the clinical population was followed longitudinally for up to four months after oncological treatment, allowing us to describe the temporal progression of structural grey matter changes. Interestingly, a principal component model based on anomaly detection enabled robust differentiation between patients and controls. Patients exhibited significantly greater grey matter volume in the contralesional hemisphere compared to healthy participants, and these structural differences evolved over time, improving the model's AUC-ROC metrics. Although exploratory, a correlation analysis revealed that these structural changes were negatively associated with postsurgical cognitive performance. Together with the PCA findings, these results suggest that brain tumors induce extensive and dynamic adaptive mechanisms in the contralateral, unaffected hemisphere, likely reflecting altered patterns of structural covariance rather than simple regional volume increases. Understanding whether these changes could represent potential predictors of postoperative cognitive recovery is crucial for developing comprehensive clinical strategies.

">Beyond Pairwise Interactions: Charting Higher-Order Models of Brain Function</a></h4>

              
                Traditional models of brain connectivity have primarily focused on pairwise interactions, overlooking the rich dynamics that emerge from simultaneous interactions among multiple brain regions. Although a plethora of higher-order interaction (HOI) metrics have been proposed, a systematic evaluation of their comparative properties and utility is missing. Here, we present the first large-scale analysis of information-theoretic and topological HOI metrics, applied to both resting-state and task fMRI data from 100 unrelated subjects of the Human Connectome Project. We identify a clear taxonomy of HOI metrics - redundant, synergistic, and topological-, with the latter acting as bridges along the redundancy-synergy continuum. Despite methodological differences, all HOI metrics align with the brain's overarching unimodal-to-transmodal functional hierarchy. However, certain metrics show specific associations with the neurotransmitter receptor architecture. HOI metrics outperform traditional pairwise models in brain fingerprinting and perform comparably in task decoding, underscoring their value for characterizing individual functional profiles. Finally, multivariate analysis reveals that - among all HOI metrics - topological descriptors are key to linking brain function with behavioral variability, positioning them as valuable tools for linking neural architecture and cognitive function. Overall, our findings establish HOIs as a powerful framework for capturing the brain's multidimensional dynamics, providing a conceptual map to guide their application across cognitive and clinical neuroscience.

">MEGaNorm: Normative Modeling of MEG Brain Oscillations Across the Human Lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Normative modeling provides a principled framework for quantifying individual deviations from typical brain development and is increasingly used to study heterogeneity in neuropsychiatric conditions. While widely applied to structural phenotypes, functional normative models remain underdeveloped. Here, we introduce MEGaNorm, the first normative modeling framework for charting lifespan trajectories of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain oscillations. Using a large, multi-site dataset comprising 1,846 individuals aged 6-88 and spanning three MEG systems, we model relative oscillatory power in canonical frequency bands using hierarchical Bayesian regression, accounting for age, sex, and site effects. To support interpretation at multiple scales, we introduce Neuro-Oscillo Charts, visual tools that summarize normative trajectories at the population level and quantify individual-level deviations, enabling personalized assessment of functional brain dynamics. Applying this framework to a Parkinson's disease cohort (n = 160), we show that normative deviation scores reveal disease-related abnormalities and uncover a continuum of patients in theta-beta deviation space. This work provides the first lifespan-encompassing normative reference for MEG oscillations, enabling population-level characterization and individualized benchmarking. All models and tools are openly available and designed for federated, continual adaptation as new data become available, offering a scalable resource for precision neuropsychiatry.

">Safety processing shifts from hippocampal to network engagement across adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a critical period that requires balancing exploration of uncertain and novel environments while maintaining safety. This task requires sophisticated neural integration of threat and safety cues to guide behavior. Yet little work has been conducted on threat and safety processing outside of conditioning paradigms, which, while valuable, lack the complexity to identify how the adolescent brain supports distinguishing threat from safety when both are present and as task contingencies change. In the current study, we take an approach that expands on elements of differential conditioning as well as conditioned inhibition. We recorded brain responses to external threat and self-oriented protection cues to examine how the adolescent brain supports threat-safety discrimination using 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our findings reveal an adolescent transition in the neural mechanisms supporting accurate threat-safety discrimination, with younger adolescents (12-14 years) relying predominantly on the hippocampus and older adolescents (15-17 years) utilizing a more integrated circuit involving the hippocampus and anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) connectivity. Our results clarify how competition between threat and safety cues is resolved within the visual cortex, demonstrating enhanced perceptual sensitivity to protection that is independent of threat. By examining the dynamic encoding of safety to different stimuli, the current study advances our understanding of adolescent neurodevelopment and provides valuable insights into threat-safety discrimination beyond conventional conditioning models.

                Study Objectives: To investigate associations between social jetlag and developing brain circuits and structures in adolescents. Methods: N = 3507 youth (median (IQR) age = 12.0 (1.1) years; 50.9% females) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort were studied. Social jetlag (adjusted for sleep debt (SJLSC) versus non-adjusted (SJL)), topological properties and intrinsic dynamics of resting-state networks, and morphometric characteristics were analyzed. Results: Over 35% of participants had SJLSC [&ge;]2.0 h. Boys, Hispanic and Black non-Hispanic youth, and/or those at later pubertal stages had longer SJLSC ({beta}=0.06 to 0.68, CI=[0.02, 0.83], p[&le;]0.02), which was also associated with higher BMI ({beta}=0.13, CI=[0.08, 0.18], p<0.01). SJLSC and SJL were associated with weaker thalamic projections ({beta}=-0.22, CI=[-0.39, -0.05], p=0.03), potentially reflecting a disrupted sleep-wake cycle. Longer SJLSC was also associated with less topologically resilient and weakly connected salience network ({beta}=-0.04, CI=[-0.08, -0.01], p=0.04), and lower thickness and/or volume of cortical and subcortical structures overlapping with this and other networks supporting emotional and reward processing and regulation, and social function ({beta}=-0.08 to -0.05, CI=[-0.12, -0.01], p<0.05). SJLSC and SJL were associated with alterations in spontaneous brain activity and coordination that indicate disrupted neural maturation and plasticity. SJL was associated with lower information transfer between regions supporting sensorimotor integration, social function and emotion regulation ({beta}=-0.07 to -0.05, CI=[-0.12, -0.01], p<0.04). Conclusions: Misaligned sleep may have detrimental effects on adolescent brain circuit organization and dynamics, and structural characteristics of regions that play critical roles in cognitive function and regulation of fundamental biological processes.

">Autophagy activators normalize aberrant Tau proteostasis and rescue synapses in human familial Alzheimer's disease iPSC-derived cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide. Despite extensive progress, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AD remain incompletely understood, partially due to inadequate disease models. To illuminate the earliest changes in hereditary (familial) Alzheimer's disease, we developed an isogenic AD cerebrocortical organoid (CO) model. Our refined methodology produces COs containing excitatory and inhibitory neurons alongside glial cells, utilizing established isogenic wild-type and diseased human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) carrying heterozygous familial AD mutations, namely PSEN1 {Delta}E9/WT, PSEN1M146V/WT, or APPswe/WT. Our CO model reveals time-progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) species, loss of monomeric Tau, and accumulation of aggregated high-molecular-weight (HMW) phospho(p)-Tau. This is accompanied by neuronal hyperexcitability, as observed in early human AD cases on electroencephalography (EEG), and synapse loss. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses reveal significant differences in molecular abnormalities in excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons, helping explain AD clinical phenotypes. Finally, we show that chronic dosing with autophagy activators, including a novel CNS-penetrant mTOR inhibitor-independent drug candidate, normalizes pathologic accumulation of A{beta} and HMW p-Tau, normalizes hyperexcitability, and rescues synaptic loss in COs. Collectively, our results demonstrate these COs are a useful human AD model suitable for assessing early features of familial AD etiology and for testing drug candidates that ameliorate or prevent molecular AD phenotypes.

">Oscillatory markers of interoceptive attention: beta suppression as a neural signature of heartbeat processing</a></h4>

              
                Interoceptive attention - the ability to selectively focus on internal bodily signals - has been linked to distinct neural responses, yet the contribution of oscillatory dynamics to this process remains underexplored. This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive attention by examining beta-band power suppression during heartbeat and auditory discrimination tasks. Fifty-one healthy participants engaged in interoceptive (heartbeat detection) and exteroceptive (auditory discrimination) tasks while their brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The results revealed significant beta suppression time-locked to the R-peak in the somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, mid-cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 310 to 530 ms post-R-peak. Beta suppression was more pronounced during interoceptive attention, correlating positively with interoceptive accuracy. The findings support the notion that beta suppression in fronto-cingulo-somatosensory network may serve as a neural marker of interoceptive processing, contributing to predictive coding models of interoception. This study highlights the potential for using beta suppression as an objective measure of interoceptive accuracy and suggests that neural oscillations play a critical role in the brain's regulation of heartbeat-related information. Furthermore, the study proposes that interoceptive attention involves a top-down mechanism that dynamically adjusts the brain's response to cardiac afferent signals, enhancing the precision of interoceptive processing. These findings have implications for understanding how the brain integrates interoceptive signals and may provide insights into clinical applications targeting interoceptive dysfunctions.

Whereas the dlPFC is associated with the attentional control network (ACN), the insula and amygdala are associated with the salience and limbic networks, respectively. The default mode network (DMN), including the ventromedial PFC, also contributes to emotion regulation. The present study sought to determine if inter-network functional connectivity can dissociate reappraising from passively viewing a negative image using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Thirty-one participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging task in which they reappraised and viewed negative images. Behavioral and skin conductance response results indicated that reappraisal was associated with reductions in negative affect compared to viewing. The univariate connectivity analysis revealed that connections between aspects of the DMN and ACN differed between reappraising versus viewing negative images. Notably, the inter-network connectivity MVPA results demonstrated that whether one was reappraising versus viewing an image could be predicted better than chance, with several connections reliably contributing to the model, including those between ACN and DMN.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div> FOXG1 syndrome (FS) is a rare and devastating neurodevelopmental disorder affected by FOXG1 gene mutations and reduced sound tolerance has been reported in children with FS. Effects of single missense mutation of Foxg1 gene on auditory function and behavior were studied using the G216S mouse model. G216S mice showed significantly reduced gap-induced prepulse inhibition, suggesting poor temporal processing without hearing loss. Increased running and freezing behaviors under loud sounds were also found in G216 mice, suggesting aversive sound behaviors. Electrophysiological assessment of the auditory cortex of G216 mice revealed a slightly reduced amplitude and enlarged poststimulus responses to the sound stimulus. The layer function analysis using current source density revealed reduced layer–specific response in the G216S mice. Immunocytochemistry found Foxg1 gene mutation affects cortical layer differentiations and reduced cortical neurons, which are consistent with the physiological results. Our study suggests that the Foxg1 mutation impaired cortical development. The results are consistent with other models of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), suggesting that the G216S mouse model may represent a hyperacusis model of ASD. Our results provide direct evidence that a single-nucleotide mutation of the Foxg1 gene can affect cortical layer development and auditory processing and reduce sound tolerance.</span>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/6/ENEURO.0081-25.2025?rss=1">An Open-Source and Highly Adaptable Rodent Limited Bedding and Nesting Apparatus for Chronic Early Life Stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>Early life stress (ELS) increases susceptibility to cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction by disrupting the neurobiological systems that regulate these behaviors. Animal models provide a valuable tool for investigating the underlying mechanisms, enabling precise manipulation of stress exposure during development. The limited bedding and nesting (LBN) model, which induces maternal stress by restricting access to bedding and nesting materials in rodents, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of chronic ELS. While this paradigm has been widely adopted, variations in apparatus designs and subtle differences in methodologies could impact consistency across studies. Here, we provide standardized guidelines for a cost-effective open&ndash;source mouse LBN apparatus design, which could further enhance the model's utility while supporting pup survival. We additionally present our findings observed during the duration of the LBN paradigm, which spans from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 10, for both dams and pups. We observe comparable corticosterone in control and LBN dams from PND 3 to 5. However, from PND 6 to 10, corticosterone remains elevated in LBN dams, while control dams show a decline. Notably, the LBN paradigm disrupts maternal care, as LBN dams exhibit more frequent nest exits and stereotypic behaviors during the dark phase. At PND 10, pups exhibit significantly reduced blood serum corticosterone levels and lower body weight compared with those reared under control conditions. By providing open-source equipment and detailed experimental protocols, our work aims to build on existing LBN paradigms to further enhance the accessibility and reproducibility of chronic ELS models.</p>
