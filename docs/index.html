	<p>Previous studies have shown that Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) reduces food intake and body mass gain and regulates proteins related to lipid metabolism in obese rats. In ovariectomized rats, GbE restored the hippocampal and hypothalamic serotonergic system activity, favoring the spontaneous feeding decrement. Considering the promising hypophagic effect of GbE, this study aimed to investigate the effect of a single acute dose on hypothalamic pathways that regulate feeding behavior in male rats. Four-month-old Wistar male rats received either a single acute oral GbE dose (500 mg/kg) or vehicle. Food intake and body mass were measured after 1, 4, 12, and 24 h. Rats were euthanized, and hypothalami were removed for mRNA quantification of anorexigenic (POMC/CART) and orexigenic (AgRP/NPY) neuropeptides, leptin/serotonin receptors (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2C), and serotonin transporters. We also investigated POMC, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2C protein levels. A single acute GbE dose induced the hypothalamic POMC, CART, and 5-HT2C gene expression but failed to modify orexigenic effectors. No alterations in food intake, body mass, and hypothalamic protein levels were observed. In summary, the present findings demonstrate the rapid stimulation of pivotal hypothalamic anorexigenic pathways in response to a single GbE administration, reinforcing the GbE hypophagic activity. However, more studies are necessary to evaluate its potential as an appetite modulator.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Live Imaging of Primary Neurons in Long-Term Cryopreserved Human Nerve Tissue</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Tissue cryopreservation provides a convenient solution for tackling one of the major problems in neuroscience research, namely, the scarce availability of human nerve tissues, especially if needed alive. While brain tissue can be used only postmortem, live nerve tissue can reasonably well be harvested from the periphery. A valuable source of primary neurons is the intestine, which compared with brain has the advantage to be safely accessible via endoscopy. The nerve tissue innervating the intestine (the enteric nervous system; ENS) can be sampled with regular endoscopic biopsy forceps and remains viable for multiple physiological and immunohistochemical tests, as previously demonstrated. Here, we present a method to preserve, over longer periods of time, human primary neurons contained in these biopsies. The use of a cryoprotective agent and the application of controlled cooling revealed to be crucial to properly store the nerve tissue and to enable functional measurements after thawing. These primary neurons were evaluated for functionality (live imaging) and morphology (histology) up to one year after cryopreservation. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging indicated that human primary neurons remained viable and responded to selective stimulations (serotonergic and nicotinic agonists) after cryopreservation. Additionally, immunohistochemistry performed with specific neuronal markers showed that nerve structure and neuronal morphology were retained, with no signs of cellular damage. In this study, we demonstrate that the human ENS is a realistic source of primary neurons, which can be successfully preserved over long times and as such can be exploited both for gastrointestinal-specific as well as for general neuroscience research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">"Tripartite Synapses" in Taste Buds: A Role for Type I Glial-like Taste Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>In mammalian taste buds, Type I cells comprise half of all cells. These are termed "glial-like" based on morphologic and molecular features, but there are limited studies describing their function. We tested whether Type I cells sense chemosensory activation of adjacent chemosensory (i.e., Types II and III) taste bud cells, similar to synaptic glia. Using <I>Gad2</I>;;GCaMP3 mice of both sexes, we confirmed by immunostaining that, within taste buds, GCaMP expression is predominantly in Type I cells (with no Type II and 28% Type III cells expressing weakly). In dissociated taste buds, GCaMP+ Type I cells responded to bath-applied ATP (10-100 &mu;<scp>m</scp>) but not to 5-HT (transmitters released by Type II or III cells, respectively). Type I cells also did not respond to taste stimuli (5 &mu;<scp>m</scp> cycloheximide, 1 m<scp>m</scp> denatonium). In lingual slice preparations also, Type I cells responded to bath-applied ATP (10-100 &mu;<scp>m</scp>). However, when taste buds in the slice were stimulated with bitter tastants (cycloheximide, denatonium, quinine), Type I cells responded robustly. Taste-evoked responses of Type I cells in the slice preparation were significantly reduced by desensitizing purinoceptors or by purinoceptor antagonists (suramin, PPADS), and were essentially eliminated by blocking synaptic ATP release (carbenoxolone) or degrading extracellular ATP (apyrase). Thus, taste-evoked release of afferent ATP from type II chemosensory cells, in addition to exciting gustatory afferent fibers, also activates glial-like Type I taste cells. We speculate that Type I cells sense chemosensory activation and that they participate in synaptic signaling, similarly to glial cells at CNS tripartite synapses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most studies of taste buds view the chemosensitive excitable cells that express taste receptors as the sole mediators of taste detection and transmission to the CNS. Type I "glial-like" cells, with their ensheathing morphology, are mostly viewed as responsible for clearing neurotransmitters and as the "glue" holding the taste bud together. In the present study, we demonstrate that, when intact taste buds respond to their natural stimuli, Type I cells sense the activation of the chemosensory cells by detecting the afferent transmitter. Because Type I cells synthesize GABA, a known gliotransmitter, and cognate receptors are present on both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements, Type I cells may participate in GABAergic synaptic transmission in the manner of astrocytes at tripartite synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sustained ErbB Activation Causes Demyelination and Hypomyelination by Driving Necroptosis of Mature Oligodendrocytes and Apoptosis of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oligodendrocytes are vulnerable to genetic and environmental insults and its injury leads to demyelinating diseases. The roles of ErbB receptors in maintaining the CNS myelin integrity are largely unknown. Here, we overactivate ErbB receptors that mediate signaling of either neuregulin (NRG) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) family growth factors and found their synergistic activation caused deleterious outcomes in white matter. Sustained ErbB activation induced by the tetracycline-dependent mouse tool <I>Plp</I>-tTA resulted in demyelination, axonal degeneration, oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation, astrogliosis, and microgliosis in white matter. Moreover, there was hypermyelination before these inflammatory pathologic events. In contrast, sustained ErbB activation induced by another tetracycline-dependent mouse tool <I>Sox10</I><sup>+/rtTA</sup> caused hypomyelination in the corpus callosum and optic nerve, which appeared to be a developmental deficit and did not associate with OPC regeneration, astrogliosis, or microgliosis. By tracing the differentiation states of cells expressing tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA)/reverse tTA (rtTA)-dependent transgene or pulse-labeled reporter proteins <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>, we found that <I>Plp</I>-tTA targeted mainly mature oligodendrocytes (MOs), whereas <I>Sox10</I><sup>+/rtTA</sup> targeted OPCs and newly-formed oligodendrocytes (NFOs). The distinct phenotypes of mice with ErbB overactivation induced by <I>Plp</I>-tTA and <I>Sox10</I><sup>+/rtTA</sup> consolidated their nonoverlapping targeting preferences in the oligodendrocyte lineage, and enabled us to demonstrate that ErbB overactivation in MOs induced necroptosis that caused inflammatory demyelination, whereas in OPCs induced apoptosis that caused noninflammatory hypomyelination. Early interference with aberrant ErbB activation ceased oligodendrocyte deaths and restored myelin development in both mice. This study suggests that aberrant ErbB activation is an upstream pathogenetic mechanism of demyelinating diseases, providing a potential therapeutic target.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Primary oligodendropathy is one of the etiologic mechanisms for multiple sclerosis, and oligodendrocyte necroptosis is a pathologic hallmark in the disease. Moreover, the demyelinating disease is now a broad concept that embraces schizophrenia, in which white matter lesions are an emerging feature. ErbB overactivation has been implicated in schizophrenia by genetic analysis and postmortem studies. This study suggests the etiologic implications of ErbB overactivation in myelin pathogenesis and elucidates the pathogenetic mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Developmental Regulation of Homeostatic Plasticity in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Homeostatic plasticity maintains network stability by adjusting excitation, inhibition, or the intrinsic excitability of neurons, but the developmental regulation and coordination of these distinct forms of homeostatic plasticity remains poorly understood. A major contributor to this information gap is the lack of a uniform paradigm for chronically manipulating activity at different developmental stages. To overcome this limitation, we used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to directly suppress neuronal activity in layer2/3 (L2/3) of mouse primary visual cortex of either sex at two important developmental timepoints: the classic visual system critical period [CP; postnatal day 24 (P24) to P29], and adulthood (P45 to P55). We show that 24 h of DREADD-mediated activity suppression simultaneously induces excitatory synaptic scaling up and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons during the CP, consistent with previous observations using prolonged visual deprivation. Importantly, manipulations known to block these forms of homeostatic plasticity when induced pharmacologically or via visual deprivation also prevented DREADD-induced homeostatic plasticity. We next used the same paradigm to suppress activity in adult animals. Surprisingly, while excitatory synaptic scaling persisted into adulthood, intrinsic homeostatic plasticity was completely absent. Finally, we found that homeostatic changes in quantal inhibitory input onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons were absent during the CP but were present in adults. Thus, the same population of neurons can express distinct sets of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms at different development stages. Our findings suggest that homeostatic forms of plasticity can be recruited in a modular manner according to the evolving needs of a developing neural circuit.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Developing brain circuits are subject to dramatic changes in inputs that could destabilize activity if left uncompensated. This compensation is achieved through a set of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that provide slow, negative feedback adjustments to excitability. Given that circuits are subject to very different destabilizing forces during distinct developmental stages, the forms of homeostatic plasticity present in the network must be tuned to these evolving needs. Here we developed a method to induce comparable homeostatic compensation during distinct developmental windows and found that neurons in the juvenile and mature brain engage strikingly different forms of homeostatic plasticity. Thus, homeostatic mechanisms can be recruited in a modular manner according to the developmental needs of the circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence for Layer-Specific Connectional Heterogeneity in the Mouse Auditory Corticocollicular System</a></h4>

              
                <p>The auditory cortex (AC) sends long-range projections to virtually all subcortical auditory structures. One of the largest and most complex of these&mdash;the projection between AC and inferior colliculus (IC; the corticocollicular pathway)&mdash;originates from layer 5 and deep layer 6. Though previous work has shown that these two corticocollicular projection systems have different physiological properties and network connectivities, their functional organization is poorly understood. Here, using a combination of traditional and viral tracers combined with <I>in vivo</I> imaging in both sexes of the mouse, we observed that layer 5 and layer 6 corticocollicular neurons differ in their areas of origin and termination patterns. Layer 5 corticocollicular neurons are concentrated in primary AC, while layer 6 corticocollicular neurons emanate from broad auditory and limbic areas in the temporal cortex. In addition, layer 5 sends dense projections of both small and large (&gt;1 &micro;m<sup>2</sup> area) terminals to all regions of nonlemniscal IC, while layer 6 sends small terminals to the most superficial 50&ndash;100 &micro;m of the IC. These findings suggest that layer 5 and 6 corticocollicular projections are optimized to play distinct roles in corticofugal modulation. Layer 5 neurons provide strong, rapid, and unimodal feedback to the nonlemniscal IC, while layer 6 neurons provide heteromodal and limbic modulation diffusely to the nonlemniscal IC. Such organizational diversity in the corticocollicular pathway may help to explain the heterogeneous effects of corticocollicular manipulations and, given similar diversity in corticothalamic pathways, may be a general principle in top-down modulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We demonstrate that a major descending system in the brain is actually two systems. That is, the auditory corticocollicular projection, which exerts considerable influence over the midbrain, comprises two projections: one from layer 5 and the other from layer 6. The layer 6 projection is diffusely organized, receives multisensory inputs, and ends in small terminals; while the layer 5 projection is derived from a circumscribed auditory cortical area and ends in large terminals. These data suggest that the varied effects of cortical manipulations on the midbrain may be related to effects on two disparate systems. These findings have broader implications because other descending systems derive from two layers. Therefore, a duplex organization may be a common motif in descending control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Rhythmogenic Network States Drive Differential Opioid Responses in the In Vitro Respiratory Network</a></h4>

              
                <p>Death from opioid overdose is typically caused by opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). A particularly dangerous characteristic of OIRD is its apparent unpredictability. The respiratory consequences of opioids can be surprisingly inconsistent, even within the same individual. Despite significant clinical implications, most studies have focused on average dose&ndash;r esponses rather than individual variation, and there remains little insight into the etiology of this apparent unpredictability. The preBo&#x0308;tzinger complex (preBo&#x0308;tC) in the ventral medulla is an important site for generating the respiratory rhythm and OIRD. Here, using male and female C57-Bl6 mice <I>in vitro</I>, we demonstrate that the preBo&#x0308;tC can assume different network states depending on the excitability of the preBo&#x0308;tC and the intrinsic membrane properties of preBo&#x0308;tC neurons. These network states predict the functional consequences of opioids in the preBo&#x0308;tC, and depending on network state, respiratory rhythmogenesis can be either stabilized or suppressed by opioids. We hypothesize that the dynamic nature of preBo&#x0308;tC rhythmogenic properties, required to endow breathing with remarkable flexibility, also plays a key role in the dangerous unpredictability of OIRD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Opioids can cause unpredictable, life-threatening suppression of breathing. This apparent unpredictability makes clinical management of opioids difficult while also making it challenging to define the underlying mechanisms of OIRD. Here, we find in brainstem slices that the preBo&#x0308;tC, an opioid-sensitive subregion of the brainstem, has an optimal configuration of cellular and network properties that results in a maximally stable breathing rhythm. These properties are dynamic, and the state of each individual preBo&#x0308;tC network relative to the optimal configuration of the network predicts how vulnerable rhythmogenesis is to the effects of opioids. These insights establish a framework for understanding how endogenous and exogenous modulation of the rhythmogenic state of the preBo&#x0308;tC can increase or decrease the risk of OIRD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Medial Entorhinal Cortex Excitatory Neurons Are Necessary for Accurate Timing</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hippocampal region has long been considered critical for memory of time, and recent evidence shows that network operations and single-unit activity in the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) correlate with elapsed time. However, whether MEC activity is necessary for timing remains largely unknown. Here we expressed DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) under the CaMKIIa promoter to preferentially target MEC excitatory neurons for chemogenetic silencing, while freely moving male rats reproduced a memorized time interval by waiting inside a region of interest. We found that such silencing impaired the reproduction of the memorized interval and led to an overestimation of elapsed time. Trial history analyses under this condition revealed a reduced influence of previous trials on current waiting times, suggesting an impairment in maintaining temporal memories across trials. Moreover, using GLM (logistic regression), we show that decoding behavioral performance from preceding waiting times was significantly compromised when MEC was silenced. In addition to revealing an important role of MEC excitatory neurons for timing behavior, our results raise the possibility that these neurons contribute to such behavior by holding temporal information across trials.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures are implicated in processing temporal information. However, little is known about the role MTL structures, such as the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, play in perceiving or reproducing temporal intervals. By chemogenetically silencing medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) excitatory activity during a timing task, we show that this structure is necessary for the accurate reproduction of temporal intervals. Furthermore, trial history analyses suggest that silencing MEC disrupts memory mechanisms during timing. Together, these results suggest that MEC is necessary for timing behavior, possibly by representing the target interval in memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Precuneal Causal Loop Mediates External and Internal Information Integration in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human brains interpret external stimuli based on internal representations. One untested hypothesis is that the default-mode network (DMN), widely considered responsible for internally oriented cognition, can decode external information. Here, we posit that the unique structural and functional fingerprint of the precuneus (PCu) supports a prominent role for the posterior part of the DMN in this process. By analyzing the imaging data of 100 participants performing two attention-demanding tasks, we found that the PCu is functionally divided into dorsal and ventral subdivisions. We then conducted a comprehensive examination of their connectivity profiles and found that at rest, both the ventral PCu (vPCu) and dorsal PCu (dPCu) are mainly connected with the DMN but also are differentially connected with internally oriented networks (IoN) and externally oriented networks (EoN). During tasks, the double associations between the v/dPCu and the IoN/EoN are correlated with task performance and can switch depending on cognitive demand. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) revealed that the strength and direction of the effective connectivity (EC) between v/dPCu is modulated by task difficulty in a manner potentially dictated by the balance of internal versus external cognitive demands. Our study provides evidence that the posterior medial part of the DMN may drive interactions between large-scale networks, potentially allowing access to stored representations for moment-to-moment interpretation of an ever-changing environment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The default-mode network (DMN) is widely known for its association with internalized thinking processes, e.g., spontaneous thoughts, which is the most interesting but least understood component in human consciousness. The precuneus (PCu), a posteromedial DMN hub, is thought to play a role in this, but a mechanistic explanation has not yet been established. In this study we found that the associations between ventral PCu (vPCu)/dorsal PCu (dPCu) subdivisions and internally oriented network (IoN)/externally oriented network (EoN) are flexibly modulated by cognitive demand and correlate with task performance. We further propose that the recurrent causal connectivity between the ventral and dorsal PCu supports conscious processing by constantly interpreting external information based on an internal model, meanwhile updating the internal model with the incoming information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Long-Range Respiratory and Theta Oscillation Networks Depend on Spatial Sensory Context</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural oscillations can couple networks of brain regions, especially at lower frequencies. The nasal respiratory rhythm, which elicits robust olfactory bulb oscillations, has been linked to episodic memory, locomotion, and exploration, along with widespread oscillatory coherence. The piriform cortex is implicated in propagating the olfactory-bulb-driven respiratory rhythm, but this has not been tested explicitly in the context of both hippocampal theta and nasal respiratory rhythm during exploratory behaviors. We investigated systemwide interactions during foraging behavior, which engages respiratory and theta rhythms. Local field potentials from the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, and CA1 of hippocampus, primary visual cortex, and nasal respiration were recorded simultaneously from male rats. We compared interactions among these areas while rats foraged using either visual or olfactory spatial cues. We found high coherence during foraging compared with home cage activity in two frequency bands that matched slow and fast respiratory rates. Piriform cortex and hippocampus maintained strong coupling at theta frequency during periods of slow respiration, whereas other pairs showed coupling only at the fast respiratory frequency. Directional analysis shows that the modality of spatial cues was matched to larger influences in the network by the respective primary sensory area. Respiratory and theta rhythms also coupled to faster oscillations in primary sensory and hippocampal areas. These data provide the first evidence of widespread interactions among nasal respiration, olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, and hippocampus in awake freely moving rats, and support the piriform cortex as an integrator of respiratory and theta activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent studies have shown widespread interactions between the nasally driven respiratory rhythm and neural oscillations in hippocampus and neocortex. With this study, we address how the respiratory rhythm interacts with ongoing slow brain rhythms across olfactory, hippocampal, and visual systems in freely moving rats. Patterns of network connectivity change with behavioral state, with stronger interactions at fast and slow respiratory frequencies during foraging as compared with home cage activity. Routing of interactions between sensory cortices depends on the modality of spatial cues present during foraging. Functional connectivity and cross-frequency coupling analyses suggest strong bidirectional interactions between olfactory and hippocampal systems related to respiration and point to the piriform cortex as a key area for mediating respiratory and theta rhythms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Maternal Immune Activation during Pregnancy Alters Postnatal Brain Growth and Cognitive Development in Nonhuman Primate Offspring</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human epidemiological studies implicate exposure to infection during gestation in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Animal models of maternal immune activation (MIA) have identified the maternal immune response as the critical link between maternal infection and aberrant offspring brain and behavior development. Here we evaluate neurodevelopment of male rhesus monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) born to MIA-treated dams (<I>n</I> = 14) injected with a modified form of the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid at the end of the first trimester. Control dams received saline injections at the same gestational time points (<I>n</I> = 10) or were untreated (<I>n</I> = 4). MIA-treated dams exhibited a strong immune response as indexed by transient increases in sickness behavior, temperature, and inflammatory cytokines. Although offspring born to control or MIA-treated dams did not differ on measures of physical growth and early developmental milestones, the MIA-treated animals exhibited subtle changes in cognitive development and deviated from species-typical brain growth trajectories. Longitudinal MRI revealed significant gray matter volume reductions in the prefrontal and frontal cortices of MIA-treated offspring at 6 months that persisted through the final time point at 45 months along with smaller frontal white matter volumes in MIA-treated animals at 36 and 45 months. These findings provide the first evidence of early postnatal changes in brain development in MIA-exposed nonhuman primates and establish a translationally relevant model system to explore the neurodevelopmental trajectory of risk associated with prenatal immune challenge from birth through late adolescence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Women exposed to infection during pregnancy have an increased risk of giving birth to a child who will later be diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder. Preclinical maternal immune activation (MIA) models have demonstrated that the effects of maternal infection on fetal brain development are mediated by maternal immune response. Since the majority of MIA models are conducted in rodents, the nonhuman primate provides a unique system to evaluate the MIA hypothesis in a species closely related to humans. Here we report the first longitudinal study conducted in a nonhuman primate MIA model. MIA-exposed offspring demonstrate subtle changes in cognitive development paired with marked reductions in frontal gray and white matter, further supporting the association between prenatal immune challenge and alterations in offspring neurodevelopment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contralateral Projection of Anterior Cingulate Cortex Contributes to Mirror-Image Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long-term limb nerve injury often leads to mirror-image pain (MIP), an abnormal pain sensation in the limb contralateral to the injury. Although it is clear that MIP is mediated in part by central nociception processing, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key brain region that receives relayed peripheral nociceptive information from the contralateral limb. In this study, we induced MIP in male mice, in which a unilateral chronic constrictive injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI) induced a decreased nociceptive threshold in both hind limbs and an increased number of c-Fos-expressing neurons in the ACC both contralateral and ipsilateral to the injured limb. Using viral-mediated projection mapping, we observed that a portion of ACC neurons formed monosynaptic connections with contralateral ACC neurons. Furthermore, the number of cross-callosal projection ACC neurons that exhibited c-Fos signal was increased in MIP-expressing mice, suggesting enhanced transmission between ACC neurons of the two hemispheres. Moreover, selective inhibition of the cross-callosal projection ACC neurons contralateral to the injured limb normalized the nociceptive sensation of the uninjured limb without affecting the increased nociceptive sensation of the injured limb in CCI mice. In contrast, inhibition of the non&ndash;cross-callosal projection ACC neurons contralateral to the injury normalized the nociceptive sensation of the injured limb without affecting the MIP exhibited in the uninjured limb. These results reveal a circuit mechanism, namely, the cross-callosal projection of ACC between two hemispheres, that contributes to MIP and possibly other forms of contralateral migration of pain sensation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mirror-image pain (MIP) refers to the increased pain sensitivity of the contralateral body part in patients with chronic pain. This pathology requires central processing, yet the mechanisms are less known. Here, we demonstrate that the cross-callosal projection neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) contralateral to the injury contribute to MIP exhibited in the uninjured limb, but do not affect nociceptive sensation of the injured limb. In contrast, the non&ndash;cross-callosal projection neurons in the ACC contralateral to the injury contribute to nociceptive sensation of the injured limb, but do not affect MIP exhibited in the uninjured limb. Our study depicts a novel cross-callosal projection of ACC that contributes to MIP, providing a central mechanism for MIP in chronic pain state.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Arcuate Nucleus Overexpression of NHLH2 Reduces Body Mass and Attenuates Obesity-Associated Anxiety/Depression-like Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nescient helix-loop-helix 2 (NHLH2) is a hypothalamic transcription factor that controls the expression of prohormone convertase 1/3, therefore having an impact on the processing of proopiomelanocortin and thus on energy homeostasis. Studies have shown that KO of <I>Nhlh2</I> results in increased body mass, reduced physical activity, and hypogonadism. In humans, a polymorphism of the <I>NHLH2</I> gene is associated with obesity; and in Prader&ndash;Willi syndrome, a condition characterized by obesity, hypogonadism and behavioral abnormalities, the expression of NHLH2 is reduced. Despite clinical and experimental evidence suggesting that NHLH2 could be a good target for the treatment of obesity, no previous study has evaluated the impact of NHLH2 overexpression in obesity. Here, in mice fed a high-fat diet introduced right after the arcuate nucleus intracerebroventricular injection of a lentivirus that promoted 40% increase in NHLH2, there was prevention of the development of obesity by a mechanism dependent on the reduction of caloric intake. When hypothalamic overexpression of NHLH2 was induced in previously obese mice, the beneficial impact on obesity-associated phenotype was even greater; thus, there was an 80% attenuation in body mass gain, reduced whole-body adiposity, increased brown adipose tissue temperature, reduced hypothalamic inflammation, and reduced liver steatosis. In this setting, the beneficial impact of hypothalamic overexpression of NHLH2 was a result of combined effects on caloric intake, energy expenditure, and physical activity. Moreover, the hypothalamic overexpression of NHLH2 reduced obesity-associated anxiety/depression behavior. Thus, we provide an experimental proof of concept supporting that hypothalamic NHLH2 is a good target for the treatment of obesity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Obesity is a highly prevalent medical condition that lacks an effective treatment. The main advance provided by this study is the demonstration of the beneficial metabolic and behavioral outcomes resulting from the overexpression of NHLH2 in the hypothalamus. When NHLH2 was overexpressed simultaneously with the introduction of a high-fat diet, there was prevention of obesity by a mechanism dependent on reduced caloric intake. Conversely, when NHLH2 was overexpressed in previously obese mice, there was reduction of the obese phenotype because of a combination of reduced caloric intake, increased physical activity, and increased thermogenesis. In addition, the overexpression of NHLH2 reduced anxiety/depression-like behavior. Thus, NHLH2 emerges as a potential target for the combined treatment of obesity and its associated anxiety/depression-like behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">D2-Like Receptor Expression in the Hippocampus and Amygdala Informs Performance on the Stop-Signal Task in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>The stop-signal task is a well-established assessment of response inhibition, and in humans, proficiency is linked to dorsal striatum D<SUB>2</SUB> receptor availability. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by changes to efficiency of response inhibition. Here, we studied 17 PD patients (6 female and 11 male) using the stop-signal paradigm in a single-blinded <scp>d</scp>-amphetamine (dAMPH) study. Participants completed [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride positron emission topography (PET) imaging in both placebo and dAMPH conditions. A voxel-wise analysis of the relationship between binding potential (BP<SUB>ND</SUB>) and stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) revealed that faster SSRT is associated with greater D<SUB>2</SUB>-like BP<SUB>ND</SUB> in the amygdala and hippocampus (right cluster <I>q</I><SUB>FDR-corr</SUB> = 0.026, left cluster <I>q</I><SUB>FDR-corr</SUB> = 0.002). A region of interest (ROI) examination confirmed this association in both the amygdala (coefficient = &ndash;48.26, <I>p</I> = 0.005) and hippocampus (coefficient = &ndash;104.94, <I>p</I> = 0.007). As healthy dopaminergic systems in the dorsal striatum appear to regulate response inhibition, we interpret our findings in PD to indicate either nigrostriatal damage unmasking a mesolimbic contribution to response inhibition, or a compensatory adaptation from the limbic and mesial temporal dopamine systems. These novel results expand the conceptualization of action-control networks, whereby limbic and motor loops may be functionally connected.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While Parkinson's disease (PD) is characteristically recognized for its motor symptoms, some patients develop impulsive and compulsive behaviors (ICBs), manifested as repetitive and excessive participation in reward-driven activities, including sex, gambling, shopping, eating, and hobbyism. Such cognitive alterations compel a consideration of response inhibition in PD. To investigate inhibitory control and assess the brain regions that may participate, we assessed PD patients using a single-blinded <scp>d</scp>-amphetamine (dAMPH) study, with [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride positron emission topography (PET) imaging, and stop-signal task performance. We find a negative relationship between D<SUB>2</SUB>-like binding in the mesial temporal region and top-signal reaction time (SSRT), with greater BP<SUB>ND</SUB> associated with a faster SSRT. These discoveries indicate a novel role for mesolimbic dopamine in response inhibition, and advocate for limbic regulation of action control in this clinical population.</p>

                Background: Hospitalizations of nursing home residents are associated with various health risks. Previous research indicates that, to some extent, hospitalizations of this vulnerable population may be inappropriate and even avoidable. This study aimed to develop a consensus list of hospital discharge diagnoses considered to be nursing home-sensitive, i.e., avoidable. Methods: The study combined analyses of routine data from six statutory health insurance companies in Germany and a two-stage Delphi panel, enhanced by expert workshop discussions, to identify and corroborate relevant diagnoses. Experts from four different disciplines estimated the proportion of hospitalizations that could potentially have been prevented under optimal conditions.   Results: We analyzed frequencies and costs of data for hospital admissions from 242,236 nursing home residents provided by statutory health insurance companies. We identified 117 hospital discharge diagnoses, which had a frequency of at least 0.1%. We recruited experts (primary care physicians, hospital specialists, nursing home professionals and researchers) to estimate the proportion of potentially avoidable hospitalizations for the 117 diagnoses deemed avoidable in two Delphi rounds (n=107 in Delphi Round 1 and n=96 in Delphi Round 2, effective response rate=91%). A total of 35 diagnoses with high and consistent estimates of the proportion of potentially avoidable hospitalizations were identified as nursing home-sensitive. In an expert workshop (n=16), a further 25 diagnoses were discussed that had not reached the criteria, of which another 23 were consented to be nursing home-sensitive conditions. Extrapolating the frequency and mean costs of these 58 diagnoses to the national German context yielded total potentially avoidable care costs of €768,304,547, associated with 219,955 nursing home-sensitive hospital admissions. Conclusion: A total of 58 nursing home-relevant diagnoses (ICD-10-GM three-digit level) were classified as nursing home-sensitive using an adapted Delphi procedure. Interventions should be developed to avoid hospital admission from nursing homes for these diagnoses.

                Background: By diagnosing using fundus images, ophthalmologists can possibly detect symptoms of retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal detachment. A number of studies have also found some links between fundus image analysis data and other underlying systemic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and kidney dysfunction. Now that imaging technology is advancing further, more fundus cameras are currently equipped with the capability to produce high resolution fundus images. One of the public databases for high-resolution fundus images called High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) is consistently used for validating vessel segmentation algorithms. However, it is noticed that the segmentation outputs from the HRF database normally include noisy pixels near the upper and lower edges of the image. In this study, we propose an enhanced method of pre-processing the images so that these noisy pixels can be eliminated, and thus the overall segmentation performance can be increased. Without eliminating the noisy pixels, the visual segmentation output shows a large number of false positive pixels near the top and bottom edges. Methods: The proposed method involves adding additional padding to the image before the segmentation procedure is applied. In this study, the Bar-Combination Of Shifted FIlter REsponses (B-COSFIRE) filter is used for retinal vessel segmentation. Results: Qualitative assessment of the segmentation results when using the proposed method showed improvement in terms of noisy pixel removal from near the edges. Quantitatively, the additional padding step improves all considered metrics for vessel segmentation, namely Sensitivity (73.76%), Specificity (97.53%), and Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) value (71.57%) for the HRF database. Conclusions: Findings from this study indicate improvement in the overall segmentation performance when using the proposed double-padding method of pre-processing the fundus image prior to segmentation. In the future, more databases with various resolutions and modalities can be included for further validation.

                <p>by Katarína Bod’ová, Enikő Szép, Nicholas H. Barton</p>

Realistic models of biological processes typically involve interacting components on multiple scales, driven by changing environment and inherent stochasticity. Such models are often analytically and numerically intractable. We revisit a dynamic maximum entropy method that combines a static maximum entropy with a quasi-stationary approximation. This allows us to reduce stochastic non-equilibrium dynamics expressed by the Fokker-Planck equation to a simpler low-dimensional deterministic dynamics, without the need to track microscopic details. Although the method has been previously applied to a few (rather complicated) applications in population genetics, our main goal here is to explain and to better understand how the method works. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method for two widely studied stochastic problems, highlighting its accuracy in capturing important macroscopic quantities even in rapidly changing non-stationary conditions. For the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the method recovers the exact dynamics whilst for a stochastic island model with migration from other habitats, the approximation retains high macroscopic accuracy under a wide range of scenarios in a dynamic environment.

Variants of the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model of Kermack & McKendrick (1927) enjoy wide application in epidemiology, offering simple yet powerful inferential and predictive tools in the study of diverse infectious diseases across human, animal and plant populations. Direct transmission models (DTM) are a subset of these that treat the processes of disease transmission as comprising a series of discrete instantaneous events. Infections transmitted indirectly by persistent environmental pathogens, however, are examples where a DTM description might fail and are perhaps better described by models that comprise explicit environmental transmission routes, so-called environmental transmission models (ETM). In this paper we discuss the stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) DTM and susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-pathogen (SEIR-P) ETM and we show that the former is the timescale separation limit of the latter, with ETM host-disease dynamics increasingly resembling those of a DTM when the pathogen’s characteristic timescale is shortened, relative to that of the host population. Using graphical posterior predictive checks (GPPC), we investigate the validity of the SEIR model when fitted to simulated SEIR-P host infection and removal times. Such analyses demonstrate how, in many cases, the SEIR model is robust to departure from direct transmission. Finally, we present a case study of white spot disease (WSD) in penaeid shrimp with rates of environmental transmission and pathogen decay (SEIR-P model parameters) estimated using published results of experiments. Using SEIR and SEIR-P simulations of a hypothetical WSD outbreak management scenario, we demonstrate how relative shortening of the pathogen timescale comes about in practice. With atttempts to remove diseased shrimp from the population every 24h, we see SEIR and SEIR-P model outputs closely conincide. However, when removals are 6-hourly, the two models’ mean outputs diverge, with distinct predictions of outbreak size and duration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RNA editing regulates lncRNA splicing in human early embryo development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiajun Qiu, Xiao Ma, Fanyi Zeng, Jingbin Yan</p>

RNA editing is a co- or post-transcriptional modification through which some cells can make discrete changes to specific nucleotide sequences within an RNA molecule after transcription. Previous studies found that RNA editing may be critically involved in cancer and aging. However, the function of RNA editing in human early embryo development is still unclear. In this study, through analyzing single cell RNA sequencing data, 36.7% RNA editing sites were found to have a have differential editing ratio among early embryo developmental stages, and there was a great reprogramming of RNA editing rates at the 8-cell stage, at which most of the differentially edited RNA editing sites (99.2%) had a decreased RNA editing rate. In addition, RNA editing was more likely to occur on RNA splicing sites during human early embryo development. Furthermore, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) editing sites were found more likely to be on RNA splicing sites (odds ratio = 2.19, P = 1.37×10<sup>−8</sup>), while mRNA editing sites were less likely (odds ratio = 0.22, P = 8.38×10<sup>−46</sup>). Besides, we found that the RNA editing rate on lncRNA had a significantly higher correlation coefficient with the percentage spliced index (PSI) of lncRNA exons (R = 0.75, P = 4.90×10<sup>−16</sup>), which indicated that RNA editing may regulate lncRNA splicing during human early embryo development. Finally, functional analysis revealed that those RNA editing-regulated lncRNAs were enriched in signal transduction, the regulation of transcript expression, and the transmembrane transport of mitochondrial calcium ion. Overall, our study might provide a new insight into the mechanism of RNA editing on lncRNAs in human developmental biology and common birth defects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Priorities for research in child and adolescent anxiety and depression: a priority setting partnership with youth and professionals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A starting point for evaluating the effectiveness of treatments should be to identify evidence gaps. Furthermore, such evaluations should consider the perspectives of patients, clinicians and carers to ensure relevance and potentially influence future research initiatives. Methods: Our approach, inspired by the James Lind Alliance methods, involved three steps. First, we performed a document analysis by identifying interventions and outcomes in two recently published overviews of systematic reviews, which summarised the effects of interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. Second, we surveyed children and adolescents with personal experiences of depression or anxiety as well as clinicians, and asked them to suggest treatments and outcomes associated with uncertainty. Finally, we facilitated a consensus process where clinicians and youth mental health patient representatives were invited to prioritise research uncertainties in separate consensus processes. Results: The survey included 674 respondents who reported a total of 1267 uncertainties. Independent coding by four investigators revealed 134 suggestions for treatments of anxiety, 90 suggestions for treatments of depression, 84 for outcomes of interventions for anxiety and 71 suggestions for outcomes of interventions for depression. Two separate priority setting workshops with eight clinicians and ten youth resulted in four independent top ten priority lists. Conclusion: Top ten lists of treatments and outcome domains of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents was identified by youth and clinicians. The results may influence the research agenda, and ultimately benefit patients.

                Ludwig’s angina (LA) is a rapidly spreading and potentially life-threatening infection having an odontogenic infection as the most common source. It involves the floor of the mouth and neck. Modernization in medical care has made this entity rare and of low mortality at the present but it is still feared as a lethal entity due to rapidly progressive airway obstruction that follows. Here we report a case of a 15-year-old male who suffered from LA. Presenting symptoms and findings of the examination helped in the clinical diagnosis. Immediate intubation, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and treatment of complications aided the patient’s recovery. LA should be considered for differential diagnosis in the case of neck swelling especially in those having a history of poor oral hygiene and recent dental procedures. Management of LA and its complications should always involve doctors from multiple disciplines.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">Unraveling the mysteries of MYT1L: From reprogramming factor to multifaceted regulator of neuronal differentiation</a></h4>

              
                In this issue of Neuron, Chen et al. (2021) generated a mouse model for haploinsufficiency of MYT1L. MYT1L is widely used in neuronal reprogramming, and de novo mutations have been linked to a neurodevelopmental syndrome. Extensive characterization in this study better delineates MYT1L’s role in transcriptional regulation and neuronal differentiation.

                In this issue of Neuron, Duan et al. (2021) identified excessive mitophagy in BLA neurons synapsing onto adBNST neurons as a mechanism for reduced neurotransmission and social defeat-induced anxiety-like behaviors.

Here the authors show histone variant H2A.Z deposition precedes RNA polymerase II binding on chromatin, before ZGA. H2A.Z loss causes transcriptional downregulation of ZGA genes and leads to changes in the 3D genome organization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">MCPH1 inhibits condensin II during interphase by regulating its SMC2-kleisin interface</a></h4>

              
                The dramatic change in morphology of chromosomal DNAs between interphase and mitosis is one of the defining features of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Two types of enzymes, namely cohesin and condensin confer the topology of chromosomal DNA by extruding DNA loops. While condensin normally configures chromosomes exclusively during mitosis, cohesin does so during interphase. The processivity of cohesin’s loop extrusion during interphase is limited by a regulatory factor called WAPL, which induces cohesin to dissociate from chromosomes via a mechanism that requires dissociation of its kleisin from the neck of SMC3. We show here that a related mechanism may be responsible for blocking condensin II from acting during interphase. Cells derived from patients affected by microcephaly caused by mutations in the MCPH1 gene undergo premature chromosome condensation but it has never been established for certain whether MCPH1 regulates condensin II directly. We show that deletion of <i>Mcph1</i> in mouse embryonic stem cells unleashes an activity of condensin II that triggers formation of compact chromosomes in G1 and G2 phases, which is accompanied by enhanced mixing of A and B chromatin compartments, and that this occurs even in the absence of CDK1 activity. Crucially, inhibition of condensin II by MCPH1 depends on the binding of a short linear motif within MCPH1 to condensin II's NCAPG2 subunit. We show that the activities of both Cohesin and Condensin II may be restricted during interphase by similar types of mechanisms as MCPH1's ability to block condensin II's association with chromatin is abrogated by the fusion of SMC2 with NCAPH2. Remarkably, in the absence of both WAPL and MCPH1, cohesin and condensin II transform chromosomal DNAs of G2 cells into chromosomes with a solenoidal axis showing that both cohesin and condensin must be tightly regulated to adjust the structure of chromatids for their successful segregation.

                Forager focus on wild cereal plants has been documented in the core zone of domestication in southwestern Asia, while evidence for forager use of wild grass grains remains sporadic elsewhere. In this paper, we present starch grain and phytolith analyses of dental calculus from 60 Mesolithic and Early Neolithic individuals from five sites in the Danube Gorges of the central Balkans. This zone was inhabited by likely complex Holocene foragers for several millennia before the appearance of the first farmers ~6200 cal BC. We also analyzed forager ground stone tools for evidence of plant processing. Our results based on the study of dental calculus show that certain species of Poaceae (species of the genus <i>Aegilops</i>) were used since the Early Mesolithic, while ground stone tools exhibit traces of a developed grass grain processing technology. The adoption of domesticated plants in this region after ~6500 cal BC might have been eased by the existing familiarity with wild cereals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Histone H1 prevents non-CG methylation-mediated small RNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis heterochromatin</a></h4>

              
                Flowering plants utilize small RNA molecules to guide DNA methyltransferases to genomic sequences. This RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway preferentially targets euchromatic transposable elements. However, RdDM is thought to be recruited by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me), a hallmark of heterochromatin. How RdDM is targeted to euchromatin despite an affinity for H3K9me is unclear. Here we show that loss of histone H1 enhances heterochromatic RdDM, preferentially at nucleosome linker DNA. Surprisingly, this does not require SHH1, the RdDM component that binds H3K9me. Furthermore, H3K9me is dispensable for RdDM, as is CG DNA methylation. Instead, we find that non-CG methylation is specifically associated with small RNA biogenesis, and without H1 small RNA production quantitatively expands to non-CG methylated loci. Our results demonstrate that H1 enforces the separation of euchromatic and heterochromatic DNA methylation pathways by excluding the small RNA-generating branch of RdDM from non-CG methylated heterochromatin.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Disentangling bias between Gq, GRK2, and arrestin3 recruitment to the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor</a></h4>

              
                G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transmit extracellular signals to the inside by activation of intracellular effector proteins. Different agonists can promote differential receptor-induced signaling responses – termed bias – potentially by eliciting different levels of recruitment of effector proteins. As activation and recruitment of effector proteins might influence each other, thorough analysis of bias is difficult. Here, we compared the efficacy of seven agonists to induce G protein, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), as well as arrestin3 binding to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M<sub>3</sub> by utilizing FRET-based assays. In order to avoid interference between these interactions, we studied GRK2 binding in the presence of inhibitors of G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>q</sub> proteins and analyzed arrestin3 binding to prestimulated M<sub>3 </sub>receptors to avoid differences in receptor phosphorylation influencing arrestin recruitment. We measured substantial differences in the agonist efficacies to induce M<sub>3</sub>R-arrestin3 versus M<sub>3</sub>R-GRK2 interaction. However, the rank order of the agonists for G protein- and GRK2-M<sub>3</sub>R interaction was the same, suggesting that G protein and GRK2 binding to M<sub>3</sub>R requires similar receptor conformations, whereas requirements for arrestin3 binding to M<sub>3</sub>R are distinct.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptional profiling of sequentially generated septal neuron fates</a></h4>

              
                The septum is a ventral forebrain structure known to regulate innate behaviors. During embryonic development, septal neurons are produced in multiple proliferative areas from neural progenitors following transcriptional programs that are still largely unknown. Here, we use a combination of single cell RNA sequencing, histology and genetic models to address how septal neuron diversity is established during neurogenesis. We find that the transcriptional profiles of septal progenitors change along neurogenesis, coinciding with the generation of distinct neuron types. We characterize the septal eminence, an anatomically distinct and transient proliferative zone composed of progenitors with distinctive molecular profiles, proliferative capacity and fate potential compared to the rostral septal progenitor zone. We show that <i>Nkx2.1</i>-expressing septal eminence progenitors give rise to neurons belonging to at least three morphological classes, born in temporal cohorts that are distributed across different septal nuclei in a sequential fountain-like pattern. Our study provides insight into the molecular programs that control the sequential production of different neuronal types in the septum, a structure with important roles in regulating mood and motivation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cyclin F drives proliferation through SCF-dependent degradation of the retinoblastoma-like tumor suppressor p130/RBL2</a></h4>

              
                Cell cycle gene expression programs fuel proliferation and are universally dysregulated in cancer. The retinoblastoma (RB)-family of proteins, RB1, RBL1/p107 and RBL2/p130, coordinately repress cell cycle gene expression, inhibiting proliferation and suppressing tumorigenesis. Phosphorylation of RB-family proteins by cyclin dependent kinases is firmly established. Like phosphorylation, ubiquitination is essential to cell cycle control, and numerous proliferative regulators, tumor suppressors, and oncoproteins are ubiquitinated. However, little is known about the role of ubiquitin signaling in controlling RB-family proteins. A systems genetics analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 screens suggested the potential regulation of the RB-network by cyclin F, a substrate recognition receptor for the SCF family of E3 ligases. We demonstrate that RBL2/p130 is a direct substrate of SCF<sup>cyclin F</sup>. We map a cyclin F regulatory site to a flexible linker in the p130 pocket domain, and show that this site mediates binding, stability, and ubiquitination. Expression of a mutant version of p130, which cannot be ubiquitinated, severely impaired proliferative capacity and cell cycle progression. Consistently, we observed reduced expression of cell cycle gene transcripts, as well a reduced abundance of cell cycle proteins, analyzed by quantitative, iterative immunofluorescent imaging. These data suggest a key role for SCF<sup>cyclin F</sup> in the CDK-RB network and raise the possibility that aberrant p130 degradation could dysregulate the cell cycle in human cancers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure and function of axo-axonic inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory neurons in mammalian cortex exhibit diverse physiological, morphological, molecular and connectivity signatures. While considerable work has measured the average connectivity of several interneuron classes, there remains a fundamental lack of understanding of the connectivity distribution of distinct inhibitory cell types with synaptic resolution, how it relates to properties of target cells and how it affects function. Here, we used large-scale electron microscopy and functional imaging to address these questions for chandelier cells in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex. With dense reconstructions from electron microscopy, we mapped the complete chandelier input onto 153 pyramidal neurons. We found that synapse number is highly variable across the population and is correlated with several structural features of the target neuron. This variability in the number of axo-axonic ChC synapses is higher than the variability seen in perisomatic inhibition. Biophysical simulations show that the observed pattern of axo-axonic inhibition is particularly effective in controlling excitatory output when excitation and inhibition are co-active. Finally, we measured chandelier cell activity in awake animals using a cell-type specific calcium imaging approach and saw highly correlated activity across chandelier cells. In the same experiments, <i>in vivo</i> chandelier population activity correlated with pupil dilation, a proxy for arousal. Together these results suggest that chandelier cells provide a circuit-wide signal whose strength is adjusted relative to the properties of target neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporally stable beta sensorimotor oscillations and cortico-muscular coupling underlie force steadiness</a></h4>

              
                As humans, we seamlessly hold objects in our hands, and may even lose consciousness of these objects. This phenomenon raises the unsettled question of the involvement of the cerebral cortex, the core area for voluntary motor control, in dynamically maintaining steady muscle force. To address this issue, we measured magnetoencephalographic brain activity from healthy adults who maintained a steady pinch grip. Using a novel analysis approach, we uncovered fine-grained temporal modulations in the ~20-Hz sensorimotor brain rhythm and its coupling with muscle activity, with respect to several aspects of muscle force (rate of increase/decrease or plateauing high/low). These modulations preceded changes in force features by ~40 ms and possessed behavioral relevance, as less salient or absent modulation predicted a more stable force output. These findings have consequences for the existing theories regarding the functional role of cortico-muscular coupling, and suggest that steady muscle contractions are characterized by a stable rather than fluttering involvement of the sensorimotor cortex.

                Background: The molecular mechanisms underlying the long-lasting behavioral changes associated with adolescent cannabis use are poorly understood. To this end, we performed gene network analyses of multiple brain regions in adult mice exposed during the entire adolescence to Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis. Methods: Two weeks after the last exposure to THC (10 mg/kg) or vehicle, we measured cognitive behaviors and profiled the transcriptomes of 5 brain regions from 12 female and 12 male mice. We performed differential gene expression analysis and constructed gene coexpression networks (modules) to identify THC-induced transcriptional alterations at the level of individual genes, gene networks, and biological pathways. We integrated the THC-correlated modules with human traits from genome-wide association studies to identify potential regulators of disease-associated networks. Results: THC impaired cognitive behaviors of mice, with memory being more impacted in females than males, which coincided with larger transcriptional changes in the female brain. Modules involved in endocannabinoid signaling and inflammation were correlated with memory deficits in the female dorsal medial striatum and ventral tegmental area, respectively. Converging pathways related to dopamine signaling and addiction were altered in the female amygdala and male nucleus accumbens. Moreover, the connectivity map of THC-correlated modules uncovered intra- and inter-region molecular circuitries influenced by THC. Lastly, modules altered by THC were enriched in genes relevant for human cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders. Conclusions: These findings provide novel insights concerning the genes, pathways and brain regions underlying persistent behavioral deficits induced by adolescent exposure to THC in a sex-specific manner.

                Overarching themes in the terminal differentiation of the enteric nervous system, an autonomously acting unit of animal nervous systems, have so far eluded discovery. We describe here the overall regulatory logic of enteric nervous system differentiation of the nematode C. elegans that resides within the foregut (pharynx) of the worm. A Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of the Drosophila Sine Oculis homeobox gene, ceh-34, is expressed in all 14 classes of interconnected pharyngeal neurons from their birth throughout their life time, but in no other neuron type of the entire animal. Constitutive and temporally controlled ceh-34 removal shows that ceh-34 is required to initiate and maintain the neuron type-specific terminal differentiation program of all pharyngeal neuron classes, including their circuit assembly, without affecting panneuronal features. Through additional genetic loss of function analysis, we show that within each pharyngeal neuron class, ceh-34 cooperates with different homeodomain transcription factors to individuate distinct pharyngeal neuron classes. Our analysis underscores the critical role of homeobox genes in neuronal identity specification and links them to the control of neuronal circuit assembly of the enteric nervous system. Together with the pharyngeal nervous system simplicity as well as its specification by a Sine Oculis homolog, our findings invite speculations about the early evolution of nervous systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of uncertain context inference on motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Humans have been shown to adapt their movements when a sudden change to the dynamics of the environment is introduced, a phenomenon called motor adaptation. If the change is reverted, the adaptation is also quickly reverted. Human are also able to adapt to multiple changes in dynamics presented separately, and to be able to switch between adapted movements on the fly. Such switching relies on contextual information which is often noisy or misleading, which affects the switch between adaptations. In this work, we introduce a computational model to explain the behavioral phenomena effected by uncertain contextual information. Specifically, we present a hierarchical model for motor adaptation based on exact Bayesian inference. This model explicitly takes into account contextual information and how the dynamics of context inference affect adaptation and action selection. We show how the proposed model provides a unifying explanation for four different experimentally-established phenomena: (i) effects of sensory cues and proprioceptive information on switching between tasks, (ii) the effects of previously-learned adaptations on switching between tasks, (iii) the effects of training history on behavior in new contexts, in addition to (iv) the well-studied savings, de-adaptation and spontaneous recovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions enhance expectation-related pain modulation</a></h4>

              
                Pain is strongly modulated by expectations and beliefs. Research across species indicates that subregions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) play a fundamental role in learning and generating predictions about valued outcomes. Consistent with this overarching framework, neuroimaging studies of experimental pain indicate that VMPFC activation tracks expectations of pain relief and statistically mediates expectation-related reductions in responses to painful stimuli across a distributed pain processing network. However, lesion studies in preclinical models and in humans with refractory chronic pain suggest that VMPFC may play a more general role in representing the affective and motivational qualities of pain that contribute to its strong aversive drive. To test whether VMPFC is necessary for pain processing in general, or instead plays a more specific role in the modulation of pain by expectations, we studied responses to experimental heat pain in five adults with bilateral surgical lesions of VMPFC and twenty healthy adults without brain damage. All participants underwent quantitative sensory testing (QST) to characterize pain sensitivity, followed by a pain expectancy task. Participants were instructed that auditory cues would be followed by heat calibrated to elicit low or high pain. Following a conditioning phase, each cue was intermittently paired with a single temperature calibrated to elicit moderate pain. We compared ratings of moderate heat stimuli and subjective expectancy ratings as a function of cue to evaluate whether VMPFC lesions impact cue-based expectancy and expectancy effects on pain intensity and unpleasantness. We also analyzed QST measures to evaluate whether VMPFC lesions were associated with overall shifts in pain sensitivity. Compared to adults without brain damage, individuals with VMPFC lesions reported larger differences in expectations as a function of pain-predictive cues, and stronger cue-based modulation of pain ratings, particularly for ratings of pain unpleasantness. There were no group differences in pain sensitivity, nor in the relationship between pain and autonomic arousal, indicating that the impact of VMPFC lesions is specific to expectancy-based modulation of pain unpleasantness. Our findings suggest that the VMPFC is not essential for basic subjective and physiological responses to painful stimuli. Rather, our findings of significantly enhanced cue-related expectancy effects may suggest that VMPFC plays an important role in updating expectations or integrating sensory information with expectations to guide subjective judgements about pain. Taken together, these results expand our understanding VMPFC's contribution to pain and highlight the role of VMPFC in integrating cognitive representations with sensory information to yield affective responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiscale and extended retrieval of associative memory structures in a cortical model of local-global inhibition balance</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory neurons take on many forms and functions. How this diversity contributes to memory function is not completely known. Previous formal studies indicate inhibition differentiated by local and global connectivity in associative memory networks functions to rescale the level of retrieval of excitatory assemblies. However, such studies lack biological details such as a distinction between types of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory), unrealistic connection schemas, and non-sparse assemblies. In this study, we present a rate-based cortical model where neurons are distinguished (as excitatory, local inhibitory, or global inhibitory), connected more realistically, and where memory items correspond to sparse excitatory assemblies. We use this model to study how local-global inhibition balance can alter memory retrieval in associative memory structures, including naturalistic and artificial structures. Experimental studies have reported inhibitory neurons and their sub-types uniquely respond to specific stimuli and can form sophisticated, joint excitatory-inhibitory assemblies. Our model suggests such joint assemblies, as well as a distribution and rebalancing of overall inhibition between two inhibitory sub-populations -- one connected to excitatory assemblies locally and the other connected globally -- can quadruple the range of retrieval across related memories. We identify a possible functional role for local-global inhibitory balance to, in the context of choice or preference of relationships, permit and maintain a broader range of memory items when local inhibition is dominant and conversely consolidate and strengthen a smaller range of memory items when global inhibition is dominant. This model therefore highlights a biologically-plausible and behaviourally-useful function of inhibitory diversity in memory.

                While the exteroceptive and interoceptive prediction of a negative event increases a person's anxiety in daily life situations, the relationship between the brain mechanism of anxiety and anxiety-related autonomic response have not been fully understood. In this fMRI study, we examined the neural basis of anxiety and anxiety-related autonomic responses in a daily driving situation. Participants viewed a driving video clip in the first-person perspective. In the middle of the video clip, participants were presented with a cue to indicate whether a subsequent crash could occur (attention condition) or not (safe condition). Compared with the safe condition, there were more activities in the anterior insula, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray, and higher sympathetic nerve responses, such as pupil dilation and peripheral arterial stiffness in the attention condition. We also observed autonomic response-related functional connectivity in the visual cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, and MCC/PCC with the right anterior insula and its adjacent regions as seed regions. Thus, the right anterior insula and adjacent regions, collaborating with the other related regions, could play a fundamental role in eliciting anxiety based on the prediction of negative events by mediating anxiety-related autonomic responses according to interoceptive information.

                The study of cognitive processes underlying natural behaviours implies to depart from computerized paradigms and artificial experimental probes. The aim of the present study is to assess the feasibility of capturing neural markers of visual attention (P300 Event-Related Potentials) in response to objects embedded in a real-world environment. To this end, electroencephalography and eye-tracking data were recorded while participants attended stimuli presented on a tablet and while they searched for books in a library. Initial analyses of the library data revealed P300-like features shifted in time. A Dynamic Time Warping analysis confirmed the presence of P300 ERP in the library condition. Library data were then lag-corrected based on cross-correlation coefficients. Together these approaches uncovered P300 ERP responses in the library recordings. These findings highlight the relevance of scalable experimental designs, joint brain and body recordings and template-matching analyses to capture cognitive events during natural behaviours.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulus dependence of theta rhythmic activity in primate V1 and its potential relevance for visual perception</a></h4>

              
                A growing body of psychophysical research reports theta (3-8 Hz) rhythmic fluctuations in visual perception that are often attributed to an attentional sampling mechanism arising from theta rhythmic neural activity in mid- to high-level cortical association areas. However, it remains unclear to what extent such neuronal theta oscillations might already emerge at early sensory cortex like the primary visual cortex (V1), e.g. from the stimulus filter properties of neurons. To address this question, we recorded multi-unit neural activity from V1 of two macaque monkeys viewing a static visual stimulus with variable sizes, orientations and contrasts. We found that among the visually responsive electrode sites, more than 50 % showed a spectral peak at theta frequencies. Theta power varied with varying basic stimulus properties. Within each of these stimulus property domains (e.g. size), there was usually a single stimulus value that induced the strongest theta activity. In addition to these variations in theta power, the peak frequency of theta oscillations increased with increasing stimulus size and also changed depending on the stimulus position in the visual field. Further analysis confirmed that this neural theta rhythm was indeed stimulus-induced and did not arise from small fixational eye movements (microsaccades). When the monkeys performed a detection task of a target embedded in a theta-generating visual stimulus, reaction times also tended to fluctuate at the same theta frequency as the one observed in the neural activity. The present study shows that a highly stimulus-dependent neuronal theta oscillation can be elicited in V1 that appears to influence the temporal dynamics of visual perception.

                Women suffer from depression at twice the rate of men, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we identify dramatic baseline sex differences in expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human postmortem brain tissue that are profoundly lost in depression. One such lncRNA, RP11-298D21.1 (which we termed FEDORA), is enriched in oligodendrocytes and neurons and upregulated in several cortical regions of depressed females but not males. We found that virally-expressing FEDORA selectively either in neurons or in oligodendrocytes of prefrontal cortex promoted depression-like behavioral abnormalities in female mice only, changes associated with cell-type-specific regulation of synaptic properties, myelin thickness, and gene expression. We also found that blood FEDORA levels have diagnostic significance for depressed women. These findings demonstrate the important role played by lncRNAs, and FEDORA in particular, in shaping the sex-specific landscape of the brain and contributing to sex differences in depression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling the effect of ephaptic coupling on spike propagation in peripheral nerve fibres</a></h4>

              
                Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that ephaptic coupling leads to the synchronisation and slowing down of spikes propagating along the axons within peripheral nerve bundles. However, the main focus thus far has been on a small number of identical axons, whereas realistic peripheral nerve bundles contain numerous axons with different diameters. Here, we present a computationally efficient spike propagation model, which captures the essential features of propagating spikes and their ephaptic interaction, and facilitates the theoretical investigation of spike volleys in large, heterogeneous fibre bundles. The spike propagation model describes an action potential, or spike, by its position on the axon, and its velocity. The velocity is primarily defined by intrinsic features of the axons, such as diameter and myelination status, but it is also modulated by changes in the extracellular potential. These changes are due to transmembrane currents that occur during the generation of action potentials. The resulting change in the velocity is appropriately described by a linearised coupling function, which is calibrated with a biophysical model. We first lay out the theoretical basis to describe how the spike in an active axon changes the membrane potential of a passive axon. These insights are then incorporated into the spike propagation model, which is calibrated with a biophysically realistic model based on Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. The fully calibrated model is then applied to fibre bundles with a large number of axons and different types of axon diameter distributions. One key insight of this study is that the heterogeneity of the axonal diameters has a dispersive effect, and that with increasing level of heterogeneity the ephaptic coupling strength has to increase to achieve full synchronisation between spikes. Another result of this study is that in the absence of full synchronisation, a subset of spikes on axons with similar diameter can form synchronised clusters. These findings may help interpret the results of noninvasive experiments on the electrophysiology of peripheral nerves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Topological conditions for propagation of spatially-distributed neural activity</a></h4>

              
                An important task of the nervous system is to transmit information faithfully and reliably across brain regions, a process that involves the coordinated activity of a relatively large population of neurons. In topographically organized networks, where the entering and exiting axons of neurons terminate in confined areas, successful propagation depends on the spatial patterns of activity: the firing neurons in a presynaptic or source layer must be located sufficiently close to each other to ensure that cells in the postsynaptic or target layer receive the requisite number of convergent inputs to fire. Here, we use principles of topology to define the conditions for transmitting information across layers. We show that simplicial complexes formed by source neurons can be used to: 1) determine whether target neurons receive suprathreshold inputs; 2) identify neurons within the active population that contribute to firing; and 3) discriminate between single and multiple active clusters of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Black-box testing in motor sequence learning</a></h4>

              
                During learning of novel motor sequences, practice leads to the consolidation of hierarchical structures, namely motor chunks, facilitating the accurate execution of sequences at increasing speeds. Recent studies show that such hierarchical structures are largely represented upstream of the primary motor cortex in the motor network, suggesting their function to be more related to the encoding, storage, and retrieval of sequences rather than their sole execution. We isolated different components of motor skill acquisition related to the consolidation of spatiotemporal features and followed their evolution over training. We found that optimal motor skill acquisition relies on the storage of the spatial features of the sequence in memory, followed by the optimization of its execution and increased execution speeds (i.e., a shift in the speed-accuracy trade-off) early in training, supporting the model proposed by Hikosaka in 1999. Contrasting the dynamics of these components during ageing, we identified less-than-optimal mechanisms in older adults explaining the observed differences in performance. We applied noninvasive brain stimulation in an attempt to support the aging brain to compensate for these deficits. The present study found that anodal direct current stimulation applied over the motor cortex restored the mechanisms involved in the consolidation of spatial features, without directly affecting the speed of execution of the sequence. This led older adults to sharply improve their accuracy, resulting in an earlier yet gradual emergence of motor chunks. The results suggest the early storage of the sequence in memory, largely independent of motor practice, is crucial for an optimal motor acquisition and retrieval of this motor behavior. Nevertheless, the consolidation of optimal temporal patterns, detected as motor chunks at a behavioral level, is not a direct consequence of storing the sequence elements, but rather of motor practice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An atlas of the developing Tribolium castaneum	 brain reveals conserved anatomy and divergent timing to Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Insect brains are formed by conserved sets of neural lineages whose fibres form cohesive bundles with characteristic projection patterns. Within the brain neuropil these bundles establish a system of fascicles constituting the macrocircuitry of the brain. The overall architecture of the neuropils and the macrocircuitry appear to be conserved. However, variation is observed e.g., in size and shape and timing of development. Unfortunately, the developmental and genetic basis of this variation is poorly understood although the rise of new genetically tractable model organisms such as the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum allows the possibility to gain mechanistic insights. To facilitate such work, we present an atlas of the developing brain of T. castaneum, covering the first larval instar, the prepupal stage and the adult, by combining wholemount immunohistochemical labelling of fibre bundles (acetylated tubulin) and neuropils (synapsin) with digital 3D reconstruction using the TrakEM2 software package. Upon comparing this anatomical dataset with the published work in D. melanogaster, we confirm an overall high degree of conservation. Fibre tracts and neuropil fascicles, which can be visualized by global neuronal antibodies like anti-acetylated tubulin in all invertebrate brains, create a rich anatomical framework to which individual neurons or other regions of interest can be referred to. The framework of a largely conserved pattern allowed us to describe differences between the two species with respect to parameters such as timing of neuron proliferation and maturation. These features likely reflect adaptive changes in developmental timing that govern the change from larval to adult brain.

                MECP2 loss-of-function mutations cause Rett syndrome, a disorder that results from a disrupted brain transcriptome. How these transcriptional defects are decoded into a disease proteome remains unknown. We studied the proteome in Rett syndrome cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) across vertebrates. We identified a consensus proteome and ontological categories shared across Rett syndrome cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from three species, including humans. Rett CSF proteomes enriched proteins annotated to HDL lipoproteins, complement, mitochondria, citrate/pyruvate metabolism, as well as synapse compartments. We used these prioritized and shared ontologies to select analytes for orthogonal quantification. These studies independently validated our proteome and ontologies. Ontologically selected CSF hits had genotypic discriminatory capacity as determined by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and distinguished Rett from a related neurodevelopmental disorder, CDKL5 deficiency disorder. We propose that Mecp2 mutant CSF proteomes and ontologies inform novel putative mechanisms and biomarkers of disease. We suggest that Rett syndrome is a metabolic disorder impacting synapse function.

                Macroscopic functional connectomic analyses have identified sets of densely connected regions in the human brain, known as connectome hubs, which play a vital role in understanding network communication, cognitive processing, and brain disorders. However, anatomical locations of functional connectome hubs are largely inconsistent and less reproducible among extant reports, partly due to inadequate sample size and differences in image processing and network analysis. Moreover, the genetic signatures underlying the robust connectome hubs remain unknown. Here, we conduct the first worldwide voxelwise meta-connectomic analysis by pooling resting-state functional MRI data of 5,212 healthy young adults across 61 independent international cohorts with harmonized image processing and network analysis protocols. We identify highly consistent and reproducible functional connectome hubs that are spatially distributed in multiple heteromodal and unimodal regions, with the most robust findings mainly located in lateral parietal regions. These connectome hubs show unique, heterogeneous connectivity profiles and are critical for both intra- and inter-network communications. Using transcriptome data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas and BrainSpan Atlas as well as machine learning, we demonstrate that these robust hubs are significantly associated with a transcriptomic pattern dominated by genes involved in the neuropeptide signaling pathway, neurodevelopmental processes, and cellular metabolic processes. This pattern represents microstructural and metabolic substrates underlying the development and functioning of brain hubs. Together, these results highlight robustness of macroscopic connectome hubs of the human brain and their potential cellular and molecular underpinnings and have implications for understanding how brain hubs support the connectome organization in health and disease.

                During social interactions, individuals influence each other to coordinate their actions. Vocal communication is an exceptionally efficient way to exert such influence. Where and how social interactions are dynamically modulated in the brain is unknown. We used functional ultrasound imaging in marmoset monkeys, a highly vocal species, to investigate the dynamics of medial social brain areas in vocal perception, production, and audio-vocal interaction. We found that the activity of a distributed network of subcortical and cortical regions distinguishes calls associated with different social contexts. This same brain network showed different dynamics during externally and internally driven vocalizations. These findings suggest the existence of a social-vocal brain network in medial cortical and subcortical areas that is fundamental in social communication.

                Nuclear and ribosomal components define cell identity and function by regulating chromatin dynamics, gene expression, and protein turnover. Here we report that in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) under normal conditions, neurons accumulate nuclear and ribosomal material of oligodendrocyte (OL) origin. We show that neuronal accumulation of OL-derived nuclear and ribosomal material is brain area-specific, and in the cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus gradually propagates during postnatal brain maturation. We further demonstrate that OL-to-neuron material transfer persists throughout adulthood and responds to neuroinflammation. We found that satellite OL of the gray matter form internuclear contacts with receiving neurons in the mouse brain. Similar close internuclear associations between satellite OL and neurons are present in the adult human cortex. Our findings provide the first evidence of wide-spread dynamic and selective OL-to-neuron nuclear and ribosomal material transfer in the mouse CNS and indicate that satellite OL serve as powerful mediators of neuronal function. Equivalent processes may occur in the human CNS and cause neurological disorders when dysregulated.

                Microglia contribute to tissue homeostasis in physiological conditions with environmental cues influencing their ever-changing morphology. Strategies to identify these changes usually involve user-selected morphometric features, which, however, have proved ineffective in establishing a spectrum of context-dependent morphological phenotypes. Here, we have developed MorphOMICs, a topological data analysis approach to overcome feature-selection-based biases and biological variability. We extracted a spatially heterogeneous and sexually-dimorphic morphological phenotype for seven adult brain regions, with ovariectomized females forming their own distinct cluster. This sex-specific phenotype declines with maturation but increases over the disease trajectories in two neurodegeneration models, 5xFAD and CK-p25. Females show an earlier morphological shift in the immediately-affected brain regions. Finally, we demonstrate that both the primary- and the short terminal processes provide distinct insights to morphological phenotypes. MorphOMICs maps microglial morphology into a spectrum of cue-dependent phenotypes in a minimally-biased and semi-automatic way.

                Establishing a detailed understanding of how the distinct forms of synaptic plasticity spatio-temporally engage into the initial storage and subsequent consolidation of memories remains a fundamental challenge of neuroscience. In addition to the better understood postsynaptic plasticity, different forms of presynaptic plasticity are widely expressed in mammalian brains and apparently operate along Hebbian or homeostatic rules. Their behavioral relevance remains enigmatic, however. Lately, acute upregulation of active zone (AZ) scaffold protein BRP and release factor Unc13A via specific axonal transport factors were shown to mediate stable expression of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). We here demonstrate that AZ scaling processes are specifically needed for stable expression of both, NMJ PHP as well as aversive olfactory mid-term memory within intrinsic neurons of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB). We first demonstrate that AZ upscaling via BRP is specifically needed for expression but not induction of NMJ homeostatic plasticity, thus establishing a direct temporal plasticity sequence of molecularly distinct AZ remodeling steps. Notably, when we reduced BRP and associated transport factors in MB intrinsic neurons, short-term memory persisted but robust deficits in stable memory expression for a few hours after conditioning were observed. In contrast, AZ release site protein RIM-BP affecting PHP induction was additionally needed for successful formation of short-term memory. Taken together, our data establish a specific role of homeostatic presynaptic long-term plasticity for memory consolidation. Such homeostatic refinement processes might well be needed to successfully integrate and display synaptic engrams constituting intermediary term memories.

                Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the striatum, a brain region that controls movement and some forms of cognition. Dysfunction and loss of medium spiny neurons of the striatum is accompanied by astrogliosis (increased astrocyte density and pathology). For decades, astrocytes were considered a homogeneous cell type, but recent transcriptomic analyses revealed astrocytes are a heterogeneous population classified into multiple subtypes depending on the expression of different gene markers. Here, we studied whether three different striatal astrocyte subtypes expressing glutamine synthetase (GS), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), or S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) are differentially altered in HD. We conducted a comparative immunofluorescence analysis in the striatum of WT and the heterozygous zQ175 HD mouse model and found that the expression and abundance of GFAP+ and S100B+ astrocytes increased in zQ175 mice, while GS+ astrocytes showed no alteration. We then explored whether there was a differential spatial distribution of any of these subtypes within the striatum. We developed a systematic brain compartmentalization approach and found that while GS+ and S100B+ astrocytes were more homogeneously distributed throughout the striatum in zQ175 mice, GFAP+ astrocytes preferentially accumulated in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum, which are regions associated with goal-directed and habitual behaviors. Additionally, GFAP+ astrocytes in zQ175 mice showed increased clustering, a parameter that indicates increased proximity and that is associated with localized inflammation and/or neurodegeneration. Our data suggest a differential susceptibility in both increased density and striatal compartmentalization of different subtypes of astrocytes in zQ175. These results highlight new potential implications for our understanding of astrocyte pathology in HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synapse-associated astrocyte mitochondria stabilize motor circuits to prevent excitotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Early stages of the devastating neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are characterized by motor neuron hyperexcitability. During this phase, peri-synaptic astrocytes are neuroprotective. When reactive, loss of wild-type astrocyte functions results in excitotoxicity. How astrocytes stabilize motor circuit function in early-stage ALS is poorly understood. Here, we used Drosophila motor neurons to define the role of astrocyte-motor neuron metabolic coupling in a model of ALS: astrocyte knockdown of the ALS-causing gene tbph/TARDBP. In wild-type, astrocyte mitochondria were dynamically trafficked towards active motor dendrites/synapses to meet local metabolic demand. Knockdown of tbph in astrocytes resulted in motor neuron hyperexcitability, reminiscent of early-stage ALS, which was met with a compensatory accumulation of astrocyte mitochondria near motor dendrites/synapses. Finally, we blocked mitochondria-synapse association in tbph knockdown animals and observed locomotor deficits and synapse loss. Thus, synapse-associated astrocyte mitochondria stabilize motor circuits to prevent the transition from hyperexcitability to excitotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adolescent rats extend help to outgroup members, highlighting a neural network for group identity categorization.</a></h4>

              
                Prosocial behavior, in particular helping others in need, occurs preferentially in response to the perceived distress of one's own group members, or ingroup. The development of neural mechanisms underlying social selectivity towards ingroup members are not well established. Here, we used a rat helping behavior test to explore the development and neural basis of ingroup bias for prosocial behavior in adolescent rats. We previously found that adult rats selectively help others from their own social group, and that this selectivity is associated with activation in reward and motivation circuits. Surprisingly, we found that adolescent rats helped both ingroup and outgroup members, evidence suggesting that ingroup bias emerges in adulthood. Analysis of brain-wide neural activity, indexed by expression of the early-immediate gene c-Fos, revealed increased activity for ingroup members across a broad set of regions, which was congruent for adults and adolescents. However, adolescents showed reduced hippocampal and insular activity, and increased orbitofrontal cortex activity compared to adults. Adolescent rats who did not help trapped others also demonstrated increased amygdala connectivity. Together, these findings demonstrate that biases for group-dependent prosocial behavior develop with age in rats and suggest that specific brain regions contribute to this prosocial selectivity, overall pointing to possible targets for the functional modulation of ingroup bias.

                Sexual dimorphism occurs where different sexes of the same species display differences in characteristics not limited to reproduction. For the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, in which the complete neuroanatomy has been solved for both hermaphrodites and males, sexually dimorphic features have been observed both in terms of the number of neurons and in synaptic connectivity. In addition, male behaviours, such as food-leaving to prioritise searching for mates, have been attributed to neuropeptides released from sex-shared or sex-specific neurons. In this study, we show that the lury-1 neuropeptide gene shows a sexually dimorphic expression pattern; being expressed in pharyngeal neurons in both sexes but displaying additional expression in tail neurons only in the male. We also show that lury-1 mutant animals show sex differences in feeding behaviours, with pharyngeal pumping elevated in hermaphrodites but reduced in males. LURY-1 also modulates male mating efficiency, influencing motor events during contact with a hermaphrodite. Our findings indicate sex-specific roles of this peptide in feeding and reproduction in C. elegans, providing further insight into neuromodulatory control of sexually dimorphic behaviours.

                Sensory adaptation is critical to extract information from a changing world. Taking advantage of the extensive parallel coding lines present in the olfactory system, we explored the potential variations of neuronal identities before and after olfactory experience. We found that at rest, the transcriptomic profiles of olfactory sensory neuron populations are already highly divergent, specific to the olfactory receptor they express, and are surprisingly associated with the sequence of these latter. These divergent profiles further evolve in response to the environment, as odorant exposure leads to massive reprogramming via the modulation of transcription. Adenylyl cyclase 3, but not other main elements of the olfactory transduction cascade, plays a critical role in this activity-induced transcriptional adaptation. These findings highlight a broad range of sensory neuron identities that are present at rest and that adapt to the experience of the individual, thus providing a novel layer of complexity to sensory coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hunchback activates Bicoid in post-mitotic Pair1 neurons to regulate synapse number</a></h4>

              
                The proper formation and function of neural circuits is crucial for cognition, sensation, and behavior. Neural circuits are highly-specific, and this specificity is dependent on neurons developing key features of their individual identities: morphology, anatomical location, molecular expression and biophysiological properties. Previous research has demonstrated that a neurons identity is, in part, generated by the temporal transcription window the neuron is born in, and the homeodomain transcription factors expressed in the mature neuron. However, whether temporal transcription factors and homeodomain transcription factors regulate neural circuit formation, maintenance and function remains unknown. Here, we utilize a well-characterized neural circuit in the Drosophila larvae, the Pair1 neuron. We determined that in the Pair1 neuron, the temporal transcription factor Hunchback activates the homeodomain transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). Both Hunchback and Bcd are expressed in Pair1 throughout larval development. Interestingly, Hunchback and Bcd were not required in Pair1 for neurotransmitter identity or axonal morphology, but were required for synapse density. We found that these transcription factors were functioning post-mitotically in Pair1 to regulate synapse density. Additionally, knocking down Hunchback and Bcd in Pair1 neurons disrupted the behavioral output of the circuit. We utilized the genetic tool TransTango to determine that Hunchback function in Pair1 is to repress forming synapses with erroneous neurons. To our knowledge, these data are the first to show Hunchback activating Bcd expression, as well as the first to demonstrate a role for Hunchback and Bcd post-mitotically.

                Zebrafish larvae have been widely used in neuroscience and drug research and development. In the larval stage, zebrafish present a broad behavioral repertoire and physiological responses similar to adults. Curcumin (CUR), a major component of Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae), has demonstrated the ability to modulate several neurobiological processes relevant to mental disorders in animal models. However, the low bioavailability of this compound can compromise its in vivo biological potential. Interestingly, it has been shown that micronization can increase the biological effects of several compounds. Thus, in this study, we compared the effects of acute exposure for 30 minutes to the following solutions: water (control), 0.1% DMSO (vehicle), 1 M CUR, or 1 M micronized curcumin (MC) in zebrafish larvae 7 days post-fertilization (dpf). We analyzed locomotor activity (open tank test), anxiety (light/dark test), and avoidance behavior (aversive stimulus test). Moreover, we evaluated parameters of oxidative status (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and non-protein thiols levels). MC increased the total distance traveled and absolute turn angle in the open tank test. There were no significant differences in the other behavioral or neurochemical outcomes. The increase in locomotion induced by MC may be associated with a stimulant effect on the central nervous system, which was evidenced by the micronization process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics of alpha suppression and enhancement may be related to resource competition in cross-modal cortical regions</a></h4>

              
                In the face of multiple sensory streams, there may be competition for processing resources in multimodal cortical area devoted to establishing representations. In such cases, alpha oscillations may serve to maintain the relevant representations and protect them from interference, whereas theta oscillations may facilitate their updating when needed. It can be hypothesized that these oscillations would differ in response to an auditory stimulus when the eyes are open or closed, as intermodal resource competition may be more prominent in the former than in the latter case. Across two studies we investigated the role of alpha and theta power in multimodal competition using an auditory task with the eyes open and closed, respectively enabling and disabling visual processing in parallel with the incoming auditory stream. In a passive listening task (Study 1a), we found alpha suppression following a pip tone with both eyes open and closed, but subsequent alpha enhancement only with closed eyes. We replicated this eyes-closed alpha enhancement in an independent sample (Study 1b). In an active auditory oddball task (Study 2), we again observed the eyes open/eyes closed alpha pattern found in Study 1 and also demonstrated that the more attentionally demanding oddball trials elicit the largest oscillatory effects. Theta power did not interact with eye status in either study. We propose a hypothesis to account for the findings in which alpha may be endemic to multimodal cortical areas in addition to visual ones.

                Recently, a new generation of devices have been developed to record neural activity simultaneously from hundreds of electrodes with a very high spatial density, both for in vitro and in vivo applications. While these advances enable to record from many more cells, they also dramatically increase the amount overlapping "synchronous" spikes (colliding in space and/or in time), challenging the already complicated process of spike sorting (i.e. extracting isolated single-neuron activity from extracellular signals). In this work, we used synthetic ground-truth recordings to quantitatively benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art spike sorters focusing specifically on spike collisions. Our results show that while modern template-matching based algorithms are more accurate than density-based approaches, all methods, to some extent, failed to detect synchronous spike events of neurons with similar extracellular signals. Interestingly, the performance of the sorters is not largely affected by the the spiking activity in the recordings, with respect to average firing rates and spike-train correlation levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxytocin signaling in the posterior hypothalamus prevents hyperphagic obesity in mice</a></h4>

              
                Decades of studies have revealed molecular and neural circuit bases for body weight homeostasis. Neural hormone oxytocin (OT) has received attention in this context because it is produced by neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), a known output center of hypothalamic regulation of appetite. OT has an anorexigenic effect, as shown in human studies, and can mediate satiety signals in rodents. However, the function of OT signaling in the physiological regulation of appetite has remained in question, because whole-body knockout (KO) of OT or OT receptor (OTR) has little effect on food intake. We herein show that acute conditional KO (cKO) of OT selectively in the adult PVH, but not in the supraoptic nucleus, markedly increases body weight and food intake, with an elevated level of plasma triglyceride and leptin. Intraperitoneal administration of OT rescues the hyperphagic phenotype of the PVH OT cKO model. Furthermore, we show that cKO of OTR selectively in the posterior hypothalamic regions, which include the primary centers for appetite regulations, phenocopies hyperphagic obesity. Collectively, these data functionally reveal that OT signaling in the posterior hypothalamic regions suppresses excessive food intake.

	<p>In 1940, van Wagenen and Herren first proposed the corpus callosotomy (CC) as a surgical procedure for epilepsy. CC has been mainly used to treat drop attacks, which are classified as generalized tonic or atonic seizures. Epileptic spasms (ESs) are a type of epileptic seizure characterized as brief muscle contractions with ictal polyphasic slow waves on an electroencephalogram and a main feature of West syndrome. Resection surgeries, including frontal/posterior disconnections and hemispherotomy, have been established for the treatment of medically intractable ES in patients with unilaterally localized epileptogenic regions. However, CC has also been adopted for ES treatment, with studies involving CC to treat ES having increased since 2010. In those studies, patients without lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging or equally bilateral lesions predominated, in contrast to studies on resection surgeries. Here, we present a review of relevant literature concerning CC and relevant adaptations. We discuss history and adaptations of CC, and patient selection for epilepsy surgeries due to medically intractable ES, and compared resection surgeries with CC. We propose a surgical selection flow involving resection surgery or CC as first-line treatment for patients with ES who have been assessed as suitable candidates for surgery.</p>

Here, we explored multidimensional profiles of carer-rated social communication using the La Trobe Communication Questionnaire (LCQ) in 11 semantic dementia (SD), 12 logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) and 9 progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) cases and contrasted their performance with 19 Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) cases, 26 behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) cases and 31 healthy older controls. Relative to the controls, the majority of patient groups displayed significant overall social communication difficulties, with common and unique profiles of impairment evident on the LCQ subscales. Correlation analyses revealed a differential impact of social communication disturbances on functional outcomes in patient and carer well-being, most pronounced for SD and bvFTD. Finally, voxel-based morphometry analyses based on a structural brain MRI pointed to the degradation of a distributed brain network in mediating social communication dysfunction in dementia. Our findings suggest that social communication difficulties are an important feature of PPA, with significant implications for patient function and carer well-being. The origins of these changes are likely to be multifactorial, reflecting the breakdown of fronto-thalamic brain circuits specialised in the integration of complex information.</p>

	<p>While outcomes of embodied awareness practices in terms of improved posture and flexibility, movement efficiency, and well-being are often reported, systematic investigations of such training effects and of the actual nature, extent, and neurofunctional correlates of learning mechanisms thought to lie at the core of such practices are very limited. The present study focused on the Feldenkrais method (FM), one of the most established embodied awareness practices, and aimed at investigating the neurofunctional outcomes of the somatic learning process at the core of the method by testing the modulations induced by a standardized FM protocol on the complexity of practicers&amp;amp;rsquo; body structural map and on the activity of their sensorimotor network during different movement-related tasks (i.e., gestures observation, execution, and imagery). Twenty-five participants were randomly divided into an experimental group&amp;amp;mdash;which completed a 28-session FM protocol based on guided group practice&amp;amp;mdash;and a control group, and underwent pre-/post-training psychometric and electrophysiological assessment. Data analysis highlighted, at the end of the FM protocol, a significant increase of EEG markers of cortical activation (task-related mu desynchronization) in precentral regions during action observation and in central regions during action execution and imagery. Also, posterior regions of the sensorimotor network showed systematic activation during all the action-related tasks.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Tracking and quantifying the abundance and location of cells in the developing brain is essential in neuroscience research, enabling a greater understanding of mechanisms underlying nervous system morphogenesis. Widely used experimental methods to quantify cells labeled with fluorescent markers, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), <I>in situ</I> hybridization, and expression of transgenes via stable lines or transient <I>in utero</I> electroporations (IUEs), depend on accurate and consistent quantification of images. Current methods to quantify fluorescently-labeled cells rely on labor-intensive manual counting approaches, such as the Fiji plugin <I>Cell Counter</I>, which requires custom macros to enable higher-throughput analyses. Here, we present RapID Cell Counter, a semi-automated cell-counting tool with an easy-to-implement graphical user interface (GUI), which facilitates quick and consistent quantifications of cell density within user-defined boundaries that can be divided into equally-partitioned segments. Compared with the standard manual counting approach, we show that RapID matched accuracy and consistency and only required ~10% of user time relative to manual counting methods, when quantifying the distribution of fluorescently-labeled neurons in mouse IUE experiments. Using RapID, we recapitulated previously published work focusing on two genes, <I>SRGAP2</I> and <I>CUL5</I>, important for projection neuron (PN) migration in the neocortex and used it to quantify PN displacement in a mouse knock-out model of <I>RBX2</I>. Moreover, RapID is capable of quantifying other cell types in the brain with complex cell morphologies, including astrocytes and dopaminergic neurons. We propose RapID as an efficient method for neuroscience researchers to process fluorescently-labeled brain images in a consistent, accurate, and mid-throughput manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dysregulated mRNA Translation in the G2019S LRRK2 and LRRK2 Knock-Out Mouse Brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>The G2019S mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) causes familial Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) and is also found in a subset of idiopathic cases. Prior studies in <I>Drosophila</I> and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopamine neurons uncovered a pronounced effect of G2019S LRRK2 on mRNA translation. It was previously reported that G2019S LRRK2 promotes translation of mRNAs with complex 5' untranslated region (UTR) secondary structure, resulting in increased expression of calcium channels and dysregulated calcium homeostasis in human dopamine neurons. Here, we show that dysregulated translation occurs in the brains of mammalian LRRK2 models <I>in vivo</I>. Through ribosome profiling studies of global translation, we observe that mRNAs with complex 5'UTR structure are also preferentially translated in the G2019S LRRK2-expressing mouse brain. Reporter assays suggest that this 5'UTR preference is independent of translation initiation factors. Conversely, translation of mRNAs with complex 5'UTR secondary structure is downregulated in LRRK2 knock-out (KO) mouse brain, indicating a robust link between LRRK2 kinase activity and translation of mRNA with complex 5'UTR structure. Further, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopamine neurons in the G2019S LRRK2-expressing brain exhibit increased calcium influx, which is consistent with the previous report from human dopamine neurons. These results collectively suggest that LRRK2 plays a mechanistic role in translational regulation, and the G2019S mutation in LRRK2 causes translational defects leading to calcium dysregulation in the mammalian brain.</p>

                Background: Placenta accreta is a pregnancy condition where the placenta's blood vessels attach too deeply to the uterine wall. Incidence of placenta accreta  is increasingly seen today as the rate of cesarean section increases, however, the exact pathophysiology of this condition is still not fully understood. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1  (sflt-1) as a protein produced by the placenta was found to be decreased in placenta accreta, Therefore we aim  to see if  sfltsFlt-1 has a role in the development of placenta accreta. Methods: This study involved 40 samples from patients that had been diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum disorder (case group), and 40 samples from patients with normal pregnancies (control group)  at Rumah Skit Umum Pusat H.Adam Malik (RSUP) Haji Adam Malik Medan, in Indonesia.  Diagnosis of placenta accreta syndrome was based on Placenta Accreta Spectrum  Score (PAS), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  (FIGO) classification of placenta accreta spectrum disorder.Analyses  were performed by independent t-test, man Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis test, with a P-value <0.05  considered as statistically significant (95%CI). Results: Based on this study, we found that the sFlt-1 level in the case group was lower than the control group. Data analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was a difference in sFlt-1 levels in this study group (p = 0.02), which was further evaluated  with post hoc analysis using Mann. -Whitney U test. The results indicated that there were significant differences between the control and PAS 0, PAS1, and PAS 2 (p = 0.043; p = 0.002; p = 0.03). Conclusion: sFlt-1 levels decreased in placental invasive pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies, however, this still needs to be investigated further in a multi-center study, considering that sFlt-1 levels are also influenced by ethnicity and other conditions that cannot be excluded in this study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Augmented reality emotion recognition for autism spectrum disorder children [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that affects brain development. The prevalence of ASD is one in 68 children. Low social motivation is the main cause in developing social communication skills deficiency. As a result, it is becoming difficult for them to express themselves, to be able to manage social interactions, and they lack the ability to comfort others and even share their own feelings. This study aimed to design a mobile application based on augmented reality (AR) focusing on social interactions and communication aspect for children with ASD. The scope is in emotion recognition, which makes use of emotional icons to help them improve their social skills, more specifically on helping them to recognize various emotions. The emotions are represented by emojis inspired by Dr. Paul Ekman who has created the basic six emotions, namely happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and angry. Additional emotions such as confound face, winking with tongue, cold sweat, blowing kiss, flushed, sleepy, disappointed, and winking are included. AR is able to gage the children’s attention when they view the animated emojis. The application enables the children with ASD to be more willing in recognizing different emotional expressions and improve their social skills by expressing their own feelings. The scope of the study is limited to emotion recognition. It is developed based on literature reviews without guidance of any certified ASD specialist. AR is an interactive technology that places digital information in our physical world in real time, providing precise registration in all three dimensions. Existing literature proved that the traditional face-to-face teaching methods have failed to increase the interest and ability of ASD children because the teacher has full control in the classroom. This study adds value to the existing works to incorporate AR as additional intervention in treating ASD children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Enhancing innovative delivery in schools using design thinking [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The pandemic has created challenges in all sectors of the economy and education. Traditional teaching approaches seem futile in the new context, thus the need to constantly reinvent the delivery to meet the fast-paced changes in the education domain. Hence, Design Thinking (DT) is an alternative approach that might be useful in the given context. DT is known to be a human-centric approach to innovative problem-solving processes. DT could be employed in the delivery process to develop twenty-first-century skills and enhance creativity and innovation, in an attempt to identify alternative solutions. The study explores the role of design thinking (DT) in the form of empathy, thinking process, gamified lessons and curriculum enhancement, which leads to innovative delivery among teachers. It enhances and facilitates innovative content delivery by leveraging creativity. The study targeted 131 teachers, whereby 61 are primary school teachers and 70 are secondary school teachers. A questionnaire constituting of 23 close-ended questions using the 5-point Likert scale was used to collect data. Data was analyzed using SmartPLS to establish relationships between DT and Innovative Delivery in schools. The data was further analyzed to seek co-relations between the DT steps and the successful transformation of content delivery by teachers. The study established a framework for the application of design thinking for teachers as the primary support in developing activities for their students. The study showed that thinking process, gamifying lessons and curriculum enhancement have positive significance in innovative delivery, whereas empathy did not show a significant positive relationship. The outcome of this study will help fill the gap towards creating an interesting method of delivery in schools and constantly innovating the method to suit the evolving generation. This insight is crucial for the Ministry of Education and policymakers to enhance teachers’ ability to innovatively deliver content to students.

                Klomp et al. show that CHK1 is essential for KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cell growth. CHK1 inhibition causes apoptotic growth suppression, MYC loss, and compensatory ERK and autophagy activation. Concurrent CHK1, ERK, and/or autophagy inhibition enhances apoptotic growth suppression. Additionally, genetic depletion of ERK-regulated DNA damage repair protein RIF1 phenocopies ERK inhibition.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Redox-sensitive cyclophilin A elicits chemoresistance through realigning cellular oxidative status in colorectal cancer</a></h4>

              
                Peng et al. show that CypA is a redox-sensitive effector regulating cellular oxidative status through a PRDX2-mediated noncanonical antioxidant system, which contributes to colorectal cancer (CRC) resistance to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Targeting CypA by cyclosporine A sensitizes CRC to chemotherapy, indicating that CypA may serve as a potential druggable therapeutic target.

                How exogenous lipid supplements influence hPSCs has been a puzzling question. Xu et al. show that LPA is a major lipid component influencing metabolism and gene expression. Although pluripotency is independent of lipid supplements, LPA induces a distinct and reversible cellular state and could be useful in stem cell applications.

                Niimi et al. show that FOXO1 inhibits lymphatic valve development via PRDM1. They also demonstrate that oscillatory shear stress upregulates lymphatic-valve-specific genes via Akt-dependent inactivation of FOXO1 and subsequent reduction of PRDM1. Their study provides insights into how lymphatic valve formation is repressed.

                Fallatah et al. use genome-wide approaches to investigate the function of mammalian nuclear Ago1 during muscle differentiation in mouse C2C12 cells. They show that enhancer-bound Ago1 controls eRNA-dependent CBP-mediated H3K27Ac. Depletion of Ago1 reduces global H3K27ac and programmed expression of genes related to skeletal muscle differentiation.

TTN3-deficient pancreatic beta cells exhibit impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion, identifying an additional regulatory pathway for diabetes mellitus.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Decreased dopaminergic inhibition of pyramidal neurons in anterior cingulate cortex maintains chronic neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Lançon et al. show that dopamine inhibits pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) via D1R signaling and subsequent opening of HCN channels. Activation of ACC D1R provides analgesia and is necessary for relief of ongoing pain. Supplementing supraspinal dopamine normalizes ACC pyramidal hyperexcitability and reduces neuropathic hyperalgesia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dinosaur bonebed amber from an original swamp forest soil</a></h4>

              
                Dinosaur bonebeds with amber content, yet scarce, offer a superior wealth and quality of data on ancient terrestrial ecosystems. However, the preserved palaeodiversity and/or taphonomic characteristics of these exceptional localities had hitherto limited their palaeobiological potential. Here, we describe the amber from the Lower Cretaceous dinosaur bonebed of Ariño (Teruel, Spain) using a multidisciplinary approach. Amber is found in both a root layer with amber strictly in situ and a litter layer mainly composed of aerial pieces unusually rich in bioinclusions, encompassing 11 insect orders, arachnids, and a few plant and vertebrate remains, including a feather. Additional palaeontological data—charophytes, palynomorphs, ostracods— are provided. Ariño arguably represents the most prolific and palaeobiologically diverse locality in which fossiliferous amber and a dinosaur bonebed have been found in association, and the only one known where the vast majority of the palaeontological assemblage suffered no or low-grade pre-burial transport. This has unlocked unprecedentedly complete and reliable palaeoecological data out of two complementary windows of preservation—the bonebed and the amber—from the same site.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ovipositor and mouthparts in a fossil insect support a novel ecological role for early orthopterans in 300 million years old forests</a></h4>

              
                A high portion of the earliest known insect fauna is composed of the so-called ‘lobeattid insects’, whose systematic affinities and role as foliage feeders remain debated. We investigated hundreds of samples of a new lobeattid species from the Xiaheyan locality using a combination of photographic techniques, including reflectance transforming imaging, geometric morphometrics, and biomechanics to document its morphology, and infer its phylogenetic position and ecological role. <i>Ctenoptilus frequens</i> sp. nov. possessed a sword-shaped ovipositor with valves interlocked by two ball-and-socket mechanisms, lacked jumping hind-legs, and certain wing venation features. This combination of characters unambiguously supports lobeattids as stem relatives of all living Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers, katydids). Given the herein presented and other remains, it follows that this group experienced an early diversification and, additionally, occurred in high individual numbers. The ovipositor shape indicates that ground was the preferred substrate for eggs. Visible mouthparts made it possible to assess the efficiency of the mandibular food uptake system in comparison to a wide array of extant species. The new species was likely omnivorous which explains the paucity of external damage on contemporaneous plant foliage.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TCR meta-clonotypes for biomarker discovery with tcrdist3 enabled identification of public, HLA-restricted clusters of SARS-CoV-2 TCRs</a></h4>

              
                T-cell receptors (TCRs) encode clinically valuable information that reflects prior antigen exposure and potential future response. However, despite advances in deep repertoire sequencing, enormous TCR diversity complicates the use of TCR clonotypes as clinical biomarkers. We propose a new framework that leverages experimentally inferred antigen-associated TCRs to form meta-clonotypes – groups of biochemically similar TCRs – that can be used to robustly quantify functionally similar TCRs in bulk repertoires across individuals. We apply the framework to TCR data from COVID-19 patients, generating 1831 public TCR meta-clonotypes from the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-associated TCRs that have strong evidence of restriction to patients with a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype. Applied to independent cohorts, meta-clonotypes targeting these specific epitopes were more frequently detected in bulk repertoires compared to exact amino acid matches, and 59.7% (1093/1831) were more abundant among COVID-19 patients that expressed the putative restricting HLA allele (false discovery rate [FDR]&lt;0.01), demonstrating the potential utility of meta-clonotypes as antigen-specific features for biomarker development. To enable further applications, we developed an open-source software package, <i>tcrdist3,</i> that implements this framework and facilitates flexible workflows for distance-based TCR repertoire analysis.
