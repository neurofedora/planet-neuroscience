              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19147">Functional Brain Network Identification in Opioid Use Disorder Using Machine Learning Analysis of Resting-State fMRI BOLD Signals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests temporal characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to functional connectivity analysis. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling of rs-fMRI BOLD features representing multiple time points to identify region(s) of interest that differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). Following the triple network model, we obtain rs-fMRI BOLD features from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we use the Boruta ML algorithm to identify statistically significant BOLD features that differentiate OUD from HC, identifying the DMN as the most salient functional network for OUD. Furthermore, we conduct brain activity mapping, showing heightened neural activity within the DMN for OUD. We perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features with and without fusing demographic features. The DMN shows the most discriminative power, achieving mean AUC and F1 scores of 80.91% and 73.97%, respectively, when fusing BOLD and demographic features. Follow-up Boruta analysis using BOLD features extracted from the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left and right temporoparietal junctions reveals significant features for all four functional hubs within the DMN.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19542">Brain-like Functional Organization within Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain has long inspired the pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19156">Kuramoto Oscillators With Asymmetric Coupling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of coupled oscillators of the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto type with interactions including a phase delay. We consider the case of a coupling matrix such that oscillators with large natural frequencies drive all slower ones but not the reverse. This scheme is inspired by Hebbian learning in neuroscience. We propose a simple model which is partly solvable analytically and shows many unusual features. For example, for the case of phase delay $\pi/2$ (a symmetric phase response curve) with symmetric coupling there is no synchronous behavior. But in the asymmetric coupling case, there are phase-locked states, i.e., states where many oscillators have the same frequency, but with substantial phase differences.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19315">A prescriptive theory for brain-like inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09450">Human-like Episodic Memory for Infinite Context LLMs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.09450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and InfiniteBench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens - a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19348">How high dimensional neural dynamics are confined in phase space</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High dimensional dynamics play a vital role in brain function, ecological systems, and neuro-inspired machine learning. Where and how these dynamics are confined in the phase space remains challenging to solve. Here, we provide an analytic argument that the confinement region is an M-shape when the neural dynamics show a diversity, with two sharp boundaries and a flat low-density region in between. Despite increasing synaptic strengths in a neural circuit, the shape remains qualitatively the same, while the left boundary is continuously pushed away. However, in deep chaotic regions, an arch-shaped confinement gradually emerges. Our theory is supported by numerical simulations on finite-sized networks. This analytic theory opens up a geometric route towards addressing fundamental questions about high dimensional non-equilibrium dynamics.

                arXiv:2410.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tendency of repeating past choices more often than expected from the history of outcomes has been repeatedly empirically observed in reinforcement learning experiments. It can be explained by at least two computational processes: asymmetric update and (gradual) choice perseveration. A recent meta-analysis showed that both mechanisms are detectable in human reinforcement learning. However, while their descriptive value seems to be well established, they have not been compared regarding their possible adaptive value. In this study, we address this gap by simulating reinforcement learning agents in a variety of environments with a new variant of an evolutionary algorithm. Our results show that positivity bias (in the form of asymmetric update) is evolutionary stable in many situations, while the emergence of gradual perseveration is less systematic and robust. Overall, our results illustrate that biases can be adaptive and selected by evolution, in an environment-specific manner.

Abstract: This paper introduces the inverse modeling constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (IM-C-MOEA/D) for addressing constrained real-world optimization problems. Our research builds upon the advancements made in evolutionary computing-based inverse modeling, and it strategically bridges the gaps in applying inverse models based on decomposition to problem domains with constraints. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated on diverse real-world problems (RWMOP1-35), showing superior performance to state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs). The experimental results highlight the robustness of the algorithm and its applicability in real-world constrained optimization scenarios.

                arXiv:2410.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-signal implementations of SNNs offer a promising solution to edge computing applications that require low-power and compact embedded processing systems. However, device mismatch in the analog circuits of these neuromorphic processors poses a significant challenge to the deployment of robust processing in these systems. Here we introduce a novel architectural solution inspired by biological development to address this issue. Specifically we propose to implement architectures that incorporate network motifs found in developed brains through a differentiable re-parameterization of weight matrices based on gene expression patterns and genetic rules. Thanks to the gradient descent optimization compatibility of the method proposed, we can apply the robustness of biological neural development to neuromorphic computing.
  To validate this approach we benchmark it using the Yin-Yang classification dataset, and compare its performance with that of standard multilayer perceptrons trained with state-of-the-art hardware-aware training method. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method mitigates mismatch-induced noise without requiring precise device mismatch measurements, effectively outperforming alternative hardware-aware techniques proposed in the literature, and providing a more general solution for improving the robustness of SNNs in neuromorphic hardware.

CMOP is a complex problem that needs to satisfy a set of equality or inequality constraints. This paper proposes a variant of the bidirectional coevolution algorithm (BiCo) with differential evolution (DE). The novelties in the model include the DE differential mutation and crossover operators as the main search engine and a non-dominated sorting selection scheme. Experimental results on two benchmark test suites and eight real-world CMOPs suggested that the proposed model reached better overall performance than the original model.

                arXiv:2410.19580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With growing environmental concerns, electric vehicles for logistics have gained significant attention within the computational intelligence community in recent years. This work addresses an emerging and significant extension of the electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP), namely EVRP with time windows, simultaneous pickup-delivery, and partial recharges (EVRP-TW-SPD), which has wide real-world applications. We propose a hybrid memetic algorithm (HMA) for solving EVRP-TW-SPD. HMA incorporates two novel components: a parallel-sequential station insertion procedure for handling partial recharges that can better avoid local optima compared to purely sequential insertion, and a cross-domain neighborhood search that explores solution spaces of both electric and non-electric problem domains simultaneously. These components can also be easily applied to various EVRP variants. To bridge the gap between existing benchmarks and real-world scenarios, we introduce a new, large-scale EVRP-TW-SPD benchmark set derived from real-world applications, containing instances with many more customers and charging stations than existing benchmark instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance advantages of HMA over existing algorithms across a wide range of problem instances. Both the benchmark set and HMA will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in this area.

Abstract: Digital collectible card games are not only a growing part of the video game industry, but also an interesting research area for the field of computational intelligence. This game genre allows researchers to deal with hidden information, uncertainty and planning, among other aspects. This paper proposes the use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to develop agents who play a card game, Hearthstone, by optimizing a data-driven decision-making mechanism that takes into account all the elements currently in play. Agents feature self-learning by means of a competitive coevolutionary training approach, whereby no external sparring element defined by the user is required for the optimization process. One of the agents developed through the proposed approach was runner-up (best 6%) in an international Hearthstone Artificial Intelligence (AI) competition. Our proposal performed remarkably well, even when it faced state-of-the-art techniques that attempted to take into account future game states, such as Monte-Carlo Tree search. This outcome shows how evolutionary computation could represent a considerable advantage in developing AIs for collectible card games such as Hearthstone.

                arXiv:2410.19277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing autonomous robotic manipulators is challenging due to the complex software interactions between vision and control components. A crucial element of modern robotic manipulators is the deep learning based object detection model. The creation and assessment of this model requires real world data, which can be hard to label and collect, especially when the hardware setup is not available. The current techniques primarily focus on using synthetic data to train deep neural networks (DDNs) and identifying failures through offline or online simulation-based testing. However, the process of exploiting the identified failures to uncover design flaws early on, and leveraging the optimized DNN within the simulation to accelerate the engineering of the DNN for real-world tasks remains unclear. To address these challenges, we propose the MARTENS (Manipulator Robot Testing and Enhancement in Simulation) framework, which integrates a photorealistic NVIDIA Isaac Sim simulator with evolutionary search to identify critical scenarios aiming at improving the deep learning vision model and uncovering system design flaws. Evaluation of two industrial case studies demonstrated that MARTENS effectively reveals robotic manipulator system failures, detecting 25 % to 50 % more failures with greater diversity compared to random test generation. The model trained and repaired using the MARTENS approach achieved mean average precision (mAP) scores of 0.91 and 0.82 on real-world images with no prior retraining. Further fine-tuning on real-world images for a few epochs (less than 10) increased the mAP to 0.95 and 0.89 for the first and second use cases, respectively. In contrast, a model trained solely on real-world data achieved mAPs of 0.8 and 0.75 for use case 1 and use case 2 after more than 25 epochs.

Abstract: Modularity has been widely studied as a mechanism to improve the capabilities of neural networks through various techniques such as hand-crafted modular architectures and automatic approaches. While these methods have sometimes shown improvements towards generalisation ability, robustness, and efficiency, the mechanisms that enable modularity to give performance advantages are unclear. In this paper, we investigate this issue and find that the amount of network modularity for optimal performance is likely entangled in complex relationships between many other features of the network and problem environment. Therefore, direct optimisation or arbitrary designation of a suitable amount of modularity in neural networks may not be beneficial. We used a classic neuroevolutionary algorithm which enables rich, automatic optimisation and exploration of neural network architectures and weights with varying levels of modularity. The structural modularity and performance of networks generated by the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm was assessed on three reinforcement learning tasks, with and without an additional modularity objective. The results of the quality-diversity optimisation algorithm, MAP-Elites, suggest intricate conditional relationships between modularity, performance, and other predefined network features.

Abstract: Brain-inspired machine intelligence research seeks to develop computational models that emulate the information processing and adaptability that distinguishes biological systems of neurons. This has led to the development of spiking neural networks, a class of models that promisingly addresses the biological implausibility and {the lack of energy efficiency} inherent to modern-day deep neural networks. In this work, we address the challenge of designing neurobiologically-motivated schemes for adjusting the synapses of spiking networks and propose contrastive-signal-dependent plasticity, a process which generalizes ideas behind self-supervised learning to facilitate local adaptation in architectures of event-based neuronal layers that operate in parallel. Our experimental simulations demonstrate a consistent advantage over other biologically-plausible approaches when training recurrent spiking networks, crucially side-stepping the need for extra structure such as feedback synapses.

                arXiv:2410.04992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long short-term memory (LSTM) has emerged as a definitive network for analyzing and inferring time series data. LSTM has the capability to extract spectral features and a mixture of temporal features. Due to this benefit, a similar feature extraction method is explored for the spiking counterparts targeting time-series data. Though LSTMs perform well in their spiking form, they tend to be compute and power intensive. Addressing this issue, this work proposes Multi-Compartment Leaky (MCLeaky) neuron as a viable alternative for efficient processing of time series data. The MCLeaky neuron, derived from the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model, contains multiple memristive synapses interlinked to form a memory component, which emulates the human brain's Hippocampus region. The proposed MCLeaky neuron based Spiking Neural Network model and its quantized variant were benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Spiking LSTMs to perform human stress detection, by comparing compute requirements, latency and real-world performances on unseen data with models derived through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Results show that networks with MCLeaky activation neuron managed a superior accuracy of 98.8% to detect stress based on Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals, better than any other investigated models, while using 20% less parameters on average. MCLeaky neuron was also tested for various signals including EDA Wrist and Chest, Temperature, ECG, and combinations of them. Quantized MCLeaky model was also derived and validated to forecast their performance on hardware architectures, which resulted in 91.84% accuracy. The neurons were evaluated for multiple modalities of data towards stress detection, which resulted in energy savings of 25.12x to 39.20x and EDP gains of 52.37x to 81.9x over ANNs, while offering a best accuracy of 98.8% when compared with the rest of the SOTA implementations.

Abstract: Indicator-based (multiobjective) diversity optimization aims at finding a set of near (Pareto-)optimal solutions that maximizes a diversity indicator, where diversity is typically interpreted as the number of essentially different solutions. Whereas, in the first diversity-oriented evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm, the NOAH algorithm by Ulrich and Thiele, the Solow Polasky Diversity (also related to Magnitude) served as a metric, other diversity indicators might be considered, such as the parameter-free Max-Min Diversity, and the Riesz s-Energy, which features uniformly distributed solution sets. In this paper, focusing on multiobjective diversity optimization, we discuss different diversity indicators from the perspective of indicator-based evolutionary algorithms (IBEA) with multiple objectives. We examine theoretical, computational, and practical properties of these indicators, such as monotonicity in species, twinning, monotonicity in distance, strict monotonicity in distance, uniformity of maximizing point sets, computational effort for a set of size~n, single-point contributions, subset selection, and submodularity. We present new theorems -- including a proof of the NP-hardness of the Riesz s-Energy Subset Selection Problem -- and consolidate existing results from the literature. In the second part, we apply these indicators in the NOAH algorithm and analyze search dynamics through an example. We examine how optimizing with one indicator affects the performance of others and propose NOAH adaptations specific to the Max-Min indicator.

Abstract: Most AI systems are black boxes generating reasonable outputs for given inputs. Some domains, however, have explainability and trustworthiness requirements that cannot be directly met by these approaches. Various methods have therefore been developed to interpret black-box models after training. This paper advocates an alternative approach where the models are transparent and explainable to begin with. This approach, EVOTER, evolves rule-sets based on simple logical expressions. The approach is evaluated in several prediction/classification and prescription/policy search domains with and without a surrogate. It is shown to discover meaningful rule sets that perform similarly to black-box models. The rules can provide insight into the domain, and make biases hidden in the data explicit. It may also be possible to edit them directly to remove biases and add constraints. EVOTER thus forms a promising foundation for building trustworthy AI systems for real-world applications in the future.

Abstract: The design of interpretable deep learning models working in relational domains poses an open challenge: interpretable deep learning methods, such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), are not designed to solve relational problems, while relational deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are not as interpretable as CBMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Relational Concept Bottleneck Models (R-CBMs), a family of relational deep learning methods providing interpretable task predictions. As special cases, we show that R-CBMs are capable of both representing standard CBMs and message-passing GNNs. To evaluate the effectiveness and versatility of these models, we designed a class of experimental problems, ranging from image classification to link prediction in knowledge graphs. In particular we show that R-CBMs (i) match generalization performance of existing relational black-boxes, (ii) support the generation of quantified concept-based explanations, (iii) effectively respond to test-time interventions, and (iv) withstand demanding settings including out-of-distribution scenarios, limited training data regimes, and scarce concept supervisions.

Abstract: Transit agencies world-wide face tightening budgets. To maintain quality of service while cutting costs, efficient transit network design is essential. But planning a network of public transit routes is a challenging optimization problem. The most successful approaches to date use metaheuristic algorithms to search through the space of possible transit networks by applying low-level heuristics that randomly alter routes in a network. The design of these low-level heuristics has a major impact on the quality of the result. In this paper we use deep reinforcement learning with graph neural nets to learn low-level heuristics for an evolutionary algorithm, instead of designing them manually. These learned heuristics improve the algorithm's results on benchmark synthetic cities with 70 nodes or more, and obtain state-of-the-art results when optimizing operating costs. They also improve upon a simulation of the real transit network in the city of Laval, Canada, by as much as 54% and 18% on two key metrics, and offer cost savings of up to 12% over the city's existing transit network.

">Cortical networks with multiple interneuron types generate oscillatory patterns during predictive coding</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding (PC) proposes that our brains work as an inference machine, generating an internal model of the world and minimizing predictions errors (i.e., differences between external sensory evidence and internal prediction signals). Theoretical models of PC often rely on high-level approaches, and therefore implementations detailing which neurons or pathways are used to compute prediction errors or adapt the internal representations, as well as their level of agreement with biological circuitry, are currently missing. Here we propose a computational model of PC, which integrates a neuroanatomically informed hierarchy of cortical areas with a precise laminar organization and cell-type-specific connectivity between pyramidal, PV, SST and VIP cells. Our model efficiently performs PC, even in the presence of external and internal noise, by forming latent representations of naturalistic visual input (MNIST, fashion-MNIST and grayscale CIFAR-10) via Hebbian learning and using them to predict sensory input by minimizing prediction errors. The model assumes that both positive and negative prediction errors are computed by stereotypical pyramidal-PV-SST-VIP circuits with the same structure but different incoming input. During sensory inference, neural oscillatory activity emerges in the system due to interactions between representation and prediction error microcircuits, with optogenetics-inspired inactivation protocols revealing a differentiated role of PV, SST and VIP cell types in such dynamics. Finally, our model shows anomalous responses to deviant stimuli within series of same-image presentations, in agreement with experimental results on mismatch negativity and oddball paradigms. We argue that our model constitutes an important step to better understand the circuits mediating PC in real cortical networks.

	<p>Background: Adult Changes in Thought (ACT), a prospective cohort study, enrolls older adult members of Kaiser Permanente Washington. We describe an ambitious project to abstract medical records facilitating epidemiological investigation. Methods: Abstracted data include medications; laboratory results; women&amp;amp;rsquo;s health; blood pressure; physical injuries; cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric and other medical conditions. Results: Of 1419 of 5763 participants with completed abstractions, 1387 (97.7%) were deceased; 602 (42.4%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias; 985 (69.4%) had a brain autopsy. Each participant had an average of 34.3 (SD = 13.4) years of data abstracted. Over 64% had pharmacy data preceding 1977; 87.5% had laboratory data preceding 1988. Stroke, anxiety, depression and confusion during hospitalization were common among participants diagnosed with dementia. Conclusions: Medical records are transformed into data for analyses with outcomes derived from other ACT data. We provide detailed, unparalleled longitudinal clinical data to support a variety of epidemiological research on clinical-pathological correlations.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Debates regarding how to represent verb phrases (VPs) consisting of the verb plus the complement and the aspectual marker -le in Mandarin Chinese remain an issue. Methods: Syntactic priming under a memory disguise paradigm was employed to investigate the issue using the SVO-ba alternation, where the SVO structure consists of a subject verb object, and the ba structure of a subject ba object verb, in five-year-olds (n = 216), an age with fully fledged grammatical knowledge but little interference from literacy. Results: The results indicate that both the complement and the marker -le should be represented in terms of phrasal rather than morphological structures. When -le is inflected to the verb alone, realization, which makes an event a fact, rather than completion, which makes an event finished, is accomplished. The event must be telicized to a state through a resultative complement to induce reliable production of the ba construction. The postverbal elements represent their own phrasal structure and challenge the verb-centered lexico-syntactic account because there are no additional representations left within a verb. Conclusions: More elicitations of the SVO than the ba invite future neurolinguistic explorations to disentangle the impacts of the frequency and thematic arrangement of agent and patient on grammatical representations cross-linguistically.</p>

	<p>Background: Managing anxiety and behavior during pediatric dental procedures is challenging. This study examines the effects of combining ibuprofen with midazolam sedation using both behavioral management and clinical hypnosis to improve patient cooperation and reduce post-treatment pain. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 311 children (mean age 74.2 months, standard deviation (SD) = 24.7) was conducted. Patients received either midazolam with ibuprofen (n = 156) or midazolam only (n = 155). Behavior was assessed using the Venham Behavior Rating Scale and anxiety with the Dental Subscale of Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Fear Survey Schedule (CFSS-DS) and the Inventory of Stressful Situations (ISS) questionnaires. Statistical analyses included Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests and correlation analyses. Results: Ibuprofen did not significantly improve behavior during procedures (drinking phase 0.61, SD 1.31, p = 0.13; before treatment 0.25, SD 0.93, p = 0.53, anesthesia 1.21, SD 1.55, p = 0.29; after treatment 0.51, SD 1.22, p = 0.68), indicating that pharmacological pain management alone is insufficient to address behavioral challenges. Ibuprofen significantly reduced post-treatment pain, with 7.2% of cases reporting pain in the non-ibuprofen group compared to none in the ibuprofen group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Ibuprofen had no effect on intraoperative behavior and only a limited effect on post-procedural pain, mainly for more invasive procedures. This study highlights the integration of sedation with behavioral strategies, such as clinical hypnosis, to manage anxiety and improve patient cooperation, aiming to enhance treatment outcomes using this integrative approach to pediatric dentistry. Further research is needed to optimize these strategies and verify them in a prospective setting.</p>

                Rabani et al. show that CD84 upregulation leads to increased immune suppression in the TME of TNBC. In Bregs, CD84 controls interleukin-10 expression through the β-catenin/Tcf4 pathway. Blocking CD84 potentiates anti-tumor immunity, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Hence, the authors suggest CD84 as a therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.

">Domain-specific Schema Reuse Supports Flexible Learning to Learn in Primate Brain</a></h4>

              
                Prior knowledge accelerates subsequent learning of similarly structured problems - a phenomenon termed "learning to learn" - by forming and reusing generalizable neural representations, i.e., the schemas. However, the stability-plasticity dilemma, i.e., how to exploit stable schemas to facilitate learning while remaining flexible towards possible changes, is not well understood. We hypothesize that restricting schemas to specific functional, e.g., decision-making, subspace and making it orthogonal to other subspaces allows the brain to balance stability and plasticity. To test it, we trained three macaques on visuomotor mapping tasks and recorded neural activity in the dorsolateral premotor cortex. By delineating decision and stimulus subspaces, we identified a schema-like manifold within only the decision subspace. The reuse of decision schemas significantly facilitated subsequent learning. In addition, the decision subspace exhibited a trend to be orthogonal to the stimulus subspace, minimizing interference between these two domains. Our results revealed that restricting schemas to specific functional domains can preserve useful knowledge while maintaining orthogonality with other subspaces, allowing for flexible adaptation to new environments, thereby resolving the stability-plasticity dilemma. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying brain's capability to learn both fast and flexibly, which can also inspire more efficient learning algorithms for artificial intelligence systems towards working in open, dynamic environments.

">Low Intestinal Doses of Botulinum Neurotoxins types A and B favour infection by Salmonella and Shigella without the flaccid paralysis of botulism</a></h4>

              
                Botulism is a life-threatening disease characterized by a descending flaccid paralysis caused by a protein neurotoxin (BoNT) released by different anaerobic bacterial species of the genus Clostridium. The paralysis results from blockade of neurotransmitter release from the terminals of peripheral cholinergic, skeletal and autonomic neurons exerted by BoNT through the cleavage of SNARE proteins, which are essential for neuroexocytosis. Here, we investigated the effect of different doses of BoNT serotypes A and B, the serotypes most commonly associated with human botulism, on enteric nervous system neurons which play an important role in gut health and physiology. We found that BoNT/A and BoNT/B enter cholinergic neurons where they cleave SNARE proteins even at doses that do not cause signs of flaccid neuroparalysis. However, these low BoNT doses favour the invasion and infection of the mouse body by Salmonella thyphimurium and Shigella flexneri. This may have significant animal health implications.

">Cortical layer 6b mediates state-dependent changes in brain activity and effects of orexin on waking and sleep</a></h4>

              
                One of the most distinctive features of the mammalian cerebral cortex is its laminar structure. Of all cortical layers, layer 6b (L6b) is by far the least-studied, despite exhibiting direct sensitivity to orexin and having widespread connectivity, suggesting an important role in regulating cortical oscillations and brain state. We performed chronic electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in mice in which a subset of L6b neurons was conditionally silenced, during undisturbed conditions, after sleep deprivation (SD), and after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of orexin. While the total amount of waking and sleep or the response to SD were not altered, L6b-'silenced' mice showed a slowing of theta-frequency (6-9 Hz) during wake and REM sleep, and a marked reduction of total EEG power, especially in NREM sleep. The infusion of orexin A increased wakefulness in both genotypes, but the effect was more pronounced in L6b-silenced mice, while the increase in theta-activity by orexin B was attenuated in L6b silenced animals. In summary, we show the role of cortical L6b in state-dependent brain oscillations and global vigilance state control, which could be mediated by orexinergic neurotransmission. Our findings provide new insights in the understanding of abnormal regulation of arousal states in neurodevelopmental and anxiety disorders.

">Effects of one-night partial sleep deprivation on perivascular space volume fraction: Findings from the Stockholm Sleepy Brain Study</a></h4>

              
                Increased waste clearance in the brain is thought to occur most readily during late-stage sleep (stage N3). Sleep deprivation disrupts time spent in deeper sleep stages, fragmenting the clearance process. Here, we have utilized the publicly available Stockholm Sleepy Brain Study to investigate whether various sleep-related measures are associated with changes in perivascular space (PVS) volume fraction following a late-night short-sleep experiment. Our sample consisted of 60 participants divided into old (65-75 years) and young (20-30 years) age groups. We found that partial sleep deprivation was not significantly associated with major PVS changes. In the centrum semiovale, we observed an interaction between percentage of total sleep time spent in N3 and sleep deprivation status on PVS volume fraction. In the basal ganglia, we saw an interaction between N2 (both percentage of total sleep time and absolute time in minutes) and sleep deprivation status. However, the significance of these findings did not survive multiple comparisons corrections. This work highlights the need for future longitudinal studies of PVS and sleep, allowing for quantification of within-subject morphological changes occurring in PVS due to patterns of poor sleep. Our findings here provide insight on the impacts that a single night of late-night short-sleep has on the perivascular waste clearance system.

">A novel male accessory gland peptide reduces female post-mating receptivity in the brown planthopper</a></h4>

              
                Mating in insects commonly induces a profound change in the physiology and behavior of the female that serves to secure numerous and viable offspring and to ensure paternity for the male by reducing receptivity of the female to further mating attempts. Here, we set out to characterize the post-mating response (PMR) in a pest insect, the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens and to identify a functional analog of sex peptide (SP) and/or other seminal fluid factors that contribute to the PMR in Drosophila. We find that BPHs display a distinct PMR that lasts for about 4 days and includes a change in female behavior with decreased receptivity to males and increased oviposition. Extract from male accessory glands (MAG) injected into virgin females triggers a similar PMR, lasting about 24h. Since SP does not exist in BPHs, we screened for candidate mediators by performing a transcriptional and proteomics analysis of MAG extract. We identified a novel 51 amino acid peptide present only in the MAG and not in female BPHs. This peptide, that we designate maccessin (macc), affects the female PMR. Females mated by males with macc knockdown display receptivity to wild type males in a second mating, which does not occur in controls. However, oviposition is not affected. Injection of recombinant macc reduces female receptivity, with no effect on oviposition. Thus, macc is so far the only candidate seminal fluid peptide that promotes a PMR in BPHs. Our analysis suggests that the gene encoding the macc precursor is restricted to species closely related to BPHs.

">Complex Properties of Training Stimuli Affect Brain Alignment in a Deep Network Model of Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Deep convolutional neural networks are important models of the visual cortex that account relatively well for brain activity and are able to perform ethologically relevant functions. However, it is unknown which combination of factors, such as network architecture, training objectives, and data best align this family of models with the brain. Here we investigate the statistics of training data. We hypothesized that stimuli that are naturalistic for mice would lead to higher similarity between deep network models and activity in mouse visual cortex. We used a video-game engine to create training datasets in which we varied the naturalism of the environment, the movement statistics, and the optics of the modelled eye. The naturalistic environment substantially and consistently led to greater brain similarity, while the other factors had more subtle and area-specific effects. We then hypothesized that differences in brain similarity between the two environments arose due to differences in spatial frequency spectra, distributions of color and orientation, and/or temporal autocorrelations. To test this, we created abstract environments, composed of cubes and spheres, that resembled the naturalistic and non-naturalistic environments in these respects. Contrary to our expectations, these factors accounted poorly for differences in brain similarity due to the naturalistic and non-naturalistic environments. This suggests that the higher brain similarities we observed after training with the naturalistic environment were due to more complex factors.

">Aberrant iron deposition in the multiple sclerosis spinal cord relates to neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Background: Iron accumulates in microglia-macrophages at the edge of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the brain. Iron-rimmed brain lesions strongly predict disability accumulation, supporting iron metabolism is crucial in MS pathology. Little is known about iron distribution in the spinal cord. Methods: Autopsy cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord samples from 9 controls and 46 MS donors of whom a subset (n=36) had mesiofrontal motor cortical tissue available for study, were labelled and systematically assessed for iron (DAB-enhanced Turnbull), myelin (PLP), axons (Palmgren silver), microglia-macrophages (TMEM119, Iba1, CD68), astroglia (GFAP), oligodendroglia (OLIG2), acute axonal injury (B-APP, SMI-32, NPY-1R) and oxidative stress (E06). MS lesional and non-lesional areas were considered. Total non-haem iron was quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Results: In controls, iron predominantly localised to oligodendrocytes with total non-haem iron relating to total myelin fraction, which markedly differed in MS where iron accumulated in microglia-macrophages, subpial astrocytes, and axons in non-lesional areas. Iron laden microglia-macrophages were over-represented relative to total microglial-macrophages and displayed dysmorphic features. Iron-positive axons showed a disto-proximal gradient (highest at lumbar level) with a predilection for the corticospinal tracts. The extent of iron axon positivity related to smaller spinal cord area, lower total axonal counts, and greater oxidative stress. Iron positivity in each cellular compartment (i.e. subpial astrocytes, microglia-macrophage and axons) related to one-another and total non-haem iron correlated with axonal counts in MS. No iron-rimmed lesions were detected in the spinal cord unlike in cortical grey and subcortical white matter of the same cases where 22% and 80% of iron-rimmed lesions, respectively, were seen. Conclusions: Despite the conspicuous absence of iron-rimmed lesions in the MS spinal cord, we demonstrate widespread aberrant iron distribution in the MS spinal cord that relates to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration independent of demyelination. The distal cord predominant and corticospinal tract specific accumulation of iron in axons mirrors the pattern of length-dependent motoric disability commonly encountered in progressive MS. These findings implicate aberrant iron accumulation as a novel, clinically relevant, feature of MS spinal cord pathology.

">Apelin-13 in the paraventricular nucleus protects myocardium from ischemia via V1a receptor of the paraventricular nucleus and GABAA receptor γ2 of the nucleus tractus solitarii in rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Apelin system plays a significant role in central blood pressure regulation, but its role in neural control of myocardial injury protection is poorly understood. Thus, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of apelin-13 in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Methods: The cardiac functions were assessed after microinjecting or transferring the apelin-13 gene into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of rat models with myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Results: In MI rats, we showed that apelin-13 expression decreased in PVN, V1a receptor expression increased in PVN and nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), and GABAA receptor (GAR) {gamma}2 expression increased in NTS. In primary cultured hypothalamus and medulla oblongata neurons, V1a receptor expression was downregulated by APJ receptor antagonist or GAR agonist, indicating that there are interactions between these receptors in neurons. Apelin-13 overexpression in PVN significantly improved cardiac function of MI and I/R rats, including left-ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left-ventricular end-systolic diameter, left-ventricular ejection fraction, and left-ventricular fractions shortening, accompanied by decreased noradrenaline and increased vasopressin plasma levels. Myocardial ischemia-related apoptotic and inflammatory pathway markers (Bcl-1, Bax, TGF-{beta}1, CCR5, Smad2) were downregulated and four neuropeptides of the parasympathetic endocrine system (somatostatin, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, vasoactive intestinal peptide) were increased in serum correspondingly with cardiac function improving. V1a receptor antagonist in PVN or NTS and GAR agonist in NTS decreased the effects of apelin-13 overexpression on cardiac function of MI and I/R rats. Conclusions: Overexpression of apelin-13 in PVN leads to cardiac function improvement via V1a receptor in PVN and NTS, and GAR?{gamma}2 in NTS. Parasympathetic endocrine system and myocardial ischemia?related apoptotic and inflammation signaling pathways are involved in apelin-13 in PVN-mediated cardiac function regulation, which provides evidence for neural regulation of cardiovascular diseases.

">Spatially global effects of feature-based attention in functional subdivisions of human subcortical nuclei</a></h4>

              
                Attention can prioritize the processing of non-spatial features throughout the visual field. While human subcortical nuclei are known to play important roles in spatial attention, the subcortical mechanisms of feature-based attention remain elusive.Using high-resolution 7T fMRI, we investigated the spatially global effects of color-based attention in functional subdivisions of human subcortical nuclei. Paying attention to a color matching the unattended stimulus across the visual field selectively modulated BOLD signals in the parvocellular (P) layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, enhancing the response to the unattended stimulus while reducing the response to the attended stimulus. The spatially global effects of color-based attention were also found in the deeper layers of the superior colliculus (SC), early visual cortices, and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) of the parietal lobe. Effective connectivity analyses further revealed enhanced feedforward and feedback connectivity between LGN and V1, along with top down modulation from IPS through the SC and ventral pulvinar. Finally, attended color can be decoded from multi-voxel response patterns in frontoparietal regions. These findings demonstrate that color-based attention selectively modulates color processing in P subdivisions of the LGN of the thalamus throughout the visual field, controlled by top-down signals from the parietal cortex through the SC and pulvinar.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Driving abilities require the synchronized activity of cerebral networks associated with sensorimotor integration, motricity, and executive functions. Drivers with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (DwP) have impaired driving ability, but little is known about the impact of &amp;amp;ldquo;wearing-off&amp;amp;rdquo; and therapies in addition to L-DOPA on driving capacities. This study aimed to (i) compare driving performance between DwP during different motor states and healthy controls and (ii) assess the impact of add-on therapies on driving abilities. Methods: DwP (n = 26) were enrolled as individuals experiencing wearing-off symptoms and treated (within 6 months before the enrollment) with add-on therapies to L-DOPA, including MAO inhibitors for DwP-A (n = 12) or opicapone for DwP-B (n = 14). Age- and sex-matched controls (CON, n = 12) were also enrolled. DwP received two driving assessments in a driving simulator during their &amp;amp;ldquo;best-on&amp;amp;rdquo; time and during their wearing-off time on different days. An anamnestic driving questionnaire was collected with the assistance of partners. A Virtual Driving Rating Scale (VDRS) was calculated, as well as learning curves (LCs) for driving items calculated in minutes. Results: DwP reported worse driving performance than CON at the driving questionnaire. In line with this, DwP showed worse VDRS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and LC (p = 0.021) than CON. Lower VDRS was associated with wearing-off (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), but DwP-B had better driving performance while in their &amp;amp;ldquo;best-on&amp;amp;rdquo; time (p = 0.037) and more items improving with LCs (7 vs. 3) than DwP-A. Conclusions: DwP demonstrated impaired driving compared to controls. Wearing-off symptoms can also affect driving ability, but therapies (opicapone more so than MAO inhibitors) may play a role in preserving specific driving skills, possibly through maintaining learning abilities.</p>

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the potential associations between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and the basal metabolic rate (BMR) with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and emotional instability (EI) using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). Additionally, it sought to identify key molecular mechanisms underlying emotional instability through a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. Methods: MR analyses utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were conducted to estimate the effects of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and the BMR on PTSD, MDD, and EI. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Concurrently, a bioinformatic analysis was executed on gene expression datasets (GSE53987 and GSE21138) derived from emotionally unstable patients. This analysis encompassed the differential gene expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by an functional enrichment analysis to uncover key molecular pathways associated with EI. Results: The MR analysis revealed that increased physical activity may have a protective effect against PTSD, albeit with inconsistent effects on MDD and EI. Sedentary behavior and the BMR demonstrated minimal associations with PTSD, MDD, or EI. The bioinformatic analysis identified 114 DEGs associated with EI, with YWHAB, SRRM2, MST1, HDAC10, and HSPA1A highlighted as significant genes. The functional enrichment analysis of these DEGs unveiled key pathways potentially involved in the molecular pathology of emotional instability. Conclusions: Physical activity appears to protect against PTSD, whereas its effects on MDD and EI are less definitive. The bioinformatic findings offer a deeper molecular understanding of EI, pinpointing specific genes and pathways that may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Further research is warranted to elucidate these intricate interactions and the identified molecular mechanisms.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Migraine is a disease that stands out for its high prevalence and socioeconomic costs. It involves the entire trigeminovascular system, the signaling substances, and their targets. However, the role of meningeal mast cells in migraine is still unclear. To better understand one of the components of neurogenic inflammation underlying migraine pathophysiology, we developed an in vivo rat model in which the dura mater was exposed bilaterally to investigate the influence of topiramate on capsaicin-induced mast cell degranulation and CGRP release from dura mater. Methods: On the day of the experiment, rats were anesthetized, and a craniectomy was performed on each parietal bone. Test substances were applied in situ over the dura mater using the right and left sides of the dura mater for the test and control, respectively. After exposure, the dura mater was processed for mast cell staining and counting. Using this setup, the effect of capsaicin (10&amp;amp;minus;3 M) was evaluated in rats of both sexes, and subsequently the effect of in situ (10&amp;amp;minus;3 M, 20 &amp;amp;micro;L) and (20 mg/kg/day for 10 days) topiramate treatment on mast cell degranulation and CGRP release were evaluated. Results: In both female and male rats, there was a greater amount of degranulated mast cells in the side stimulated by capsaicin compared to the control side in both females (18 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3% vs. 74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3%; p = 0.016) and males (28 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2% vs. 74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3%, p = 0.016). In the group treated with topiramate for 10 days prior to the experiments, capsaicin did not induce mast cell degranulation (control 20 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1% vs. capsaicin 22 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%, p = 0.375) in contrast to animals treated for 10 days with gavage control (control 25 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1% vs. capsaicin 76 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%, p = 0.016). Topiramate applied in situ concomitant with capsaicin did not protect the mast cells from degranulation in response to capsaicin (38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2% vs. 44 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%, p = 0.016). There was a significant reduction in CGRP release from the dura mater in the group treated with topiramate for 10 days compared to the control. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a novel experimental model wherein systemic administration of topiramate is observed to modulate the impact of capsaicin on meningeal mast cell degranulation.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Post-traumatic growth (PTG) has the potential to draw positive consequences from trauma. Hence, there is interest in finding ways to promote PTG. Research has identified an attentional bias towards positive resilience-related words (e.g., &amp;amp;ldquo;persistence&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;amp;rdquo;) in university students who report high PTG after experiencing adversities. Although people can respond to these experiences by showing low PTG, this bias seems to help with their struggle by making purposeful contents more accessible. Therefore, boosting attentional bias towards positive resilience-related words could help people with low PTG. Methods: In this study, the participants were thirty-six university students who had experienced bullying before entering university. Using a Stroop emotional task, they identified the color of resilience and neutral words, either positive or negative, before and after being submitted to transcranial direct current stimulation. Stimulation was targeted at the right temporal area involved in intentionality processing. Results: In the anodal condition, the results support a stimulation effect on the resilience attentional bias that could benefit participants with low PTG. A significant moderation of approach motivation for this effect was also found. Specifically, only when participants had medium or high approach motivation did stimulation boost the attentional bias in students with low PTG. Conclusions: These results support that tDCS stimulation in this brain area is effective in enhancing resilience attentional bias in low-PTG students. However, for this effect to occur it is necessary to have approach motivation, which is motivation related to goals.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between developmental and premorbid body composition measurements and the risk of motor neuron disease (MND).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a cohort study in the UK Biobank to assess the association of developmental body metrics and premorbid body composition measures (using 28 measurements and 7 patterns of body composition) with the risk of MND. Among participants with longitudinal measures, we compared the changes in body composition over time between individuals who later developed MND and those who remained free of MND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 412,691 individuals included in this study, 549 people received an MND diagnosis during the follow-up visit. Higher birth weight was associated with an increased risk of MND among individuals born over 4 kg (hazard ratio [HR] per kg increase = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.38–3.55), and taller adult height was associated with an increased risk of MND (HR per 5 cm increase = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03–1.17). We observed that measures of elevated fat mass were associated with a lower risk of MND more than 5 years before diagnosis. A higher “leg-dominant fat distribution” pattern was associated with an increased risk whereas higher “muscle strength” was associated with a reduced risk of MND 5 years before diagnosis. Longitudinal analyses indicated a faster decline in measures of fat mass and muscle strength, as well as a shift in fat distribution from arm to leg dominant, among individuals who later developed MND, compared with others.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Body composition at early and middle age may be indicative of the risk of MND development. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

">Overt visual attention modulates decision-related signals in ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                When indicating a preference between two options, decision makers are thought to compare and accumulate evidence in an attention-guided process. Little is known about this process's neural substrates or how visual attention affects the representations of accumulated evidence. We conducted a simultaneous eye-tracking and fMRI experiment in which human subjects gradually learned about the value of two food-lotteries. With this design we were able to extend decisions over a prolonged time-course, manipulate the temporal onset of evidence, and therefore dissociate sampled and accumulated evidence. Consistent with past work, we found correlates of sampled evidence in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and correlates of accumulated evidence in the prefrontal and parietal cortex. We also found that more gaze at an option increased its choice probability and that gaze amplified sampled-value signals in the vmPFC and ventral striatum. Most importantly, we found that gaze modulated accumulated-value signals in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), providing novel evidence that visual attention has lasting effects on decision variables and suggesting that activity in the pre-SMA reflects accumulated evidence and not decision conflict. These results shed new light on the neural mechanisms underlying gaze-driven decision processes.

">Resting-state functional connectivity changes following audio-tactile speech training</a></h4>

              
                Understanding speech in background noise is a challenging task, especially if the signal is also distorted. In a series of previous studies we have shown that comprehension can improve if simultaneously to the auditory speech, the person receives speech-extracted low-frequency signals on fingertips. The effect increases after short audio-tactile speech training. Here we use resting-state functional magnetic resonance, measuring spontaneous low-frequency oscillations in the brain while at rest, to assess training-induced changes in functional connectivity. We show enhanced connectivity within a right-hemisphere cluster encompassing the middle temporal motion area (MT), and the extrastriate body area (EBA), and lateral occipital cortex (LOC), which before training is found to be more connected to bilateral dorsal anterior insula. Furthermore, early visual areas are found to switch from increased connectivity with the auditory cortex before, to increased connectivity with an association sensory/multisensory parietal hub, contralateral to the palm receiving vibrotactile inputs, after. Also the right sensorimotor cortex, including finger representations, is more connected internally after training. The results altogether can be interpreted within two main complementary frameworks. One, speech-specific, relates to the pre-existing brain connectivity for audio-visual speech processing, including early visual, motion and body regions for lip-reading and gesture analysis in difficult acoustic conditions, which the new audio-tactile speech network might be built upon. The other refers to spatial/body awareness and audio-tactile integration, including in the revealed parietal and insular regions. It is possible that an extended training period may be necessary to more effectively strengthen direct connections between the auditory and sensorimotor brain regions, for the utterly novel speech comprehension task. The outcomes of the study can be relevant for both basic neuroscience, as well as development of rehabilitation tools for the hearing impaired population.

">Encoding manifolds constructed from grating responses organize responses to natural scenes in cortical visual areas</a></h4>

              
                We have created "encoding manifolds" to reveal the overall responses of a brain area to a variety of stimuli. Encoding manifolds organize response properties globally: each point on an encoding manifold is a neuron, and nearby neurons respond similarly to the stimulus ensemble in time. We previously found, using a large stimulus ensemble including optic flows, that encoding manifolds for the retina were highly clustered, with each cluster corresponding to a different ganglion cell type. In contrast, the topology of the V1 manifold was continuous. Now, using responses of individual neurons from the Allen Institute Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset in the mouse, we infer encoding manifolds for V1 and for five higher cortical visual areas (VISam, VISal, VISpm, VISlm, and VISrl). We show here that the encoding manifold topology computed only from responses to various grating stimuli is also continuous, not only for V1 but also for the higher visual areas, with smooth coordinates spanning it that include, among others, orientation selectivity and firing-rate magnitude. Surprisingly, the encoding manifold for gratings also provides information about natural scene responses. To investigate whether neurons respond more strongly to gratings or natural scenes, we plot the log ratio of natural scene responses to grating responses (mean firing rates) on the encoding manifold. This reveals a global coordinate axis organizing neurons' preferences between these two stimuli. This coordinate is orthogonal (i.e., uncorrelated) to that organizing firing rate magnitudes in VISp. Analyzing layer responses, a preference for gratings is concentrated in layer 6, whereas preference for natural scenes tends to be higher in layers 2/3 and 4. We also find that preference for natural scenes dominates the responses of neurons that prefer low (0.02 cpd) and high (0.32 cpd) spatial frequencies, rather than intermediate ones (0.04 to 0.16 cpd). Conclusion: while gratings seem limited and natural scenes unconstrained, machine learning algorithms can reveal subtle relationships between them beyond linear techniques.

">The impact of dwell time on the contextual effect of visual and passive lead-in movements</a></h4>

              
                Contextual cues arising from distinct movements are crucial in shaping control strategies for human movement. Here, we examine the impact of visual and passive lead-in movement cues on unimanual motor learning, focusing on the influence of dwell time, in which two-part movements are separated by the interval between the end of the first movement and the start of the second. We used a robotic manipulandum to implement a point-to-point interference task with switching opposing viscous curl fields in male and female human participants. Consistent with prior research, in both visual and passive lead-in conditions, participants showed significant adaptation to opposing dynamics with short dwell times. As dwell time increased for both visual and passive signals, past movement information had less contextual influence. However, the efficacy of visual movement cues declined faster as dwell times increased. At dwell times greater than 800ms, the contextual influence of prior visual movement was small, whereas the effectiveness of passive lead-in movement was found to be significantly greater. This indicates that the effectiveness of sensory movement cues in motor learning is modality-dependent. We hypothesize that such differences may arise because proprioceptive signals directly relate to arm movements, whereas visual inputs can relate to many aspects of movement in the environment and not just to our own arm movements. Therefore, the motor system may not always find them as relevant for predictive control of dynamics.

">Chronic activation of corticospinal tract neurons after pyramidotomy injury enhances neither behavioral recovery nor axonal sprouting</a></h4>

              
                Modulation of neural activity is a promising strategy to influence the growth of axons and improve behavioral recovery after damage to the central nervous system. The benefits of neuromodulation likely depend on optimization across multiple input parameters. Here we used a chemogenetic approach to achieve continuous, long-term elevation of neural activity in murine corticospinal tract (CST) neurons. To specifically target CST neurons, AAV2-retro-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry or matched mCherry control was injected to the cervical spinal cord of adult Emx1-Cre transgenic mice. Pilot studies verified efficient transgene expression in CST neurons and effective elevation of neural activity as assessed by cFos immunohistochemistry. In subsequent experiments mice were administered either DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry or control DIO-mCherry, were pre-trained on a pellet retrieval task, and then received unilateral pyramidotomy injury to selectively ablate the right CST. Mice then received continual clozapine via drinking water and weekly testing on the pellet retrieval task, followed by cortical injection of a viral tracer to assess cross-midline sprouting by the spared CST. After sacrifice at eight weeks post-injury immunohistochemistry for cFos verified elevated CST activity in hM3Dq-treated animals and immunohistochemistry for PKC-gamma verified unilateral ablation of the CST in all animals. Despite the chronic elevation of CST activity, however, both groups showed similar levels of cross-midline CST sprouting and similar success in the pellet retrieval task. These data indicate that continuous, long-term elevation of activity that is targeted specifically to CST neurons does not affect compensatory sprouting or directed forelimb movements.

">Meditation in the third-person perspective modulates minimal self and heartbeat-evoked potentials</a></h4>

              
                Experienced meditation practitioners often report altered states of their sense of self, including decentering and distancing the self from the body and current concerns. Altered states of the sense of self, such as disembodiment and distancing of the self from the body, have also been induced experimentally using virtual reality (VR) and linked neurally to heartbeat evoked potentials (HEPs). Whereas many studies investigated the related neural correlates of such decentering during meditation, none experimentally modulated the sense of self during meditation practice using VR nor determined the potentially associated behavioral changes of the sense of self. Here we determined HEPs and behavioral measures in 23 participants who performed a guided meditation practice in VR, either from a third-person (3PP) or first-person perspective (1PP) to modulate the sense of self. In the 3PP versus 1PP meditation condition, we report stronger sensations of detachment and disconnection, reduced salience of the perceived body boundary, and reduced self-identification with the body. HEP analysis revealed differential neural responses between conditions, characterized by a more negative HEP amplitude in the 3PP condition, associated with activation of the posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. Leveraging a new VR-supported meditation platform and methods, these data link the sense of self in meditation practice to the neuroscience of the bodily self, based on subjective, behavioral, and neural measures.

">Brain-like learning with exponentiated gradients</a></h4>

              
                Computational neuroscience relies on gradient descent (GD) for training artificial neural network (ANN) models of the brain. The advantage of GD is that it is effective at learning difficult tasks. However, it produces ANNs that are a poor phenomenological fit to biology, making them less relevant as models of the brain. Specifically, it violates Dale's law, by allowing synapses to change from excitatory to inhibitory and leads to synaptic weights that are not log-normally distributed, contradicting experimental data. Here, starting from first principles of optimisation theory, we present an alternative learning algorithm, exponentiated gradient (EG), that respects Dale's Law and produces log-normal weights, without losing the power of learning with gradients. We also show that in biologically relevant settings EG outperforms GD, including learning from sparsely relevant signals and dealing with synaptic pruning. Altogether, our results show that EG is a superior learning algorithm for modelling the brain with ANNs.

">Loss of Calcitonin gene-related Related Receptor component protein (RCP) in nervous system can bias gepant antagonism</a></h4>

              
                We examined calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) effects on behavioral surrogates for motion-induced nausea and static imbalance in the nestinRCP null (-/-), a novel mouse model that loses expression of receptor component protein (RCP) in the nervous system after tamoxifen induction. The assays used were the motion-induced thermoregulation and center of pressure (CoP) assays. Findings suggest CGRP affects behavioral measures in the nestinRCP (-/-) similarly to littermate controls, since CGRP was observed to increase female sway and diminish tail vasodilations to provocative motion in both sexes. However, the CGRP-receptor antagonist olcegepant did not antagonize CGRPs effects in the nestinRCP (-/-) null mice, whereas it was effective in littermate controls. Findings suggest RCP loss may change the sensitivity of the CGRP receptor and affect the efficacy of receptor antagonists.

">Statistical method accounts for microscopic electric field distortions around neurons when simulating activation thresholds</a></h4>

              
                Notwithstanding advances in computational models of neuromodulation, there are mismatches between simulated and experimental activation thresholds. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex generates motor evoked potentials (MEPs). At the threshold of MEP generation, whole-head models predict macroscopic (at millimeter scale) electric fields (50-70 V/m) which are considerably below conventionally simulated cortical neuron thresholds (200-300 V/m). We hypothesize that this apparent contradiction is in part a consequence of electrical field warping by brain microstructure. Classical neuronal models ignore the physical presence of neighboring neurons and microstructure and assume that the macroscopic field directly acts on the neurons. In previous work, we performed advanced numerical calculations considering realistic microscopic compartments (e.g., cells, blood vessels), resulting in locally inhomogeneous (micrometer scale) electric field and altered neuronal activation thresholds. Here we combine detailed neural threshold simulations under homogeneous field assumptions with microscopic field calculations, leveraging a novel statistical approach. We show that, provided brain-region specific microstructure metrics, a single statistically derived scaling factor between microscopic and macroscopic electric fields can be applied in predicting neuronal thresholds. For the cortical sample considered, the statistical methods match TMS experimental thresholds. Our approach can be broadly applied to neuromodulation models, where fully coupled microstructure scale simulations may not be practical.

">Reward invigorates isometric gripping actions</a></h4>

              
                Individuals exhibit a propensity to move faster toward more rewarding stimuli. While this phenomenon has been observed in movements, the effect of reward on implicit control of isometric actions, like gripping or grasping, is relatively unknown. How reward-related invigoration generalizes to other effortful actions is an important question. Reward invigorates reaching movements and saccades, supporting the idea that reward pays the additional effort cost of moving faster. Effort in isometric force generation is less understood, so here we ask whether and how reward-related invigoration generalizes to isometric force gripping. And if so, what implicit characteristics of gripping change when there is a prospect of reward? Participants (N=19) gripped a force transducer and the force applied was mapped to radial position of an onscreen cursor. Each trial, a target appeared in one of four locations; increasing grip force moved the cursor toward the target. The gripping action was interchangeable for all target positions. In each block of 100 trials, one target was consistently rewarded, while the other targets were not. When gripping to acquire the rewarded target, participants reacted faster, generated force more rapidly and to a greater extent, while intriguingly maintaining the same accuracy and integral of force over time. These findings support the generalization of reward-related invigoration in isometric force tasks, and that the brain exquisitely trades-off reward and effort costs to obtain reward more rapidly without compromising accuracy or more effort costs than necessary.

">Body-wandering reveals an embodied dimension of thought with distinct affective and neural signatures</a></h4>

              
                Humans often engage in self-generated thoughts when unoccupied by external events, a phenomenon commonly known as mind-wandering. Previous research has predominantly focused on the cognitive aspects of mind-wandering, overlooking the potential embodied or interoceptive components that contribute to our ongoing thought patterns. In this study, we addressed this gap by exploring "body-wandering"-thoughts related to internal bodily sensations such as breathing, heartbeat, and gastrointestinal functions. To assess body-wandering, we applied a retrospective multi-dimensional interoceptive experience sampling approach in 536 healthy participants concurrently with resting-state functional brain imaging. Our findings revealed that body-wandering is distinct from cognitively focused thoughts, underscoring the unique role of embodied processes in ongoing experience. Embodied thought patterns were associated with increased negative affect, heightened physiological arousal, and reduced ADHD symptoms. In contrast, cognitive-focused thoughts were linked to decreased negative affect, lower arousal, and higher depression symptoms. Notably, body-wandering corresponded with a unique neural signature involving increased connectivity between somatomotor, interoceptive, and thalamocortical brain networks. These results emphasise the importance of incorporating embodied processes into theoretical models of mind-wandering and suggest that individual differences in body-wandering significantly impact emotional states and mental health.

">Saccade onset, not fixation onset, best explains early sensory responses across the human visual cortex during naturalistic vision</a></h4>

              
                Visual processing has traditionally been investigated using static viewing paradigms, where participants are presented with streams of randomized stimuli. Observations from such experiments have been generalized to naturalistic vision, which is based on active sampling via eye movements. In studies of naturalistic vision, visual processing stages are thought to be initiated at the onset of fixations, equivalent to a stimulus onset. Here we test whether findings from static visual paradigms translate to active, naturalistic vision. Utilizing head-stabilized magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye tracking data of 5 participants who freely explored thousands of natural images, we show that saccade onset, not fixation onset, explains most variance in latency and amplitude of the early sensory component M100. Source-projected MEG topographies of image and saccade onset were anticorrelated, demonstrating neural dynamics that share similar topographies but produce oppositely oriented fields. Our findings challenge the prevailing approach for studying natural vision and highlight the role of internally generated signals in the dynamics of sensory processing.

">Continuous integration of heading and goal directions guides steering</a></h4>

              
                Navigating animals must integrate a diverse array of sensory cues into a single locomotor decision. Insects perform intricate navigational feats using a brain region termed the central complex in which an animal's heading direction is transformed through several layers of circuitry to elicit goal-directed locomotion. These transformations occur mostly in the fan-shaped body (FB), a major locus of multi-sensory integration in the central complex. Key aspects of these sensorimotor computations have been extensively characterized by functional studies, leveraging the genetic tools available in the fruit fly. However, our understanding of how neuronal activity in the FB dictates locomotor behaviors during navigation remains enigmatic. Here, we manipulate the activity of two key neuronal populations that input into the FB--the PFNa and PFNd neurons--used to encode the direction of two complex navigational cues: wind plumes and optic flow, respectively. We find that flies presented with unidirectional optic flow steer along curved walking trajectories, but silencing PFNd neurons abolishes this curvature. We next use optogenetic activation to introduce a fictive heading signal in the PFNs to establish the causal relationship between their activity and steering behavior. Our studies reveal that the central complex guides locomotion by summing the PFN-borne directional signals and shifting movement trajectories left or right accordingly. Based on these results, we propose a model of central complex-mediated locomotion wherein the fly achieves fine-grained control of sensory-guided steering by continuously integrating its heading and goal directions over time.

">Social Experience Shapes Fighting Strategies for Reproductive Success</a></h4>

              
                Social isolation generally increases aggression but decreases mating competition, resulting in an intricate and ambiguous relationship between social experience, aggression, and reproductive success. In male Drosophila, aggression is often characterized by lunging, a frequent and comparatively gentle combat behavior. Here, we establish a behavioral paradigm for studying a less frequent but more vigorous fighting form known as tussling. We discover that while social enrichment decreases lunging, aligning with past observations, it heightens the more forceful tussling behavior. These two forms of aggression rely on different olfactory receptor neurons, specifically Or67d for lunging and Or47b for tussling. We further identify three pairs of central pC1 neurons that specifically promote tussling. Moreover, shifting from lunging to tussling in socially enriched males facilitates better territory control and mating success, mitigating the disadvantages associated with aging. These findings reveal how social experience shapes fighting strategies to optimize reproductive success.

">Testing the Tests: Using Connectome-Based Predictive Models to Reveal the Systems Standardized Tests and Clinical Symptoms Are Reflecting</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging has achieved considerable success in elucidating the neurophysiological underpinnings of various brain functions. Tools such as standardized cognitive tests and symptom inventories have played a crucial role in informing neuroimaging studies, helping to uncover the underlying brain systems associated with these measures. Substantial strides have been taken in developing models, such as connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), that establish connections between external measures and the human connectome, offering insights into how the functional organization of the brain varies in relation to scores on external measures. Here, we depart from the conventional feed-forward approach and introduce a feed-back approach that allows testing of the tests. Since the inception of cognitive psychology over 60 years ago, cognitive tests have been meticulously developed to measure specific components of cognition. These tests, which have undergone extensive validation and have been standardized and administered to millions, operate on explicit assumptions about the cognitive components they assess. Rather than using external tests to identify the circuits supporting test scores, we a priori define networks of interest and quantify the extent to which these circuits support the test measure. To demonstrate this, we define functional connectivity networks for six cognitive constructs and quantify their contribution to performance across a spectrum of standardized cognitive tests and clinical measures. Employing robust machine learning in a predictive modeling framework, we show how this approach can be used to select tests according to the networks they rely upon. This establishes a biologically grounded metric for test comparison. This approach also yields a brain-driven process for forming composite tests by selecting test combinations that depend on the same proportional brain systems, or for a single network of interest, combining tests with the highest predictive power for that network. This brain-driven approach results in more robust behavioral assessments and enhanced predictive power for the network of interest. We illustrate how this methodology can be applied to evaluate the inclusion of specific sub-tests within a composite score, revealing instances where composite scores are reinforced or weakened by subtest inclusion in terms of the specificity of the brain network they interrogate. The brain-test score modeling approach presented here provides a biologically driven approach to the selection of external cognitive and symptom measures directed at specific brain systems. It opens new avenues of research by providing a framework for the development of new tests and measures guided by quantitative brain metrics.

">Imaging synaptic density in ageing and Alzheimer's Disease with -SynVesT-1</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring synaptic injury in neurodegenerative diseases may provide new insights into the evolution of the degenerative process as well as a potential mechanism to target for preservation of function. Synaptic density imaging with PET is a relatively new approach to this issue. However, there are remaining questions about technical approaches to data analysis including reference region selection, and how specific phenotypic presentations and symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are reflected in alterations in synaptic density. Methods: Using an SV2A PET ligand radiolabeled with the 18F isotope ([18F]-SynVesT-1) we performed sensitivity analyses to determine the optimal reference tissue modelling approach to derive whole brain ratio images. Using these whole brain images from a sample of young adults, older adults, and patients with varied phenotypic presentations of AD we then contrast regional SV2A density and in vivo AD biomarkers. Result: Reference tissue optimisation concluded that a cerebellar grey matter reference region is best for deriving whole brain ratio images. Using these whole brain ratio images, we find a strong inverse association between [18F]-SynVesT-1 PET uptake and amyloid beta and tau PET deposition. Finally, we find that individuals with lower temporal grey matter volume but higher temporal [18F]-SynVesT-1 PET uptake show preserved performance on the MMSE. Conclusions: [18F]-SynVesT-1 PET shows a close association with in vivo AD pathology and preserved SV2A density may be a possible marker for resilience to neurodegeneration.

">'Mini analysis' is an unreliable reporter of synaptic changes</a></h4>

              
                Analysis of miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs, or 'minis') is one of the most extensively employed approaches to determine the functional properties of synaptic connections. The popularity of this technique stems from its simplicity. Patch-clamp recording is used to observe spontaneous transmission occurring at synapses throughout a neuron's dendritic tree. These events are analysed in an attempt to determine quantal synaptic parameters and changes during experimental manipulation. For decades, changes in the amplitude or frequency of mPSCs have been interpreted as evidence for specific synaptic modifications, including changes in presynaptic release sites, postsynaptic receptor abundance or even nanoscale changes in the alignment of synaptic machinery. However, at the majority of brain synapses, these events are small, with many undetectable due to recording noise. Here, using both simulated and experimental data, we demonstrate that interpreting synaptic changes from mPSC datasets is fundamentally fallible. Due to incomplete detection of event distributions, seemingly specific changes in mPSC amplitude or frequency falsely report actual synaptic changes. In addition, probabilistic detection of small events gives false confidence in the completeness of detection and inaccurate determination of quantal size. We not only demonstrate the dense pitfalls of mini analysis, but also establish a method for experimental detection of the detection limit, allowing more robust data analysis and scientific interpretation.

">Connexin 43 mediated mitochondrial transfer prevents cisplatin induced sensory neurodegeneration.</a></h4>

              
                Platinum based chemotherapeutics cisplatin are front-line treatments for paediatric and adult cancer. Despite advancements in medical interventions chemotherapy-induced peripheral sensory neuropathy is a common adverse health related complication that can persist for the long-term and impacts upon individuals quality of life. Recently, the causes of chemotherapy induced sensory neurodegeneration has been linked to sensory neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction. Here this study investigated cisplatin induced sensory neurodegeneration and how donation of monocytic mitochondria to recipient cisplatin damaged dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons prevent platinum-based chemotherapy-induced sensory neurotoxicity. Neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y, or mouse DRG sensory neurons were treated with either vehicle or cisplatin, and co-cultured with mitotracker-labelled THP1 monocytes. Cisplatin induced dysmorphic mitochondria and shifted to a glycolytic dependent energy production, with diminishment in oxidative phosphorylation in cisplatin treated dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons. DRG sensory neurons exposed to cisplatin were recipients of monocyte mitochondria indicated by increased intracellular mitotracker fluorescent labelling. Mitochondrial transfer to sensory neurons was neuroprotective by preventing neurite loss and neuronal apoptosis. Vehicle treated DRG sensory neurons did not demonstrate significant mitochondrial uptake. Furthermore, cisplatin induced mitochondrial transfer was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of gap junction protein, connexin 43. Connexin 43 inhibition led to reduced neuroprotective capacity via mitochondrial transfer. These findings demonstrate that monocytic mitochondria transfer to DRG sensory neurons damaged by cisplatin is dependent upon gap junction intercellular communication to promote sensory neuronal survival. This novel process in sensory neuronal protection is a potential novel therapeutic intervention for alleviating neuropathic pain in individuals treated for cancer.

">Microglia respond to elevated intraocular pressure and synapse loss in the visual thalamus in a mouse model of glaucoma.</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system and mediate a broad array of adaptations and responses during disease, injury, and development. Typically, microglia morphology is understood to provide a window into their functional state. However, it is apparent that they have the capacity to adopt a broad spectrum of functional phenotypes characterized by numerous morphological profiles and associated gene expression profiles. Glaucoma, which leads to blindness from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration, is commonly associated with elevated intraocular pressure and has been shown to trigger microglia responses within the retinal layers, at the optic nerve head, and in retinal projection targets in the brain. The goal of this study was to determine the relationship of microglia morphology to intraocular pressure and the loss of retinal ganglion cell output synapses in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), a RGC projection target in the thalamus that conveys information to the primary visual cortex. We accomplished this by analyzing dLGN microglia morphologies in histological sections from DBA/2J mice, which develop a form of inherited glaucoma. Microglia morphology was analyzed using skeletonized Iba1-fluorescence images and fractal analyses of individually reconstructed microglia cells. We found that microglia adopted more simplified morphologies, characterized by fewer endpoints and less total process length per microglia cell. There was an age-dependent shift in microglia morphology in tissue from control mice (DBA/2JGpnmb+) that was accelerated in DBA/2J mice. Microglia morphological measurements correlated with cumulative intraocular pressure, immunofluorescence labeling for the complement protein C1q, and density of vGlut2-labeled RGC axon terminals. Additionally, fractal analysis revealed a clear distinction between control and glaucoma dLGN, with microglia from ocular hypertensive DBA/2J dLGN tissue showing an elongated rod-like morphology. RNA-sequencing of dLGN tissue samples showed an upregulation of immune system-related gene expression and several specific genes associated with microglia activation and potential neuroprotective functions. These results suggest that microglia in the dLGN alter their physiology to respond to RGC degeneration in glaucoma, potentially contributing to CNS adaptations to neurodegenerative vision loss.

">Sex Differences in Contextual Extinction Learning After Single Binge-Like EtOH Exposure in Adolescent C57BL/6J Mice</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between chronic heavy drinking and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is well-documented; however, the impact of more common drinking patterns, such as a single episode leading to a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.09 g/dL (moderate intoxication), remains underexplored. Given the frequent co-occurrence of PTSD and alcohol misuse, it is essential to understand the biological and behavioral factors driving this comorbidity. We hypothesize that alcohol's immediate sedative effects are coupled with the development of persistent molecular alcohol tolerance, which may disrupt fear extinction learning. To investigate this, we employed a Single Episode Ethanol (SEE) in-vivo exposure to mimic binge-like alcohol consumption over a 6-hour period, following contextual conditioning trials. Extinction trials were conducted 24 hours later to assess the effects on extinction learning. Our findings reveal a significant deficit in fear extinction learning in alcohol-treated adolescent male mice compared to saline-treated controls, with no such effects observed in female adolescent mice. These results suggest that even non-chronic alcohol exposure may contribute to the development of trauma- and stress-related disorders, such as PTSD, in males. Additionally, histological analysis revealed significant alterations in FKBP5, beta-catenin, and GSK-3beta levels in the hippocampus, striatum, and basolateral amygdala of alcohol-treated mice following extinction. The insights gained from this study could reshape our understanding of the risk factors for PTSD and open new avenues for prevention and treatment, targeting the molecular mechanisms that mediate alcohol tolerance.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Microsurgical clipping has traditionally been considered a standard treatment for middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms. Recently, a caseload reduction related to improved endovascular treatment options has occurred in cerebrovascular neurosurgery. Therefore, studies that report the clinical and radiological outcomes after clipping are highly warranted. Methods: Patients with an unruptured MCA bifurcation aneurysm, who were surgically treated at the Department of Neurosurgery in Linz between 2002 and 2019, were included in this study. Clinical and radiological outcome parameters were evaluated for each patient. Results: Overall, 272 patients were eligible for inclusion. Complete aneurysm occlusion was demonstrated in 266 (99.3%) of the 268 (98.5%) patients who underwent postoperative digital subtraction angiography. In six (2.2%) patients, a permanent new neurological deficit (pNND) persisted after treatment. Intraoperative aneurysm rupture was a significant factor (p = 0.0049) in the logistic regression. At the last follow-up, only two patients (0.7%) had an unfavorable outcome (mRS &amp;amp;gt; 2). More recent surgeries were associated with fewer cases of pNND (p = 0.009). A transient new neurological deficit occurred in 13 patients (4.8%), with aneurysm size being a significant risk factor (p = 0.009). Surgical site infections were reported in four patients (1.5%), with patient age (p = 0.039) and time (p = 0.001) being significant factors. Two patients died (0.7%) perioperatively and two patients (0.7%) needed a retreatment in the long-term follow-up. Conclusions: The findings indicate that microsurgical clipping is a safe procedure with minimal need for retreatment. It achieves a high occlusion rate while maintaining a very low rate of adverse outcomes. Continuous intraoperative enhancements over time have contributed to a progressive improvement in clinical outcomes in recent years. This trend is exemplified by the absence of detectable pNND in the era of ICG angiography. Consequently, these data support the conclusion that microsurgical clipping should still be considered an appropriate treatment option for unruptured MCA bifurcation aneurysms.</p>

	<p>In schizophrenia, it was suggested that an integrated and multimodal approach, combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, could improve functional outcomes and clinical features in patients living with schizophrenia (PLWS). Among these alternatives, evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) and Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) represent feasible treatment options targeting the clinical features that are unmet needs of PLWS (especially negative and cognitive symptoms). As no clear evidence is available on the combination of these non-pharmacological approaches, this review aimed to collect the available literature on the combination of EBPIs and NIBS in the treatment of PLWS. We demonstrated that the field of combining EBPIs and NIBS in schizophrenia is in its infancy, as only 11 studies were reviewed. In fact, only a few trials, with divergent results, combined these non-pharmacological modalities; while emerging evidence is available on the combination of cognitive remediation and rTMS/iTBS, inconclusive results were obtained. Conversely, albeit preliminary, more solid findings are available on the combination of HF-rTMS and family intervention. Moreover, despite the fact that cognitive activation could not be considered an EBPI, promising results are available in combination with tDCS to improve the working memory domain. To overcome these limitations, we considered several methodological issues to promote research in this field.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) face challenges in social communication due to difficulties in considering context, processing information, and interpreting social cues. This study aims to explore the neural processes related to pragmatic language communication in children with ASD and address the research question of how functional brain connectivity operates during complex pragmatic language tasks. Methods: We examined differences in brain functional connectivity between children with ASD and typically developing peers while they engaged in video recordings of spoken language tasks. We focused on two types of speech acts: semantic and pragmatic. Results: Our results showed differences between groups during the pragmatic and semantic language processing, indicating more idiosyncratic connectivity in children with ASD in the Left Somatomotor and Left Limbic networks, suggesting that these networks play a role in task-dependent functional connectivity. Additionally, these functional differences were mainly localized to the left hemisphere.</p>

	<p>Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently a promising technique for psychiatric patients with severe and treatment-resistant symptoms. However, the results to date have been quite heterogeneous, and the indications for psychosurgery with DBS remain in an experimental phase. One of the major challenges limiting the advancement of DBS in psychiatric disorders is the lack of objective criteria for diagnosing certain conditions, which are often based more on clinical scales rather than measurable biological markers. Additionally, there is a limited capacity to objectively assess treatment outcomes. Methods: This overview examines the literature on the available biomarkers in psychosurgery in relation to DBS, as well as other relevant biomarkers in psychiatry with potential applicability for this treatment modality. Results: There are five types of biomarkers: clinical/behavioral, omic, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and neurobiochemical. The information provided by each biomarker within these categories is highly variable and may be relevant for diagnosis, response prediction, target selection, program adjustment, etc. Conclusions: A better understanding of biomarkers and their applications would allow DBS in psychosurgery to advance on a more objective basis, guided by the information provided by them and within the context of precision psychiatry.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a leading neurodegenerative disorder currently affecting approximately 55 million individuals globally, a number projected to escalate to 139 million by 2050. Despite extensive research spanning several decades, the cure for AD remains at a developing stage. The only existing therapeutic options are limited to symptom management, and are often accompanied by adverse side effects. The pathological features of AD, including the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, result in progressive neuronal death, synaptic loss, and brain atrophy, leading to significant cognitive decline and a marked reduction in quality of life. Objective: In light of the shortcomings of existing pharmacological interventions, this review explores the potential of photobiomodulation (PBM) as a non-invasive therapeutic option for AD. PBM employs infrared light to facilitate cellular repair and regeneration, focusing on addressing the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s underlying biomechanical mechanisms. Method: This paper presents a comprehensive introduction to the mechanisms of PBM and an analysis of preclinical studies evaluating its impact on cellular health, cognitive function, and disease progression in AD.The review provides a comprehensive overview of the various wavelengths and application methods, evaluating their efficacy in mitigating AD-related symptoms. Conclusions: The findings underscore the significant potential of PBM as a safe and effective alternative treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, emphasizing the necessity for further research and clinical trials to establish its therapeutic efficacy conclusively.</p>

                <p>Pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death, has recently been found to play an important role in spinal cord injury (SCI). C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1), and NLR-family CARD-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) have been reported to be associated with neuronal pyroptosis, but few studies have clarified their functions and regulatory mechanisms in SCI. In this study, CLEC5A, TREM1, and NLRC4 were highly expressed in lidocaine-induced SCI rat models, and their knockdown alleviated lidocaine-induced SCI. The elevation of pyroptosis-related indicators LDH, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-18, caspase-1, and IL-1&beta; levels in SCI rats was attenuated after silencing of CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4. Lidocaine-induced decrease in cell viability and the elevation in cell death were partly reversed after CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4 silencing. Lidocaine-mediated effects on the levels of LDH, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-18, caspase-1, and IL-1&beta; in lidocaine-induced PC12 cells were weakened by downregulating CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4. CLEC5A could interact with TREM1 to mediate NLRC4 expression, thus accelerating neuronal pyroptosis, ultimately leading to SCI exacerbation. In conclusions, CLEC5A interacted with TREM1 to increase NLRC4 expression, thus promoting neuronal pyroptosis in rat SCI models, providing new insights into the role of neuronal pyroptosis in SCI.</p>

                <p>Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG) from <I>Polygonum multiflorum</I> exerts neuroprotective effects after ischemic stroke. We explored whether TSG improved ischemic stroke injury via PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro model and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model were established. Cerebral injury was assessed by neurological score, hematoxylin and eosin staining, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, and brain water content. Apoptosis, cell viability, and mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed by flow cytometry, cell counting kit-8, and JC-1 staining, respectively. Colocalization of LC3-labeled autophagosomes with lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2-labeled lysosomes or translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20-labeled mitochondria was observed with fluorescence microscopy. The ubiquitination level was determined using ubiquitination assay. The interaction between molecules was validated by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione <I>S</I>-transferase pull-down. We found that TSG promoted mitophagy and improved cerebral ischemia/reperfusion damage in MCAO rats. In OGD/R-subjected neurons, TSG promoted mitophagy, repressed neuronal apoptosis, upregulated Y-box binding protein-1 (YBX1), and activated PINK1/Parkin signaling. TSG upregulated ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) to elevate YBX1 protein. Furthermore, USP10 inhibited ubiquitination-dependent YBX1 degradation. <I>USP10</I> overexpression activated PINK1/Parkin signaling and promoted mitophagy, which were reversed by <I>YBX1</I> knockdown. Moreover, TSG upregulated USP10 to promote mitophagy and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. Collectively, TSG facilitated PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy by upregulating USP10/YBX1 axis to ameliorate ischemic stroke.</p>

                <p>It remains unknown whether the Chinese tree shrew, regarded as the closest sister of primate, has evolved a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) comparable with primates that is characterized by a fourth layer (L4) enriched with granular cells and reciprocal connections with the mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Here, we reported that following AAV-hSyn-EGFP expression in the MD neurons, the fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography revealed their projection trajectories and targeted brain areas, such as the hippocampus, the corpus striatum, and the dlPFC. Cre-dependent transsynaptic viral tracing identified the MD projection terminals that targeted the L4 of the dlPFC, in which the presence of granular cells was confirmed via cytoarchitectural studies by using the Nissl, Golgi, and vGlut2 stainings. Additionally, the L5/6 of the dlPFC projected back to the MD. These results suggest that the tree shrew has evolved a primate-like dlPFC which can serve as an alternative for studying cognition-related functions of the dlPFC.</p>

Data in behavioral research is often quantified with event-logging software, generating large data sets containing detailed information about subjects, recipients, and the duration of behaviors. Exploring and analyzing such large data sets can be challenging without tools to visualize behavioral interactions between individuals or transitions between behavioral states, yet software that can adequately visualize complex behavioral data sets is rare. TIBA (The Interactive Behavior Analyzer) is a web application for behavioral data visualization, which provides a series of interactive visualizations, including the temporal occurrences of behavioral events, the number and direction of interactions between individuals, the behavioral transitions and their respective transitional frequencies, as well as the visual and algorithmic comparison of the latter across data sets. It can therefore be applied to visualize behavior across individuals, species, or contexts. Several filtering options (selection of behaviors and individuals) together with options to set node and edge properties (in the network drawings) allow for interactive customization of the output drawings, which can also be downloaded afterwards. TIBA accepts data outputs from popular logging software and is implemented in Python and JavaScript, with all current browsers supported. The web application and usage instructions are available at tiba.inf.uni-konstanz.de. The source code is publicly available on GitHub: github.com/LSI-UniKonstanz/tiba.

                <p>by Uma R. Mohan, Joshua Jacobs</p>

Invasive brain stimulation is used to treat individuals with episodic memory loss; however, studies to date report both enhancement and impairment of memory. This Essay discusses the sources of this variability, and suggests a path towards developing customized stimulation protocols for more consistent memory enhancement.
Author summary: Episodic memory is a critical aspect of everyday life that allows us to recall events, make decisions, and navigate our environments. It is estimated that 1 in 25 Americans suffer from episodic memory loss from Alzheimer ‘s disease, dementia, or following a traumatic brain injury. Clinicians and researchers have recently tried to help supplement or repair memory in individuals with episodic memory disorders using electrical brain stimulation. However, although there is evidence of invasive brain stimulation improving memory, studies also show that it can have variable effects, and sometimes cause memory impairment. In this Essay, we investigate these differences and try to explain this variability. We propose that key aspects of the memory network are heterogeneous across individuals, requiring customized stimulation protocols to create successful brain stimulation systems for memory enhancement. We provide a plan for applying brain stimulation while overcoming this variability by using closed-loop stimulation protocols that are customized according to a person’s own anatomical structure, functional connectivity, and memory-related electrophysiological patterns.

                Abstract Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors, often associated with catecholamine secretion. These tumors can arise in various locations, with the majority found in the abdomen and pelvis, while a smaller percentage occurs in the thorax and head and neck regions. Diaphragmatic paragangliomas are exceedingly rare, with only two documented cases in the literature. This report details a case of a primary diaphragmatic paraganglioma in a 59-year-old patient presenting with unexplained weight loss, tremors, and diaphoresis. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the right lobe of the liver, later identified as a diaphragmatic paraganglioma during surgery. The case underscores the importance of preoperative catecholamine assessment and careful surgical planning due to the risks associated with tumor manipulation. Complete surgical resection, although challenging, remains the definitive treatment, especially in hypervascular tumors located near major vascular structures.

                Abstract Background Telemedicine has improved adherence to heart failure (HF) treatment, however it has not yet been tailored specifically to address HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Our objective is to undertake a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research studies that focus on telemedicine in HFrEF. Methods We conducted an extensive literature review encompassing trials which included outpatients with HFrEF who underwent telemedicine compared with usual care. We exclude any studies without ejection fraction data. Three bibliographic databases from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were utilized in our search from January 1999 to May 2023. The endpoints of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF-related hospitalization. The Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) and the risk of bias in non-randomized studies – of interventions (ROBINS-I) were used for non-randomized or observational studies. To quantitatively analyze the collective findings, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was computed for each outcome. Results Out of the initial pool of 4,947 articles, we narrowed down our analysis to 27 studies, Results showed that telemedicine significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 – 0.78; p<0.00001), cardiovascular-related mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 – 0.80, p < 0.00001), and HF-related hospitalization based on number of events (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 – 0.94, p = 0.009) as well as number of patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 – 0.87, p < 0.0001). Conclusion Telemedicine was shown significantly beneficial in decreasing mortality and hospitalization in HFrEF patients. Future research should focus on standardizing effective telemedicine practices due to the existing variability in methods and clinical situation of the patients.

                Liu et al. show that C. elegans specifically recognizes divergent oomycete pathogens through paired transmembrane C-type lectin receptors. These act mainly in AWA neurons and the intestine to induce in the epidermis a protective immune response characterized by the induction of chitinase-like (chil) genes.

                In this paper, Lu et al. characterize a population of neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis that is activated by general anesthetics and diazepam. These neurons suppress behavioral and autonomic characteristics of anxiety and could be a key mediator of the anxiolytic properties of anesthetics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95811">GDF2 and BMP10 coordinate liver cellular crosstalk to maintain liver health</a></h4>

              
                The liver is the largest solid organ in the body and is primarily composed of hepatocytes (HCs), endothelial cells (ECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which spatially interact and cooperate with each other to maintain liver homeostasis. However, the complexity and molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these different cell types remain to be revealed. Here, we generated mice with conditional deletion of <i>Gdf2</i> (also known as <i>Bmp9</i>) and <i>Bmp10</i> in different liver cell types and demonstrated that HSCs were the major source of GDF2 and BMP10 in the liver. Using transgenic ALK1 (receptor for GDF2 and BMP10) reporter mice, we found that ALK1 is expressed on KCs and ECs other than HCs and HSCs, and GDF2 and BMP10 secreted by HSCs promote the differentiation of KCs and ECs and maintain their identity. <i>Pdgfb</i> expression was significantly upregulated in KCs and ECs after <i>Gdf2</i> and <i>Bmp10</i> deletion, ultimately leading to HSCs activation and liver fibrosis. ECs express several angiocrine factors, such as BMP2, BMP6, Wnt2, and Rspo3, to regulate HC iron metabolism and metabolic zonation. We found that these angiocrine factors were significantly decreased in ECs from <i>Gdf2/Bmp10</i><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice, which further resulted in liver iron overload and disruption of HC zonation. In summary, we demonstrated that HSCs play a central role in mediating liver cell-cell crosstalk via the production of GDF2 and BMP10, highlighting the important role of intercellular interaction in organ development and homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100083">One N-glycan regulates natural killer cell antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and modulates Fc γ receptor IIIa/CD16a structure</a></h4>

              
                Both endogenous antibodies and a subset of antibody therapeutics engage Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)IIIa/CD16a to stimulate a protective immune response. Increasing the FcγRIIIa/IgG1 interaction improves the immune response and thus represents a strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy. FcγRIIIa is a heavily glycosylated receptor and glycan composition affects antibody-binding affinity. Though our laboratory previously demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cell N-glycan composition affected the potency of one key protective mechanism, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), it was unclear if this effect was due to FcγRIIIa glycosylation. Furthermore, the structural mechanism linking glycan composition to affinity and cellular activation remained undescribed. To define the role of individual amino acid and N-glycan residues, we measured affinity using multiple FcγRIIIa glycoforms. We observed stepwise affinity increases with each glycan truncation step, with the most severely truncated glycoform displaying the highest affinity. Removing the N162 glycan demonstrated its predominant role in regulating antibody-binding affinity, in contrast to four other FcγRIIIa N-glycans. We next evaluated the impact of the N162 glycan on NK cell ADCC. NK cells expressing the FcγRIIIa V158 allotype exhibited increased ADCC following kifunensine treatment to limit N-glycan processing. Notably, an increase was not observed with cells expressing the FcγRIIIa V158 S164A variant that lacks N162 glycosylation, indicating that the N162 glycan is required for increased NK cell ADCC. To gain structural insight into the mechanisms of N162 regulation, we applied a novel protein isotope labeling approach in combination with solution NMR spectroscopy. FG loop residues proximal to the N162 glycosylation site showed large chemical shift perturbations following glycan truncation. These data support a model for the regulation of FcγRIIIa affinity and NK cell ADCC whereby composition of the N162 glycan stabilizes the FG loop and thus the antibody-binding site.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84053">Emergence of planar cell polarity from the interplay of local interactions and global gradients</a></h4>

              
                Planar cell polarity (PCP) – tissue-scale alignment of the direction of asymmetric localization of proteins at the cell-cell interface – is essential for embryonic development and physiological functions. Abnormalities in PCP can result in developmental imperfections, including neural tube closure defects and misaligned hair follicles. Decoding the mechanisms responsible for PCP establishment and maintenance remains a fundamental open question. While the roles of various molecules – broadly classified into “global” and “local” modules – have been well-studied, their necessity and sufficiency in explaining PCP and connecting their perturbations to experimentally observed patterns have not been examined. Here, we develop a minimal model that captures the proposed features of PCP establishment – a global tissue-level gradient and local asymmetric distribution of protein complexes. The proposed model suggests that while polarity can emerge without a gradient, the gradient not only acts as a global cue but also increases the robustness of PCP against stochastic perturbations. We also recapitulated and quantified the experimentally observed features of swirling patterns and domineering non-autonomy, using only three free model parameters - the rate of protein binding to membrane, the concentration of PCP proteins, and the gradient steepness. We explain how self-stabilizing asymmetric protein localizations in the presence of tissue-level gradient can lead to robust PCP patterns and reveal minimal design principles for a polarized system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104071">Navigating neurodiversity in higher education in India</a></h4>

              
                The concept of neurodiversity embraces the idea that there are many different ways of perceiving, thinking about and responding to the world around us. Yet, many countries – including India, with its vast population – still struggle with this concept. Societal perceptions and stereotypes surrounding neurodiversity, often fuelled by ignorance and misinformation, contribute to the marginalisation and exclusion experienced by neurodivergent individuals. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities that neurodivergent students in Indian higher education face, highlighting the urgent need for systemic change to co-create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment.

	<p>Background: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to synchronize their actions with external auditory stimuli through a process called auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor or rhythmic entrainment. Positive effects of rhythmic entrainment have been demonstrated in adults with neurological movement disorders, yet the neural substrates supporting the transformation of auditory input into timed rhythmic motor outputs are not fully understood. We aimed to systematically map and synthesize the research on the neural correlates of auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor entrainment and synchronization. Methods: Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews, a systematic search was conducted across four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and Scopus) for articles published between 2013 and 2023. Results: From an initial return of 1430 records, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria and were synthesized based on the neuroimaging modality. There is converging evidence that auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor synchronization engages bilateral cortical and subcortical networks, including the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Specifically, the supplementary motor area and the basal ganglia are essential for beat-based timing and internally guided rhythmic movements, while the cerebellum plays an important role in tracking and processing complex rhythmic patterns and synchronizing to the external beat. Self-paced tapping is associated with additional activations in the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia, suggesting that tapping in the absence of auditory cues requires more neural resources. Lastly, existing studies indicate that movement rate and the type of music further modulate the EEG power in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Conclusions: These findings are discussed in the context of clinical implications and rhythm-based therapies.</p>

	<p>Background: The neurosurgical treatment of thoracic disc herniation (TDH) has undergone dramatic changes over the years in terms of surgical approaches and intraoperative technological tools. There is still no unanimous consent on the criteria for approach selection, and the choice varies among Institutions. The aim of this study is to compare anterior and posterolateral approaches for TDH in terms of functional and surgical outcomes. Methods: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines from EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar online databases up to May 2024 incorporated studies that reported outcomes of thoracic disc herniation surgeries. Analyzed factors included major peri- and postoperative complications, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, neurological improvement, and complete hernia resection. Random-effect models were used to calculate pooled odds ratios and mean differences. Results: The posterolateral approach was associated with significantly lower rates of major medical (OR 0.14, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.27) and surgical complications (OR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.99) compared to the anterior approach. Additionally, posterolateral approaches reduced intraoperative blood loss and shorter hospital stays. Posterolateral techniques were linked to higher odds of neurological improvement (OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.99) and higher rates of complete hernia resection (OR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.71). Conclusions: Posterolateral approaches offer advantages in terms of safety, recovery, neurological improvement, and complete hernia resection. More extensive prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and refine surgical strategies. Emerging technologies, such as the exoscope and 45&amp;amp;deg; endoscopy, may further enhance surgical outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background. Pain is known to negatively impact attention, but its influence on more complex cognitive abilities, such as logical reasoning, remains inconsistent. This may be due to compensatory mechanisms (e.g., investing additional resources), which might not be detectable at the behavioral level but can be observed through psychophysiological measures. In this study, we investigated whether experimentally induced pain affects logical reasoning and underlying attentional mechanisms, using both behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. Methods. A total of 98 female participants were divided into a pain-free control group (N = 47) and a pain group (N = 51). Both groups completed the Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) task, with EEG recordings capturing task-related power (TRP) changes in the upper alpha frequency band (10&amp;amp;ndash;12 Hz). We used a mixed design where all participants completed half of the APM task in a pain-free state (control condition); the second half was completed under pain induction by the pain group but not the pain-free group (experimental condition). Results. Logical reasoning performance, as measured by APM scores and response times, declined during the experimental condition, compared to the control condition for both groups, indicating that the second part of the APM was more difficult than the first part. However, no significant differences were found between the pain and pain-free groups, suggesting that pain did not impair cognitive performance at the behavioral level. In contrast, EEG measures revealed significant differences in upper alpha band power, particularly at fronto-central sites. In the pain group, the decrease in TRP during the experimental condition was significantly smaller compared to both the control condition and the pain-free group. Conclusions. Pain did not impair task performance at the behavioral level but reduced attentional resources, as reflected by changes in upper alpha band activity. This underscores the importance of incorporating more sensitive psychophysiological measures alongside behavioral measures to better understand the impact of pain on cognitive processes.</p>

	<p>Background: Focal mechanical vibration therapy has gained attention as a potential intervention to improve motor function while decreasing spasticity and pain in post-stroke patients. Despite promising results, there remains variability in study designs and outcomes, warranting a review of its clinical efficacy. Methods: A review was conducted to evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of focal mechanical vibration therapy on post-stroke rehabilitation. Six studies were included, assessing outcomes such as spasticity reduction (using the Modified Ashworth Scale), motor function recovery (Wolf Motor Function Test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment), and pain management (Visual Analog Scale, Numerical Rating Scale). The quality of studies was evaluated using the PEDro scale and RoB-2 tool. An overview review was conducted to provide a comprehensive analysis of the topic. Results: The included studies demonstrated significant reductions in spasticity and improvements in motor function in most patients receiving focal vibration therapy. Notable improvements were observed when focal vibration was combined with other rehabilitation techniques, such as progressive modular rebalancing or robotic rehabilitation. Pain levels were also reduced in several studies. However, differences in vibration parameters (frequency, amplitude), small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods limit the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: Focal mechanical vibration therapy appears to be an effective adjunct in post-stroke rehabilitation, particularly for reducing spasticity and improving motor function. Although short-term benefits are promising, further research is required to determine long-term efficacy and optimal treatment parameters. This review evaluates the effectiveness of focal vibration therapy in treating motor deficits and spasticity in post-stroke patients. The results suggest its potential to improve these conditions, though further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Around 20% of cancer patients will develop brain metastases (BrMs), with 15&amp;amp;ndash;25% occurring in the posterior fossa (PF). Although the effectiveness of systemic therapies is increasing, surgery followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (S+SRS) versus definitive SRS remains the mainstay of treatment. Given the space restrictions within the PF, patients with BrMs in this location are at higher risk of brainstem compression, hydrocephalus, herniation, coma, and death. However, the criteria for treating large PF BrMs with S+SRS versus definitive SRS remains unclear. Methods: We reviewed a prospective registry database (2009 to 2020) and identified 64 patients with large PF BrMs (&amp;amp;ge;4 cc) treated with SRS or S+SRS. Clinical and radiological parameters were analyzed. The two endpoints were overall survival (OS) and local failure (LF). Results: Patients in the S+SRS group were more highly symptomatic than patients in the SRS group. Gait imbalance and intracranial pressure symptoms were 97% and 80%, and 47% and 35% for S+SRS and SRS, respectively. Radiologically, there were significant differences in the mean volume of the lesions [6.7 cm3 in SRS vs. 29.8 cm3 in the S+SRS cohort, (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001)]; compression of the fourth ventricle [47% in SRS vs. 96% in S+SRS cohort, (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001)]; and hydrocephalus [0% in SRS vs. 29% in S+SRS cohort, (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001)]. Patients treated with S+SRS had a higher Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA). LF was 12 and 17 months for SRS and S+SRS, respectively. Moreover, the S+SRS group had improved OS (12 vs. 26 months, p = 0.001). Conclusions: A higher proportion of patients treated with S+SRS presented with hydrocephalus, fourth-ventricle compression, and larger lesion volumes. SRS-alone patients had a lower KPS, a lower GPA, and more brain metastases. S+SRS correlated with improved OS, suggesting that it should be seriously considered for patients with large PF-BrM.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an extremely aggressive brain tumor that has few available treatment options and a dismal prognosis. Recent research has highlighted the potential of extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) produced from mesenchymal stem cells as a potential treatment approach for GBM. MSC-EVs, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, perform a significant function in cellular communication and have shown promise in mediating anti-tumor effects. Purpose: This systematic literature review aims to consolidate current findings on the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs in GBM treatment. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across major medical databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) up to September 2024 to identify studies investigating the use of MSC-derived EVs in GBM therapy. Keywords included &amp;amp;ldquo;extracellular vesicles&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;mesenchymal stem cells&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;targeted therapies&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;outcomes&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;adverse events&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;glioblastoma&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;exosomes&amp;amp;rdquo;. Inclusion criteria were studies published in English involving GBM models both in vivo and in vitro and those reporting on therapeutic outcomes of MSC-EVs. Data were extracted and analyzed based on EV characteristics, mechanisms of action, and therapeutic efficacy. Results: The review identified several key studies demonstrating the anti-tumor effects of MSC-EVs in GBM models. A total of three studies were included, focusing on studies conducted between 2021 and 2023. The review included three studies that collectively enrolled a total of 18 patients. These studies were distributed across two years, with two trials published in 2023 (66.7%) and one in 2021 (33.3%). The mean age of the participants ranged from 37 to 57 years. In terms of gender distribution, males were the predominant group in all studies. Prior to receiving MSC-EV therapy, all patients had undergone standard treatments for GBM, including surgery, chemotherapy (CT), and, in some cases, radiation therapy (RT). In all three studies, the targeted treatment involved the administration of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene therapy delivered to the tumor site, then 14 days of ganciclovir treatment. Outcomes across the studies indicated varying levels of efficacy for the MSC-EV-based therapy. The larger 2023 study reported fewer encouraging outcomes, with a median PFS of 11.0 months (95% CI: 8.3&amp;amp;ndash;13.7) and a median OS of 16.0 months (95% CI: 14.3&amp;amp;ndash;17.7). Adverse effects were reported in only one of the studies, the 2021 trial, where patients experienced mild-to-moderate side effects, including fever, headache, and cerebrospinal fluid leukocytosis. A total of 11 studies on preclinical trials, using in vitro and in vivo models, were included, covering publications from 2010 to 2024. The studies utilized MSCs as delivery systems for various therapeutic agents (interleukin 12, interleukin 7, doxorubicin, paclitaxel), reflecting the versatility of these cells in targeted cancer therapies. Conclusions: MSC-derived EVs represent a promising therapeutic approach for GBM, offering multiple mechanisms to inhibit tumor growth and enhance treatment efficacy. Their ability to deliver bioactive molecules and modulate the tumor microenvironment underscores their potential as a novel, cell-free therapeutic strategy. Future studies should optimize EV production and delivery methods and fully understand their long-term effects in clinical settings to harness their therapeutic potential in GBM treatment.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The primary life-threatening complication in spinal&amp;amp;ndash;bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is ventilatory failure. The present study analyzes the longitudinal patterns of respiratory function tests over a follow-up of 11 years. Methods: We collected data from 9 genetically confirmed SBMA patients. Spirometric measurements [maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), and forced vital capacity (FVC)], serum biochemical indices and SBMA functional rating scale (SBMAFRS) were collected every 6 months for 11 years. An average time curve was utilized to assess the changes in both pulmonary tests and serum biochemical indices of the patients. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA was applied to assess statistical differences. The Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rank correlation coefficient was utilized to evaluate the correlations between the respiratory function tests and serum biochemical and clinical indices. Results: A progressive decrease was observed in the respiratory function tests; the slope of the linear regression was significantly non-zero (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) for all three time curves. A major decrease was observed for MEP (52%) and MIP (42%), while this was minor for FVC (25%). SBMAFRS score correlated with FVC (r = 0.27), MIP (r = 0.53) and MEP (r = 0.51). MIP and MEP correlated with creatine phosphokinase (r = 0.3, r = 0.25, respectively) and MIP with creatinine levels (r = 0.31). Conclusions: This longitudinal study shows a progressive decline of spirometric data throughout life in SBMA patients. The decline appears to be related to clinical deterioration and muscle denervation. Spirometric measures relative to maximal strength of the respiratory muscles (MIP and MEP) may have a better predictive value for pulmonary and muscular decline than FVC.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Although the embodiment of action-related language is well-established in the mother tongue (L1), less is known about the embodiment of a second language (L2) acquired later in life through formal instruction. We used the high temporal resolution of ERPs and topographic ERP analyses to compare embodiment in L1 and L2 and to investigate whether L1 and L2 are embodied with different strengths at different stages of linguistic processing. Methods: Subjects were presented with action-related and non-action-related verbs in a silent reading task. Subjects were late French&amp;amp;ndash;German and German&amp;amp;ndash;French bilinguals, respectively, and we could therefore collapse across languages to avoid common confounding between language (French and German) and order of acquisition (L1, L2). Results: We could show distinct effects of embodiment and language. Embodiment affected only the sensory and lexical stages of processing with increased strength and power of the N1 component for motor vs. non-motor verbs, and language affected the lexical and semantic stages of processing with stronger P2/N400 components for L2 than for L1. Non-motor verbs elicited a stronger P1 component in L2. Conclusions: Our results suggest that processing words in L2 requires more effortful processing. Importantly, L1 and L2 are not embodied differently, and embodiment affects early and similar stages of processing in L1 and L2, possibly integrating other process of action&amp;amp;ndash;language interaction</p>

	<p>Background: Revised El Escorial (rEEC) and Awaji criteria are currently used for diagnosing and categorizing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, they are complex; their sensitivity is still not optimal for research purposes, and they present high inter-rater variability in clinical practice. To address these points, in 2019, a new set of diagnostic criteria was proposed, namely the Gold Coast criteria (GCC), characterized by a dichotomous diagnostic categorization, i.e., ALS or not ALS. Methods:&amp;amp;nbsp;In order to investigate the sensitivity, specificity, and clinical usefulness of GCC in a practical clinical setting, we retrospectively evaluated 131 patients diagnosed with ALS and 104 control subjects. ALSFRS-R score, electrophysiological tests, neuroradiological investigations, and CSF analysis were obtained. rEEC, Awaji, and GCC were applied at the first and last evaluations. Results: The sensitivity of GCC (93.1%; 96.1%) was greater than rEEC (71.8%; 87%) and Awaji criteria (77.8%; 89.3%) both at the first visit and last follow-up. The GCC&amp;amp;rsquo;s specificity (28.8%) is lower than that of the other two criteria (rEEC 45.2%; Awaji 43.3%). Conclusions: Our study suggests that in a real-world setting, the GCC are more sensitive and have substantially lower risk of false negative diagnoses than rEEC and Awaji criteria. Although rEEC had the highest specificity, they may delay the diagnosis. Systematically using the GCC could help to achieve an earlier diagnosis and quickly refer patients to the correct management. The low specificity of GCC is likely to not significantly impact patient recruitment in clinical trials; therefore, its use might allow a faster and earlier enrollment.</p>

                Background Underwater gliders are widely used in marine applications for monitoring purposes. These gliders must withstand hydrodynamic forces and maintain its body stability. The underwater environments are highly unpredictable, and small changes in the environment can lead to significant instability in underwater vehicles. Methods This study uses different numerical techniques to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a torpedo-shaped glider. A symmetric torpedo-shaped glider model was created and analyzed using a licensed version of ANSYS 20.1 Fluent tool. The behavior of the torpedo glider under various flow conditions was examined such as variation of grid test, change of turbulent models, the variation in the inflow boundary conditions involves varying the velocity from 10.16 m/s to 15.16 m/s in 1m/s increment and from 10.16 m/s to 7.66 m/s in 0.5 m/s, also six different models were analyzed. Results Research was also attempted with different turbulent models and the Spalart-Allmara model was producing least validation error of 1.28 % with a primary focus on nose optimization. By varying the nose length, the study aimed to identify the best-suited nose geometry to minimize drag force. The nose lengths were varied to 0.205 m and 0.19m, resulting in validation errors of 2.81% and 1.16%, respectively, the results are clearly explained in the sub sequent sections of this article. Conclusion In conclusion, this study has evaluated various modifications and their impact on drag force reduction. The application of Spallart-Allmara model resulted in an improvement of 1.28%. Decrease in velocity lead to a significant reduction in the drag force, with an improvement of 37.3%. The nose optimization also contributed to drag force; a nose length of 0.205m yielded a 3.37% improvement. While a 0.19m nose length resulted in a 1.67% reduction. This study helps researchers in hydrodynamics by optimizing geometry for drag reduction.

                Background Exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) is a cause for heart disease and lung cancer among non- smokers. This cluster randomized control trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a tobacco smoke free home intervention in reducing exposure to second hand smoke. Protocol The intervention will be conducted among 30 clusters in urban and peri-urban areas of Kochi, India. The sample size is 300 per arm and 15 clusters to detect a minimal difference of 0.03ng/ml in cotinine levels between groups, at 80% power with a two-sided alfa of 0.05 considering variable cluster size. A baseline survey will be undertaken to identify smokers. Data related to smoking, indoor smoking, nicotine dependence, blood pressure (BP) of smokers, morbidity experienced, and lung volume Fev1/Fev6 of smokers will be measured. Urine cotinine, morbidity, BP of spouse and child will be assessed. Air quality monitors measuring PM2.5 will be placed in homes. Trained self-help group women and frontline health workers will implement the intervention. The intervention will consist of monthly home visits to educate the smoker on the harms of second-hand smoke using 3 A’s. The circle of influencers around the smoking men will also be contacted by the members of self-help group to provide support to stop smoking within homes and to quit. They will then organize two-three meetings of community leaders and heads of women’s groups, present data on harms of SHS, and explain the rationale for establishing smoke free homes in their community for a duration of six months. After the intervention a post assessment will be conducted and this will be repeated after six months. Ethics and dissemination The trial protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences. Results will be submitted to open access peer reviewed journals and shared with other stakeholders. Trial registration CTRI/2021/06/034478

Methods The Web of Science database was selected for the search conducted in February 2024, and selection and data extraction were performed independently by two researchers. Collaborative networks were generated using VOSviewer software, while altimetric data were analysed using Dimensions. The relationship between the bibliometric and altimetric data was examined using Spearman correlation. Results The search yielded 355 articles, of which 175 were included, published between 2008 and 2024. The most cited article reached 324 citations. Proof of concept was the most common study design (n=135), and the majority of studies used AI to detect and diagnose dental caries (n=122), with radiography being the most commonly used diagnostic method (n=99). The author with the highest number of articles was Schwendicke F (n=15), and the leading institution was Charite University, Berlin (n=13). China was the leading country in terms of research output (n=28) and Asia was the leading continent (n=54). The use of AI in cariology has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce unnecessary interventions and optimise patient outcomes. Research interest in AI for cariology has increased significantly over the past five years, particularly in Asia. Conclusion These findings suggest significant clinical benefits and highlight the need for further research, particularly clinical trials, to validate these applications in practice.

                Background Triple-negative breast cancers are defined as tumors that lack the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It exhibits unique clinical and pathological features, is highly aggressive, and has a relatively poor prognosis and poor clinical outcome. Objective To identify a novel drug target protein against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and potential phytochemical lead molecules against novel drug targets. Methods In this study, we retrieved TNBC samples from NGS and microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database and employed a combination of differential gene expression studies, protein-protein interaction analysis, and network topology investigation to identify the target protein. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, followed by Molecular Mechanics with Generalised Born Surface Area solvation, a potential lead molecule was identified. Result The androgen receptor (AR) was found to be the target protein, and 2-hydroxynaringenin was discovered to be a possible phytochemical lead molecule to combat TNBC. Upregulated genes with LogFC > 1.25 and P-value < 0.05 from the TNBC gene expression dataset were given to STRING tool to investigate the network topology, and androgen receptor (AR) was found to be an appropriate hub gene in the protein-protein interaction network. Phytochemicals that inhibit breast cancer were retrieved from the PubChem database and virtual screening was performed using PyRx against the AR protein. Based on Lipinski’s rule and ADMET properties, molecular interaction studies were analyzed using induced fit docking, wherein significant binding interactions were displayed by 2-hydroxynaringenin. Molecular dynamics studies and MM-GBSA of AR and the 2-hydroxynaringenin complex revealed strong and stable interactions. Conclusion AR was identified as a hub protein that is highly expressed in breast cancer and 2-hydroxynaringenin efficacy of counter TNBC needs to be investigated further in vitro and in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1269/v1?src=rss">Prevalence and risk factors of Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Thammasat University Hospital [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acinetobacter baumannii infection (ABI) is a concerning worldwide public health matter with high levels of morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. This study aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of ABI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. Methods A retrospective review was performed on pediatric patients admitted to the PICU over an 8-year period. Demographic characteristics, infection risk factors, and clinical outcomes were compared and analyzed between patients with ABI, determined to be the case group, and patients without ABI, determined to be the control group. The study also assessed the prevalence of ABI and its antimicrobial resistance profile. Results Between June 2014 and May 2022, a total of 82 cases of ABI were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.02%. After applying the exclusion criteria, 12 cases were excluded. Consequently, 70 ABI cases in total and 140 cases in a control group were included in the study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis identified chronic respiratory disease, mechanical ventilation lasting 3 days or more, and the use of piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks as independent risk factors associated with ABI. The rate of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) was notably high at 93.22%. Cases of ABI were associated with higher mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization compared to non-ABI cases. Conclusion ABI remains a critical pathogen in the PICU. The presence of chronic respiratory disease, use of mechanical ventilation for at least three days, and a history of receiving piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks are significant risk factors for ABI. The high level of antibiotic resistance, especially to carbapenems, highlights the emphasis for more stringent infection control practices and the creation of novel antimicrobial therapies.

                <p>by Ashima Keshava, Farbod Nosrat Nezami, Henri Neumann, Krzysztof Izdebski, Thomas Schüler, Peter König</p>

Natural eye movements have primarily been studied for over-learned activities such as tea-making, sandwich-making, and hand-washing, which have a fixed sequence of associated actions. These studies demonstrate a sequential activation of low-level cognitive schemas facilitating task completion. However, whether these action schemas are activated in the same pattern when a task is novel and a sequence of actions must be planned in the moment is unclear. Here, we recorded gaze and body movements in a naturalistic task to study action-oriented gaze behavior. In a virtual environment, subjects moved objects on a life-size shelf to achieve a given order. To compel cognitive planning, we added complexity to the sorting tasks. Fixations aligned with the action onset showed gaze as tightly coupled with the action sequence, and task complexity moderately affected the proportion of fixations on the task-relevant regions. Our analysis revealed that gaze fixations were allocated to action-relevant targets just in time. Planning behavior predominantly corresponded to a greater visual search for task-relevant objects before the action onset. The results support the idea that natural behavior relies on the frugal use of working memory, and humans refrain from encoding objects in the environment to plan long-term actions. Instead, they prefer just-in-time planning by searching for action-relevant items at the moment, directing their body and hand to it, monitoring the action until it is terminated, and moving on to the following action.

                <p>by Pablo Capilla-Lasheras, Nina Bircher, Antony M. Brown, Xavier Harrison, Thomas Reed, Jennifer E. York, Dominic L. Cram, Christian Rutz, Lindsay Walker, Marc Naguib, Andrew J. Young</p>

Explaining the evolution of sex differences in cooperation remains a major challenge. Comparative studies highlight that offspring of the more philopatric sex tend to be more cooperative within their family groups than those of the more dispersive sex but we do not understand why. The leading “Philopatry hypothesis” proposes that the more philopatric sex cooperates more because their higher likelihood of natal breeding increases the direct fitness benefits of natal cooperation. However, the “Dispersal trade-off hypothesis” proposes that the more dispersive sex cooperates less because preparations for dispersal, such as extra-territorial prospecting, trade-off against natal cooperation. Here, we test both hypotheses in cooperatively breeding white-browed sparrow weavers (<i>Plocepasser mahali</i>), using a novel high-resolution automated radio-tracking method. First, we show that males are the more dispersive sex (a rare reversal of the typical avian sex difference in dispersal) and that, consistent with the predictions of both hypotheses, females contribute substantially more than males to cooperative care while within the natal group. However, the Philopatry hypothesis cannot readily explain this female-biased cooperation, as females are not more likely than males to breed within their natal group. Instead, our radio-tracking findings support the Dispersal trade-off hypothesis: males conduct pre-dispersal extra-territorial prospecting forays at higher rates than females and prospecting appears to trade-off against natal cooperation. Our findings thus highlight that the evolution of sex differences in cooperation could be widely attributable to trade-offs between cooperation and dispersal; a potentially general explanation that does not demand that cooperation yields direct fitness benefits.

Reynolds, Nicolas Torquet, Stefania Tolu, Sarah Mondoloni, Claire Nguyen, Amy Siriphanh, Robin Justo, Steve Didienne, Nicolas Debray, Cécile Viollet, Louis Raynaud, Yasmine Layadi, Coralie Fouquet, Bernadette Hannesse, Ana-Marta Capaz, Thomas Topilko, Nicolas Renier, Alexandre Mourot, Fabio Marti, Philippe Faure</p>

Individual animals differ in their traits and preferences, which shape their social interactions, survival, and susceptibility to disease, including addiction. Nicotine use is highly heterogenous and has been linked to the expression of personality traits. Although these relationships are well documented, we have limited understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that give rise to distinct behavioral profiles and their connection to nicotine susceptibility. To address this question, we conducted a study using a semi-natural and social environment called “Souris-City” to observe the long-term behavior of individual male mice. Souris-City provided both a communal living area and a separate test area where mice engaged in a reward-seeking task isolated from their peers. Mice developed individualistic reward-seeking strategies when choosing between water and sucrose in the test compartment, which, in turn, predicted how they adapted to the introduction of nicotine as a reinforcer. Moreover, the profiles mice developed while isolated in the test area correlated with their behavior within the social environment, linking decision-making strategies to the expression of behavioral traits. Neurophysiological markers of adaptability within the dopamine system were apparent upon nicotine challenge and were associated with specific profiles. Our findings suggest that environmental adaptations influence behavioral traits and sensitivity to nicotine by acting on dopaminergic reactivity in the face of nicotine exposure, potentially contributing to addiction susceptibility. These results further emphasize the importance of understanding interindividual variability in behavior to gain insight into the mechanisms of decision-making and addiction.

                Background Large research consortia can generate tremendous amounts of biological information, including high-resolution soil, vegetation, and climate data. While this knowledge stock holds invaluable potential for answering evolutionary and ecological questions, making these data exploitable for modelling remains a daunting task due to the many processing steps required for synthesis. This might result in many researchers to fall back to a handful of ready-to-use data sets, potentially at the expense of statistical power and scientific rigour. In a push for a more stringent approach, we introduce BEpipeR, an R pipeline that allows for the streamlined synthesis of plot-based Biodiversity Exploratories data. Methods BEpipeR was designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind. For instance, users simply choose between aggregating forest or grassland data, or a combination thereof, effectively allowing them to process any experimental plot data of this research consortium. Additionally, instead of coding, they parse most processing information in a user-friendly way through parameter sheets. Processing includes, among others, the creation of a spatially explicit plot-ID template, data wrangling, quality control, plot-wise aggregations, the calculation of derived metrics, data joining to a large composite data set, and metadata compilation. Results With BEpipeR, we provide a feature-rich pipeline that allows users to process Biodiversity Exploratories data in a flexible and reproducible way. This pipeline might serve as a starting point for aggregating the numerous data sets of this and potentially similar research consortia. In this way, it might be a primer for the construction of consortia-wide composite data sets that take full advantage of the consortia’s rich information stocks, ultimately boosting the visibility and participation of individual research projects. Conclusions The BEpipeR permits the user-friendly processing and plot-wise aggregation of Biodiversity Exploratories data. With modifications, this framework may be easily adopted by other research consortia.

                The rise of large, publicly shared functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets in human neuroscience has focused on acquiring either a few hours of data on many individuals (‘wide’ fMRI) or many hours of data on a few individuals (‘deep’ fMRI). In this opinion article, we highlight an emerging approach within deep fMRI, which we refer to as ‘intensive’ fMRI: one that strives for extensive sampling of cognitive phenomena to support computational modeling and detailed investigation of brain function at the single voxel level. We discuss the fundamental principles, trade-offs, and practical considerations of intensive fMRI. We also emphasize that intensive fMRI does not simply mean collecting more data: it requires careful design of experiments to enable a rich hypothesis space, optimizing data quality, and strategically curating public resources to maximize community impact.

                Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the brain’s gateway for vision, and their degeneration underlies several blinding diseases. RGCs interact with other neuronal cell types, microglia, and astrocytes in the retina and in the brain. Much knowledge has been gained about RGCs and glia from mice and other model organisms, often with the assumption that certain aspects of their biology may be conserved in humans. However, RGCs vary considerably between species, which could affect how they interact with their neuronal and glial partners. This review details which RGC and glial features are conserved between mice, humans, and primates, and which differ. We also discuss experimental approaches for studying human and primate RGCs. These strategies will help to bridge the gap between rodent and human RGC studies and increase study translatability to guide future therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90893">Increasing adult-born neurons protects mice from epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, an area that contains neurons which are vulnerable to insults and injury, such as severe seizures. Previous studies showed that increasing adult neurogenesis reduced neuronal damage after these seizures. Because the damage typically is followed by chronic life-long seizures (epilepsy), we asked if increasing adult-born neurons would prevent epilepsy. Adult-born neurons were selectively increased by deleting the pro-apoptotic gene <i>Bax</i> from Nestin-expressing progenitors. Tamoxifen was administered at 6 weeks of age to conditionally delete <i>Bax</i> in Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><i>Bax</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Six weeks after tamoxifen administration, severe seizures (status epilepticus; SE) were induced by injection of the convulsant pilocarpine. After mice developed epilepsy, seizure frequency was quantified for 3 weeks. Mice with increased adult-born neurons exhibited fewer chronic seizures. Postictal depression was reduced also. These results were primarily in female mice, possibly because they were more affected by <i>Bax</i> deletion than males, consistent with sex differences in <i>Bax</i>. The female mice with enhanced adult-born neurons also showed less neuronal loss of hilar mossy cells and hilar somatostatin-expressing neurons than wild-type females or males, which is notable because loss of these two hilar cell types is implicated in epileptogenesis. The results suggest that selective <i>Bax</i> deletion to increase adult-born neurons can reduce experimental epilepsy, and the effect shows a striking sex difference. The results are surprising in light of past studies showing that suppressing adult-born neurons can also reduce chronic seizures.

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide, profoundly impacts health and quality of life. While cognitive impairments&amp;amp;mdash;such as memory loss, attention deficits, and disorientation&amp;amp;mdash;predominate in AD, motor symptoms, though common, remain underexplored. These motor symptoms, including gait disturbances, reduced cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle weakness, sarcopenia, and impaired balance, are often associated with advanced stages of AD and contribute to increased mortality. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that motor symptoms may be present in earlier stages and can serve as predictive markers for AD in older adults. Despite a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving these motor symptoms, several key pathways have been identified, offering avenues for further investigation. This review provides an in-depth analysis of motor symptoms in AD, discussing its progression, potential mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. Addressing motor symptoms alongside cognitive decline may enhance patient functionality, improve quality of life, and support more comprehensive disease management strategies.</p>

	<p>Background. This study aims to determine if Riluzole usage can change the function and excitability of motor neurons. Methods. The clinical data and indices of motor neuron excitability were assessed using high-density surface EMG parameters from 80 ALS participants. The persistent inward current was assessed using the discharge rate from paired motor units obtained from the tibialis anterior muscle. This enabled the discharge rate at recruitment, peak discharge rates and the hysteresis of the recruitment&amp;amp;ndash;derecruitment frequencies (also known as delta F) to be calculated. Limbs were classified according to their strength. Results. No differences in these motor neuron discharge properties were found according to whether Riluzole was used. Conclusions. The possible interpretations of this finding are discussed.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with several coexisting diseases or comorbidities, including inflammatory and metabolic disorders. In fact, ASD symptoms may be associated with immune system dysfunction. However, studies investigating the peripheral blood levels of immune cells are lacking and have provided mixed findings. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the intensity level of ASD symptoms and the inflammatory and metabolic profiles in 154 children and adolescents (2&amp;amp;ndash;17 years). Methods: Bayesian multilevel models were used to examine the relationship between their symptom intensities and inflammatory/metabolic profiles. Results: Heavier children had higher values for triglyceride and insulin levels. Children with a level 3 of ASD intensity had higher free fatty acids levels. However, when adjusting for ASD intensity, gender, medication use, or weight status, older children appeared to have higher values of triglycerides, insulin levels, and free fatty acids. Conclusions: We concluded that as Brazilian children with ASD became older, they had a higher risk for insulin resistance.</p>

                <p>Injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) can cause severe neurological deficits. Axonal regrowth is a fundamental process for the reconstruction of compensatory neuronal networks after injury; however, it is extremely limited in the adult mammalian CNS. In this study, we conducted a loss-of-function genetic screen in cortical neurons, combined with a Web resource-based phenotypic screen, and identified synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4) as a novel regulator of axon elongation. Silencing Syt4 in primary cultured cortical neurons inhibits neurite elongation, with changes in gene expression involved in signaling pathways related to neuronal development. In a spinal cord injury model, inhibition of Syt4 expression in cortical neurons prevented axonal sprouting of the corticospinal tract, as well as neurological recovery after injury. These results provide a novel therapeutic approach to CNS injury by modulating Syt4 function.</p>

                <p>Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) signaling is critical for neuronal development and function from fate specification to synaptic plasticity. Type III Nrg1 is a synaptic protein which engages in bidirectional signaling with its receptor ErbB4. Forward signaling engages ErbB4 phosphorylation, whereas back signaling engages two known mechanisms: (1) local axonal PI3K-AKT signaling and (2) cleavage by -secretase resulting in cytosolic release of the intracellular domain (ICD), which can traffic to the nucleus (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Bao et al., 2003</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B21">Hancock et al., 2008</cross-ref>). To dissect the contribution of these alternate signaling strategies to neuronal development, we generated a transgenic mouse with a missense mutation (V<SUB>321</SUB>L) in the Nrg1 transmembrane domain that disrupts nuclear back signaling with minimal effects on forward signaling or local back signaling and was previously found to be associated with psychosis (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Walss-Bass et al., 2006</cross-ref>). We combined RNA sequencing, retroviral fate mapping of neural stem cells, behavioral analyses, and various network analyses of transcriptomic data to investigate the effect of disrupting Nrg1 nuclear back signaling in the dentate gyrus (DG) of male and female mice. The V<SUB>321</SUB>L mutation impairs nuclear translocation of the Nrg1 ICD and alters gene expression in the DG. V<SUB>321</SUB>L mice show reduced stem cell proliferation, altered cell cycle dynamics, fate specification defects, and dendritic dysmorphogenesis. Orthologs of known schizophrenia (SCZ)-susceptibility genes were dysregulated in the V<SUB>321</SUB>L DG. These genes coordinated a larger network with other dysregulated genes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis and protein interaction network analyses revealed striking similarity between DG transcriptomes of V<SUB>321</SUB>L mouse and humans with SCZ.</p>

                <p>Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have associated intronic variants in <I>PDE4B</I>, encoding cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B), with increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as schizophrenia and substance use disorders that are often comorbid with it. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of genetic risk involving PDE4B are poorly understood. To examine the effects of PDE4B variation on phenotypes with translational relevance to psychiatric disorders, we focused on PDE4B missense variant M220T, which is present in the human genome as rare coding variant rs775201287. When expressed in HEK-293 cells, PDE4B1-M220T exhibited an attenuated response to a forskolin-elicited increase in the intracellular cAMP concentration. In behavioral tests, homozygous <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> male mice with a C57BL/6JJcl background exhibited increased reactivity to novel environments, startle hyperreactivity, prepulse inhibition deficits, altered cued fear conditioning, and enhanced spatial memory, accompanied by an increase in cAMP signaling pathway-regulated expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. In response to a traumatic event (10 tone&ndash;shock pairings), neuronal activity was decreased in the cortex but enhanced in the amygdala and hippocampus of <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice. At 24&nbsp;h post-trauma, <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice exhibited increased startle hyperreactivity and decreased plasma corticosterone levels, similar to phenotypes exhibited by PTSD patients. Trauma-exposed <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice also exhibited a slower decay in freezing at 15 and 30&nbsp;d post-trauma, demonstrating enhanced persistence of traumatic memories, similar to that exhibited by PTSD patients. These findings provide substantive mouse model evidence linking PDE4B variation to PTSD-relevant phenotypes and thus highlight how genetic variation of PDE4B may contribute to PTSD risk.</p>

                <p>Neural decoding is a tool for understanding how activities from a population of neurons inside the brain relate to the outside world and for engineering applications such as brain&ndash;machine interfaces. However, neural decoding studies mainly focused on different decoding algorithms rather than different neuron types which could use different coding strategies. In this study, we used two-photon calcium imaging to assess three auditory spatial decoders (space map, opponent channel, and population pattern) in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the dorsal inferior colliculus of male and female mice. Our findings revealed a clustering of excitatory neurons that prefer similar interaural level difference (ILD), the primary spatial cues in mice, while inhibitory neurons showed random local ILD organization. We found that inhibitory neurons displayed lower decoding variability under the opponent channel decoder, while excitatory neurons achieved higher decoding accuracy under the space map and population pattern decoders. Further analysis revealed that the inhibitory neurons&rsquo; preference for ILD off the midline and the excitatory neurons&rsquo; heterogeneous ILD tuning account for their decoding differences. Additionally, we discovered a sharper ILD tuning in the inhibitory neurons. Our computational model, linking this to increased presynaptic inhibitory inputs, was corroborated using monaural and binaural stimuli. Overall, this study provides experimental and computational insight into how excitatory and inhibitory neurons uniquely contribute to the coding of sound locations.</p>

                <p>Neural circuits supporting innate behaviors, such as feeding, exploration, and social interaction, intermingle in the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Although previous studies have shown that individual LH neurons change their firing relative to the baseline during one or more behaviors, the firing rate dynamics of LH populations within behavioral episodes and the coordination of behavior-related LH populations remain largely unknown. Here, using unsupervised graph-based clustering of LH neurons firing rate dynamics in freely behaving male mice, we identified distinct populations of cells whose activity corresponds to feeding, specific times during feeding bouts, or other innate behaviors&mdash;social interaction and novel object exploration. Feeding-related cells fired together with a higher probability during slow and fast gamma oscillations (30&ndash;60 and 60&ndash;90&nbsp;Hz) than during nonrhythmic epochs. In contrast, the cofiring of neurons signaling other behaviors than feeding was overall similar between slow gamma and nonrhythmic epochs but increased during fast gamma oscillations. These results reveal a neural organization of ethological hierarchies in the LH and point to behavior-specific motivational systems, the dysfunction of which may contribute to mental disorders.</p>

                <p>Sleep is known to drive the consolidation of motor memories. During nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the close temporal proximity between slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles ("nesting" of SO-spindles) is known to be essential for consolidation, likely because it is closely associated with the reactivation of awake task activity. Interestingly, recent work has found that spindles can occur in temporal clusters or "trains." However, it remains unclear how spindle trains are related to the nesting phenomenon. Here, we hypothesized that spindle trains are more likely when SOs co-occur in the prefrontal and motor cortex. We conducted simultaneous neural recordings in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary motor cortex (M1) of male rats training on the reach-to-grasp motor task. We found that intracortically recorded M1 spindles are organized into distinct temporal clusters. Notably, the occurrence of temporally precise SOs between mPFC and M1 was a strong predictor of spindle trains. Moreover, reactivation of awake task patterns is much more persistent during spindle trains in comparison with that during isolated spindles. Together, our work suggests that the precise coupling of SOs across mPFC and M1 may be a potential driver of spindle trains and persistent reactivation of motor memory during NREM sleep.</p>

                <p>We used virus-mediated anterograde and retrograde tracing, optogenetic modulation, immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and patch-clamp recordings in acute brain slices to study the release mechanism and &mu;-opioid modulation of the dual glutamatergic/GABAergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area and supramammillary nucleus to the granule cells of the dorsal hippocampus of male and female mice. In keeping with previous reports showing that the two transmitters are released by separate active zones within the same terminals, we found that the short-term plasticity and pharmacological modulation of the glutamatergic and GABAergic currents are indistinguishable. We further found that glutamate and GABA release at these synapses are both virtually completely mediated by N- and P/Q-type calcium channels. We then investigated &mu;-opioid modulation of these synapses and found that activation of &mu;-opioid receptors (MORs) strongly inhibits the glutamate and GABA release, mostly through inhibition of presynaptic N-type channels. However, the modulation by MORs of these dual synapses is complex, as it likely includes also a disinhibition due to downmodulation of local GABAergic interneurons which make direct axo-axonic contacts with the dual glutamatergic/GABAergic terminals. We discuss how this opioid modulation may enhance LTP at the perforant path inputs, potentially contributing to reinforce memories of drug-associated contexts.</p>

                <p>The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates neuronal plasticity and animal behavior. ECM staining shows a net-like structure around a subset of neurons, a ring-like structure at the nodes of Ranvier, and diffuse staining in the interstitial matrix. However, understanding the structural features of ECM deposition across various neuronal types and subcellular compartments remains limited. To visualize the organization pattern and assembly process of the hyaluronan-scaffolded ECM in the brain, we fused a HaloTag to hyaluronan proteoglycan link protein 1, which links hyaluronan and proteoglycans. Expression or application of the probe in primary rat neuronal cultures enables us to identify spatial and temporal regulation of ECM deposition and heterogeneity in ECM aggregation among neuronal populations. Dual-color birthdating shows the ECM assembly process in culture and in vivo. Sparse expression in mouse brains of either sex reveals detailed ECM architectures around excitatory neurons and developmentally regulated dendritic ECM. Our study uncovers extensive structural features of the brain's ECM, suggesting diverse roles in regulating neuronal plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/43/e0727242024?rss=1">Atp13a5 Marker Reveals Pericyte Specification in the Mouse Central Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perivascular mural cells including vascular smooth cells (VSMCs) and pericytes are integral components of the vascular system. In the central nervous system (CNS), pericytes are also indispensable for the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB), blood&ndash;spinal cord barrier, and blood&ndash;retinal barrier and play key roles in maintaining cerebrovascular and neuronal functions. However, the functional specifications of pericytes between CNS and peripheral organs have not been resolved at the genetic and molecular levels. Hence, the generation of reliable CNS pericyte-specific models and genetic tools remains very challenging. Here, we report a new CNS pericyte marker in mice. This putative cation-transporting ATPase 13A5 (<I>Atp13a5</I>) marker was identified through single-cell transcriptomics, based on its specificity to brain pericytes. We further generated a knock-in model with both tdTomato reporter and Cre recombinase. Using this model to trace the distribution of <I>Atp13a5-</I>positive pericytes in mice, we found that the tdTomato reporter reliably labels the CNS pericytes, including the ones in spinal cord and retina but not peripheral organs. Interestingly, brain pericytes are likely shaped by the developing neural environment, as <I>Atp13a5-</I>positive pericytes start to appear around murine embryonic day 15 (E15) and expand along the cerebrovasculature. Thus, <I>Atp13a5</I> is a specific marker of CNS pericyte lineage, and this <I>Atp13a5-</I>based model is a reliable tool to explore the heterogeneity of pericytes and BBB functions in health and diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/43/e1096242024?rss=1">Beyond Barrels: Diverse Thalamocortical Projection Motifs in the Mouse Ventral Posterior Complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Thalamocortical pathways from the rodent ventral posterior (VP) thalamic complex to the somatosensory cerebral cortex areas are a key model in modern neuroscience. However, beyond the intensively studied projection from medial VP (VPM) to the primary somatosensory area (S1), the wiring of these pathways remains poorly characterized. We combined micropopulation tract-tracing and single-cell transfection experiments to map the pathways arising from different portions of the VP complex in male mice. We found that pathways originating from different VP regions show differences in area/lamina arborization pattern and axonal varicosity size. Neurons from the rostral VPM subnucleus innervate trigeminal S1 in point-to-point fashion. In contrast, a caudal VPM subnucleus innervates heavily and topographically second somatosensory area (S2), but not S1. Neurons in a third, intermediate VPM subnucleus innervate through branched axons both S1 and S2, with markedly different laminar patterns in each area. A small anterodorsal subnucleus selectively innervates dysgranular S1. The parvicellular VPM subnucleus selectively targets the insular cortex and adjacent portions of S1 and S2. Neurons in the rostral part of the lateral VP nucleus (VPL) innervate spinal S1, while caudal VPL neurons simultaneously target S1 and S2. Rostral and caudal VP nuclei show complementary patterns of calcium-binding protein expression. In addition to the cortex, neurons in caudal VP subnuclei target the sensorimotor striatum. Our finding of a massive projection from VP to S2 separate from the VP projections to S1 adds critical anatomical evidence to the notion that different somatosensory submodalities are processed in parallel in S1 and S2.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/10/ENEURO.0271-23.2024?rss=1">Role of Membrane Estrogen Receptor Alpha on the Positive Feedback of Estrogens on Kisspeptin and GnRH Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Estrogens act through nuclear and membrane-initiated signaling. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) is critical for reproduction, but the relative contribution of its nuclear and membrane signaling to the central regulation of reproduction is unclear. To address this question, two complementary approaches were used: estetrol (E<SUB>4</SUB>) a natural estrogen acting as an agonist of nuclear ERs, but as an antagonist of their membrane fraction, and the C451A-ER&alpha; mouse lacking mER&alpha;. E<SUB>4</SUB> dose- dependently blocks ovulation in female rats, but the central mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. To determine whether E<SUB>4</SUB> acts centrally to control ovulation, its effect was tested on the positive feedback of estradiol (E<SUB>2</SUB>) on neural circuits underlying luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. In ovariectomized females chronically exposed to a low dose of E<SUB>2</SUB>, estradiol benzoate (EB) alone or combined with progesterone (P) induced an increase in the number of kisspeptin (Kp) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons coexpressing Fos, a marker of neuronal activation. E<SUB>4</SUB> blocked these effects of EB, but not when combined to P. These results indicate that E<SUB>4</SUB> blocked the central induction of the positive feedback in the absence of P, suggesting an antagonistic effect of E<SUB>4</SUB> on mER&alpha; in the brain as shown in peripheral tissues. In parallel, as opposed to wild-type females, C451A-ER&alpha; females did not show the activation of Kp and GnRH neurons in response to EB unless they are treated with P. Together these effects support a role for membrane-initiated estrogen signaling in the activation of the circuit mediating the LH surge.</p>

                Introduction Mitochondria are cell organelles that function as the cell’s main power plant, producing ATP, the main energy molecule in cells. Mitochondria play an important role in the context of neuroprotection, and mitochondrial function has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent research in the field of neuroprotection has focused on the development of therapies that target mitochondria. Natural ingredients have long been used in traditional medicine and show potential as neuroprotective agents. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords natural agents, herb*, neuroprotective, and mitochondria. The data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results The research trend found are documents by year, most global cited document, most relevant sources, A factorial map illustrating the leading contributors of papers, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, qualitative analysis, and word cloud. Conclusions Natural Agent Neurotropik is a natural substance that influences the brain’s nervous system and peripheral nervous system, enhancing cognition, mood, and brain function. Derived from herbs, spices, and herbal products, it has advantages over other natural agents in energy production, brain biogenesis, and neuroprotection. Natural agents’ compositional heterogeneity affects reproductive results. Proper characterization and standardized extraction techniques are crucial for establishing plant extracts’ chemical profile. Dosage consistency is essential for standardized results. Long-term safety and potential toxicity should be evaluated. Comparing natural medicines with synthetic pharmaceuticals can enhance therapy efficacy and reduce drug resistance. Further research is needed to assess neuroprotection and mitochondrial function.

                Introduction Diarrhea is a significant health problem in the Third World. Identification of the pathogen that causes diarrhea is vital for measures to prevent and control this disease. There are also very few reports of diarrhea in Sudan. Our study aimed to determine the Prevalence of specific protozoan pathogens (Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum., and Giardia spp) in children in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among children under five years of age hospitalized with acute diarrhea between April and December 2014. Diarrheal stool samples were collected, and E. histolytica, C. parvum, and Giardia spp were examined using multiplex real-time PCR. Results Four hundred and thirty-seven children with acute diarrhea were included in this study; the higher prevalence of diarrhea was in the age ≤ 2 years old (403, 92.2%), >2–≤4 years (32, 7.3%), and >4–<5 years (2, 0.5%). The male-to-female ratio in this study was 1:1.7. Infection with intestinal parasite was found in 155 (35.5%) cases, and co-infection was detected in 16 (3.7%) cases. Giardia spp (18.8%) and C. parvum (15.8%) were the most frequently identified parasites, followed by E. histolytica (0.9). The parasite infection rate was highest and lowest in the under 2-year-old group 143 (35.5%) and the 2–4-year-old group 12 (37.5%). The infection rate was higher in boys 104 (37.7%) than in girls 51 (31.7%). The number of positive cases was higher in the rainy season (August to December) 143 (37.4%), corresponding with that in the dry Season (April to June) 12 (21.8%). Discussion Our present study demonstrated the high prevalence of Giardia spp and C. parvum in children with diarrhea in the Khartoum region and the usefulness of the multiplex real-time method in disclosing pathogenic protozoal agents. Our result highlighted the necessity of developing intervention measurement and control strategies to deal with childhood parasitic diarrhea in this region.

                Objective To analyze the effectiveness of various techniques available for printing, finishing and polishing of 3D printed prosthesis. Methods The articles were selected from electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus. Recently, lot of advancements have been observed in the field of 3D printing in dentistry. Results Numerous studies were found explaining the factors affecting the surface roughness such as printing speed, direction, layer thickness, post curing, etc., and the significance in achieving a smooth surface finish of a 3D printed prosthesis. The methods employed to achieve this range, similar to conventional and chairside polishing, are to use advanced coating materials such as light cured glazes to nanoparticles. Conclusion 3D printing is being used in day-to-day practice and the prosthesis must be aesthetic looking to satisfy the patients’ expectations. There is a lack of data supporting any one polishing method for the prosthesis. There is a need for further research on the existing techniques and newer advancements yielding aesthetic prostheses with an optimal surface finish.
