              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14872">Maximum entropy models of neuronal populations at and off criticality</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical evidence of scaling behaviors in neuronal avalanches suggests that neuronal populations in the brain operate near criticality. Departure from scaling in neuronal avalanches has been used as a measure of distance to criticality and linked to brain disorders. A distinct line of evidence for brain criticality has come from thermodynamic signatures in maximum entropy (ME) models. Both of these approaches have been widely applied to the analysis of neuronal data. However, the relationship between deviations from avalanche criticality and thermodynamics of ME models of neuronal populations remains poorly understood. To address this question, we study spontaneous activity of organotypic rat cortex slice cultures in physiological and drug-induced hypo- or hyper-excitable conditions, which are classified as critical, subcritical and supercritical based on avalanche dynamics. We find that ME models inferred from critical cultures show signatures of criticality in thermodynamic quantities, e.g. specific heat. However, such signatures are also present, and equally strong, in models inferred from supercritical cultures -- despite their altered dynamics and poor functional performance. On the contrary, ME models inferred from subcritical cultures do not show thermodynamic hints of criticality. Importantly, we confirm these results using an interpretable neural network model that can be tuned to and away from avalanche criticality. Our findings indicate that maximum entropy models correctly distinguish subcritical from critical/supercritical systems. However, they may not be able to discriminate between avalanche criticality and supercriticality, although they may still capture a number of important features from neuronal data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15296">Detection of spiking motifs of arbitrary length in neural activity using bounded synaptic delays</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.15296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of spiking neural networks, temporal coding of signals is increasingly preferred over the rate coding hypothesis due to its advantages in processing speed and energy efficiency. In temporal coding, synaptic delays are crucial for processing signals with precise spike timings, known as spiking motifs. Synaptic delays are however bounded in the brain and can thus be shorter than the duration of a motif. This prevents the use of motif recognition methods that consist of setting heterogeneous delays to synchronize the input spikes on a single output neuron acting as a coincidence detector. To address this issue, we developed a method to detect motifs of arbitrary length using a sequence of output neurons connected to input neurons by bounded synaptic delays. Each output neuron is associated with a sub-motif of bounded duration. A motif is recognized if all sub-motifs are sequentially detected by the output neurons. We simulated this network using leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and tested it on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) database, that is, on audio data converted to spikes via a cochlear model, as well as on random simultaneous motifs. The results demonstrate that the network can effectively recognize motifs of arbitrary length extracted from the SHD database. Our method features a correct detection rate of about 60% in presence of ten simultaneous motifs from the SHD dataset and up to 80% for five motifs, showing the robustness of the network to noise. Results on random overlapping patterns show that the recognition of a single motif overlapping with other motifs is most effective for a large number of input neurons and sparser motifs. Our method provides a foundation for more general models for the storage and retrieval of neural information of arbitrary temporal lengths.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15298">Modulating the tennis racket grip during motor imagery influences serve accuracy and performance: A pilot study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is now ample evidence that Motor Imagery (MI) contributes to improve motor performance. Previous studies provided evidence that its effectiveness remains dependent upon specific guidelines and recommendations. The body posture, as well as the context in which MI is performed, are notably critical and should be carefully considered. The present study in young tennis players (n=18) was designed to compare the effectiveness of performing MI of the serve while adopting a loose grip (congruent MI) or holding tightly and squeezing hard the racket (incongruent MI). Data revealed that both MI conditions contributed to enhance the number of successful serves (p<0.001) and the technical quality of the serve (p<0.001). Interestingly, comparing mean serve accuracy scores showed that performance gains were significantly higher in the loose MI group than in the tight MI group (p<0.02). These findings confirm the critical importance of the congruence between the content of the mental representation and the features of the corresponding actual movement. Overall, the present study further highlights the effectiveness of the loose grip while mentally rehearsing the serve, and might thus contribute to update and adjust specific MI guidelines and recommendations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15338">Does the Muller-Lyer illusion induced by a goalkeeper configuration influence soccer penalty kicks?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In soccer penalty kicks, goalkeepers that orient their arms upward compared to downward can be misperceived as being taller - effectively recreating the Muller-Lyer illusion. The present study elaborates on previous research surrounding a potential illusion-induced bias in penalty kicks. Participants were exposed to goalkeeper configurations within a virtual goal including arms-parallel, arms-down, arms-out and arms-up. They separately judged the perceived size of the goalkeeper, and executed penalty kicks. The perceived size was near fully consistent with the intended illusion. Meanwhile, the penalty kicks indicated wider a horizontal position following arms-out, and lower vertical position following arms-up. Likewise, there was no relation between the biases expressed in perception and action. While goalkeepers can elicit a perceptual illusion, this does not extend to influencing the penalty kick itself. Instead, other contextual cues appeared more relevant including the proximity between the goalkeeper and goalposts, and with it, the available space in the goal.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14188">A region-specific brain dysfunction underlies cognitive impairment in long COVID brain fog</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.14188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long COVID "brain fog" is a common and debilitating subjective syndrome often associated with persistent cognitive impairment after COVID-19 infection. Here we identify a specific regional brain dysfunction that mediates this cognitive impairment and provide evidence that targeted neuromodulation improves this deficit. In 120 patients with long COVID brain fog, we found an aberrant perceptual processing pattern. Patients with more severe brain fog committed significantly more false alarms (impulsive responses to non-signals) despite preserved overall accuracy. Both high-density (128-channel) EEG and structural MRI analyses provided converging evidence of a right inferior insula deficit, characterized by a blunted neural monitoring signal and cortical atrophy. We confirmed this deficit in a separate 796-participant UK Biobank longitudinal COVID re-imaging cohort, where COVID-19 survivors also showed selective impairment on a perceptual processing task and corresponding longitudinal atrophy of the right inferior insula compared with healthy controls. Finally, in a proof-of-principle randomized, sham-controlled trial (n = 40), a non-invasive, excitatory theta-burst ultrasound stimulation protocol targeting the right inferior insula rescued the perceptual deficit by reducing false alarms. These findings provide evidence of a causal role for right inferior insula dysfunction in long COVID-related perceptual impairment and show that modulation of this region can rescue the deficit, establishing it as a novel therapeutic target for long COVID cognitive impairment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14917">Teaching signal synchronization in deep neural networks with prospective neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working memory requires the brain to maintain information from the recent past to guide ongoing behavior. Neurons can contribute to this capacity by slowly integrating their inputs over time, creating persistent activity that outlasts the original stimulus. However, when these slowly integrating neurons are organized hierarchically, they introduce cumulative delays that create a fundamental challenge for learning: teaching signals that indicate whether behavior was correct or incorrect arrive out-of-sync with the neural activity they are meant to instruct. Here, we demonstrate that neurons enhanced with an adaptive current can compensate for these delays by responding to external stimuli prospectively -- effectively predicting future inputs to synchronize with them. First, we show that such prospective neurons enable teaching signal synchronization across a range of learning algorithms that propagate error signals through hierarchical networks. Second, we demonstrate that this successfully guides learning in slowly integrating neurons, enabling the formation and retrieval of memories over extended timescales. We support our findings with a mathematical analysis of the prospective coding mechanism and learning experiments on motor control tasks. Together, our results reveal how neural adaptation could solve a critical timing problem and enable efficient learning in dynamic environments.

                arXiv:2511.04047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.

                arXiv:2511.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting nonlinear time series with multi-scale temporal structures remains a central challenge in complex systems modeling. We present a novel reservoir computing framework that combines delay embedding with random Fourier feature (RFF) mappings to capture such dynamics. Two formulations are investigated: a single-scale RFF reservoir, which employs a fixed kernel bandwidth, and a multi-scale RFF reservoir, which integrates multiple bandwidths to represent both fast and slow temporal dependencies. The framework is applied to a diverse set of canonical systems: neuronal models such as the Rulkov map, Izhikevich model, Hindmarsh-Rose model, and Morris-Lecar model, which exhibit spiking, bursting, and chaotic behaviors arising from fast-slow interactions; and ecological models including the predator-prey dynamics and Ricker map with seasonal forcing, which display multi-scale oscillations and intermittency. Across all cases, the multi-scale RFF reservoir consistently outperforms its single-scale counterpart, achieving lower normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and more robust long-horizon predictions. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly incorporating multi-scale feature mappings into reservoir computing architectures for modeling complex dynamical systems with intrinsic fast-slow interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15199">Learning Where, What and How to Transfer: A Multi-Role Reinforcement Learning Approach for Evolutionary Multitasking</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.15199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) algorithms typically require tailored designs for knowledge transfer, in order to assure convergence and optimality in multitask optimization. In this paper, we explore designing a systematic and generalizable knowledge transfer policy through Reinforcement Learning. We first identify three major challenges: determining the task to transfer (where), the knowledge to be transferred (what) and the mechanism for the transfer (how). To address these challenges, we formulate a multi-role RL system where three (groups of) policy networks act as specialized agents: a task routing agent incorporates an attention-based similarity recognition module to determine source-target transfer pairs via attention scores; a knowledge control agent determines the proportion of elite solutions to transfer; and a group of strategy adaptation agents control transfer strength by dynamically controlling hyper-parameters in the underlying EMT framework. Through pre-training all network modules end-to-end over an augmented multitask problem distribution, a generalizable meta-policy is obtained. Comprehensive validation experiments show state-of-the-art performance of our method against representative baselines. Further in-depth analysis not only reveals the rationale behind our proposal but also provide insightful interpretations on what the system have learned.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15326">A Quantifier-Reversal Approximation Paradigm for Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical neural network approximation results take the form: for every function $f$ and every error tolerance $\epsilon > 0$, one constructs a neural network whose architecture and weights depend on $\epsilon$. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approximation paradigm that reverses this quantifier order. For each target function $f$, we construct a single recurrent neural network (RNN) with fixed topology and fixed weights that approximates $f$ to within any prescribed tolerance $\epsilon > 0$ when run for sufficiently many time steps.
  The key mechanism enabling this quantifier reversal is temporal computation combined with weight sharing: rather than increasing network depth, the approximation error is reduced solely by running the RNN longer. This yields exponentially decaying approximation error as a function of runtime while requiring storage of only a small, fixed set of weights. Such architectures are appealing for hardware implementations where memory is scarce and runtime is comparatively inexpensive.
  To initiate the systematic development of this novel approximation paradigm, we focus on univariate polynomials. Our RNN constructions emulate the structural calculus underlying deep feed-forward ReLU network approximation theory -- parallelization, linear combinations, affine transformations, and, most importantly, a clocked mechanism that realizes function composition within a single recurrent architecture. The resulting RNNs have size independent of the error tolerance $\epsilon$ and hidden-state dimension linear in the degree of the polynomial.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of finding the global minima of a given function. Specifically, we consider complicated functions with numerous local minima, as is often the case for real-world data mining losses. We do so by applying a model from theoretical physics to create an Ising model-based evolutionary optimization algorithm. Our algorithm creates stable regions of local optima and a high potential for improvement between these regions. This enables the accurate identification of global minima, surpassing comparable methods, and has promising applications to ensembles.

                arXiv:2511.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) are widely used for expensive Black-Box Optimization. However, their reliance on rigid, manually designed components such as infill criteria and evolutionary strategies during the search process limits their flexibility across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Dual-Control Bi-Space Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (DB-SAEA), a Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) framework tailored for multi-objective problems. DB-SAEA learns a meta-policy that jointly regulates candidate generation and infill criterion selection, enabling dual control. The bi-space Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module in DB-SAEA adopts an attention-based architecture to capture optimization states from both true and surrogate evaluation spaces, while ensuring scalability across problem dimensions, population sizes, and objectives. Additionally, we integrate TabPFN as the surrogate model for accurate and efficient prediction with uncertainty estimation. The framework is trained via reinforcement learning, leveraging parallel sampling and centralized training to enhance efficiency and transferability across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that DB-SAEA not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, but also exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks with higher-dimensional settings. This work introduces the first MetaBBO framework with dual-level control over SAEAs and a bi-space ELA that captures surrogate model information.

                arXiv:2511.15408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trained on diverse human-authored texts, Large Language Models (LLMs) unlocked the potential for Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG), benefiting various applications like advertising and storytelling. Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training.

                arXiv:2506.01497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SPICEMixer, a genetic algorithm that synthesizes circuits by directly evolving SPICE netlists. SPICEMixer operates on individual netlist lines, making it compatible with arbitrary components and subcircuits and enabling general-purpose genetic operators: crossover, mutation, and pruning, all applied directly at the netlist level. To support these operators, we normalize each netlist by enforcing consistent net naming (inputs, outputs, supplies, and internal nets) and by sorting components and nets into a fixed order, so that similar circuit structures appear at similar line positions. This normalized netlist format improves the effectiveness of crossover, mutation, and pruning. We demonstrate SPICEMixer by synthesizing standard cells (e.g., NAND2 and latch) and by designing OpAmps that meet specified targets. Across tasks, SPICEMixer matches or exceeds recent synthesis methods while requiring substantially fewer simulations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01218">Quantitative Attractor Analysis of High-Capacity Kernel Logistic Regression Hopfield Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.01218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods such as Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, but the principles governing their performance and stability remain largely uncharacterized. This paper presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the attractor landscape in KLR-trained networks to establish a solid foundation for their design and application. Through extensive, statistically validated simulations, we address critical questions of generality, scalability, and robustness. Our comparative analysis reveals that KLR and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) exhibit similarly high storage capacities and clean attractor landscapes, suggesting this is a general property of kernel regression methods, though KRR is computationally much faster. We uncover a non-trivial, scale-dependent scaling law for the kernel width ($\gamma$), demonstrating that optimal capacity requires gamma to be scaled such that $\gamma \times N$ increases with network size $N$. This implies that larger networks necessitate more localized kernels -- where each pattern's influence is more spatially confined--to manage inter-pattern interference. Under this optimized scaling, we provide definitive evidence that the storage capacity scales linearly with network size ($P \propto N$). Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis shows that performance is remarkably robust to the choice of the regularization parameter lambda. Collectively, these findings provide a clear set of empirical principles for designing high-capacity, robust associative memories and clarify the mechanisms that enable kernel methods to overcome the classical limitations of Hopfield-type models.

                arXiv:2506.00377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised a new challenge for developers since it is prone to known and unknown cyberattacks due to its heterogeneity, flexibility, and close connectivity. To defend against such security breaches, researchers have focused on building sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) using machine learning (ML) techniques. Although these algorithms notably improve detection performance, they require excessive computing power and resources, which are crucial issues in IoT networks considering the recent trends of decentralized data processing and computing systems. Consequently, many optimization techniques have been incorporated with these ML models. Specifically, a special category of optimizer adopted from the behavior of living creatures and different aspects of natural phenomena, known as metaheuristic algorithms, has been a central focus in recent years and brought about remarkable results. Considering this vital significance, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of various applications of metaheuristics algorithms in developing a machine learning-based IDS, especially for IoT. A significant contribution of this study is the discovery of hidden correlations between these optimization techniques and machine learning models integrated with state-of-the-art IoT-IDSs. In addition, the effectiveness of these metaheuristic algorithms in different applications, such as feature selection, parameter or hyperparameter tuning, and hybrid usages are separately analyzed. Moreover, a taxonomy of existing IoT-IDSs is proposed. Furthermore, we investigate several critical issues related to such integration. Our extensive exploration ends with a discussion of promising optimization algorithms and technologies that can enhance the efficiency of IoT-IDSs.

                <p>To navigate dynamic environments, animals must rapidly integrate sensory information and respond appropriately to gather rewards and avoid threats. It is well established that dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) are key for creating associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict. Critically, it remains unclear how sensory information is integrated into DA pathways. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is positioned as a relay for DA neuron augmentation. We characterized the anatomy and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA/SNc in male and female rats. First, we show that neurons in the deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing with projections to the striatum and ventral pallidum, and these SC projections excite DA and GABA neurons in the VTA/SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neuron activation did not reliably evoke behavior in an optogenetic pavlovian conditioning paradigm, and activation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference/avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons evokes head turning. Focusing optogenetic activation solely onto DA neurons that receive input from the SC was sufficient to invigorate turning, but not reinforcement. Turning intensity increased with repeated stimulations, suggesting that this circuit may underlie sensorimotor learning for exploration and attentional switching. Together, our results show that collicular neurons contribute to cue-guided behaviors by controlling pose adjustments through interaction with DA neurons that preferentially engage movement instead of reward.</p>

                <p>Humans have an automatic tendency to imitate others&rsquo; actions, a process facilitated by the action observation network (AON). While motor nodes of the AON, such as the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the supplementary motor area (SMA), are engaged during automatic imitation, the distinct roles of their projections to the primary motor cortex (M1) remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the plasticity and functional role of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in healthy humans of either sex. We used a combination of corticocortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to modulate cortical connectivity strength and drift diffusion modeling to study the impact of ccPAS on the latent cognitive processes underlying automatic imitation. Our results show that manipulating PMv-to-M1 connectivity increases the baseline tendency to imitate actions, shifting the response toward or away from an imitative response when connectivity in this circuit is enhanced or hindered, respectively. Conversely, strengthening SMA-to-M1 connectivity does not affect this bias but improves contextual information integration, facilitating task-appropriate behavior, reflected by the drift rate parameter. These findings demonstrate a double dissociation in the functional roles of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways: the former pathway drives the automatic imitation bias, while the latter modulates the integration of contextual information to regulate imitation. By combining network-based brain stimulation with advanced behavioral analysis, this study provides causal evidence for the distinct cognitive functions supported by the PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in the facilitation and regulation of automatic imitation. Our findings offer insights into the neural mechanisms governing imitation and its context-dependent modulation.</p>

                <p>Aging affects the reproductive system, although its impact on GnRH neurons is mainly unexplored. Thus, we compared the transcriptome and electrophysiology of GnRH neurons obtained from female middle-aged (MA, 400&ndash;430&nbsp;d) and young (Y, 70&nbsp;d), diestrous mice, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reproductive senescence-related molecular changes in one-third of the MA mice. The upregulated genes (<I>n</I> = 225) were linked to immune signaling, olfactory- and vomeronasal receptors. The downregulated genes (<I>n</I> = 233) were related to mRNA processing, G-protein&ndash;coupled receptors, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport, and estrogen signaling. In addition, ion channel (Na, K, Ca), neurotransmitter (ACh, GABA, glutamate), and various neuropeptide receptor-coding genes showed differential expression indicating functional alterations of the cells. Accordingly, whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recordings revealed a twofold increase in spontaneous firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons. Significant changes were also observed in characteristics of action potentials and afterhyperpolarization amplitudes. Conspicuously, miniature postsynaptic currents were absent in 72% of MA-GnRH neurons, and pharmacological blockade of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> and glutamate receptors didn't affect the firing rate. However, administration of their ligands evoked inward currents and facilitated firing in both animal groups, although with a decreased efficacy in MA animals. MA-GnRH neurons sustained responsiveness to estradiol, G-protein inhibition, and kisspeptin (KP) like those of young animals. While KP receptor antagonist, KP-234, diminished firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons, it had no effect on young GnRH cells. Collectively, these findings revealed that both the transcriptome and electrophysiological activity of GnRH neurons change at middle age and the explored alterations are hallmarks of early phase of reproductive senescence.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/47/e0651252025?rss=1">Origins of the Auditory Brainstem Response in Mice Using Source Localization of Topographic Multichannel EEG</a></h4>

              
                <p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a critical tool for assessing auditory brainstem function in biomedical mouse models. Remarkably, despite its importance, the origins of ABR waves specific to mice remain poorly identified. Here, we used EEG source reconstruction to reevaluate the mouse-specific ABR origins. We recorded the topography of ABRs using high-density EEG from the skull of adult mice of either sex combined with parallel multielectrode recordings in the auditory cortex. Individual ABR waves showed a series of distinct spatial topographies across the skull. Wave I&rsquo; was strongly lateralized, supporting its auditory nerve origin. Waves II/III were also lateralized but had a more frontal distribution, supporting an origin in the cochlear nucleus and olivary complex. A distinct shift in wave IV topography showed focused activity directly above the inferior colliculus (IC). Source localization with beamforming supported the origin of wave IV and V in the IC. In addition, the slow IC wave, P<SUB>0</SUB>, temporally overlapped with responses in the auditory cortex. We identify ABR wave IV as a marker of IC activity, separating earlier brainstem contributions (cochlear nucleus, olivary complex) from later thalamic and cortical components. This finding improves the anatomical specificity of the mouse ABR as a noninvasive marker in biomedical mouse models.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/47/e0673252025?rss=1">Motor Control Processes Moderate Visual Working Memory Gating</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gating processes that regulate sensory input into visual working memory (WM) and the execution of planned actions share neural mechanisms, suggesting a mutual interaction. In a preregistered study (Open Science Framework), we examined how this interaction may result in sensory interference during WM storage using a delayed match-to-sample task. Participants (12 males, 20 females) memorized the color of a target stimulus for later report on a color wheel. The shape of the target indicated which hand they would adjust the color wheel with. During the retention interval, an interference task was presented, requiring a response with either the same or different hand as the main task. In half of the interference trials, the interfering task cue was also colored to introduce visual interference. EEG results showed early motor planning during sensory encoding, evidenced by mu/beta suppression contralateral to the responding hand. The interference task only impaired WM performance when it included an irrelevant color, indicating that the interference effect was primarily driven by the irrelevant sensory information. In addition, color reporting in the WM task was biased toward the irrelevant color. This was more pronounced when both tasks were performed with the same hand, suggesting a selective gating mechanism dependent on motor control processes. This effect was mitigated by a control mechanism, which was evident in frontal theta activity, where higher power predicted lower bias on the single-trial level. Our findings thus reveal that sensory WM updating can be induced by interfering motor actions, which can be compensated by a reactive control mechanism.</p>

                <p>Listeners effortlessly extract multi-dimensional auditory objects, such as a localized talker, from complex acoustic scenes. However, the neural mechanisms that enable simultaneous encoding and linking of distinct sound features&mdash;such as a talker&rsquo;s voice and location&mdash;are not fully understood. Using invasive intracranial recordings in seven neurosurgical patients (four male, three female), we investigated how the human auditory cortex processes and integrates these features during naturalistic multi-talker scenes and how attentional mechanisms modulate such feature integration. We found that cortical sites exhibit a continuum of feature sensitivity, ranging from single-feature-sensitive sites (responsive primarily to voice spectral features or to location features) to dual-feature-sensitive sites (responsive to both features). At the population level, neural response patterns from both single- and dual-feature-sensitive sites jointly encoded the attended talker&rsquo;s voice and location. Notably, single-feature-sensitive sites encoded their primary feature with greater precision but also represented coarse information about the secondary feature. Sites selectively tracking a single, attended speech stream concurrently encoded both voice and location features, demonstrating a link between selective attention and feature integration. Additionally, attention selectively enhanced temporal coherence between voice- and location-sensitive sites, suggesting that temporal synchronization serves as a mechanism for linking these features. Our findings highlight two complementary neural mechanisms&mdash;joint population coding and temporal coherence&mdash;that enable the integration of voice and location features in the auditory cortex. These results provide new insights into the distributed, multi-dimensional nature of auditory object formation during active listening in complex environments.</p>

                <p>Exposure to loud and/or prolonged noise damages the cochlea and triggers downstream brain changes, resulting in hearing loss and altered speech comprehension. It remains unclear however whether noise exposure also compromises the cochlear efferent system; a feedback pathway originates in the brain that fine-tunes hearing sensitivity in the cochlea. Recent evidence suggests that lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferent system supports hearing recovery by sustaining auditory nerve activity for several weeks after acoustic trauma (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B53">Sitko et al., 2025</cross-ref>); however, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we examined the long-term effects of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) on the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing pattern in mouse LOC neurons of either sex. Under normal conditions, these neurons display a characteristic burst firing pattern driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated membrane voltage oscillations. One week following noise exposure, hearing thresholds were significantly elevated, and the duration of AP bursts was increased, as a result of an enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Moreover, LOC neurons exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents&mdash;a key process that shapes the duration of voltage oscillations&mdash;whose properties were also modified following noise exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation, CDI, and outward leak currents is sufficient to sustain the oscillating behavior of LOC neurons. We propose that NIHL increases efferent activity, thereby enhancing the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which may support long-lasting restoration of sensory coding in the damaged cochlea.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/47/e0909252025?rss=1">Hippocampal Drift Rate Reflects the Temporal Organization of Memories</a></h4>

              
                <p>When freely recalling past events, individuals tend to successively remember stimuli that were studied close together in time&mdash;a phenomenon known as temporal clustering. Temporal clustering is thought to occur because stimuli are encoded in relation to a slowly drifting internal context; this internal context representation is then reinstated during recall, leading to clustered recall of stimuli that share a similar internal context. While several lines of evidence implicate the hippocampus in supporting internal context representations, there is limited evidence directly linking hippocampal drift during memory encoding to subsequent temporal clustering during recall. In a human fMRI experiment (<I>n</I> = 38; 20 females and 18 males), we sought to influence the rate of internal context change during memory encoding and tested for corresponding effects on (1) temporal clustering and (2) hippocampal drift rate. To influence internal context, we manipulated the rate at which background scenes "switched" while a list of words was encoded. Afterward, subjects freely recalled as many words as possible. While switch rate had no effect on the total number of words recalled, it significantly influenced the degree of temporal clustering. Specifically, a higher switch rate was associated with less temporal clustering. Strikingly, this pattern was mirrored by drift rate in the hippocampus: a higher switch rate was associated with significantly lower hippocampal autocorrelation (more drift). Moreover, individual differences in hippocampal autocorrelation were positively correlated with temporal clustering. Collectively, this suggests that hippocampal drift rate during encoding and temporal clustering during recall each reflects a common internal context representation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/47/e0979252025?rss=1">Effects of Partial Occlusion on Response Dynamics and Interregional Processing within Primate Superior Temporal Sulcus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recognizing partially occluded objects is a critical visual function that primates perform with ease, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Previous studies in the macaque inferotemporal cortex have reported mixed results on whether occlusion delays and reduces responses to partially occluded objects. To address this, we recorded single-unit activity from body-responsive regions of the middle and anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) in male macaques while presenting body stimuli with varying levels of occlusion using a dot pattern. Occlusion reduced response strength and increased onset latency in both regions, and even low occlusion levels altered response dynamics by increasing the difference between the response trough and second peak. While body selectivity was preserved, body decoding accuracy declined and was delayed as occlusion increased. In contrast to some prior reports, we found no consistent enhancement of body decoding during the late response phase. By controlling for information loss and clutter introduced by the occluder, we found that reductions in response strength were partly due to the deletion of body features, whereas changes in response dynamics primarily reflected interactions between the occluder and the remaining body features. Occlusion delayed the first but not the second response peak, suggesting distinct mechanisms for these phases. Peak decoding at high occlusion levels emerged later in anterior than middle STS, indicating a feedforward component. However, representational similarity analysis combined with Granger causality suggested enhanced feedback from anterior to middle STS under high occlusion. Together, these results highlight the response dynamics supporting robust recognition under occlusion.</p>

                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a cascade of secondary pathologies&mdash;such as neuroinflammation and glial activation&mdash;contributing to progressive neuronal loss and hindering functional recovery. While therapeutic hypothermia has shown neuroprotective potential, its clinical application is limited by systemic complications. Recent discoveries have identified hypothalamic Q neurons, whose activation induces a reversible, hibernation-like hypothermic state, termed Q neuron-induced hypothermic/hypometabolic states (QIH), without the need for external cooling. However, whether QIH can mitigate brain injury remains unknown. In this study, we examined the therapeutic effects of QIH following acute brain injury in male mice. Using a dorsal striatal stab injury model, we found that QIH-treated mice displayed significantly improved motor performance and grip strength compared with controls. Histological analyses revealed enhanced neuronal survival in the perilesional striatum, accompanied by markedly reduced astrocytic gliosis and microglial accumulation at the injury site. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these improvements, we employed a medial prefrontal cortex injury model and observed that QIH robustly suppressed astrocytic and microglial activation, as indicated by reduced GFAP and Iba1 expression. Additionally, QIH decreased the number of CD16/32- and CD68-positive microglia and downregulated iNOS expression, suggesting that QIH dampens both oxidative and phagocytic inflammatory responses. Morphometric analysis further revealed a shift toward ramified and rod-shaped microglia, phenotypes associated with neuroprotection. Our findings demonstrate that QIH ameliorates early neuroinflammation, preserves neuronal integrity, and promotes functional recovery following brain injury. These results highlight QIH as a novel and physiologically grounded neuroprotective strategy that may overcome the limitations of conventional hypothermia-based interventions.</p>

                <p>The olfactory bulb (OB) is one of the few regions in the adult brain that receives newly generated neuronal precursors throughout the lifespan of animals. These neuronal precursors differentiate into OB interneurons, mostly granule cells (GCs), and integrate into the bulbar network by forming dendro-dendritic reciprocal synapses with OB principal neurons. The ultrastructural properties and plasticity of these synapses and whether they are distinct from those formed by early-born, resident GCs remain unknown. In the present study, we assessed the ultrastructural properties of dendro-dendritic reciprocal synapses formed by either adult-born or resident, early-born GCs with principal neurons in mice of both sexes and studied their plasticity following sensory deprivation and odor learning. The synapses formed by either adult-born or resident, early-born GCs with principal bulbar neurons were undistinguishable in terms of area, diameter, and aspect ratio. In contrast, the synapses formed by adult-born GCs were characterized by a smaller synaptic cleft and a larger density of total and docked synaptic vesicles than synapses formed by resident GCs. Sensory deprivation and odor learning decreased and increased, respectively, the overall density and the number of docked synaptic vesicles in adult-born and resident GCs forming synapses with principal neurons. Our results revealed important differences in the ultrastructural properties of synapses formed by interneurons born at distinct developmental stages and revealed their plasticity in response to sensory deprivation and odor learning.</p>

                <p>High-frequency bursts in the hippocampus, known as ripples (80&ndash;120&nbsp;Hz in humans), have been shown to support episodic memory processes. However, converging recent evidence in rodent models and human neuroimaging suggests that the hippocampus may be involved in a wider range of memory domains, including motor sequence learning (MSL). Nevertheless, no direct link between hippocampal ripples and MSL has been established yet. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from the hippocampus in 20 epilepsy patients (11 males and 9 females) during an MSL task in which participants showed steady improvement across nine 30&nbsp;s typing blocks interspersed with 30&nbsp;s rest ("offline") periods. We first demonstrated that ripple rates strongly increased during rest relative to typing blocks. Importantly, ripple rates during rest periods tracked behavioral improvements, both across learning blocks and across participants. These findings suggest that hippocampal ripples during rest periods play a role in facilitating motor sequence learning.</p>

                <p>Similar to motor skill learning in mammals, vocal learning in songbirds requires a set of interconnected brain areas that make up an analogous basal ganglia&ndash;thalamocortical circuit known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP). Although neural activity in the AFP has been extensively investigated during awake singing, very little is known about its neural activity patterns during other behavioral states. Here, we used chronically implanted Neuropixels probes to investigate spontaneous neural activity in the AFP during natural sleep and awake periods in male zebra finches. We found that during sleep, neuron populations in the pallial region LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) spontaneously exhibited synchronized bursts that were characterized by a negative sharp deflection in the local field potential (LFP) and a transient increase in gamma power. LMAN population bursts occurred primarily during non-rapid eye movement sleep and were highly reminiscent of sharp-wave ripple activity observed in the rodent hippocampus. We also examined the functional connectivity within the AFP by calculating the pairwise LFP coherence. As expected, delta and theta band coherence within LMAN and Area X was higher during sleep compared with awake periods. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe strong coherence between LMAN and Area X during sleep, suggesting that the input from LMAN into Area X is spatially restricted. Overall, these results provide the first description of spontaneous neural dynamics within the AFP across behavioral states.</p>

                <p>Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (CTs) provide strong feedback input that is crucial to perception and cognition in normal and pathological states; however, the synaptic properties of this input remain largely unknown, especially in pathology. Here, we examined the synaptic properties of CT axon terminals in the medial geniculate body (MGB), the auditory thalamus, in normal hearing male and female mice and in a mouse model of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), also in male and female mice. In normal hearing mice, we found that the amplitude of CT-evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) to the core-type ventral subdivision of the auditory thalamus (MGv), which mainly conveys rapid sensory information, is larger compared with the amplitude of CT-evoked EPSC to the matrix-type dorsal subdivision of the auditory thalamus (MGd), which likely conveys higher-order internal state information. This is due to higher axonal density and/or axonal recruitment in CT-&gt;MGv compared with CT-&gt;MGd synapses. After noise trauma, we observed enhanced short-term facilitation in CT-&gt;MGd but not CT-&gt;MGv synapses. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of short-term synaptic plasticity after NIHL via which CTs enhance the throughput of matrix-type thalamus, likely to improve perceptual recovery via higher-order contextual modulation.</p>

                Background Investment decision making is a critical aspect of financial planning. It involves allocating the financial resources to various investment avenues with an objective of generating future returns. Behavioral finance provides a theoretical framework for understanding psychological biases investment decision making which changes the assumptions of traditional finance. This study examines five important behavioral biases such as heuristics, prospect theory, emotions, market impact, and herding behavior on investment decision-making and portfolio management by considering investor experience and financial literacy as moderating factors. Methods Primary data was collected from individual investors in the BSE and NSE using a structured questionnaire administered through a purposive random sampling. Resulting in 151 complete responses were obtained and were considered valid for the purpose of our study. PLS-SEM was used to test the proposed hypotheses as well as the moderating effect Results Study finding indicates that heuristics have a positive and statistically significant effect on investment decisions, while prospect theory, emotions, market impact, and herding behavior showed no significant direct influence. The moderation analysis reveals that both investor experience and financial literacy significantly moderate the effects of emotions and market impact on investment decisions. However, their influence on heuristics, prospect theory, and herding behavior was statistically insignificant. Conclusions The results of this study lead to several conclusions. In this present study only one behavioral bias heuristics (HU) demonstrated a significant direct influence on investment decisions. In contrast, other behavioral biases such as prospect theory (P), emotions (E), market impact (M), and herding behavior (HB) do not significantly affect investment decisions (p > 0.05). The moderating effect of investors’ experience and financial literacy investor behavior are minimal. The result underscores that improving financial education, skills, knowledge and gaining experience may help investors regulate emotional and trend-based decisions but may not be sufficient to address more instinctive cognitive biases. The significance of the study provides important implications for financial educators, advisors, policymakers and stock market authorities regarding the need for behaviorally informed investor training, decision-support systems, and informed advisory services to promote rational investment behavior.

                Background Traumatic injuries remain critical public health concerns, placing psychosocial and economic burdens on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Despite being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, especially in low-and middle-income countries, few studies have examined predictors of injury severity in pre-hospital settings. Most research focuses on injury incidence, with limited attention to pre-hospital factors. We aimed assessing the prevalence of severe injuries and their associated factors among patients managed by pre-hospital emergency services. Methods A cross-sectional study was utilized medical registry data from 1,162 RTI victims. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information were collected, with injuries categorized as severe or non-severe based on the Injury Severity Score. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to indicate associated factors of severe injury. Results Among 1162 victims, 165 (14%) experienced severe injury. Our results showed that females were less likely to experience severe injury (aOR=0.47, 95%CI:0.26–0.79) than males. Regarding trauma mechanism, car-to-pedestrian collisions (aOR=2.3, 95%CI:1.25–4.1), car-to-motorcycle collisions considerably increased the likelihoods of severe injury (aOR=3.88, 95%CI:1.16–13.05) compared to car-only crashes. Alcohol users were more likely to experience severe injury (aOR=3.37; 95%CI: 2.04-5.56) than non-users. Those who travelled distance ranged 21-40 km had higher likelihoods (aOR=2.91, 95%CI:1.27–6.63), while those with more than 40 km faced higher likelihoods of severe injury (aOR=2.64, 95% CI:1.11–6.25) than individuals with less than 20 km to reach to a healthcare facility. Those with extremity injuries (aOR=0.28, 95% CI:0.15–0.52), chest injuries (aOR=0.40, 95%CI:0.23–0.71, p=.002) had lower likelihoods of severe injury than those with head trauma. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing injury severity in the pre-hospital setting. The findings underscore the importance of strengthening early identification and rapid stabilization of high-risk patients during pre-hospital care. Future research using prospective longitudinal designs is recommended to confirm causality.

                <p>by Nicoló Gozzi, Matteo Chinazzi, Jessica T. Davis, Corrado Gioannini, Luca Rossi, Marco Ajelli, Nicola Perra, Alessandro Vespignani</p>

We present Epydemix, an open-source Python package for the development and calibration of stochastic compartmental epidemic models. The framework supports flexible model structures that incorporate demographic information, age-stratified contact matrices, and dynamic public health interventions. A key feature of Epydemix is its integration of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques to perform parameter inference and model calibration through comparison between observed and simulated data. The package offers a range of ABC methods such as simple rejection sampling, simulation-budget-constrained rejection, and Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC). Epydemix is modular, and supports ABC-based calibration both for models defined within the package and for those developed externally. To demonstrate the computational framework capabilities, we discuss usage examples that include (i) simulating an intervention-driven model with time-varying parameters, and (ii) benchmarking calibration performance using synthetic epidemic data. We further illustrate the use of the package in a retrospective case study that includes scenario projections under alternative intervention assumptions. By lowering the barrier for the implementation of computational and inference approaches, Epydemix makes epidemic modeling more accessible to a wider range of users, from academic researchers to public health professionals.

Mathematical and computational models are often used to forecast respiratory infectious disease burden, including to inform healthcare capacity. We aimed to characterize pathways of clinical progression associated with SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections using data from patients aged 0 to >90 years in an integrated healthcare system, whose encounters were monitored across all levels of acuity spanning virtual, ambulatory, and inpatient care settings. Using parametric survival models, we estimated probabilities of progression and distributions of time to progression from each setting to all higher-acuity settings on a cascade encompassing the following classes of events or encounters: symptoms onset; diagnostic testing; telehealth or other virtual care appointment; outpatient physician office visit; urgent care presentation; emergency department presentation; hospital admission; mechanical ventilation; and death. Our analyses included data from 59,668, 22,705, and 1,668 episodes associated with positive SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV tests, respectively, between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. First clinical encounters occurred in inpatient settings for only 4.7%, 3.4%, and 18.7% of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV episodes, respectively, with median times (interquartile range) of 6.8 (3.6-13.2), 6.6 (3.5-12.1), and 6.4 (3.8-10.6) days from symptoms onset to admission. Overall, 7.9% of SARS-CoV-2 episodes, 5.8% of influenza episodes, and 33.8% of RSV episodes resulted in inpatient admission, ventilation, or death. Between 40.4-62.1%, 71.6-87.3%, and 47.9-58.7% of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV infections, respectively, had encounters in lower-acuity virtual care, outpatient, or urgent care settings. For all three viruses, the proportions of cases receiving care at each level of acuity increased with older age and greater numbers of comorbid conditions. Median durations of hospital stay were 4.2 (2.6, 7.3), 4.0 (2.3, 6.8), and 4.3 (2.5, 7.4) days for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV episodes resulting in admission. These estimates provide a basis for modeling real-world clinical care requirements and the progression of respiratory viral infections.

                <p>by Ignacio Sanchez-Burgos, Andres R. Tejedor, Rosana Collepardo-Guevara, Jorge Bernardino de la Serna, Jorge R. Espinosa</p>

The deficiency of α1-antitrypsin protein is a genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates within hepatocytes, leading to liver dysfunction. In the lung, it is found in macrophages, bronchial and epithelial alveolar cells type 2, leading to pulmonary emphysema. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanism underlying the formation of α1-antitrypsin inclusion bodies remain elusive. In this study, we combine equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the intricate process of α1-antitrypsin condensate formation and maturation. Our mechanistic model explains cluster accumulation—specifically the onset of this pathogenesis—through the emergence of phase-separated liquid-like protein droplets, which subsequently undergo inter-protein <i>β</i>-sheet transitions between misfolded variants, resulting in solid-like clusters. We find that this mechanism only applies to the misfolded variant, Z-α1-antitrypsin, which phase-separates driven by its disordered C-terminus. In contrast, the native protein, M-α1-antitrypsin, shows much lower propensity to phase-separate and later form kinetically trapped aggregates. Furthermore, we explore how Z-α1-antitrypsin exhibits an increased capacity to form condensates near external walls with different types of interactions. Such conditions can be similar to those found within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where phase separation and hardening take place. Overall, our results shed light on the molecular basis of α1-antitrypsin-related disorders and provide valuable microscopic insights for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting protein misfolding and aggregation-related disorders.

                <p>by Yirong Xiang, Jules C. Hancox, Henggui Zhang</p>

Patients with abbreviated cardiac repolarization are at increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular and atrial fibrillation (AF). In this computational simulation study, we investigated pro-arrhythmic effects of loss-of-function missense mutations in <i>CACNA1C</i> (A39V and G490R Cav1.2) identified in patients with a phenotype combining Brugada syndrome with shorter-than-normal QT intervals. Biophysically-detailed computational models of human atrial cells were modified to incorporate the functional impact of the <i>CACNA1C</i> encoded A39V and G490R mutations on the reduction of the maximal conductance (g<sub>CaL</sub>) of L-type calcium channels (LTCC). Varying levels of g<sub>CaL</sub> reduction were considered. Effects of deficient LTCC on atrial excitation and propagation were investigated by using cellular and multi-dimensional tissue models that included a one-dimensional atrial strand, a two-dimensional idealized atrial sheet and three-dimensional human atria with realistic anatomical structure and detailed electrophysiology. Our results showed that reduced LTCC activity from the <i>CACNA1C</i> A39V and G490R mutations accelerated atrial repolarization, leading to shortened action potential duration and effective refractory period, as well as the loss of their rate-dependence. At the tissue level, decreased g<sub>CaL</sub> shortened the wavelength of atrial excitation waves, slowed down atrial conduction velocity (CV) at low pacing rates but increased it at high pacing rates. It also showed bi-phasic arrhythmogenic effects in One-dimensional (1D), Two-dimensional (2D) and Three-dimensional (3D) tissue simulations. A large reduction in I<sub>CaL</sub> increased tissue susceptibility to initiation and maintenance of atrial re-entrant excitation waves, while a moderate reduction showed anti-arrhythmic effects due to an increased meandering area of re-entrant excitation waves that led to early self-termination of the reentry. In conclusion, this study provides new mechanistic insights into understanding of biphasic effects of loss-of-function LTCC mutations on atrial pro-arrhythmias.

                <p>by Yanqi Wu, Vieyiti K. Kouadio, Thomas R. Usherwood, Justin Li, Margaret Bisher, Reshum Aurora, Aaron Z. Lam, Alice R. Lam, Abigail K. R. Lytton-Jean, Scott R. Manalis, Teemu P. Miettinen</p>

Marine phytoplankton face eco-evolutionary pressure to regulate their vertical position in the ocean to access light, which is abundant towards the surface, and nutrients, which are found deeper down the water column. All phytoplankton experience gravitational sinking, which can contribute to their vertical migration. However, the biophysical and molecular mechanisms that impact gravitational sinking have not been systematically characterized across taxa and environmental conditions. Here, we combine simulations with measurements of cell mass, volume, and composition to investigate the effects of nutrient availability on gravitational sinking in nine representative unicellular pico- and nanoplankton species. We find that gravitational sinking becomes faster in most species when starved, but the biophysical changes responsible for this vary across species and starvation conditions. For example, the faster sinking of <i>Chaetoceros calcitrans</i> is nearly exclusively driven by cell density whereas that of <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> is due to cell volume. On the molecular level, the altered sinking is predominantly attributed to changes in cellular dry contents, rather than water. For example, starch accumulation increases sinking in three green algae species, and lipid accumulation decreases sinking in <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Overall, our work reveals that phytoplankton physiology has evolved multiple mechanisms that impact gravitational sinking in response to starvation, possibly to support the vertical migration of the cell.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen provides the proper redox environment for disulfide bond formation, which is essential for the correct folding of proteins entering the secretory pathway and forming membranes. However, the precise mechanisms by which disruptions in protein folding within the ER activate proteostatic mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> the antineoplastic agent hydroxyurea (HU) induces a transient perinuclear ER expansion, Bip1 accumulation, and the clustering of nuclear pore complexes in a specific region of the nuclear envelope. This striking phenotype is mimicked by diamide (DIA), a specific inducer of thiol stress, and can be prevented or rapidly reversed by dithiothreitol, a reducing agent, suggesting that ER expansion results from disulfide stress. Furthermore, HU or DIA treatments resulted in the accumulation of misfolded proteins in cytoplasmic foci containing Hsp104 disaggregase and Hsp70/Ssa1 chaperones. Our data show that HU impacts redox-dependent protein folding, impairs the secretory pathway, and activates specific proteostatic mechanisms in both the ER and the cytoplasm.

                <p>by Rafael Custodio, Ellinor O. Alseth, Michael A. Brockhurst, Sam P. Brown, Edze R. Westra</p>

Attacks from molecular parasites such as mobile genetic elements (MGEs) have driven the evolution of defense systems in bacterial genomes. Yet, despite significant advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of these bacterial immune systems, we have only a rudimentary understanding of their ecology and evolution. Bacteria exist as part of complex microbiomes, but community ecology and microbiome research has yet to characterize the impacts of interactions between MGEs and defense mechanisms upon the structure, dynamics and evolution of microbiomes. This Essay introduces and discusses the interplay between bacterial community dynamics and bacterial immune systems, speculating about how these reciprocal interactions may shape microbial community structure and function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-651/v3?src=rss">Explainable Transfer Learning with Residual Attention BiLSTM for Prognosis of Ischemic Heart Disease. [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Early and accurate prediction of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) is critical to reducing cardiovascular mortality through timely intervention. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in disease prediction, many lack interpretability, generalizability, and fairness—particularly when deployed across demographically diverse populations. These shortcomings limit clinical adoption and risk reinforcing healthcare disparities. Methods This study proposes a novel model: X-TLRABiLSTM (Explainable Transfer Learning–based Residual Attention Bidirectional LSTM). The architecture integrates transfer learning from pre-trained cardiovascular models into a BiLSTM framework with residual attention layers to improve temporal feature extraction and convergence. To ensure transparency, the model incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each clinical feature to the final prediction. Additionally, a demographic reweighting strategy is applied to the training process to reduce bias across subgroups defined by age, gender, and ethnicity. The model was evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. Results The X-TLRABiLSTM model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.2%, with an F1-score of 98.1% and an AUC of 99.1%, outperforming standard ML classifiers and state-of-the-art DL baselines. SHAP-based interpretability analysis highlighted clinically relevant predictors such as chest pain type, ST depression, and thalassemia. A fairness-aware reweighting strategy was applied during training, and fairness evaluation revealed minimal performance disparity across demographic subgroups, with F1-score gaps ≤ 0.6% and error rate gaps ≤ 0.4%. Confusion matrix analysis demonstrated low false-positive and false-negative rates, reinforcing the model’s reliability for clinical deployment. Conclusions X-TLRABiLSTM offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and demographically fair framework for IHD prognosis. By combining transfer learning, residual attention, explainable AI, and fairness-aware optimization, this model advances trustworthy AI in healthcare. Its successful performance on benchmark clinical data supports its potential for real-world integration in ethical, AI-assisted cardiovascular diagnostics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-403/v3?src=rss">Correlation of transcutaneous and serum bilirubin levels in late preterm and term neonates at a tertiary care center in south India [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Neonatal jaundice is one of the most prevalent conditions during first week of life causing morbidity and even mortality in few, especially in low – middle income countries. Although visual inspection for jaundice has been a time tested method, serum bilirubin is the gold standard investigation of choice. Due to this, newborns receive many heel or vein pricks for testing, hence the transcutaneous bilirubinometer can be a helpful non-invasive tool for diagnosing jaundice requiring phototherapy. Methods This prospective study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka to compare a non invasive method of detecting bilirubin levels and serum bilirubin levels. Performance of a transcutaneous bilirubinometer Dräger Jaundice Meter JM-105 was assessed against routine venous serum bilirubin testing before phototherapy during neonatal care in the first two weeks of life. Results were derived by analysing the correlation coefficient between two methods and direct agreement was analysed using Bland Altman analysis. Results Total of 271 neonates (>35 weeks) were included in the study. Transcutaneous bilirubinometry and serum bilirubin values were done on all of them in the first week of life. Correlation analysis showed significant relationship with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.629. Values of transcutaneous bilirubinometer showed excellent agreement with venous serum bilirubin concentration in Bland Altman analysis. Conclusions The transcutaneous bilirubinometer is a reliable tool to screen neonates and identify those needing phototherapy there by reducing invasive blood sampling.

                Spatial cognition in mammals relies on various spatially tuned cell types in the hippocampus and associated brain regions. Recent studies have increasingly explored the developmental timelines of these cells, their characteristics during early life, and the developmental origins of their functional heterogeneity in adulthood. In this review we discuss these findings and propose that the emergence and properties of spatially tuned cells across various developmental stages are shaped by the sequential maturation of multiple sensory and motor systems, as well as by the maturation of local inhibitory circuits. In addition, sensory and navigation experiences crucially influence the development of spatial navigation and episodic memory circuits. Finally, we highlight the diversity of cell types during development, and discuss how this diversity contributes to the functional heterogeneity of spatially tuned cells in adulthood.

                Visual experience is essential for the proper development of sensory representations in layer (L) 2/3 of the visual cortex. In this issue of Neuron, Lempel et al. reveal that increased stimulus discriminability by feedforward inputs and their alignment to recurrent circuits are critical for the development of orientation selectivity.

                Noise damages the cochlea, triggering maladaptive plasticity in the auditory cortex (ACtx) that makes moderate-intensity sounds seem uncomfortably loud. Clayton, Awwad, McGill, et al. show that brief activation of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons in the ACtx at 40 Hz sustainably reverses this plasticity and restores normal loudness perception for up to 1 week.

                This study using CSFV reveals how enveloped RNA viruses fully exploit autophagy for replication. The virus coopts the COPS2 protein to first enter autophagosomes and then accelerate their fusion with lysosomes, enabling non-lytic viral release through autolysosomal exocytosis and revealing a potential antiviral target.

                Lu et al. determine structures of the human taurine transporter (TauT) in apo, substrate-bound, and inhibitor-bound states. Structural comparisons between inward-open and occluded conformations elucidate the transporter’s dynamic transitions. Furthermore, they reveal binding modes for inhibitors and demonstrate the role of the sodium ion in stabilizing the occluded conformation.

                Nagao et al. show that Chd7 orchestrates post-stroke reactive astrogliosis by partnering with Sox2 or Atf4 to regulate transcription of Trib3, C3ar1, and Malt1. Astrocyte-specific Chd7 deletion suppresses astrocyte proliferation and neuroinflammation, reduces lesion volume and astrocytic scarring, and improves motor recovery, indicating that Chd7-dependent transcriptional regulation underlies stroke-induced gliosis.

                <p>Nature, Published online: 19 November 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03651-y">doi:10.1038/d41586-025-03651-y</a></p>Genome-wide association studies and rare-variant burden tests are the two main tools for discovering links between genetic variants and traits. Comparisons of their results reveal that they systematically rank genes differently, and models have been developed to explain why. Ultimately, both methods are complementary, each highlighting distinct aspects of trait biology.

Here, the authors present a coupled strategy that combines PDH with the reverse water–gas shift reaction through a tandem catalytic system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107397">Conduction pathway for potassium through the Escherichia coli pump KdpFABC</a></h4>

              
                Under osmotic stress, bacteria express a heterotetrameric protein complex, KdpFABC, which functions as an ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup> pump to maintain intracellular potassium levels. The subunit KdpA belongs to the superfamily of K<sup>+</sup> transporters and adopts pseudo fourfold symmetry with a membrane-embedded selectivity filter as seen in K<sup>+</sup> channels. KdpB belongs to the superfamily of P-type ATPases with a conserved binding site for ions within the membrane domain and three cytoplasmic domains that orchestrate ATP hydrolysis via an aspartyl phosphate intermediate. Previous work hypothesized that K<sup>+</sup> moves parallel to the membrane plane through a 40 Å long tunnel that connects the selectivity filter of KdpA with a canonical binding site in KdpB. In the current work, we have reconstituted KdpFABC into lipid nanodiscs and used cryo-EM to image the wild-type pump under turnover conditions. We present a 2.1 Å structure of the E1~P·ADP conformation, which reveals new features of the conduction pathway. This map shows strong densities within the selectivity filter and at the canonical binding site, consistent with K<sup>+</sup> bound at each of these sites in this conformation. Many water molecules occupy a vestibule and the proximal end of the tunnel, which becomes markedly hydrophobic and dewetted at the subunit interface. We go on to use ATPase and ion transport assays to assess effects of numerous mutations along this proposed conduction pathway. The results confirm that K<sup>+</sup> ions pass through the tunnel and support the existence of a low-affinity site in KdpB for releasing these ions to the cytoplasm. Taken together, these data shed new light on the unique partnership between a transmembrane channel and an ATP-driven pump in maintaining the large electrochemical K<sup>+</sup> gradient essential for bacterial survival.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92958">MCAK recognizes the nucleotide-dependent feature at growing microtubule ends</a></h4>

              
                The growing plus-end is a key regulatory site for microtubule dynamics. MCAK (mitotic centromere-associated kinesin), a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, is an end-binding regulator of catastrophe frequency. It is intriguing how MCAK specifically binds to growing microtubule ends. Here, we measure the end-binding kinetics of MCAK using single-molecule imaging and reveal that MCAK not only binds to the distalmost ends, but also to the proximal region of GTP cap where EB1 preferentially binds. Further analysis shows that MCAK strongly binds to GTPγS microtubules which mimic the GDP·Pi-tubulin-enriched region of GTP cap, and this binding preference is dependent on the nucleotide state of MCAK. This finding suggests that MCAK recognizes the nucleotide-dependent feature of microtubule ends. Moreover, we show that although MCAK and XMAP215 partly share binding regions at the distalmost ends, they act largely independently, influencing catastrophe frequency and growth rate, respectively. Overall, our findings provide new insights into how MCAK regulates microtubule end dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107449">Life-cycle-related gene expression patterns in the brown algae</a></h4>

              
                Brown algae are important primary constituents of marine coastal ecosystems, characterised by complex life cycles and various levels of complex multicellular development. However, the molecular processes that underlie development and life cycle progression in the brown algae remain poorly understood. In this study, pairwise comparisons of gametophyte and sporophyte transcriptomes across 10 diverse brown algal species showed that the total number of genes exhibiting generation-biased or generation-specific expression in each species was correlated with the degree of dimorphism between life cycle generations. However, analysis of gene ontology terms assigned to the generation-biased/generation-specific genes indicated that each generation (i.e. the sporophyte and the gametophyte) also has characteristic broad life-cycle-related features that have been conserved during evolution. A more detailed analysis of <i>Ectocarpus</i> species 7 identified progressive transcriptome changes over its entire life cycle, with a particularly marked change in transcriptome composition during the first day of sporophyte development, characterised by downregulation of flagellar and transcription factor genes and upregulation of a subset of translation genes. Comparison with a similar transcriptomic time series for the evolutionarily distant (about 250 My) brown alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i> indicated considerable conservation of co-expressed gene modules between the two species, particularly for modules that were enriched in genes assigned to evolutionarily conserved functional categories. This study therefore identified broad life-cycle- and development-related patterns of gene expression that are conserved across the brown algae.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103484">The Mac1 ADP-ribosylhydrolase is a therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to pose a threat to public health. Current therapeutics remain limited to direct-acting antivirals that lack distinct mechanisms of action and are already showing signs of viral resistance. The virus encodes an ADP-ribosylhydrolase macrodomain (Mac1) that plays an important role in the coronaviral life cycle by suppressing host innate immune responses. Genetic inactivation of Mac1 abrogates viral replication in vivo by potentiating host innate immune responses. However, it is unknown whether this can be achieved by pharmacologic inhibition and can therefore be exploited therapeutically. Here, we report a potent and selective lead small molecule, AVI-4206, that is effective in an in vivo model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Standard cellular models indicate that AVI-4206 has high target engagement and can weakly inhibit viral replication in a gamma interferon- and Mac1 catalytic activity-dependent manner. However, a stronger antiviral effect for AVI-4206 is observed in human airway organoids and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. In an animal model of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, AVI-4206 reduces viral replication, potentiates innate immune responses, and leads to a survival benefit. Our results provide pharmacological proof of concept that Mac1 is a valid therapeutic target via a novel immune-restoring mechanism that could potentially synergize with existing therapies targeting distinct, essential aspects of the coronaviral life cycle. This approach could be more widely used to target other viral macrodomains to develop antiviral therapeutics beyond COVID-19.

                Non-stationary dynamical cortical states − neural activity changing on the topology of the cortex across time − and in particular traveling waves, is an emerging topic. In this article, we propose that similar spatio-temporal traveling wave patterns observed across cortical scales are underpinned by generative mechanisms that differ in nature, that we categorize as first- and second-order traveling waves. This original definition provides a unifying framework making testable predictions at both mechanistic and functional levels. While having diverse mechanistic origins, we propose that traveling waves across spatial and temporal scales subserve a canonical computation at the core of a variety of brain functions, thereby ordering neuronal processing to impose a computational syntax.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103074">Comprehensive profiling of migratory primordial germ cells reveals niche-specific differences in non-canonical Wnt and Nodal-Lefty signaling in anterior vs posterior migrants</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian primordial germ cells (PGCs) migrate asynchronously through the embryonic hindgut and dorsal mesentery to reach the gonads. We previously found that interaction with different somatic niches regulates mouse PGC proliferation along the migration route. To characterize transcriptional heterogeneity of migrating PGCs and their niches, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 13,262 mouse PGCs and 7868 surrounding somatic cells during migration (E9.5, E10.5, E11.5) and in anterior vs posterior locations to enrich for leading and lagging migrants. Analysis of PGCs by position revealed dynamic gene expression changes between faster or earlier migrants in the anterior and slower or later migrants in the posterior at E9.5; these differences include migration-associated actin polymerization machinery and epigenetic reprogramming-associated genes. We furthermore identified changes in signaling with various somatic niches, notably strengthened interactions with hindgut epithelium via non-canonical WNT (ncWNT) in posterior PGCs compared to anterior. Reanalysis of a previously published dataset suggests that ncWNT signaling from the hindgut epithelium to early migratory PGCs is conserved in humans. Trajectory inference methods identified putative differentiation trajectories linking cell states across timepoints and from posterior to anterior in our mouse dataset. At E9.5, we mainly observed differences in cell adhesion and actin cytoskeletal dynamics between E9.5 posterior and anterior migrants. At E10.5, we observed divergent gene expression patterns between putative differentiation trajectories from posterior to anterior, including Nodal signaling response genes <i>Lefty1, Lefty2,</i> and <i>Pycr2</i> and reprogramming factors <i>Dnmt1, Prc1,</i> and <i>Tet1</i>. At E10.5, we experimentally validated anterior migrant-specific <i>Lefty1/2</i> upregulation via whole-mount immunofluorescence staining for LEFTY1/2 and phosphorylated SMAD2/3, suggesting that elevated autocrine Nodal signaling in migrating PGCs occurs as they near the gonadal ridges. Together, this positional and temporal atlas of mouse PGCs supports the idea that niche interactions along the migratory route elicit changes in proliferation, actin dynamics, pluripotency, and epigenetic reprogramming.

                <i>P</i>-atic liquid crystal theories offer new perspectives on how cells self-organize and respond to mechanical cues. Understanding and quantifying the underlying orientational orders is, therefore, essential for unraveling the physical mechanisms that govern tissue dynamics. Due to the deformability of cells this requires quantifying their shape. We introduce rigorous mathematical tools and a reliable framework for such shape analysis. Applying this to segmented cells in MDCK monolayers and computational approaches for active vertex models and multiphase field models allows to demonstrate independence of shape measures and the presence of various <i>p</i>-atic orders at the same time. This challenges previous findings and opens new pathways for understanding the role of orientational symmetries and <i>p</i>-atic liquid crystal theories in tissue mechanics and development.

">Rapid neocortical network modifications via dendritic plateau potential induced plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Learning in brains is associated with changes in neuronal network activity thought to be driven by synaptic plasticity. While recent work in the hippocampus has revealed some of the mechanisms involved there, less is known about how neocortical circuits adapt, especially during behavior. Here to determine if neocortical areas possess rapid plasticity mechanisms that could support online adaptations we used optical imaging and intracellular membrane potential (Vm) recordings to examine the activity of layer V neurons in a higher visual area of mice learning a task. The introduction of a novel rewarded stimulus resulted in a rapid modification of population activity that featured abrupt alterations in single neuron selectivity. Vm recordings revealed that both naturally occurring and experimentally-induced dendritic calcium plateau potentials (plateaus) rapidly alter the action potential (APs) output and Vm dynamics of neurons over many seconds of time around the plateau, in some cases from one trial to the next. Trains of high frequency APs had no effect. Finally, experimental inhibition during learning of the distal dendritic region responsible for initiating plateaus reduced the rate of population level adaptation. Our findings suggest that the deep layers of higher order visual cortex possess a rapid learning mechanism mediated by plateau-induced synaptic plasticity.

">Canopy1/Cnpy1 is required for proper V2R processing and transport; its loss impairs the function and circuit organization of basal/V2R vomeronasal sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is a specialized chemosensory structure in the nasal cavity that detects pheromones and mediates social and reproductive behaviors. The VNO of rodents is populated by different types of Vomeronasal Sensory Neurons (VSNs). Apical VSNs, located near the lumen, express the transcription factor (TF) Meis2, V1R family receptors, and the G protein subunit Go, the VSNs distributed closer to the basal lamina express the TF Tfap2e/AP2{epsilon}, V2R receptors, and the G protein subunit Gi2. In addition, sparse cells in the VNO express the Formyl Peptide Receptors (FPRs). Single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA Seq) identified over 980 differentially expressed genes between these cell types, with many linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Among these ER proteins, Canopy1 (Cnpy1), was found to be among the most enriched genes in V2R+ VSNs. Previously studied only in zebrafish, Cnpy1 was found to affect Fgfr1 signaling and is thus also known as FGF signaling regulator-1. In a previous study, we discovered that AP-2{epsilon} upregulates Cnpy1 expression. Although Cnpy1 knockout mice are viable and have normal VNO development at birth, they experience a progressive degeneration and loss of V2R-expressing VSNs. Prior to symptoms, the basal VSNs of KO mice display reduced V2R protein immunoreactivity in the soma and a complete absence of the protein at the lumen of the VNO, rendering the neurons non-functional. Cnpy1 KOs exhibit altered guidance cues and adhesion molecule expression, along with disrupted connectivity to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Our study shows that distinct neuronal types depend on unique ER protein repertoires to maintain proper proteostasis. The loss of Cnpy1 highlights the importance of cell type specific ER factors in the differentiation and function of specific neurons, revealing mechanisms that drive neuronal diversity and vulnerability to ER gene disruption.

">Analysis of cortical dysplasias using b-tensor encoding diffusion MRI in an animal model</a></h4>

              
                Cortical dysplasias are malformations of cortical development characterized by disorganization of the cyto- and myeloarchitecture of the neocortex. They are a common cause of epilepsy and their diagnosis through conventional imaging can often be challenging, hindering surgical treatments. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has the ability to infer tissue properties at the microscopic scale, making it a promising technique for detection of cortical dysplasias. This study aims to assess the microarchitecture of the cerebral cortex in a murine model of cortical dysplasia using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) acquired with b-tensor encoding. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered either carmustine (BCNU) or saline solution on day 15 of gestation. Their offspring were imaged at 120 days of age using a 7 tesla scanner, acquiring diffusion-sensitive images with b-tensor encoding. Images were processed with Q-space trajectory imaging with positivity constraints (QTI+) to derive various metrics along a curvilinear coordinate system across the neocortex. After scanning, the brains were processed for immunofluorescence and histological examinations. Experimental animals exhibited a significant reduction of microscopic fractional anisotropy ( FA) and anisotropic kurtosis (Ka) in the middle and lateral cortical layers compared to the control animals. Immunofluorescence and histological analysis showed decreased and dysorganized myelinated fibers, and an increase of glial processes in BCNU-treated animals. Given the applicability of b-tensor encoding in clinical scanners, this approach holds promise for improving detection of focal cortical dysplasias in patients with epilepsy.

                Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, including hypertension and cardiovascular disease, yet strategies for safe and precise mitochondrial-targeted delivery remain limited. Here, we establish strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) as a biocompatible, high-fidelity chemical platform for engineering mitochondria-targeted brain-derived exosomes (BR-EVs). Copper-free click conjugation of a mitochondrial-targeting ligand (e.g. Cy5-DBCO) under mild aqueous conditions preserved vesicle morphology (30-150 nm core; 120-200 nm hydrodynamic), proteomic composition, and uptake dynamics. Time-course imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed unaltered endocytic kinetics, >75 % mitochondrial colocalization, and intact organelle architecture. In vivo neuroinflammation and biodistribution analyses demonstrated immunological neutrality, strong central nervous system retention, and minimal peripheral dispersion following intracerebroventricular administration. Proteomic profiling of unlabeled Sprague-Dawley (SD) and hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) BR-EVs uncovered hypertension-driven enrichment of oxidative and complement pathways correlating with mitochondrial fragmentation and reactive oxygen species generation in neuronal cultures. These findings establish SPAAC-mediated ligand conjugation as a biocompatible and chemically precise approach for generating mitochondria-targeted exosomes that preserve exosomal identity, biodistribution, and signaling fidelity-advancing a foundational platform for organelle-specific delivery and mechanistic imaging in the central nervous system.

">GABA-glutamate corelease is a mechanism for state-dependent neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                Ventral tegmental area neurons projecting to lateral habenula (LHb) corelease the main inhibitory and excitatory transmitters, GABA and glutamate (VTAGG). Yet the functional role of this synchronous signal remains unclear. We hypothesized that the sign of VTAGG action depends on postsynaptic state in LHb. Ex vivo, activating VTAGG terminals evoked excitatory and inhibitory responses in LHb that varied with postsynaptic membrane potential. In vivo, VTAGG inputs drove net inhibition and supported positive reinforcement that was dependent on GABA, but not glutamate, release. Using chemogenetics to bidirectionally modulate LHb, we found that LHb hyperpolarization shifted VTAGG effects toward excitation, abolishing positive reinforcement, whereas LHb depolarization enhanced net inhibition and positive reinforcement. Thus, the activity state of LHb neurons dictates whether GABA-glutamate corelease is functionally inhibitory or excitatory and can reverse the motivational valence of VTAGG input, supporting a homeostatic role for GABA-glutamate cotransmission with broad implications for disorders of imbalanced motivation.

">MatClassRSA v2 release: A MATLAB toolbox for M/EEG classification, proximity matrix construction, and visualization</a></h4>

              
                MatClassRSA is a MATLAB toolbox that performs magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) classification and other analyses related to Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). The toolbox is designed for cognitive neuroscience researchers who wish to perform classification-based decoding analyses of their data---often repeated trials of evoked responses---or derive Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) as input to RSA. Organized as a collection of user-called functions, MatClassRSA v2 comprises five main modules: Preprocessing, Reliability, Classification, RDM Computation, and Visualization. The Classification module supports multiple classifiers (LDA, RF, SVM) and classification schemes (e.g., multiclass, pairwise, cross-validated, train-test, hyperparameter optimization) and offers basic statistical analyses via permutation testing. Functions in other modules include, for example, trial-averaging and noise normalization; reliability estimation; non-classification RDM construction; and hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering visualizations. The toolbox is freely available on GitHub under an MIT license and includes the main codebase, a User Manual, example function calls, and illustrative analyses. This preprint provides a general background of M/EEG classification for RSA as well as a narrative overview of the v2 MatClassRSA release, its updated functionalities, and illustrative analyses performed using the toolbox.

">Mecp2 deficiency induces dysphagia in a preclinical model of Rett Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Rett Syndrome is a rare, x-linked genetic neurological disorder caused by MECP2 gene mutations. This progressive neurodevelopmental disorder hinders patients ability to breathe and eat normally. It is unclear how Mecp2-deficiency results in a high percentage of dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia in patients with Rett syndrome. We aim to determine the effects of Mecp2-deficiency on swallow related neuromuscular mechanisms contributing to dysphagia in Rett syndrome. Swallow and breathing were detected using electrophysiology in the submental and laryngeal muscle complexes and the hypoglossal and vagus nerves. Several medullary motoneuron populations involved in swallowing were examined by immunohistochemistry in pre and post symptomatic Mecp2-deficient male and female mice. Swallow-related submental complex duration and amplitude were significantly decreased in both Mecp2-/y and Mecp2+/- compared to wild-type, due to decreased motor unit activation. In both Mecp2-deficient mice, cholinergic staining in hypoglossal, facial, and trigeminal nuclei were decreased. We noted a significant increase in the transition time from inspiration to swallow, swallow to the subsequent inspiration, and impaired respiratory rhythm regeneration in Mecp2-/y, but not Mecp2+/- mice. Mecp2-deficiency resulted in impaired brainstem cholinergic signaling, which contribute to weakened submental muscle complex activity, and impaired swallow related laryngeal vestibular closure. These results suggest Mecp2-deficient mice are a viable pre-clinical model to further study dysphagia in Rett syndrome.

                Intracellular tau accumulation contributes to neurodegeneration and systemic dysfunction. Although tau primarily aggregates in neurons as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), it also affects other cell types through poorly understood mechanisms. To define the molecular characteristics of tangle-bearing neurons and their influence on surrounding cells, we used CosMx SMI to evaluate the expression of 950 genes in more than 265,000 cells from rTg(tauP301L)4510 tauopathy and control mouse brains. In the cerebral cortex, tau pathology disrupted the excitatory-inhibitory neuron balance and altered pathways critical for myelination, similar myelin changes were observed in postmortem brain tissue from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. In the hypothalamus, tau accumulation was associated with transcriptional changes linked to pathways involved in body weight and metabolic regulation. These findings reveal molecular mechanisms underlying both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects of tauopathy and identify targets for further investigation into tau pathogenesis and its systemic impact.

">Pericyte and Endothelial Primary Cilia and Centrioles have Disparate Organization Across the Brain Microvasculature</a></h4>

              
                The brain microvascular functions are strongly influenced by the local microenvironment and cellular organization. Intracellular organelles, including primary cilia and centrioles, play critical roles in sensing and transmitting environmental cues and maintaining vascular integrity. However, their distribution across the brain vasculature remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilized publicly available large-volume electron microscopy datasets encompassing the cerebral vasculature from pial arterioles through parenchymal capillaries to pial venules. We systematically analyzed the cellular organization and characterized the distribution of primary cilia and centrioles in the mouse and human brain microvasculature. We found primary cilia exclusively on human cortical endothelial cells (ECs), indicating inter-species differences between mouse and human. Primary cilia were frequently present on mural cells (MCs, smooth muscle cells or pericytes) surrounding venules and capillaries but rarely observed on arterioles in both mouse and human brains. These MC primary cilia exhibited heterogeneity in ciliogenesis, including cells with ciliary pockets, surface cilia, and a hybrid configuration we refer as a partial pocket. In the mouse brain, many MC primary cilia were closely ensheathed by astrocytic endfeet and occasionally extended between them to establish proximity to synapses, whereas all primary cilia in the human brain were confined within the basal lamina. Our analysis of cellular density revealed similar EC densities between arterioles and venules in mice, but not in human. EC centrioles were consistently positioned against the direction of blood flow relative to the nuclei, suggesting that they may serve as a structural marker for flow direction. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive characterization of primary cilia and centrioles, highlighting distinct interspecies differences between mouse and human brain microvasculature. The proximity to neural cells and gradient distribution of these subcellular structures suggest that they may act as antennae for sensing mechanical and chemical signals within the brain microvascular environment.

">The Paradox of Unpredictability: Trying to Be Unpredictable Makes Sequences More Predictable</a></h4>

              
                Human intuition about randomness is systematically biased. When asked to generate random sequences, people systematically generate too many alternations. At the same time, game-theoretic analyses of competitive interactions prescribe truly random mixed strategies as the unique way to remain unpredictable to an opponent. Despite this formal equivalence between randomness and unpredictability, research on cognitive biases in sequential judgment and on strategic behavior in games has largely proceeded in parallel, leaving open how biased internal models of randomness shape behavior when the explicit goal is to be unpredictable. Here we bring these traditions together in two experiments in which one group of participants generates sequences and another predicts them. In our first experiment, we show that when the goal shifts from being random to being unpredictable, participants reverse this pattern, generating sequences with a strong repetition bias. In a second experiment, we asked new participants to predict two model-derived sequences that were empirically calibrated to the group-level statistics from the first experiment (Competitive-like vs Random-like). We found a paradox: the repetitive sequences intended to be unpredictable were in fact more predictable than the alternating sequences intended to be random. This paradox appears to stem from an asymmetric reinforcement learning mechanism, whereby success selectively strengthens beliefs in repetition but not alternation. Our findings bridge classic cognitive bias and strategic behavior, suggesting how a fundamental learning mechanism can shape paradoxical predictability.

">Highly Consistent Anatomical Asymmetry in a Small Primate Brain: Left is Always Larger in the Marmoset Monkey</a></h4>

              
                Although lateralisation of brain function is relatively common in animals, this is rarely accompanied by overt anatomical asymmetries. In primates, morphological differences between the cerebral hemispheres are well established in Hominidae but have been regarded as subtler or inconsistent in other species. Here we demonstrate that the left hemisphere is reproducibly larger than the right hemisphere in one of the smallest primates, the marmoset. This asymmetry develops postnatally, persists throughout adult life, and is found in individuals from genetically isolated colonies. Voxel-based morphometry reveals that the larger left hemisphere is primarily due to differences in the volume of cortical areas linked to social cognition. This result challenges the notion that the development and evolution of marked morphological asymmetry between the hemispheres is linked to the evolution of large brains.

">The transcription factor BCL11A restores differentiation potential to aged oligodendrocyte progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                In young animals, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) undergo robust differentiation, progressing through stages to become pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes (Pre-OL) and ultimately myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). However, OPCs from aged animals have reduced differentiation ability. This disrupts myelin maintenance in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a lack of remyelination following demyelinating injury and impaired adaptive myelination as a mechanism of learning. To uncover novel factors essential for restoring resilience in aged OPCs, we employed a data-driven approach involving the development of a computational pipeline, gSWITCH (accessible at: https://altoslabs.shinyapps.io/gSWITCH/), that allows for capture of precise dynamic gene expression patterns to pinpoint potential 'switch' genes during lineage progression. Using gSWITCH to identify potential switch genes crucial for OPCs, we conducted a comparative analysis of gene expression in OPCs isolated from young and aged animals. This revealed a group of transcription factors with decreased expression in aged OPCs. Further analysis of transcription factor binding site enrichment in OPC switches highlighted Bcl11a, a zinc finger transcription factor that could potentially serve as a master regulator of many switch genes. Ectopic overexpression of Bcl11a in aged OPCs did not enhance their proliferation; however, it significantly enhanced their differentiation into OLs. Overexpression of Bcl11a in aged mice, followed by demyelination injury in spinal cord white matter, significantly increased the differentiation of OPCs into OLs within the injury region compared to control aged mice. Furthermore, we found that Bcl11a is absent in invertebrates and has undergone pervasive purifying selection throughout vertebrate evolution, constraining its amino-acid sequence by eliminating deleterious mutations. Our study shows that reversing the age-related decline of this evolutionarily conserved factor in aged OPCs restores their impaired capacity for differentiation.

">Neuronal activity promotes repair by microglial reprogramming following demyelination</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play a multifaceted role in neurological disorders. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease, microglia contribute to inflammation and tissue damage, but can also support repair by clearing myelin debris, limiting inflammation and promoting remyelination and neuroprotection. The timely transition from their pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative states is essential for effective repair and, in chronic MS, persistent, defective microglial activation contributes to disease progression. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the microglial switch remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that neuronal activity can modulate microglial signature at the onset of remyelination in MS models, in a pattern-dependent manner. Transcriptomic analyses reveal a downregulation of pro-inflammatory, disease-associated microglial signatures alongside an upregulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, indicative of a shift toward pro-regenerative states following physiological activity enhancement. This activity-dependent reprogramming also extends to infiltrating monocytes and macrophages, collectively fostering a microenvironment favoring repair.

">Peri-operative pregabalin does not adversely impact experimentaloutcomes in rat models of chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Multiple mechanisms contribute to the experience of pain where the use of model organisms to dissect mechanistically sensory regulatory circuitry is a vital component of discovering underlying causes of persistent pain in disease states. Such disease states can be modelled in animals using surgical procedures that, ethically, should involve administration of analgesia. However, since basic pain researchers often wish to measure pain-related events, animals may be denied peri-operative analgesia to avoid adversely influencing experimental outcomes. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of peri-operative analgesia usage in rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) models. Using a combination of behavioural testing and in vivo electrophysiology in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, we assessed the impact of peri-operative pregabalin on nociceptive behaviours in the acute recovery phase, and behavioural and electrophysiological experimental outcomes in the chronic phase, of rat SNL and CIBP models. Results: A literature search revealed that, for studies using rat models of SNL or CIBP, only 5.37 % and 12.69 % respectively reported the use of peri-operative analgesia. We then demonstrated that the use of pregabalin as a peri-operative analgesic reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in the acute period following SNL surgery, with no impact on behavioural, electrophysiological or neuropharmacological outcomes in the chronic phase of either model. Conclusions: This study challenges the basic science researcher's reasoning that peri-operative analgesia confounds neurobiological outcomes. The use of peri-operative analgesia should be an important consideration to improve animal welfare in chronic models of pain.

">Distinct spatial distribution of potentiated dendritic spines in encoding- and recall-activated hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Experimental advancements in neuroscience have identified cellular engrams - ensembles of neurons whose activation is necessary and sufficient for memory retrieval. Synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation, is key to memory encoding and recall, but the relationship between learning-induced dendritic spine potentiation and neuron-wide activation remains unclear. Here, we employ a post-synaptic translation-dependent potentiation reporter (SA-PSD{Delta}Venus) and a neuronal activation reporter (ESARE-dTurquoise) to determine their spatiotemporal correlation in the mouse hippocampal CA1 following contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Potentiated spines were enriched in activated neurons, with distribution varying across CA1 layers at different phases of memory: potentiated spines were more frequent in activated neurons in stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum moleculare after CFC (encoding), while recall-activated neurons showed a larger number of potentiated spines in the stratum radiatum. These findings demonstrate that the relative weight and spatial distribution of potentiated synaptic inputs to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons changes between the encoding and retrieval phases of memory.

">Independent Basal Ganglia Neural Populations Encode Speech Production and Ambient-Noise Levels</a></h4>

              
                The function of the basal ganglia (BG), a set of nuclei deep in the brain, is still under debate despite their clinical relevance. Lines of evidence from non-human primate and human experiments suggest that one key causal contribution of the adult primate BG is invigoration of movement according to environmental and energetic constraints. Previous studies have come to this conclusion using primarily limb motor control tasks. We hypothesized BG are also important for invigorating the respiratory, vocal, and articulatory motor systems during speech production. To test this, we used a rare clinical opportunity to record local field potentials-broadband gamma activity (LFP-BGA) and single unit (SU) activity from human basal ganglia during deep brain stimulation implant surgeries. Participants repeated sentences aloud in the operating room. We modulated environmental and energetic constraints of speech production by inducing the Lombard Effect, wherein people reliably increase the intensity of their voice in the presence of background noise. Participants increased voice intensity, pitch, vowel space size, and respiratory depth in the presence of ambient noise. ~40% of LFP and SU sites were modulated by speech production. Comparing globus pallidus (GP) LFP-BGA, herein reported for the first time during speech, to subthalamic nucleus (STN) LFP-BGA revealed GP activated after STN. STN was more coincident with the speech preparatory period and GP more coincident with speech onset, suggesting differential roles in speech production. We found only weak evidence that STN or GP activity encodes the level of produced speech intensity. Instead, we found that LFP-BGA and SU-FR robustly track the ambient background noise levels. Linear decoding from SU-firing rate revealed we could infer the background noise levels with >75% accuracy in any given time point in the trial, including baseline. Importantly, the ambient-noise-modulated sites were an independent population from speech-modulated sites. We conclude that human BG encode the energetic constraints of communication. We theorize that the code is leveraged in downstream BG-cortical loop nodes to invigorate speech oro-motor gestures and co-speech manual limb gestures, both of which respond to ambient noise levels to maintain high-fidelity communication.

">The Virtual Brain Ontology: A Digital Knowledge Framework for Reproducible Brain Network Modeling</a></h4>

              
                Computational models of brain network dynamics offer mechanistic insights into brain function and disease, and are utilized for hypothesis generation, data interpretation, and the creation of personalized digital brain twins. However, results remain difficult to reproduce and compare because equations, parameters, networks, and numerical settings are reported inconsistently across the literature, and shared code is often not fully documented, standardized, or executable. We introduce *The Virtual Brain Ontology* (TVB-O), a semantic knowledge base, minimal metadata standard, and Python toolbox that simplifies the description, execution, and sharing of network simulations. TVB-O offers 1) a common vocabulary and ontology for core concepts and axioms representing current domain knowledge for simulating brain network dynamics, 2) a minimal, human- and machine-readable metadata specification for the information needed to reproduce an experiment, 3) a curated database of published models, brain networks, and study configurations, and 4) software that generates executable code for various simulation platforms and programming languages, including The Virtual Brain, Jax, or Julia. FAIR metadata and provenance-aware reports can be exported from TVB-O's model specification. It hereby enables a flexible framework for adopting new models and enhances reproducibility, comparability, and portability across simulators, while making assumptions explicit and linking models to biomedical knowledge and observation pathways. By reducing technical barriers and standardizing workflows, TVB-O broadens access to computational neuroscience and establishes a foundation for transparent, shareable "digital brain twins" that integrate with clinical pipelines and large-scale data resources.

">Convergent and divergent spatial topographies of individualized brain functional networks and their developmental origins</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is intrinsically organized into canonical functional networks with distinct spatial topographies. While precision functional mapping delineates individualized topographies of single networks, the spatial coordination among networks and its developmental origin remains largely unknown. Here, we propose functional topography covariance analysis (FOCA), a novel framework that quantifies convergent and divergent spatial alignments across individualized functional networks and further delineates their internetwork relationships, neurobiological basis, ontogenetic layouts, and cognitive outcomes. Across two well-established task-free functional MRI (fMRI) datasets encompassing both conventional and densely sampled scans, FOCA consistently revealed self-clustered hierarchies in the coordination of functional topographies, closely aligned with existing functional gradients and characterized by convergent couplings within primary systems and divergent couplings in higher-order systems. Such pattern was well predicted by fundamental neurobiological attributes, especially aerobic glycolysis. In a large public neonatal cohort, FOCA matrix exhibited adult-inverted hierarchical couplings and marked changes in auditory and action-mode networks, primarily driven by prominent redistributions of negative couplings. Moreover, neonatal FOCA profiles in the primary visual system significantly predicted neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months. Finally, compared with conventional functional connectivity (FC), FOCA proved more robust to global signals and more sensitive to the maturation of negative couplings. These findings highlight the critical role of negative connectivity in brain functional reorganization and advance our understanding of the cooperative and competitive relationships among functional systems and their developmental origins.

">Immature C. elegans motor neurons control early embryo behavior via both synaptic and non-synaptic GABA release</a></h4>

              
                Pre-natal brain activity has long lasting effects on subsequent neurodevelopment. It is unclear if early brain activity is dominated by cell intrinsic, synaptic, or non-synaptic mechanisms. We address this question by analyzing C. elegans embryo behavior in snf-11 mutants, which lack a plasma membrane GABA re-uptake pump (orthologous to GAT1). At 510-570 minutes post-fertilization, embryo motion was transiently and potently inhibited in snf-11 GAT1 mutants, which precedes formation of most nerve ring synapses. This transient motion inhibition requires GABA synthesis in DD motor neurons and UNC-49 GABAA receptors in body muscles. When motion inhibition occurs, DD neurons have not yet completed neurite outgrowth. Genetic analysis suggests that motion inhibition was mediated by both synaptic and tonic GABA release from DD motor neurons. These results suggest that DD neurons control embryo behavior prior to completing their developmental maturation.

">A novel method to sort and enrich sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral sensory neurons, residing in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), relay sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Although single-cell transcriptomic studies have identified over 20 distinct sensory neuron subtypes, functional analysis and assessment of subtype-specific pathological changes remain difficult. Effective isolation and enrichment of sensory neurons are challenging yet essential for functional studies. Therefore, we used single-cell transcriptomic data from DRG to identify a panel of neuronal surface markers, including Nrxn2 and Pirt. Using these markers, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) panel for neuronal enrichment and analysis that does not rely on transgenic mouse strains and can be broadly applied. The panel was validated by microscopy and single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing, which also revealed broad representation of neuronal subtypes. Expression of these markers in human DRG underscores the translational value of this isolation method for sensory and pain studies. Overall, this study provides a valuable tool for isolating DRG neurons, advancing research on sensory neuron function and pain biology, and facilitating neuroimmune studies.

">Identity Domains Reveal How Life Experiences and the Microbiome Shape Individuality and Uncover the Presence of Social Memory in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Personality is comprised of enduring traits that shape behavior across contexts and over time. Yet outside humans, research often equates individuality with personality, focusing on how one animal differs from another in each behavior. This overlooks the latent space that spans an animal's behavioral repertoire, how it is shaped by innate tendencies and prior experiences, and how it differs from transient factors. Here, we bridge this gap by integrating a data-driven framework with unbiased trait interpretation via large language models, revealing how social, sexual, and physiological conditions systematically alter the expression of personality-like traits in Drosophila melanogaster. This approach yielded four identities: space-use (exploration), time-use (social investment), avoidance, and aggression. Large language models produced strong consensus on the interpretation of some of these axes and divergence on others. These dimensions proved stable within individuals yet shifted predictably following mating, isolation, and microbiome manipulation, often in sex dependent ways. Notably, flies behaved differently toward familiar and unfamiliar peers, revealing a capacity for social memory. These findings bridge temperament and personality, showing how life history reshapes baseline tendencies into individualized profiles within constrained dimensions. They establish Drosophila as a tractable system for uncovering the biological logic of personality and advancing cross-species principles for individuality research.

">A ventral hippocampus to nucleus accumbens pathway regulates impulsivity</a></h4>

              
                Heightened impulsivity is attributed with substance abuse disorders, gambling, and obesity. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) has recently been linked with impulse control, yet the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms through which this control occurs are unknown. A subset of vHPC neurons project to the nucleus accumbens (ACB), a brain region known for regulating reward and motivation. Here, we evaluated the role of vHPC-ACB signaling in food-directed impulsivity using fiber photometry and transsynaptic chemogenetic and behavioral approaches. Male and female rats were trained in the differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL) test of impulsive action, where they learn to withhold lever presses for 20 seconds to obtain a palatable food reward. Photometry recordings during DRL revealed analogous elevations in calcium-dependent activity in the vHPC and ACB during the 5s immediately prior to a non-impulsive vs. an impulsive response. Chemogenetic silencing of ACB-projecting vHPC neurons elevated impulsive responses in DRL relative to vehicle treatment in males but not females, yet had no effect on home cage food intake, operant-based motivation to work for palatable food, impulsive choice, or anxiety-like behavior. To determine whether this impulse control circuit requires vHPC->ACB communication independent of collateral targets of ACB-projecting vHPC neurons, we utilized a novel transsynaptic viral approach to selectively silence ACB neurons that receive synaptic glutamatergic signaling from the vHPC. Results reveal that inhibition of ACB neurons receiving vHPC signaling elevates impulsive action in the DRL task relative to vehicle treatment. Collective results reveal a hippocampal-striatal circuit that regulates impulsive action in males.

">Association between white-matter lesion volume and heart-rate variability: A comparison of T1, T1-T2 and T1-FLAIR-based segmentations using FreeSurfer SAMSEG</a></h4>

              
                Background: Heart disease is a crucial risk factor for brain degeneration, but the exact mechanisms are still under investigation. Notably, a growth in white-matter lesion (WML) volume, a hallmark of cerebral small-vessel disease (cSVD) with connections to progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, has been linked to cardiovascular disease. As such, measures of cardiovascular function such as heart rate variability may represent early and accessible predictors of WML development. Methods: This study used data from healthy adults drawn from the Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions (LEMON) dataset to examine heart function through measures of heart rate variability (HRV), as well as their relationship to cSVD as quantified through WML volumes, using FreeSurfer SAMSEG. WML volumes were segmented using 3T T1+FLAIR, T1+T2 or T1 images alone. Results: Results indicate that both young and old adults exhibited WMLs, and that lower HRV was associated with higher WML volume. This was particularly strong for high-frequency HRV across both young and older adults, but it was low-frequency HRV that was related to WML volume in an age-specific manner. Moreover, we showed that the WML-HRV relationship that is apparent using T1+FLAIR or T1+T2 based WML volumes could be observed even with T1w-based WML estimation alone. Conclusions: These results suggest HRV not only as an avenue through which cardiovascular risk translates into brain degeneration, but also as a potential early and readily measurable non-invasive predictor of later WML development and cognitive impairment.

">Emergence of Individualized Functional Topography in the Neonatal Brain</a></h4>

              
                The early postnatal period represents a critical phase for establishing the brain's fundamental architecture. However, how individualized functional topography emerges and shapes long-term cognition remains unknown. Using multimodal neuroimaging data from 419 neonates, we map personalized functional topographies in the first weeks of life and reveal their association with 18-month neurocognitive outcomes. Unique and stable functional topographies are already present at birth, with interindividual variability organized along a conserved sensorimotor-to-association hierarchy. These individualized maps encode early brain maturity and robustly predict cognitive, language, and motor outcomes at 18-month of age, with predictive features concentrated at network boundaries. This functional refinement is structurally anchored by concurrent maturation in cortical myelination and sulcal depth. Preterm birth results in distinctive topographic alterations characterized by accelerated maturation of association networks. Our work establishes a foundation for precision models of early brain development and elucidates its significance for long-term neurocognitive outcomes.

">Scalable Human Cellular Models of Parkinson Disease Reveal A Druggable Link Between the Angiotensin Receptor 1 and Alpha-Synuclein Pathology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinson s disease (PD) involves progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons in the substantia nigra. No disease-modifying treatments exist, only symptomatic relief. Our lab reported an unbiased screen in larval zebrafish identifying renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, including clinically used AGTR1 inhibitors for hypertension, as potent neuroprotective agents. This study aims to investigate the effects of AGTR1 inhibition on human mDA neuron survival using inducible neurodegenerative 2D and 3D models for human mDA neuron degeneration. Methods: We report a scalable high-content platform, using CRISPR-engineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived mDA neurons expressing a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) fluorescent reporter, allowing to track mDA neuron survival live in a dish. We developed chemically inducible neurodegenerative 2D and 3D models for human mDA neuron degeneration, allowing to recapitulate PD pathology in human cells in vitro. Results: Our model establishes scalable human cellular models of PD well-suited for therapeutic discovery. Using 2D and 3D mono and co-cultures, this study demonstrates that inhibition of AGTR1, via chemical or genetic means, protects against chemically induced mDA neuron degeneration. Transcriptomic analyses show AGTR1 inhibition lowers synuclein transcription, by reducing SNCA and SNCB gene expression. In 3D neuron-glia assembloids, AGTR1 inhibition protects against the accumulation of phosphorylated form of a-synuclein (p129a Syn), key PD pathological marker. Conclusions: We highlight AGTR1 as a key regulator of -synuclein transcription and aggregation in human mDA neurons, and AGTR1 inhibition as pro-survival in human iPSC-derived models. These findings position inhibition of AGTR1 as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD neuroprotection.

">CNS Myelin Sheath Lengths Locally Scale to Axon Diameter via Piezo1</a></h4>

              
                Myelin sheath lengths vary by an order of magnitude in the central nervous system (CNS) and tune the timing of neuronal signaling. Thus, variation in myelin sheath length has been proposed to coordinate the timing of neuronal signaling to ultimately impact behavior. The mechanisms to establish myelin sheath length are unknown. For decades, reports have documented that in vivo myelin sheath size scales with the diameter of the ensheathed axon. We previously demonstrated diameter is sufficient to instruct myelin sheath lengths formed by oligodendrocytes using a synthetic axon culture system. The mechanisms of oligodendrocyte diameter-sensing and its translation into sheath elongation are still unknown. Here we demonstrate that diameter-sensing and sheath length is locally regulated: each individual myelin sheath responds to the underlying fiber diameter. We uncover a novel mechanism for scaling myelin sheath length to fiber diameter, through mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. In vivo, Piezo1 impacts the elongation of myelin sheaths on large diameter axons, recapitulating our in vitro results. Yet, surprisingly, there is no impact on myelin thickness with conditional Piezo1 loss. We propose Piezo1 provides a mechanism to establish hard-wired myelin sheath patterns, where oligodendrocytes transduce axon diameter into generating myelin segments with vastly different lengths.

">Human assembloid model of emergent neurotropic enteroviruses</a></h4>

              
                Enteroviruses (EVs) are the leading cause of viral meningitis in children. Recent outbreaks of non-polio EVs, most notably EV-A71 and EV-D68, have been associated with a polio-like paralysis known as acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). The lack of relevant models that mimic the cellular and functional responses of these human-restricted pathogens has hampered the development of effective treatments. We have previously engineered human stem cell-derived assembloids that recapitulate the neuromuscular connections underlying muscle contractions by integrating human spinal cord/hindbrain organoids (hSpO) and human skeletal muscle. Here, we used organoids and assembloids to investigate polio and non-polio EV pathogenesis. Infection of assembloids with poliovirus (PV), EV-D68 and EV-A71 resulted in loss of muscle contraction for all three viruses, which could be prevented by treatment with an antiviral agent. Yet, despite the convergence on neuronal dysfunction, the cellular targets by which each virus acted differed. More specifically, single cell transcriptomic profiling uncovered divergent cell tropisms between the EVs, and live imaging experiments revealed different modes and kinetics of cell damage. Altogether, we describe a multi-cellular model that captures viral pathogenesis in a human and circuit-relevant context.

">Hedonic hotspot in rat olfactory tubercle: map for mu-opioid, orexin, and muscimol enhancement of sucrose 'liking'.</a></h4>

              
                Pleasure plays a crucial role in positive reinforcement and motivation. Brain regions able to amplify positive hedonic reactions to sweetness, known as 'hedonic hotspots', are distributed within the mesocorticolimbic reward systems. The olfactory tubercle (OT), a part of the ventral striatum that receives olfactory input, contains distinct functional domains: the anteromedial domain mediates approach motivation toward odors associated with food, whereas the lateral domain mediates avoidance motivation away from odors associated with danger. However, it has remained unclear whether the OT modulates hedonic reactions to pleasant sensations. In this study, we made pharmacological microinjections in OT of in rats to examine whether these OT subregions can modulate hedonic reactions, as assessed by the taste reactivity test. Sweet oral infusions of sucrose solution were delivered into the mouth via an intraoral cannula, and the rats' orofacial and somatic hedonic reactions were recorded and analyzed. We compared three pharmacological agents: mu-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO, orexin-A peptide, and GABAA receptor agonist muscimol. Microinjection of any of these drugs into the anteromedial OT subregion enhanced hedonic 'liking' reactions to sucrose. Furthermore, DAMGO injection into the anteromedial OT subregion recruited distant Fos expression in other 'hedonic hotspots', including in the caudal ventral pallidum and the rostromedial orbitofrontal cortex. By contrast, the same microinjections into the anterolateral OT subregion failed to enhance 'liking' reactions and, DAMGO oppositely increased aversive 'disgust' reactions. These findings suggest that the anteromedial OT contains a 'hedonic hotspot', whereas the anterolateral OT may contain a suppressive opioid 'hedonic coldspot'. Thus, OT subregions may help causally modulate hedonic reactions to sweetness and flavor perception.

">The Role of Pavlovian Bias in Smoking Cessation Success and Neurocognitive Alterations During Nicotine Withdrawal</a></h4>

              
                Background: Inability to manage conflicts between multiple decision-making systems is associated with various mental disorders including addiction. The imbalance between the Pavlovian and instrumental systems may contribute to smoking cessation failure and relapse, as excessive Pavlovian motivation may override goal-directed quitting attempts. However, the exact role of the Pavlovian bias in smoking cessation and its neurocognitive mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: Eighty-six smokers participated in a smoking cessation clinic, completing the well-established orthogonalized go-nogo task before and after the intervention. We applied computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses to investigate the role of Pavlovian bias and its neural correlates in predicting smoking cessation outcomes. Results: Computational modeling revealed that higher levels of Pavlovian bias were associated with treatment failures. Importantly, Pavlovian bias significantly moderated the relationship between clinic participation rate and the likelihood of smoking cessation, suggesting that such bias can undermine motivational effort to quit. Furthermore, individuals who successfully quit smoking exhibited increased Pavlovian bias toward reward following cessation, indicating a potential cognitive mechanism underlying the relapse cycle. Complementary fMRI analyses demonstrated that Pavlovian bias influenced valence encoding in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), suggesting altered decision-making neural circuits. Conclusions: Pavlovian bias can be a critical risk factor of relapse in the smoking population, while this bias can be increased in response to nicotine abstinence. Moreover, the results highlight the roles of the vmPFC in decision-making under Pavlovian-instrumental conflict, providing insights into the neural underpinnings of relapse vulnerability. Understanding these mechanisms may guide targeted interventions to enhance smoking cessation outcomes.

                Background Endometrial malignancy in premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is rare but clinically challenging. Current diagnostic strategies rely on endometrial sampling, which is invasive and often unnecessary. This study aimed to develop and internally validate a novel risk prediction score for endometrial malignancy in premenopausal women with AUB. Methods A retrospective longitudinal analytical study was conducted over 8 years and 11 months (January 2016–November 2024) at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. Premenopausal women with AUB who underwent endometrial biopsy followed by hysterectomy were included. Comparative analyses, logistic regression, and ROC curve analysis were performed. Significant variables were weighted according to adjusted odds ratios to construct a risk prediction score. Results Among 209 patients, 13 (6.2%) had endometrial malignancy. Independent predictors of endometrial malignancy were: oral contraceptive use (OR 29.9, 95% CI 1.5–587.1, p = 0.025), endometrial thickness >9 mm (OR 25.3, 95% CI 4.3–147.6, p < 0.001), vascularization (OR 98.3, 95% CI 3.7–2594.8, p = 0.006). Protective factors included hemorrhage episode ≤1 (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08–0.52, p = 0.001) and lower bleeding abundance (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.65, p = 0.002). The final score allocated points as follows: endometrial thickness >9 mm (+3), oral contraceptive use (+3), vascularization (+4), hemorrhage episodes ≤1 (−2), and lower bleeding abundance (−1). A score ≥7 defined high risk. Model discrimination was excellent (AUC 0.901, 95% CI 0.825–0.976, p < 0.001). At a cutoff ≥7, sensitivity was 77%, specificity 90%, positive predictive value 34%, and negative predictive value 98%. Conclusions We developed and internally validated a novel risk prediction score for endometrial malignancy in premenopausal women with AUB. With strong diagnostic performance and high negative predictive value, this score may help clinicians better identify women who truly require invasive sampling.

                Road maintenance is essential for preserving the useful life of the roads. The evaluation methodology used in Ecuador is the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) method. It is the most complete method based on the analysis of the functional and structural damages that the pavement presents, the same ones that depend on its class, severity, and quantity. The PCI methodology uses data based on experiments made in the United States, so when evaluating pavements in Ecuador using the said methodology, it is not a correct adaptation to our reality because of the differences in deterioration of climatic factors and construction aspects. The PCI methodology has a study of values deduced from each of the damages present on the road, which are very strict in their qualification because the pavement service index in the United States looks for roads with high-quality standards compared to the Ecuadorian reality, where economic factors such as restrictions on usual road maintenance. The research proposes to generate changes in the abacus that generate the deduced values of the PCI methodology and adapt them to our country. Resulting in a 20% variability in the Ecuadorian Pavement Serviceability Index (PSI), which was applied to the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) method, commonly used for pavement evaluation.

                Background Youth substance abuse is an escalating public health challenge in Uganda, undermining individual well-being, family stability, and community development. Understanding the influence of family and community dynamics is critical for designing effective prevention strategies. Aim This study investigated the relationship between family and community factors and substance abuse among youths in Bushenyi District, Western Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional study design was employed. Structured questionnaires were administered to 381 youths aged 18–30 years, collecting sociodemographic information and data on family and community influences (parental drug use, home rules, peer influence, and law enforcement). Descriptive statistics summarised the data, chi-square tests assessed associations, and logistic regression identified predictors at a 5% significance level. Results Early initiation of drug use was common, particularly in bars and among peer groups. Substance abuse was significantly associated with parental drug use (χ2 = 102.68, p < 0.001), living arrangements (χ2 = 21.46, p = 0.001), peer influence (χ2 = 13.40, p = 0.001), and weak law enforcement (χ2 = 12.95, p = 0.001). Regression analysis showed that strict home rules were protective (Exp(B) = 0.325, p < 0.001), while weak law enforcement increased the risk of substance abuse (Exp(B) = 0.357, p = 0.003). Conclusion Family and community dynamics, particularly parental behaviour, peer pressure, and ineffective institutional regulation, are central drivers of youth substance abuse. Strengthening parental involvement, enforcing household rules, and improving law enforcement and community-based interventions are important in reducing the burden of substance use. The study highlights the need for multisectoral action involving families, schools, religious institutions, and law enforcement, while providing evidence to inform prevention strategies and future research on contextual risk pathways.

                Background Rapid development and adoption of digital technologies across all research disciplines underlines the need for accessible and reusable computational data and code. Methods An anonymous, multidisciplinary survey covering open science, data publishing and reuse, as well as code publishing and reuse was conducted to gather insights into researchers’ practices, needs, and barriers. Results A total of 254 people initiated the survey, with 133 complete responses (mostly from Europe, equally distributed among scientific fields). Survey revealed that registered reports, replication studies and pre-registration are the least applied practices (52%, 38% and 42%), while open software and OA publishing demonstrated widespread adoption (83% and 69%) of the respondents, respectively. Data sharing is hindered mostly by lack of time (60%) and sufficient funding (44%). Among the predefined obstacles of code sharing, again, the lack of time to build proper documentation (65%), pressure to publish (51%), and the insufficient funding (42%) are the most mentioned reasons. On the other hand, most stimulating factors are the requirement of journals to share data/codes (score: 482), followed by incentives and rewards by institutions (score: 439). The survey showed that 28% of researchers never tried to reproduce a study, and when replication was attempted, researchers often found that open data (70%), open code (71%), and metadata (86%) were missing or incomplete. The analysis of open-ended responses highlighted the need for training, career-stage guidelines, and basic programming skills for researchers. Conclusions Although the likely low response rate may limit its representativeness, this study provides an up-to-date snapshot. A recurrent theme throughout the responses is the need for structural incentives and institutional support. Researchers claim that making work reproducible requires time, resources, and expertise; however, these efforts are rarely rewarded in conventional academic evaluation systems, highlighting the need for a systemic cultural shift.

                Background Segmentation in microscopy images is a critical task in bioimage analysis, with many deep learning models available (e.g., Cellpose, Omnipose, StarDist, SAM-based models). However, researchers often face challenges in choosing the most suitable model for their data, as quantitative metrics do not always reflect the biological relevance of segmentation results. Methods We developed BISCUIT (BioImage Segmentation Comparison Utility and Interactive Tool), an open-source platform that enables users to run multiple state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on the same images and visually compare their outputs side-by-side. BISCUIT is implemented as an interactive Jupyter Notebook pipeline, leveraging existing segmentation libraries, and can be executed either via a zero-installation cloud environment (Google Colab) or on local high-performance computing resources. Results Using BISCUIT, we demonstrate how visual inspection of segmentation outputs can reveal qualitative differences between algorithms that may be overlooked by abstract performance metrics. For example, in a fluorescence microscopy image dataset, BISCUIT allowed direct comparison of segmentations from Cellpose, Omnipose, and StarDist, highlighting differences in how each algorithm delineated cell boundaries. This visual approach helped identify the model that produced the most biologically plausible segmentation for the dataset. Conclusions BISCUIT provides an intuitive platform for bioimage analysts and life scientists to evaluate and “see what really works” on their data. The platform is openly available and extensible, lowering the barrier for researchers to perform rapid, interactive benchmarking of segmentation models on their own microscopy data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1276/v1?src=rss">A Review of Deep Learning Techniques for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition: Models, Methods, and Datasets [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Emotion Recognition (ER) with Electroencephalography (EEG) has become a major area of focus in affective computing due to its direct measurement of the activity of the brain. ER based on EEG has also advanced with the popularity of Deep Learning (DL) and its advancements related to classification accuracy and model efficiency. This systematic review is conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and aims to provide an overview of DL-based EEG emotion recognition approaches. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across five major databases covering the publications from 2020 to 2025. The studies with EEG signals for ER using DL architectures were included in the present review. Finally, a total of 233 articles were considered after eligibility screening. To enhance the diversity of investigation, we assessed the public datasets utilized for ER based on EEG in terms of their stimulation procedures and emotional representation. Further, the provided analysis attempts to direct future research toward EEG-based emotion identification systems that are more interpretable, generalizable, and data-efficient. This systematic review aims to provide a roadmap for developing EEG-driven ER, guiding researchers toward more reliable, scalable, and practically useful systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1275/v1?src=rss">A Novel Particle Marine Predator Optimizer for Gene Selection Health Problem [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background High-dimensional microarray data complicates reliable cancer classification. Compact, informative gene panels are needed to maintain predictive power while improving interpretability and cost. Methods We propose a two-stage feature-selection pipeline. Stage 1 ranks genes via an ensemble of filters—ReliefF, chi-square, and Kullback–Leibler divergence—tempered by minimum redundancy–maximum relevance to promote diversity. Stage 2 performs wrapper-based subset search using a Particle Marine Predator Optimizer that fuses Marine Predators Algorithm for global exploration with Particle Swarm Optimization for local refinement. The objective maximizes cross-validated SVM accuracy while penalizing subset size. Results Across seven benchmarks (Breast, CNS, Leukemia, Leukemia-3c, Leukemia-4c, Lymphoma, Ovarian), we compare against Bat Algorithm, Grey Wolf Optimizer, Marine Predators Algorithm, White Shark Optimizer, and recent representatives using accuracy, F1, precision, sensitivity, Matthews correlation coefficient, selected-gene count, and convergence behavior. The method frequently matches or exceeds alternatives while selecting few genes, achieving perfect accuracy on several datasets (Leukemia, Leukemia-3c, Lymphoma, Ovarian) and stable, strong performance on the remainder. Typical subset sizes are 2–5 genes for Leukemia variants, 7–8 for CNS, and ~20 for Breast. Optimization traces show rapid, steady improvement. Conclusions The pipeline achieves an effective exploration–exploitation balance, yielding compact gene panels without sacrificing classification performance. Its modular design supports straightforward extension to larger cohorts and other omics modalities.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013706">An evolutionary approach to predict the orientation of CRISPR arrays</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Axel Fehrenbach, Alexander Mitrofanov, Omer S. Alkhnbashi, Rolf Backofen, Franz Baumdicker</p>

CRISPR-Cas is a defense system of bacteria and archaea against phages. Parts of the foreign DNA, called spacers, are incorporated into the CRISPR array which constitutes the immune memory. The orientation of CRISPR arrays is crucial for analyzing and understanding the functionality of CRISPR systems and their targets. Several methods have been developed to identify the orientation of a CRISPR array. To predict the orientation, different methods use different features such as the repeat sequences between the spacers, the location of the leader sequence, the Cas genes, or PAMs. However, those features are often not sufficient to predict the orientation with certainty, or different methods disagree.
Remarkably, almost all CRISPR systems have been found to insert spacers in a polarized manner at the leader end of the array. We introduce <i>CRISPR-evOr</i>, a method that leverages the resulting patterns to predict the acquisition orientation for (a group of) CRISPR arrays by reconstructing and comparing the likelihood of their evolutionary history with respect to both possible acquisition orientations. The new method is independent of Cas type, leader existence and location, and transcription orientation.
<i>CRISPR-evOr</i> is thus particularly useful for arrays that other CRISPR orientation tools cannot predict confidently and to verify or resolve conflicting predictions from existing tools. <i>CRISPR-evOr</i> currently confidently predicts the orientation of 28.3% of the arrays in the considered subset of CRISPRCasdb, which other tools like CRISPRDirection and CRISPRstrand cannot reliably orient. As our tool leverages evolutionary information we expect this percentage to grow in the future when more closely related arrays will be available. Additionally, <i>CRISPR-evOr</i> provides confident decisions for rare subtypes of CRISPR arrays, where knowledge about repeats and leaders and their orientation is limited.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013690">Ten simple rules for early-career researchers supervising short-term student projects</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rebecca M. Crossley, Philip K. Maini</p>

Supervising a short-term research project at undergraduate or master’s level is a rewarding yet complex responsibility that extends far beyond subject expertise. It offers supervisors the opportunity to inspire the next generation of scientists, while providing students with a crucial platform to develop research skills, academic identity, and resilience. However, short-term research projects often come with challenges, including varying levels of student motivation, limited time frames, and the need for intensive skill development. Effective supervision can enhance student learning, foster independent thinking, and improve both the quality and impact of student work, while also contributing to a positive and inclusive research culture. In this article, we present ten simple rules to guide supervisors, particularly those with limited supervision experience, such as early-career researchers, in supporting undergraduate and master’s students through their research journeys. These rules emphasise balancing project requirements with student interests, managing scope, fostering community integration, promoting open science practices, and providing structured yet flexible guidance. By adopting these practical strategies, supervisors can create a more productive, supportive, and enriching research experience for both students and themselves.
