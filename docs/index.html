<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and affective disorders are frequently comorbid and share underlying mechanisms that could be targets for comprehensive treatment. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has high comorbidity with AUD, but comprehensive models of this overlap are nascent. We recently characterized a model of comorbid AUD and PTSD-like symptoms, wherein stressed rats receive an inhibitory avoidance (IA)-related footshock on two occasions followed by two-bottle choice (2BC) voluntary alcohol drinking. Stressed rats received the second footshock in a familiar (FAM, same IA box as the first footshock) or novel context (NOV, single-chambered apparatus); the FAM paradigm more effectively increased alcohol drinking in males and the NOV paradigm in females. During abstinence, stressed males displayed avoidance-like PTSD symptoms, and females showed hyperarousal-like PTSD symptoms. Rats in the model had altered spontaneous action potential-independent GABAergic transmission in the central amygdala (CeA), a brain region key in alcohol dependence and stress-related signaling. However, PTSD sufferers may have alcohol experience prior to their trauma. Here, we therefore modified our AUD/PTSD comorbidity model to provide 3 weeks of intermittent extended alcohol access before footshock and then studied the effects of NOV and FAM stress on drinking and PTSD phenotypes. NOV stress suppressed the escalation of alcohol intake and preference seen in male controls, but no stress effects were seen on drinking in females. Additionally, NOV males had decreased action potential-independent presynaptic GABA release and delayed postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor kinetics in the CeA compared to control and FAM males. Despite these changes to alcohol intake and CeA GABA signaling, stressed rats showed broadly similar anxiogenic-like behaviors to our previous comorbid model, suggesting decoupling of the PTSD symptoms from the AUD vulnerability for some of these animals. The collective results show the importance of alcohol history and trauma context in vulnerability to comorbid AUD/PTSD-like symptoms.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper introduces a special issue focused on sex and gender (s/g) cognitive/behavioral differences at developmental ages providing an overview of this multifaceted and debated topic. It will provide a description of the biological systems that are strongly interconnected to generate s/g differences, that is, genetic determinants, sex hormones, differences in brain structure, organization, and/or function, inherited or modifiable under environmental pressures. Developmental studies are rare. Some addressed whether s/g differences in cognitive/behavioral characteristics are evident early in life and are consistent throughout development, entailing that s/g differences can follow the evolving steps in girls and boys in different domains. The data are far from being homogeneous and consistent about s/g difference in language, social skills, and visuo/spatial abilities. The differences are small, often with overlapping performances, similar to what is seen in adulthood. Given that several variables and the interactions between them are implicated, further longitudinal studies adopting adequate assessment tools, very large size multicultural samples stratified in different, well-sized and precise age groups, considering biological and sociocultural variables, are needed. Due to the complexity of the issue, there is still the need to support and adopt an s/g difference approach also in cognitive and behavioral studies at developmental ages. Finally, these studies have not only scientific importance and relevant cultural, anthropological, and social implications, but are also useful for pedagogical programming as well as for the study of the different susceptibility to develop CNS diseases and consequently to promote different therapies and treatments.</p>

	<p>Background: Early biomarkers of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are critical both to initiate interventions and to choose participants for clinical trials. Odor threshold, odor identification and odor familiarity are impaired in AD. Methods: We investigated the relative abilities of standard screening (MMSE) and olfactory measures to predict transitions from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), from CN to AD, and MCI to AD. The archival sample of 497, from the UCSD ADRC, included participants who were CN, MCI, AD and converters to MCI or AD. Apoe ε4 status, a genetic risk factor, was available for 256 participants, 132 were ε4 carriers. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve plots the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to determine diagnostic accuracy. Results: Different measures were better predictors at specific stages of disease risk; e.g., odor familiarity, odor identification and the combination showed higher predictive value for converting from MCI to AD in ε4 carriers than the MMSE. Combining odor familiarity and odor identification produced an AUC of 1.0 in ε4 carriers, MMSE alone was 0.58. Conclusions: Olfactory biomarkers show real promise as non-invasive indicators of prodromal AD. The results support the value of combining olfactory measures in assessment of risk for conversion to MCI and to AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Novel Neuron-Specific Regulator of the V-ATPase in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The V-ATPase is a highly conserved enzymatic complex that ensures appropriate levels of organelle acidification in virtually all eukaryotic cells. While the general mechanisms of this proton pump have been well studied, little is known about the specific regulations of neuronal V-ATPase. Here, we studied CG31030, a previously uncharacterized <I>Drosophila</I> protein predicted from its sequence homology to be part of the V-ATPase family. In contrast to its ortholog ATP6AP1/VhaAC45 which is ubiquitous, we observed that CG31030 expression is apparently restricted to all neurons, and using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene tagging, that it is mainly addressed to synaptic terminals. In addition, we observed that CG31030 is essential for fly survival and that this protein co-immunoprecipitates with identified V-ATPase subunits, and in particular ATP6AP2. Using a genetically-encoded pH probe (VMAT-pHluorin) and electrophysiological recordings at the larval neuromuscular junction, we show that <I>CG31030</I> knock-down induces a major defect in synaptic vesicle acidification and a decrease in quantal size, which is the amplitude of the postsynaptic response to the release of a single synaptic vesicle. These defects were associated with severe locomotor impairments. Overall, our data indicate that CG31030, which we renamed VhaAC45-related protein (VhaAC45RP), is a specific regulator of neuronal V-ATPase in <I>Drosophila</I> that is required for proper synaptic vesicle acidification and neurotransmitter release.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">First two years of reimbursed enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of Fabry disease in Poland [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Fabry disease (FD) is an ultra-rare genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by pathologic gene variants resulting in insufficient expression of α-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine in plasma and in different cells throughout the body, causing major cardiovascular, renal, and nervous system complications. Until 2018, reimbursed enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD was available in all European Union countries except Poland.             We present the preliminary results of the first two years of reimbursed ERT in Poland. We obtained data from the seven largest academic centers in Katowice, Cracow, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk, Warsaw, and Łódź. The questionnaire included the following data: number of patients treated, number of patients qualified for ERT, and patient characteristics.             All centers returned completed questionnaires that included data for a total of 71 patients (28 men and 43 women) as of June 2021. Thirty-five patients with the diagnosis of FD confirmed by genetic testing (22 men and 13 women) had already qualified for reimbursed ERT. Mean (SD) age at the commencement of the ERT program was 39.6 (15.5) years (range 18-79 years). Mean time from the first clinical symptoms reported by the patients to the FD diagnosis was 21.1 (8.9) years, and the mean time from the final diagnosis of FD to the beginning of ERT was 4.7 (4.6) years.             FD is still underdiagnosed in Poland. To identify undiagnosed FD patients and to ensure that patients in Poland benefit fully from ERT, implementation of an effective nationwide screening strategy and close cooperation with a network of rare disease centers is advised.

                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been rapidly spreading. Several guideline therapies have been proposed as a possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2, however, these therapies are not sufficient to treat a severe condition of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterised by the increase of D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs). Secretome-mesenchymal stem cells (S-MSCs) produced by MSCs under hypoxia could excessively release several anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors to control the COVID-19 cytokine storm and accelerate lung injury improvement. This is the first study investigating the clinical outcomes of three severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of three different hospitals in Indonesia treated with S-MSCs. The decrease of D-dimer and CRP level was reported for all patients treated with S-MSCs. This was in line with improvement of pulmonary radiology, blood gas level, and hematologic assessment. In conclusion, these cases suggest that S-MSCs could effectively control D-dimer, CRP level and GGOs of severe COVID-19 patients associated with recovered pulmonary function.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CAMAP: Artificial neural networks unveil the role of codon arrangement in modulating MHC-I peptides presentation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tariq Daouda, Maude Dumont-Lagacé, Albert Feghaly, Yahya Benslimane, Rébecca Panes, Mathieu Courcelles, Mohamed Benhammadi, Lea Harrington, Pierre Thibault, François Major, Yoshua Bengio, Étienne Gagnon, Sébastien Lemieux, Claude Perreault</p>

MHC-I associated peptides (MAPs) play a central role in the elimination of virus-infected and neoplastic cells by CD8 T cells. However, accurately predicting the MAP repertoire remains difficult, because only a fraction of the transcriptome generates MAPs. In this study, we investigated whether codon arrangement (usage and placement) regulates MAP biogenesis. We developed an artificial neural network called Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor (CAMAP), predicting MAP presentation solely from mRNA sequences flanking the MAP-coding codons (MCCs), while excluding the MCC <i>per se</i>. CAMAP predictions were significantly more accurate when using original codon sequences than shuffled codon sequences which reflect amino acid usage. Furthermore, predictions were independent of mRNA expression and MAP binding affinity to MHC-I molecules and applied to several cell types and species. Combining MAP ligand scores, transcript expression level and CAMAP scores was particularly useful to increase MAP prediction accuracy. Using an <i>in vitro</i> assay, we showed that varying the synonymous codons in the regions flanking the MCCs (without changing the amino acid sequence) resulted in significant modulation of MAP presentation at the cell surface. Taken together, our results demonstrate the role of codon arrangement in the regulation of MAP presentation and support integration of both translational and post-translational events in predictive algorithms to ameliorate modeling of the immunopeptidome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">PaIRKAT: A pathway integrated regression-based kernel association test with applications to metabolomics and COPD phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charlie M. Carpenter, Weiming Zhang, Lucas Gillenwater, Cameron Severn, Tusharkanti Ghosh, Russell Bowler, Katerina Kechris, Debashis Ghosh</p>

High-throughput data such as metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics have become familiar data types within the “-omics” family. For this work, we focus on subsets that interact with one another and represent these “pathways” as graphs. Observed pathways often have disjoint components, i.e., nodes or sets of nodes (metabolites, etc.) not connected to any other within the pathway, which notably lessens testing power. In this paper we propose the Pathway Integrated Regression-based Kernel Association Test (PaIRKAT), a new kernel machine regression method for incorporating known pathway information into the semi-parametric kernel regression framework. This work extends previous kernel machine approaches. This paper also contributes an application of a graph kernel regularization method for overcoming disconnected pathways. By incorporating a regularized or “smoothed” graph into a score test, PaIRKAT can provide more powerful tests for associations between biological pathways and phenotypes of interest and will be helpful in identifying novel pathways for targeted clinical research. We evaluate this method through several simulation studies and an application to real metabolomics data from the COPDGene study. Our simulation studies illustrate the robustness of this method to incorrect and incomplete pathway knowledge, and the real data analysis shows meaningful improvements of testing power in pathways. PaIRKAT was developed for application to metabolomic pathway data, but the techniques are easily generalizable to other data sources with a graph-like structure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Optimal design for a psychosocial intervention on severely acute malnourished children in humanitarian settings: results of an expert survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Common psychosocial interventions focus on feeding, stimulation, emotional responsiveness and childcare and parenting. Inclusion of such a component in the outpatient management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) children is recommended. However, clinical assessment of such interventions is tedious in humanitarian settings and modalities evidence on the impact of psychosocial interventions alongside nutrition protocol for SAM is scarce.  This survey aimed to gather expert opinions on the optimal design of a combined psychosocial and nutrition intervention feasible in humanitarian settings. Methods: From March to May 2018, an online survey was emailed to international experts in nutrition and mental health and psychosocial support, mainly from academia and international non-governmental organisations (INGOs). It included multiple choices questions on the key components of an optimal combined intervention. Results: Of the 76 experts targeted, 20 responded. 11 (55%) belonged to INGOs, 2 (10%) to academia, and 4 (20%) to international organizations and donors. For most respondents, a combined intervention should be provided in weekly 45-minuites counselling sessions, provided individually (rather than in a group) and at home (rather than at a health center). None of the proposed ideal duration (two, four or six months) gained the majority of votes. Experts thought that 35% staff training should be in “Active listening for psychosocial support”, and 30% in “Early child development”, 25% in “Maternal depression” and 9% in “Anthropometric measurements”. They estimated that a combined intervention could improve SAM recovery rate by 10% (min-max: 0-19%) vs. the nutritional protocol alone. Qualitative results highlighted the importance of tailoring the intervention to the individual, the population and the settings; as well as considering feasibility and scalability at the design stage. Conclusion: These findings could guide further research on the impact of psychosocial interventions on SAM children’s health and development, and help designing innovative approaches to treat undernutrition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of acute L-arginine supplementation on physical performance in strength training: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The oral administration of L-arginine has been related to improved physical performance due to a likely reduction in muscle fatigue, resulting from the vasodilator effect of nitric oxide on skeletal muscle. However, there is no precise and quantitative analysis of the information in the literature. The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of L-arginine supplementation on physical performance in strength training with a systematic review and meta-analysis. We hypothesized that L-arginine supplementation would improve performance capacity and the effects involved in strength training. Methods: The study period was from 2010 to 2020. The inclusion process established articles with well-designed human experiments that included only L-arginine supplementation (without any additional compounds) testing the effects of L-arginine supplementation on sports performance related to strength training; identical experimental conditions in placebo or control group; and publications in the last ten years (until December 31, 2020). Three studies were included that compared L-arginine supplementation with placebo in anaerobic performance tests. Test analysis supplementation with other supplements was removed and there was no gender, age, and ethnicity level. Results: There was no significant heterogeneity (p>0.05) in the analysis of the three selected articles and the effects of L-arginine supplementation in muscular endurance; performance had a mean of 0.26 (95% CI = -0.129; 0.649; p = 0.190), peak torque with a mean of -0.002 (95% CI = -0.531; 0.527; p = 0. 99) of the third series of exercises and, furthermore, when comparing the integrated effect (resistance rate with the peak torque) there was no difference with a mean of 0.168 (95% CI = -0.145; 0.481; p = 0.292). Conclusions: Acute L-arginine supplementation provides no ergogenic effect on strength training performance.

                Although the antimicrobial potential of nitric oxide (NO) is widely published, it is little used clinically. NO is a key signalling molecule modulating vascular, neuronal, inflammatory and immune responses. Endogenous antimicrobial activity is largely mediated by high local NO concentrations produced by cellular inducible nitric oxide synthase, and by derivative reactive nitrogen oxide species including peroxynitrite and S-nitrosothiols. NO may be taken as dietary substrate (inorganic nitrate, L-arginine), and therapeutically as gaseous NO, and transdermal, sublingual, oral, intranasal and intravenous nitrite or nitrate. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that NO has generic static and cidal activities against viruses (including β-coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2), bacteria, protozoa and fungi/yeasts in vitro. Therapeutic effects have been seen in animal models in vivo, and phase II trials have demonstrated that NO donors can reduce microbial infection. Nevertheless, excess NO, as occurs in septic shock, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In view of the dose-dependent positive and negative effects of NO, safety and efficacy trials of NO and its donors are needed for assessing their role in the prevention and treatment of infections. Trials should test dietary inorganic nitrate for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis and gaseous NO or oral, topical or intravenous nitrite and nitrate for treatment of mild-to-severe infections, including due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). This review summarises the evidence base from in vitro, in vivo and early phase clinical studies of NO activity in viral, bacterial, protozoal and fungal infections.

                Currently, the studies on sexual abuse trauma, and resilience in Confucian survivors are still limited. The purpose of this study is to explore the resilience of Confucian women after sexual abuse trauma to provide evidence to support in counseling and psychotherapy practices. The article describes the resiliency story of a Vietnamese Confucian female survivor who was abused by her brother from the age of 8 to 16. The life history approach used in qualitative narrative research was applied in this study. The researcher identified two factors that strongly influence the survivor’s resilience: (1) the effectiveness of passive education in the general education curriculum is oriented to both competence and quality development; and (2) an authentic understanding of the core Confucian philosophical doctrine: the neutrality and the self-nurture. Based on the findings, we propose a 7-stage flow diagram of a Confucian women's resilience following sexual abuse. These findings provide important evidence-based practice for counselors and clinicians in supporting and intervening for sexually abused Confucian women and contribute to the impact of studies on religious and spiritual factors affecting the resilience of sexual abuse survivors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pneumococcal carriage and antibiotic susceptibility patterns in mother-baby pairs in a rural community in Eastern Uganda: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pneumococcal carriage predisposes children to pneumonia. Pneumonia poses a significant threat to the lives of children below five years old worldwide, contributing to a high number of hospitalizations and death. Morbidity and morbidity are especially common in children under five and the elderly, although any age group can be affected. This study aimed to estimate pneumococcal carriage and determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the pneumococci isolated from mother-baby pairs in Ngora district after the rollout of the pneumococcal vaccine. We hypothesized that high carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in mothers leads to carriage in their babies and hence a greater chance of contracting pneumonia. Methods: Consecutive sampling was used to select 152 mother-baby pairs from community visits and those seeking care at the health facility. We collected nasal swabs from both baby and mother for culture and sensitivity testing using Kirby-Bauer’s agar disc diffusion method. Data was also collected from the mothers who consented to take part in the study, using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Results: This study found that there was a low prevalence of pneumococcal carriage in the mother-baby pair in the Ngora district. Only one mother-baby pair (1/152) was found to be colonized with pneumococci in both mother and baby and the rest of S. pneumoniae colonized either the mother or baby. We also observed high rates of microbial resistance to penicillin, which is the first-line drug for the management of pneumonia in Uganda. Also, high resistance patterns were recorded with chloramphenicol (50%) and tetracycline (50%), whereas the lowest resistance was recorded in clindamycin (17%). Conclusions: The relationship between pneumococcal carriage and immunization status suggests that the pneumococcal vaccine is protective against the pneumococcal carriage. Resistance of S. pneumoniae to commonly used antibiotics was high.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prospective cohort study of the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers over clinical variables in children and young people with cancer presenting with fever and neutropenia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Fever during chemotherapy induced neutropenia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of the treatment of childhood cancer. Predictions of poor outcome could be enhanced by incorporating serum biomarkers of inflammation at presentation and reassessment. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted of children under 18 years old, being treated for cancer or a cancer-like condition, who presented with fever (≥ 38.0°C) and neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5*109/L). Clinical features were recorded, along with three experimental inflammatory biomarkers: procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Outcomes included serious medical complications (SMC): any infection related mortality, critical care and organ support, severe sepsis, septic shock, significant microbiologically defined infection, or radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Results Biomarker assessments were undertaken in 43 episodes of fever and neutropenia, from 31 patients aged between four months and 17 years old (median six years): 20 were female and 22 had acute leukaemia. Five episodes of SMC were noted. PCT, IL-6 and IL-8 had poor individual discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.48 to 0.60) and did not add to the value of clinical risk stratification tools. Insufficient data were collected to formally assess the value of repeated assessments. Conclusions Incorporating serum biomarkers of inflammation at presentation of episodes of fever with neutropenia in childhood does not clearly improve risk stratification. Repeated assessments over time may be of value.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Breastfeeding assessment tools for at-risk and malnourished infants aged under 6 months old: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many small and malnourished infants under 6 months of age have problems with breastfeeding and restoring effective exclusive breastfeeding is a common treatment goal. Assessment is a critical first step of case management, but most malnutrition guidelines do not specify how best to do this. We aimed to identify breastfeeding assessment tools for use in assessing at-risk and malnourished infants in resource-poor settings. Methods: We systematically searched: Medline and Embase; Web of Knowledge; Cochrane Reviews; Eldis and Google Scholar databases. Also the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), CAse REport guidelines, Emergency Nutrition Network, and Field Exchange websites. Assessment tool content was analysed using a framework describing breastfeeding ‘domains’ (baby’s behaviour; mother’s behaviour; position; latching; effective feeding; breast health; baby’s health; mother’s view of  feed; number, timing and length of feeds). Results: We identified 29 breastfeeding assessment tools and 45 validation studies. Eight tools had not been validated. Evidence underpinning most tools was low quality and mainly from high-income countries and hospital settings. The most comprehensive tools were the Breastfeeding, Evaluation and Education Tool, UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative tools and CARE training package. The tool with the strongest evidence was the WHO/UNICEF B-R-E-A-S-T-Feed Observation Form. Conclusions: Despite many possible tools, there is currently no one gold standard. For assessing malnourished infants in resource-poor settings, UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative tools, Module IFE and the WHO/UNICEF B-R-E-A-S-T-Feed Observation Form are the best available tools but could be improved by adding questions from other tools. Allowing for context, one tool for rapid community-based assessment plus a more detailed one for clinic/hospital assessment might help optimally identify breastfeeding problems and the support required. Further research is important to refine existing tools and develop new ones. Rigorous testing, especially against outcomes such as breastfeeding status and growth, is key.

     alt="Mapping the corticoreticular pathway from cortex-wide anterograde axonal tracing in the mouse"/>
<p>The mouse corticoreticular pathway (CRP) originates from widespread parts of the cortex, including the primary motor (M1), secondary motor (M2), anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, and primary somatosensory (S1) areas. Compared with the corticospinal tract, the CRP is more distributed and bilaterally projecting, suggesting greater resilience to complete disruption.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The corticoreticular pathway (CRP) has been implicated as an important mediator of motor recovery and rehabilitation after central nervous system damage. However, its origins, trajectory and laterality are not well understood. This study mapped the mouse CRP in comparison with the corticospinal tract (CST). We systematically searched the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (© 2011 Allen Institute for Brain Science) for experiments that used anterograde tracer injections into the right isocortex in mice. For each eligible experiment (<i>N</i> = 607), CRP and CST projection strength were quantified by the tracer volume reaching the reticular formation motor nuclei (RF<sub>motor</sub>) and pyramids, respectively. Tracer density in each brain voxel was also correlated with RF<sub>motor</sub> versus pyramids projection strength to explore the relative trajectories of the CRP and CST. We found significant CRP projections originating from the primary and secondary motor cortices, anterior cingulate, primary somatosensory cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. Compared with the CST, the CRP had stronger projections from each region except the primary somatosensory cortex. Ipsilateral projections were stronger than contralateral for both tracts (above the pyramidal decussation), but the CRP projected more bilaterally than the CST. The estimated CRP trajectory was anteromedial to the CST in the internal capsule and dorsal to the CST in the brainstem. Our findings reveal a widespread distribution of CRP origins and confirm strong bilateral CRP projections, theoretically increasing the potential for partial sparing after brain lesions and contralesional compensation after unilateral injury.</p>

<p>MS had deleterious effects on a variety of assessments. EE could reverse MS-induced cognitive impairments.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early-life experiences, including parental care, affect cognitive performance later in life. Being exposed to early-life maternal separation (MS) increases susceptibility to stress-related psychopathology. Previous studies suggest that MS could induce learning and memory impairments. Since enriched environment (EE) provides more opportunities for exploration and social interaction, in the present study we evaluated the effects of a short EE paradigm with a duration of 13 days on cognitive abilities of maternally separated rats (MS; 180 min/day, postnatal day (PND) 1–21) during adolescence in four experimental groups: Control, Control+EE, MS, and MS+EE. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were also measured in experimental animals. We also studied the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the slices of hippocampal CA1 area. The behavioral and electrophysiological assessments were started at PND 35. MS caused higher basal CORT levels in plasma and impaired spatial learning, memory, and social interaction. LTP induction was also impaired in MS rats and plasma BDNF levels were reduced in these animals. MS also induced more anxiety-like behavior. Short EE reduced plasma CORT levels had the potential to improve locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior in MS+EE rats and reversed MS-induced impairments of spatial learning, memory, and social behavior. LTP induction and plasma BDNF levels were also enhanced in MS+EE rats. We concluded that short EE might be considered as a therapeutic strategy for promoting cognition.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Much evidence has proved that excitotoxicity induced by excessive release of glutamate contributes largely to damage caused by ischemia. In view of the key role played by NMDA receptors in mediating excitotoxicity, compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways have become the most promising type of anti-stroke candidate compounds. However, the limited therapeutic time window for neuroprotection is a key factor preventing NMDA receptor-related compounds from showing efficacy in all clinical trials for ischemic stroke. In this perspective, the determination of therapeutic time windows of these kinds of compounds is useful in ensuring a therapeutic effect and accelerating clinical application. This mini-review discussed the therapeutic time windows of compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways, described related influence factors and the status of clinical studies. The purpose of this review is to look for compounds with wide therapeutic time windows and better clinical application prospect.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A single synonymous nucleotide change impacts the male-killing phenotype of prophage WO gene wmk</a></h4>

              
                <i>Wolbachia</i> are the most widespread bacterial endosymbionts in animals. Within arthropods, these maternally-transmitted bacteria can selfishly hijack host reproductive processes to increase the relative fitness of their transmitting females. One such form of reproductive parasitism called male killing, or the selective killing of infected males, is recapitulated to degrees by transgenic expression of the <i>WO</i>-<i>mediated killing</i> (<i>wmk</i>) gene. Here, we characterize the genotype-phenotype landscape of <i>wmk-</i>induced male killing in <i>D. melanogaster </i>using transgenic expression. While phylogenetically distant <i>wmk</i> homologs induce no sex-ratio bias, closely-related homologs exhibit complex phenotypes spanning no death, male death, or death of all hosts. We demonstrate that alternative start codons, synonymous codons, and notably a single synonymous nucleotide in <i>wmk </i>can ablate killing. These findings reveal previously unrecognized features of transgenic <i>wmk</i>-induced killing and establish new hypotheses for the impacts of post-transcriptional processes in male killing variation. We conclude that synonymous sequence changes are not necessarily silent in nested endosymbiotic interactions with life-or-death consequences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">mTORC1-induced retinal progenitor cell overproliferation leads to accelerated mitotic aging and degeneration of descendent Müller glia</a></h4>

              
                Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) divide in limited numbers to generate the cells comprising vertebrate retina. The molecular mechanism that leads RPC to the division limit, however, remains elusive. Here, we find that the hyperactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in an RPC subset by deletion of <i>tuberous sclerosis complex 1 </i>(<i>Tsc1</i>) makes the RPCs arrive at the division limit precociously and produce Müller glia (MG) that degenerate from senescence-associated cell death. We further show the hyperproliferation of <i>Tsc1</i>-deficient RPCs and the degeneration of MG in the mouse retina disappear by concomitant deletion of <i>hypoxia-induced factor 1-</i><i>a</i> (<i>Hif1</i><i>a</i>), which induces glycolytic gene expression to support mTORC1-induced RPC proliferation. Collectively, our results suggest that, by having mTORC1 constitutively active, an RPC divides and exhausts mitotic capacity faster than neighboring RPCs, and thus produces retinal cells that degenerate with aging-related changes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intestinal goblet cells sample and deliver lumenal antigens by regulated endocytic uptake and transcytosis</a></h4>

              
                Intestinal goblet cells maintain the protective epithelial barrier through mucus secretion and yet sample lumenal substances for immune processing through formation of goblet cell associated antigen passages (GAPs). The cellular biology of GAPs and how these divergent processes are balanced and regulated by goblet cells remains unknown. Using high resolution light and electron microscopy, we found that in mice, GAPs were formed by an acetylcholine (ACh) dependent endocytic event remarkable for delivery of fluid phase cargo retrograde into the trans golgi network and across the cell by transcytosis - in addition to the expected transport of fluid phase cargo by endosomes to multi-vesicular bodies and lysosomes. While ACh also induced goblet cells to secrete mucins, ACh-induced GAP formation and mucin secretion were functionally independent and mediated by different receptors and signaling pathways, enabling goblet cells to differentially regulate these processes to accommodate the dynamically changing demands of the mucosal environment for barrier maintenance and sampling of lumenal substances.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Physical observables to determine the nature of membrane-less cellular sub-compartments</a></h4>

              
                The spatial organization of complex biochemical reactions is essential for the regulation of cellular processes. Membrane-less structures called foci containing high concentrations of specific proteins have been reported in a variety of contexts, but the mechanism of their formation is not fully understood. Several competing mechanisms exist that are difficult to distinguish empirically, including liquid-liquid phase separation, and the trapping of molecules by multiple binding sites. Here we propose a theoretical framework and outline observables to differentiate between these scenarios from single molecule tracking experiments. In the binding site model, we derive relations between the distribution of proteins, their diffusion properties, and their radial displacement. We predict that protein search times can be reduced for targets inside a liquid droplet, but not in an aggregate of slowly moving binding sites. We use our results to reject the multiple binding site model for Rad52 foci, and find a picture consistent with a liquid-liquid phase separation. These results are applicable to future experiments and suggest different biological roles for liquid droplet and binding site foci.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular reconstruction of recurrent evolutionary switching in olfactory receptor specificity</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory receptor repertoires exhibit remarkable functional diversity, but how these proteins have evolved is poorly understood. Through analysis of extant and ancestrally-reconstructed drosophilid olfactory receptors from the Ionotropic receptor (Ir) family, we investigated evolution of two organic acid-sensing receptors, Ir75a and Ir75b. Despite their low amino acid identity, we identify a common 'hotspot' in their ligand-binding pocket that has a major effect on changing the specificity of both Irs, as well as at least two distinct functional transitions in Ir75a during evolution. Moreover, we show that odor specificity is refined by changes in additional, receptor-specific sites, including those outside the ligand-binding pocket. Our work reveals how a core, common determinant of ligand-tuning acts within epistatic and allosteric networks of substitutions to lead to functional evolution of olfactory receptors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Short-chain fatty acids activate acetyltransferase p300</a></h4>

              
                Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate, and butyrate are produced in large quantities by the gut microbiome and contribute to a wide array of physiological processes. While the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, many effects of SCFAs have been traced to changes in the cell’s epigenetic state. Here, we systematically investigate how SCFAs alter the epigenome. Using quantitative proteomics of histone modification states, we identified rapid and sustained increases in histone acetylation after addition of butyrate or propionate, but not acetate. While decades of prior observations would have suggested that hyperacetylation induced by SCFAs are attributed to inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), we found that propionate and butyrate instead activate the acetyltransferase p300. Propionate and butyrate are rapidly converted to the corresponding acyl-CoAs which are then used by p300 to catalyze auto-acylation of the autoinhibitory loop, activating the enzyme for histone/protein acetylation. This data challenges the long-held belief that SCFAs mainly regulate chromatin by inhibiting HDACs, and instead reveals a previously unknown mechanism of HAT activation that can explain how an influx of low levels of SCFAs alters global chromatin states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">De novo motor learning of a bimanual control task over multiple days of practice</a></h4>

              
                Although much research on motor learning has focused on how we adapt our movements to maintain performance in the face of imposed perturbations, in many cases we must learn new skills from scratch, or de novo. In comparison to adaptation, relatively little is known about de novo learning. In part, this is because learning a new skill can involve many challenges, including learning to recognize new patterns of sensory input and generate new patterns of motor output. However, even with familiar sensory cues and well-practiced movements, the problem of quickly selecting the appropriate actions in response to the current state is challenging. Here, we devised a bimanual hand-to-cursor mapping which isolates this control problem. We find that participants' initially struggled to control the cursor under this bimanual mapping, despite explicit knowledge of the mapping. Performance improved steadily over multiple days of practice, however. Participants exhibited no aftereffects when reverting to a veridical cursor, confirming that participant's learned the new task de novo, rather than through adaptation. Corrective responses to mid-movement perturbations of the target were initially weak, but, with practice participants gradually became able to respond rapidly and robustly to these perturbations. After four days of practice, participants' behavior under the bimanual mapping almost matched performance with a veridically mapped cursor. However, there remained a small but persistent difference in performance level. Our findings illustrate the dynamics and limitations of learning a novel controller and introduce a promising paradigm for tractably investigating this aspect of motor skill learning.

                A topographic map of auditory space is a feature found in the superior colliculus (SC) of many species, including CBA/CaJ mice. In this genetic background, high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural level differences are used to generate spatial receptive fields (RFs) that form a topographic map along the azimuth. Unfortunately, C57BL/6 mice, a strain widely used for transgenic manipulation, display age-related hearing loss (AHL) due to an inbred mutation in the Cadherin 23 gene (Cdh23) that affects hair cell mechanotransduction. To overcome this problem, researchers have used young C57BL/6 mice in their studies, as they have been shown to have normal hearing thresholds. However, important details of the auditory response characteristics of the SC such as spectral responses and spatial localization, have not been characterized in young C57BL/6 mice. Here we show that 2-4-month C57BL/6 mice lack neurons with frontal auditory RFs and therefore lack a topographic representation of auditory space in the SC. Analysis of the spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) of the SC auditory neurons shows that C57BL/6 mouse SC neurons lack the ability to detect the high-frequency(>40kHz) spectral cues that are needed to compute frontal RFs. We also show that crossing C57BL/6 mice with CBA/CaJ mice or introducing one copy of the wild-type Cdh23 to C57BL/6 mice rescues the high-frequency hearing deficit and improves the topographic map of auditory space. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of high-frequency hearing in computing a topographic map of auditory space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Use-dependent biases primarily originate from a contaminated motor plan</a></h4>

              
                Repetition of a specific movement biases subsequent actions towards the recently practiced movement, a phenomenon referred to as use-dependent learning (UDL). UDL has been attributed to shifts in the tuning of neurons in the motor cortex. However, recent studies employing a forced reaction time task, including the eLife article by Marinovic et al (2017), indicate that these biases may also arise from a contaminated motor plan, one that is biased towards the practiced direction. We advanced this line of inquiry, seeking to establish the relative contribution of execution and planning processes to UDL in a center-out reaching task in which participants were able to initiate movements of their own volition. On most trials, the target appeared at a designated frequent location; on other trials, the target appeared at one of six rare locations. In Experiment 1, participants exhibited a robust movement bias towards the frequent target when movements were self-initiated quickly, but a small movement bias when movements were self-initiated slowly - the signature of a contaminated motor plan. Strikingly, the heading angles were bimodally distributed, with one peak at the frequent target location and the other at the rare target location - a finding reinforced by a re-analysis of two widely cited studies on UDL. Notably, the latter peak was shifted in the frequently practiced direction, a signature of a motor execution bias. To eliminate the contribution of planning-related UDL, we imposed a delay between target onset and movement initiation in Experiment 2. As predicted, the heading angles became unimodally distributed around the rare target. The peak of this distribution was again shifted towards the location of the frequent target, indicative of a persistent bias in motor execution. Taken together, these results highlight two distinct components of UDL even when movements are self-initiated: First, the temporal dynamics underlying movement planning, in which a default plan is progressively overridden by a new plan, produces a pronounced motor planning bias. Second, there is a small, temporally stable bias that may reflect shifts in motor unit tuning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The human frontal operculum is involved in visuomotor performance monitoring</a></h4>

              
                For adaptive goal-directed action, the brain needs to monitor action performance and detect errors. The corresponding information may be conveyed via different sensory modalities; for instance, visual and proprioceptive body position cues may inform about current manual action performance. Thereby, contextual factors such as the current task set may also determine the relative importance of each sensory modality for action guidance. Here, we analysed human behavioral, fMRI, and MEG data from two VR-based hand-target phase matching studies to identify the neuronal correlates of performance monitoring and error processing under instructed visual or proprioceptive task sets. Our main result was a general, modality-independent response of the bilateral FO to poor phase matching accuracy, as evident from increased BOLD signal and increased gamma power. Furthermore, functional connectivity of the bilateral FO to the right PPC increased under a visual vs proprioceptive task set. These findings suggest that the bilateral FO generally monitors manual action performance; and, moreover, that when visual action feedback is used to guide action, the FO may signal an increased need for control to visuomotor regions in the right PPC following errors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and protective antiviral immunity by MRI</a></h4>

              
                Central nervous system (CNS) infections are a major cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Even patients that survive CNS infections can have lasting neurological dysfunction resulting from immune and pathogen induced pathology. Developing approaches to noninvasively track pathology and immunity in the infected CNS is crucial for patient management and development of new therapeutics. Here, we develop novel MRI-based approaches to monitor virus-specific CD8+ T cells and their relationship to cerebrovascular pathology in the living brain. We studied a relevant murine model in which a neurotropic virus (vesicular stomatitis virus) was introduced intranasally and then entered the brain via olfactory sensory neurons - a route exploited by many pathogens in humans. Using T2*-weighted high-resolution MRI, we identified small cerebral microbleeds as the earliest form of pathology associated with viral entry into the brain. Mechanistically, these microbleeds occurred in the absence of peripheral immune cells and were associated with infection of vascular endothelial cells. We monitored the adaptive response to this infection by developing methods to iron label and track individual virus specific CD8+ T cells by MRI. Transferred antiviral T cells were detected in the brain within a day of infection and were able to reduce cerebral microbleeds. These data demonstrate the utility of MRI in detecting the earliest pathological events in the virally infected CNS as well as the therapeutic potential of antiviral T cells in mitigating this pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic reduction of the dimensionality of natural scenes allows accurate predictions of retinal ganglion cell spike outputs.</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian retina engages a broad array of linear and nonlinear circuit mechanisms to convert natural scenes into retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spike outputs. Although many individual integration mechanisms are well understood, predictive models of natural scene encoding perform poorly, likely due to interactions among the active mechanisms. Here, we identified spatial integration mechanisms relevant for natural scene encoding and used computational modeling to predict spike outputs in primate parasol RGCs. Our approach was to simplify the structure of natural scenes and empirically ask whether these changes were reflected in RGC spike responses. We observed that reducing natural movies to 16 linearly integrated regions described ~80% of the structure of parasol RGC spike responses. We then used simplified stimuli to create high-dimensional metamers that recapitulated the spike response of full-field naturalistic movies. Finally, we identified the retinal computations that convert natural images in 16-dimensional space into 1-dimensional spike outputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Readers move their eyes mindlessly using midbrain visuo-motor principles</a></h4>

              
                Saccadic eye movements rapidly shift our gaze over 100,000 times daily, enabling countless tasks ranging from driving to reading. Long regarded as a window to the mind and human information processing, they are thought to be cortically/cognitively controlled movements aimed at objects/words of interest. Saccades however involve a complex cerebral network wherein the contribution of phylogenetically older sensory-motor pathways remains unclear. Here we show using a neuro-computational approach that mindless visuo-motor computations, akin to reflexive orienting responses in neonates and vertebrates with little neocortex, guide humans' eye movements in a quintessentially cognitive task, reading. These computations occur in the superior colliculus, an ancestral midbrain structure, that integrates retinal and (sub)cortical afferent signals over retinotopically organized, and size-invariant, neuronal populations. Simply considering retinal and primary-visual-cortex afferents, which convey the distribution of luminance contrast over sentences (visual-saliency map), we find that collicular population-averaging principles capture readers' prototypical word-based oculomotor behavior, leaving essentially rereading behavior unexplained. These principles reveal that inter-word spacing is unnecessary, explaining metadata across languages and writing systems using only print size as a predictor. Our findings demonstrate that saccades, rather than being a window into cognitive/linguistic processes, primarily reflect rudimentary visuo-motor mechanisms in the midbrain that survived brain-evolution pressure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in-vivo digital atlas of the spatially reliable cerebral vasculature in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral vascular abnormalities can have a large impact on brain function and have been frequently detected as a comorbidity in various neuropathologies. The mouse is the most common pre-clinical animal model used to investigate neuropathologies and thus cerebral vascular atlases of this species are indispensable. In particular, an atlas derived from multiple animals and that can address inter-subject variability is still absent. The current study presents a mouse cerebral vascular atlas developed from MR 2D-TOF angiograms acquired from a relatively high number (N=21) of 12 weeks old male C57BL/6 mice. The vascular atlas we present depicts large arteries, veins and sinuses that are more spatially reliable across animals than smaller vessels. The atlas is available for download and contains multiple datasets: i) a cerebral vascular atlas; ii) a digital segmentation of large vessels (arteries and veins); iii) a high resolution T2 anatomical background aligned to the atlas; iv) a skeletonized vascular atlas; and v) a vascular graph model. We suggest that these components provide a very potent analysis tool for mouse fMRI data and that the atlas can be used as a template for multimodal brain imaging studies. To this end, we also demonstrate an explicit application of the atlas for the investigation of vascular influences in resting-state fMRI.

                Obesity, defined as an excess of adipose tissue that adversely affects health, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. However, understanding the structure and function of human adipose tissue has been limited by the inability to visualize cellular components due to the innate structure of adipocytes, which are characterized by large lipid droplets. Combining the iDISCO and the CUBIC protocols for whole tissue staining and optical clearing, we developed a protocol to enable immunostaining and clearing of human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) obtained from individuals with severe obesity. We were able to perform immunolabeling of sympathetic nerve terminals in whole white adipose tissue and subsequent optical clearing by eliminating lipids to render the opaque tissue completely transparent. We then used light sheet confocal microscopy to visualize innervation of human WAT from obese individuals in a 3D manner. We demonstrate the visualization of sympathetic nerve terminals in human WAT. This protocol can be modified to visualize other structures such as blood vessels involved in the development, maintenance and function of human adipose tissue in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The 2D Ising model, criticality and AIT</a></h4>

              
                In this short note we study the 2D Ising model, a universal computational model which reflects phase transitions and critical phenomena, as a framework for establishing links between systems that exhibit criticality with the notions of complexity. This is motivated in the context of neuroscience applications stemming from algorithmic information theory (AIT). Starting with the original 2D Ising model, we show that --- together with correlation length of the spin lattice, susceptibility to a uniform external field --- the correlation time of the magnetization time series, the compression ratio of the spin lattice, the complexity of the magnetization time series --- as derived from Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression---, and the rate of information transmission in the lattice, all reflect the effects of the phase transition, which results in spacetime pockets of uniform magnetization at all scales. We also show that in the Ising model the insertion of sparse long-range couplings has a direct effect on the critical temperature and other parameters. The addition of positive links extends the ordered regime to higher critical temperatures, while negative links have a stronger, disordering influence at the global scale. We discuss some implications for the study of long-range (e.g., ephaptic) interactions in the human brain and the effects of weak perturbations in neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning the statistics of pain: computational and neural mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Pain invariably changes over time, and these temporal fluctuations are riddled with uncertainty about body safety. In theory, statistical regularities of pain through time contain useful information that can be learned, allowing the brain to generate expectations and inform behaviour. To investigate this, we exposed healthy participants to probabilistic sequences of low and high-intensity electrical stimuli to the left hand, containing sudden changes in stimulus frequencies. We demonstrate that humans can learn to extract these regularities, and explicitly predict the likelihood of forthcoming pain intensities in a manner consistent with optimal Bayesian models with dynamic update of beliefs. We studied brain activity using functional MRI whilst subjects performed the task, which allowed us to dissect the underlying neural correlates of these statistical inferences from their uncertainty and update. We found that the inferred frequency (posterior probability) of high intensity pain correlated with activity in bilateral sensorimotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex and right caudate. The uncertainty of statistical inferences of pain was encoded in the right superior parietal cortex. An intrinsic part of this hierarchical Bayesian model is the way that unexpected changes in frequency lead to shift beliefs and update the internal model. This is reflected by the KL divergence between consecutive posterior distributions and associated with brain responses in the premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior parietal cortex. In conclusion, this study extends what is conventionally considered a sensory pain pathway dedicated to process pain intensity, to include the generation of Bayesian internal models of temporal statistics of pain intensity levels in sensorimotor regions, which are updated dynamically through the engagement of premotor, prefrontal and parietal regions.

                The spike collision test is a highly reliable technique to identify axonal projection of a neuron recorded electrophysiologically for investigating functional spike information among brain areas. It is potentially applicable to more neuronal projections by combining multi-channel recording with optogenetic stimulation. Yet, it remains inefficient and laborious because an experimenter must visually select spikes in every channel and manually repeat spike collision tests for each neuron serially. Here, we established a novel technique to automatically perform spike collision tests for all channels in parallel (Multi-Linc analysis), employing two distinct protocols implemented in a multi-channel real-time processing system. The rat cortical neurons identified with this technique displayed physiological spike features consistent with excitatory projection neurons. Their antidromic spikes were similar in shape but slightly larger in amplitude compared with spontaneous spikes. In addition, we demonstrated simultaneous identification of reciprocal or bifurcating projections among cortical areas. Thus, our Multi-Linc analysis will be a powerful research approach to elucidate interareal spike communication.

                Background: The lateral septum (LS) is a critical social behavior node. The LS is activated by social novelty, and perturbing LS activity impairs social recognition. However, the neural circuits and cell signaling pathways that converge on the LS to mediate this behavior aren't known. We identify brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in projection neurons from the basolateral amgydala (BLA) to the LS, and tropomyosin kinase B receptor (TrkB) signaling in LS neurons, as required for social novelty recognition. Methods: We used single-molecule fluorescent in-situ hybridization to quantify Ntrk2 expression in LS. Viral transgenesis was used to induce cre-recombinase mediated TrkB knockdown in LS to evaluate impact on social recognition behavior, and social novelty-induced c-Fos expression in the LS. We used viral approaches for projection-specific ablation and BDNF-depletion in BLA-LS projection neurons to assess the role of this circuit in social recognition behavior. Results: The majority of GABAergic neurons in LS express TrkB. TrkB knockdown in LS abolishes social novelty recognition, and decreases LS activation in response to social novelty. Selectively ablating BLA-LS projection neurons abolishes social novelty recognition behavior, an effect that is phenocopied by depleting BDNF in this circuit. Conclusions: BLA-LS projection neurons depend on BDNF expression to regulate social recognition in the mouse. Within the LS, neurons require intact TrkB receptor signaling to mediate this behavior.

	<p>Ecstatic epilepsy is a rare form of focal epilepsy in which the aura (beginning of the seizures) consists of a blissful state of mental clarity/feeling of certainty. Such a state has also been described as a “religious” or mystical experience. While this form of epilepsy has long been recognized as a temporal lobe epilepsy, we have accumulated evidence converging toward the location of the symptomatogenic zone in the dorsal anterior insula during the 10 last years. The neurocognitive hypothesis for the genesis of a mental clarity is the suppression of the interoceptive prediction errors and of the unexpected surprise associated with any incoming internal or external signal, usually processed by the dorsal anterior insula. This mimics a perfect prediction of the world and induces a feeling of certainty. The ecstatic epilepsy is thus an amazing model for the role of anterior insula in uncertainty and surprise.</p>

	<p>Background: Stroke is the leading cause of cortical deafness (CD), the most severe form of central hearing impairment. CD remains poorly characterized and perhaps underdiagnosed. We perform a systematic review to describe the clinical and radiological features of stroke-associated CD. Methods: PubMed and the Web of Science databases were used to identify relevant publications up to 30 June 2021 using the MeSH terms: “deafness” and “stroke”, or “hearing loss” and “stroke” or “auditory agnosia” and “stroke”. Results: We found 46 cases, caused by bilateral lesions within the central auditory pathway, mostly located within or surrounding the superior temporal lobe gyri and/or the Heschl’s gyri (30/81%). In five (13.51%) patients, CD was caused by the subcortical hemispheric and in two (0.05%) in brainstem lesions. Sensorineural hearing loss was universal. Occasionally, a misdiagnosis by peripheral or psychiatric disorders occurred. A few (20%) had clinical improvement, with a regained oral conversation or evolution to pure word deafness (36.6%). A persistent inability of oral communication occurred in 43.3%. A full recovery of conversation was restricted to patients with subcortical lesions. Conclusions: Stroke-associated CD is rare, severe and results from combinations of cortical and subcortical lesions within the central auditory pathway. The recovery of functional hearing occurs, essentially, when caused by subcortical lesions.</p>

	<p>I have reviewed studies on neural responses to pictured actions in the action observation network (AON) and the cognitive functions of these responses. Based on this review, I have analyzed the specific representational characteristics of action photographs. There has been consensus that AON responses provide viewers with knowledge of observed or pictured actions, but there has been controversy about the properties of this knowledge. Is this knowledge causally provided by AON activities or is it dependent on conceptual processing? What elements of actions does it refer to, and how generalized or specific is it? The answers to these questions have come from studies that used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to stimulate motor or somatosensory cortices. In conjunction with electromyography (EMG), TMS allows researchers to examine changes of the excitability in the corticospinal tract and muscles of people viewing pictured actions. The timing of these changes and muscle specificity enable inferences to be drawn about the cognitive products of processing pictured actions in the AON. Based on a review of studies using TMS and other neuroscience methods, I have proposed a novel hypothetical account that describes the characteristics of action photographs that make them effective cues to social perception. This account includes predictions that can be tested experimentally.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic had imposed a variety of containment measures on the general population for prolonged periods. Confinement has had, and still has, social, economic, educational, health, and psychological consequences on the entire population. Objective: In this article, a systematic search has been performed based on studies carried out since the beginning of the pandemic, regarding the impact of these containment measures on the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population and their caregivers. Method: We consulted six databases (i.e., PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct) and selected ten studies that met the inclusion criteria. The chosen studies have been classified according to their theoretical focus, methodology, and target population. Results: We found an increase in stress and a decrease in psychological well-being among individuals diagnosed with ASD (i.e., parents and caregivers). Additionally, in studies focused on children, youth, and adults with ASD diagnosis, the results are contradictory depending on variables such as age, ASD severity, or type of family structure. Conclusions: The results show that the consequences of quarantine and social confinement are quite contradictory and depend on variables such as age, ASD severity, and family features.</p>

	<p>Accumulating evidence shows that brain functional deficits may be impacted by damage to remote brain regions. Recent advances in neuroimaging suggest that stroke impairment can be better predicted based on disruption to brain networks rather than from lesion locations or volumes only. Our aim was to explore the feasibility of predicting post-stroke somatosensory function from brain functional connectivity through the application of machine learning techniques. Somatosensory impairment was measured using the Tactile Discrimination Test. Functional connectivity was employed to model the global brain function. Behavioral measures and MRI were collected at the same timepoint. Two machine learning models (linear regression and support vector regression) were chosen to predict somatosensory impairment from disrupted networks. Along with two feature pools (i.e., low-order and high-order functional connectivity, or low-order functional connectivity only) engineered, four predictive models were built and evaluated in the present study. Forty-three chronic stroke survivors participated this study. Results showed that the regression model employing both low-order and high-order functional connectivity can predict outcomes based on correlation coefficient of r = 0.54 (p = 0.0002). A machine learning predictive approach, involving high- and low-order modelling, is feasible for the prediction of residual somatosensory function in stroke patients using functional brain networks.</p>

	<p>Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is a rare autoimmune illness characterized by a constellation of often severe, but treatable, psychiatric and neurological symptoms. Whereas symptoms such as psychosis and bizarre and abnormal motor behavior are common in adults, pediatric patients typically present with behavioral changes, irritability and sleep dysfunction. The recovery phase is usually slow and may be associated with longstanding adaptive, behavioral and neuropsychological problems. Very few studies explored the cognitive and adaptive sequelae in children with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The present review article suggests that, although most children and adolescents return to their daily life and previous activities, they may have a low quality of life and show neuropsychological sequelae involving language, memory, especially verbal memory, and attentional resources, even after several months from the hospital discharge. In particular, the available results reveal difficulties in cognitive skills involving executive functions. This impairment is considered the “core” of the cognitive profile of young patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. On the other hand, some cognitive skills, such as general intelligence, show good overall recovery over time. Additional neuropsychological research evaluating larger samples, more homogenous methods and longitudinal studies is required.</p>

	<p>Neuropsychiatric disorders are found to be associated with bullous pemphigoid (BP), an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease. Antipsychotics have emerged as possible inducing factors of BP. However, large sample studies concerning BP associated with antipsychotics, as well as with specific mental disorders, are still lacking. Our review retrieved a few clinical studies and case reports on the topic, producing controversial results. We report for the first time a bipolar patient case presenting BP following five-month therapy with risperidone long-acting injectable (LAI). We hypothesize that the dermatological event is associated with the medication administered. The issue emerged during psychiatric consultation and was confirmed by histological examination, direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies, plus positive plasma and cutaneous BP180 and BP230 IgG. Neurodegeneration or neuroinflammation might represent a primary process leading to a cross-reactive immune response between neural and cutaneous antigens and contributing to self-tolerance failure. Furthermore, the time sequence of the shared biological mechanisms leading to clinical manifestations of the neuropsychiatric disorder and BP remains undefined. BP comorbid with bipolar disorder might occasionally represent a serious health risk and affect patients’ physical and psychosocial quality of life. Thus, clinicians treating psychiatric patients should consider BP as a possible adverse effect of psychotropic medications.</p>

                <p>Detection of an unexpected, novel, or salient stimulus typically leads to an orienting response by which animals move the head, in concert with the sensors (e.g., eyes, pinna, whiskers), to evaluate the stimulus. The basal ganglia are known to control orienting movements through tonically active GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) that project to the superior colliculus. Using optogenetics, we explored the ability of GABAergic SNr neurons on one side of the brain to generate orienting movements. In a strain of mice that express channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in both SNr GABAergic neurons and afferent fibers, we found that continuous blue light produced a robust sustained excitation of SNr neurons which generated ipsiversive orienting. Conversely, in the same animal, trains of blue light excited afferent fibers more effectively than continuous blue light, producing a robust sustained inhibition of SNr neurons which generated contraversive orienting. When ChR2 expression was restricted to either GABAergic SNr neurons or GABAergic afferent fibers from the striatum, blue light patterns in SNr produced only ipsiversive or contraversive orienting movements, respectively. Interestingly, whisker positioning and the reaction to an air-puff on the whiskers were incongruent between SNr-evoked ipsiversive and contraversive head movements, indicating that orienting driven by exciting or inhibiting SNr neurons have different behavioral significance. In conclusion, unilateral SNr neuron excitation and inhibition produce orienting movements in opposite directions and, apparently, with distinct behavioral significance.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Atypical sensory processing is currently included within the diagnostic criteria of autism. The cerebellum is known to integrate sensory inputs of different modalities through its connectivity to the cerebral cortex. Interestingly, cerebellar malformations are among the most replicated features found in postmortem brain of individuals with autism. We studied sensory processing in the cerebellum in a mouse model of autism, knock-out (KO) for the <I>Cntnap2</I> gene. <I>Cntnap2</I> is widely expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) and has been recently reported to regulate their morphology. Further, individuals with <I>CNTNAP2</I> mutations display cerebellar malformations and CNTNAP2 antibodies are associated with a mild form of cerebellar ataxia. Previous studies in the <I>Cntnap2</I> mouse model show an altered cerebellar sensory learning. However, a physiological analysis of cerebellar function has not been performed yet. We studied sensory evoked potentials in cerebellar Crus I/II region on electrical stimulation of the whisker pad in alert mice and found striking differences between wild-type and <I>Cntnap2</I> KO mice. In addition, single-cell recordings identified alterations in both sensory-evoked and spontaneous firing patterns of PCs. These changes were accompanied by altered intrinsic properties and morphologic features of these neurons. Together, these results indicate that the <I>Cntnap2</I> mouse model could provide novel insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of autism core sensory deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence study of intermittent hormonal therapy of Prostate Cancer patients in Spain [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Although intermittent androgen deprivation therapy was introduced many years ago to improve patients’ quality of life with the same carcinologic efficiency as continuous hormonal therapy, recent data suggest that those patients could be overtreated. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of prostate cancer patients receiving intermittent androgen deprivation therapy in Spain. Methods: A retrospective, longitudinal study was conducted using electronic drug dispensation data from four Spanish autonomous communities, which encompass 17.23 million inhabitants (36.22% of the total population in Spain). We estimated intermittent androgen therapy use (%IAD) and the prevalence of patients under intermittent androgen therapy (PIAD) overall and stratified by region. Other outcome variables included the pharmaceutical forms dispensed and the total direct annual expenditure on androgen deprivation therapy‐associated medications. Results: A total of 863,005 dispensations corresponding to a total of 65,752 men were identified, treated with either luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues (353,162) administered alone or in combination with anti‐androgens (509,843). Overall, the mean (±SD) age of the patients was 76.9 (±10.4) years. Results revealed that the mean annual PIAD along the study was 6.6% in the total population studied, and the overall %IAD during the five‐year study period was 5.6%. The mean cost of hormonal therapy per year was 25 million euros for LHRH analogues and 6.3 million euros for anti-androgens. Conclusions:  An important proportion of prostate cancer patients in Spain could benefit from intermittent androgen therapy during the study period while avoiding overtreatment harms associated with continuous hormonal therapy.

                <p>by Arjun Chandrasekhar, James A. R. Marshall, Cortnea Austin, Saket Navlakha, Deborah M. Gordon</p>

Creating a routing backbone is a fundamental problem in both biology and engineering. The routing backbone of the trail networks of arboreal turtle ants (<i>Cephalotes goniodontus</i>) connects many nests and food sources using trail pheromone deposited by ants as they walk. Unlike species that forage on the ground, the trail networks of arboreal ants are constrained by the vegetation. We examined what objectives the trail networks meet by comparing the observed ant trail networks with networks of random, hypothetical trail networks in the same surrounding vegetation and with trails optimized for four objectives: minimizing path length, minimizing average edge length, minimizing number of nodes, and minimizing opportunities to get lost. The ants’ trails minimized path length by minimizing the number of nodes traversed rather than choosing short edges. In addition, the ants’ trails reduced the opportunity for ants to get lost at each node, favoring nodes with 3D configurations most likely to be reinforced by pheromone. Thus, rather than finding the shortest edges, turtle ant trail networks take advantage of natural variation in the environment to favor coherence, keeping the ants together on the trails.

                <p>by Ruth Johnson, Kathryn S. Burch, Kangcheng Hou, Mario Paciuc, Bogdan Pasaniuc, Sriram Sankararaman</p>

The number of variants that have a non-zero effect on a trait (<i>i.e</i>. polygenicity) is a fundamental parameter in the study of the genetic architecture of a complex trait. Although many previous studies have investigated polygenicity at a genome-wide scale, a detailed understanding of how polygenicity varies across genomic regions is currently lacking. In this work, we propose an accurate and scalable statistical framework to estimate regional polygenicity for a complex trait. We show that our approach yields approximately unbiased estimates of regional polygenicity in simulations across a wide-range of various genetic architectures. We then partition the polygenicity of anthropometric and blood pressure traits across 6-Mb genomic regions (<i>N</i> = 290K, UK Biobank) and observe that all analyzed traits are highly polygenic: over one-third of regions harbor at least one causal variant for each of the traits analyzed. Additionally, we observe wide variation in regional polygenicity: on average across all traits, 48.9% of regions contain at least 5 causal SNPs, 5.44% of regions contain at least 50 causal SNPs. Finally, we find that heritability is proportional to polygenicity at the regional level, which is consistent with the hypothesis that heritability enrichments are largely driven by the variation in the number of causal SNPs.

The ever increasing applications of bioinformatics in providing effective interpretation of large and complex biological data require expertise in the use of sophisticated computational tools and advanced statistical tests, skills that are mostly lacking in the Sudanese research community. This can be attributed to paucity in the development and promotion of bioinformatics, lack of senior bioinformaticians, and the general status quo of inadequate research funding in Sudan. In this paper, we describe the challenges that have encountered the development of bioinformatics as a discipline in Sudan. Additionally, we highlight on specific actions that may help develop and promote its education and training. The paper takes the National University Biomedical Research Institute (NUBRI) as an example of an institute that has tackled many of these challenges and strives to drive powerful efforts in the development of bioinformatics in the country.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comprehensive discovery of CRISPR-targeted terminally redundant sequences in the human gut metagenome: Viruses, plasmids, and more</a></h4>

Viruses are the most numerous biological entity, existing in all environments and infecting all cellular organisms. Compared with cellular life, the evolution and origin of viruses are poorly understood; viruses are enormously diverse, and most lack sequence similarity to cellular genes. To uncover viral sequences without relying on either reference viral sequences from databases or marker genes that characterize specific viral taxa, we developed an analysis pipeline for virus inference based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). CRISPR is a prokaryotic nucleic acid restriction system that stores the memory of previous exposure. Our protocol can infer CRISPR-targeted sequences, including viruses, plasmids, and previously uncharacterized elements, and predict their hosts using unassembled short-read metagenomic sequencing data. By analyzing human gut metagenomic data, we extracted 11,391 terminally redundant CRISPR-targeted sequences, which are likely complete circular genomes. The sequences included 2,154 tailed-phage genomes, together with 257 complete crAssphage genomes, 11 genomes larger than 200 kilobases, 766 genomes of <i>Microviridae</i> species, 56 genomes of <i>Inoviridae</i> species, and 95 previously uncharacterized circular small genomes that have no reliably predicted protein-coding gene. We predicted the host(s) of approximately 70% of the discovered genomes at the taxonomic level of phylum by linking protospacers to taxonomically assigned CRISPR direct repeats. These results demonstrate that our protocol is efficient for <i>de novo</i> inference of CRISPR-targeted sequences and their host prediction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pinging the brain with visual impulses reveals electrically active, not activity-silent, working memories</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joao Barbosa, Diego Lozano-Soldevilla, Albert Compte</p>

Persistently active neurons during mnemonic periods have been regarded as the mechanism underlying working memory maintenance. Alternatively, neuronal networks could instead store memories in fast synaptic changes, thus avoiding the biological cost of maintaining an active code through persistent neuronal firing. Such “activity-silent” codes have been proposed for specific conditions in which memories are maintained in a nonprioritized state, as for unattended but still relevant short-term memories. A hallmark of this “activity-silent” code is that these memories can be reactivated from silent, synaptic traces. Evidence for “activity-silent” working memory storage has come from human electroencephalography (EEG), in particular from the emergence of decodability (EEG reactivations) induced by visual impulses (termed pinging) during otherwise “silent” periods. Here, we reanalyze EEG data from such pinging studies. We find that the originally reported absence of memory decoding reflects weak statistical power, as decoding is possible based on more powered analyses or reanalysis using alpha power instead of raw voltage. This reveals that visual pinging EEG “reactivations” occur in the presence of an electrically active, not silent, code for unattended memories in these data. This crucial change in the evidence provided by this dataset prompts a reinterpretation of the mechanisms of EEG reactivations. We provide 2 possible explanations backed by computational models, and we discuss the relationship with TMS-induced EEG reactivations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Plasmodium NOT1-G paralogue is an essential regulator of sexual stage maturation and parasite transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin J. Hart, B. Joanne Power, Kelly T. Rios, Aswathy Sebastian, Scott E. Lindner</p>

Productive transmission of malaria parasites hinges upon the execution of key transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory events. While much is now known about how specific transcription factors activate or repress sexual commitment programs, far less is known about the production of a preferred mRNA homeostasis following commitment and through the host-to-vector transmission event. Here, we show that in <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites, the NOT1 scaffold protein of the CAF1/CCR4/Not complex is duplicated, and one paralogue is dedicated for essential transmission functions. Moreover, this NOT1-G paralogue is central to the sex-specific functions previously associated with its interacting partners, as deletion of <i>not1-g</i> in <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> leads to a comparable or complete arrest phenotype for both male and female parasites. We show that, consistent with its role in other eukaryotes, PyNOT1-G localizes to cytosolic puncta throughout much of the <i>Plasmodium</i> life cycle. PyNOT1-G is essential to both the complete maturation of male gametes and to the continued development of the fertilized zygote originating from female parasites. Comparative transcriptomics of wild-type and <i>pynot1-g</i><sup>−</sup> parasites shows that loss of PyNOT1-G leads to transcript dysregulation preceding and during gametocytogenesis and shows that PyNOT1-G acts to preserve mRNAs that are critical to sexual and early mosquito stage development. Finally, we demonstrate that the tristetraprolin (TTP)-binding domain, which acts as the typical organization platform for RNA decay (TTP) and RNA preservation (ELAV/HuR) factors is dispensable for PyNOT1-G’s essential blood stage functions but impacts host-to-vector transmission. Together, we conclude that a NOT1-G paralogue in <i>Plasmodium</i> fulfills the complex transmission requirements of both male and female parasites.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The structure of hippocampal circuitry relates to rapid category learning in humans</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Prior work suggests that complementary white matter pathways within the hippocampus (HPC) differentially support the learning of specific versus general information. In particular, while the trisynaptic pathway (TSP) rapidly forms memories for specific experiences, the monosynaptic pathway (MSP) slowly learns generalities. However, despite the theorized significance of such circuitry, characterizing how information flows within the HPC to support learning in humans remains a challenge. We leveraged diffusion-weighted imaging as a proxy for individual differences in white matter structure linking key regions along with TSP (HPC subfields CA<sub>3</sub> and CA<sub>1</sub>) and MSP (entorhinal cortex and CA<sub>1</sub>) and related these differences in hippocampal structure to category learning ability. We hypothesized that learning to categorize the “exception” items that deviated from category rules would benefit from TSP-supported mnemonic specificity. Participant-level estimates of TSP- and MSP-related integrity were constructed from HPC subfield connectomes of white matter streamline density. Consistent with theories of TSP-supported learning mechanisms, we found a specific association between the integrity of CA<sub>3</sub>–CA<sub>1</sub> white matter connections and exception learning. These results highlight the significant role of HPC circuitry in complex human learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">G protein‐coupled estrogen receptor‐1 enhances excitatory synaptic responses in the entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Activation of estrogen receptors is thought to modulate cognitive function in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum by affecting both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. The entorhinal cortex is a major source of cortical sensory and associational input to the hippocampus, but it is unclear whether either estrogens or progestogens may modulate cognitive function through effects on synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex. This study assessed the effects of the brief application of either 17-β estradiol (E2) or progesterone on excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the female rat entorhinal cortex in vitro. Rats were ovariectomized on postnatal day (PD) 63 and also received subdermal E2 implants to maintain constant low levels of circulating E2 on par with estrus. Electrophysiological recordings from brain slices were obtained between PD70 and PD86, and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) reflecting the activation of the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex were evoked by the stimulation of layer I afferents. The application of E2 (10 nM) for 20 min resulted in a small increase in the amplitude of fEPSPs that reversed during the 30-min washout period. The application of the ERα agonist propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) (100 nM) or the β agonist DPN (1 μM) did not significantly affect synaptic responses. However, the application of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1) agonist G1 (100 nM) induced a reversible increase in fEPSP amplitude similar to that induced by E2. Furthermore, the potentiation of responses induced by G1 was blocked by the GPER1 antagonist G15 (1 μM). Application of progesterone (100 nM) or its metabolite allopregnanolone (1 μM) did not significantly affect synaptic responses. The potentiation of synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex induced by the activation of GPER1 receptors may contribute to the modulation of cognitive function in female rats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal subfield volumes and memory discrimination in the developing brain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to keep distinct memories of similar events is underpinned by a type of neural computation called pattern separation (PS). Children typically report coarse-grained memories narratives lacking specificity and detail. This lack of memory specificity is illustrative of an immature or impaired PS. Despite its importance for the ontogeny of memory, data regarding the maturation of PS during childhood is still scarce. PS is known to rely on the hippocampus, particularly on hippocampal subfields DG and CA3. In this study, we used a memory discrimination task, a behavioral proxy for PS, and manually segmented hippocampal subfields volumes in the hippocampal body in a cohort of 26 children aged from 5 to 12 years. We examined the association between subfields volumes and memory discrimination performance. The main results were: (1) we showed age-related differences of memory discrimination suggesting a continuous increase of memory performance during early to late childhood. (2) We evidenced distinct associations between age and the volumes of hippocampal subfield, suggesting distinct developmental trajectories. (3) We showed a relationship between memory discrimination performance and the volumes of CA3 and subiculum. Our results further confirm the role of CA3 in memory discrimination, and suggest to scrutinize more closely the role of the subiculum. Overall, we showed that hippocampal subfields contribute distinctively to PS during development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Direct synaptic excitation between hilar mossy cells revealed with a targeted voltage sensor</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dentate gyrus not only gates the flow of information into the hippocampus, it also integrates and processes this information. Mossy cells (MCs) are a major type of excitatory neuron strategically located in the hilus of the dentate gyrus where they can contribute to this processing through networks of synapses with inhibitory neurons and dentate granule cells. Some prior work has suggested that MCs can form excitatory synapses with other MCs, but the role of these synapses in the network activity of the dentate gyrus has received little attention. Here, we investigated synaptic inputs to MCs in mouse hippocampal slices using a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) targeted to MCs by Cre-lox technology. This enabled optical recording of voltage changes from multiple MCs simultaneously. Stimulating granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells activated well-established inputs to MCs and elicited synaptic responses as expected. However, the weak blockade of MC responses to granule cell layer stimulation by DCG-IV raised the possibility of another source of excitation. To evaluate synapses between MCs as this source, single MCs were stimulated focally. Stimulation of one MC above its action potential threshold evoked depolarizing responses in neighboring MCs that depended on glutamate receptors. Short latency responses of MCs to other MCs did not depend on release from granule cell axons. However, granule cells did contribute to the longer latency responses of MCs to stimulation of other MCs. Thus, MCs transmit their activity to other MCs both through direct synaptic coupling and through polysynaptic coupling with dentate granule cells. MC–MC synapses can redistribute information entering the dentate gyrus and thus shape and modulate the electrical activity underlying hippocampal functions such as navigation and memory, as well as excessive excitation during seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Aberrant slow waves in the hippocampus during activation in mice with low cholinergic tone</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effects of acetylcholine on cortical activation were studied in wild-type (WT) mice, compared to knockout (KO) mice depleted of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene in the basal forebrain, and knockdown (KD) mice with heterogeneous depletion of VAChT gene in the brain. Cortical activation was assessed by comparing power spectra of local field potentials (LFPs) during activated states of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM) or walk (WLK), with those during non-activated states of slow-wave sleep (SWS) or awake-immobility (IMM). Activation-induced suppression of delta (1–4 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) power in the hippocampus, and delta power in frontal cortex, were reduced in KO and KD mice compared to WT mice. Mean theta frequency was higher in KD than KO mice during WLK and REM, but not different between WT and KO mice. Peak theta (4–12 Hz) and integrated gamma (30–150 Hz) power were not significantly different among mouse groups. However, theta-peak-frequency selected gamma2 (62–100 Hz) power was lower in KO than WT or KD mice during WLK, and theta-peak-frequency selected theta power during REM decreased faster with high theta frequency in KO than WT/ KD mice. Theta power increase during REM compared to WLK was lower in KO and KD mice compared to WT mice. Theta–gamma cross-frequency coherence, a measure of synchronization of gamma with theta phase, was not different among mouse groups. However, during REM, SWS, and IMM, delta-gamma coherence was significantly higher and proximal–distal delta coherence in CA1 was lower in KO than WT/KD mice. We conclude that a deficiency in basal forebrain acetylcholine release not only enhances slow waves and suppresses theta-associated gamma waves during activation, but also increases delta-gamma cross-frequency coherence during nonactivated states, with a possible effect of disrupting cognitive processing during any brain state.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 forecast for 13 Caribbean countries using ARIMA modeling for confirmed, death, and recovered cases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus in the Caribbean region has led to increased surveillance with an increasing trend of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 13 Caribbean countries. Our study aims to analyze the impact of Covid-19 (SARS nCoV-2) in 13 Caribbean countries in terms of the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases. Methods: The study uses the ARIMA model based on the time series pattern according to data retrieved from John Hopkins University. The data were analyzed using Stata 14 SE software for the period January 22, 2020, and August 16, 2021, and forecasted till December 31, 2021. All chosen models were compared with other models in terms of various factors like AIC/BIC, log-likelihood, p-value significance, coefficient < 1, and 5% significance. The ACF and PACF graphs were plotted to reduce bias and select the best-fitting model. Results: The results show the predicted trend in terms of confirmed, death, and recovered cases of COVID-19 for 13 Caribbean countries. The projected ARIMA model forecast for the period December 16, 2021, to December 31, 2021, shows 2470272 (95% CI 2438965 - 2501579) confirmed cases, 27220 (95% CI 26886 - 27555) deaths, and 818105 (95% CI 818085 - 818125) recovered cases related to Covid-19. The final ARIMA model chosen for confirmed COVID-19 cases, several deaths, and recovered cases are ARIMA (9,2,4), ARIMA (1,2,1), and ARIMA (1,2,1), respectively. Conclusions As per the results of the forecasted COVID-19 models, there is a steady rise in confirmed, death, and recovered cases during the period June 1, 2020, until November 30, 2020, and April 1, 2021, until June 15, 2021. It shows an increasing trend for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases and a slowing of the number of deaths.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive dysfunction is a core symptom of anti–N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, but detailed studies on prevalence, characteristics of cognitive deficits, and the potential for recovery are missing. Here, we performed a prospective longitudinal study to assess cognitive long-term outcome and identify clinical predictors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were performed in 43 patients with NMDAR encephalitis 2.3 years and 4.9 years (median) after disease onset. Cognitive assessments covered executive function, working memory, verbal/visual episodic memory, attention, subjective complaints, and depression and anxiety levels. Cognitive performance of patients was compared to that of 30 healthy participants matched for age, sex, and education.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All patients had persistent cognitive deficits 2.3 years after onset, with moderate or severe impairment in &gt;80% of patients. Core deficits included memory and executive function. After 4.9 years, significant improvement of cognitive function was observed, but moderate to severe deficits persisted in two thirds of patients, despite favorable functional neurological outcomes (median modified Rankin Scale = 1). Delayed treatment, higher disease severity, and longer duration of the acute phase were predictors for impaired cognitive outcome. The recovery process was time dependent, with greater gains earlier after the acute phase, although improvements were possible for several years after disease onset.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cognitive deficits are the main contributor to long-term morbidity in NMDAR encephalitis and persist beyond functional neurological recovery. Nonetheless, cognitive improvement is possible for several years after the acute phase and should be supported by continued cognitive rehabilitation. Cognition should be included as an outcome measure in future clinical studies. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Zhao et al. demonstrate that rapid plasticity in CA1 pyramidal cells creates cellular responses carrying information about position and choice-related factors during a cued, two-choice virtual navigation task. Prior learning is necessary to produce the upstream code for trial type, and subsequent plasticity enables flexible readout of the code.

                How does the human brain flexibly support a remarkably diverse repertoire of hand movements? Natraj et al. show that mesoscale activity, for movements ranging from grasps to finger individuation, lie within a common multi-area manifold spanning the “grasp network.” However, latent dynamics within this manifold were movement specific and compartmentalized into distinct behaviorally relevant submanifolds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamus gates active dendritic computations in cortex during sensory processing</a></h4>

              
                Perception is causally linked to a calcium-dependent spiking mechanism that is built into the distal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons - the major output cell type of the cerebral cortex. It is yet unclear which circuits activate this cellular mechanism upon sensory stimulation. Here we found that the same thalamocortical axons that relay sensory signals to layer 4 also densely target the dendritic domain by which pyramidal tract neurons initiate calcium spikes. Distal dendritic inputs, which normally appear greatly attenuated at the cell body, thereby generate bursts of action potentials in cortical output during sensory processing. Our findings indicate that thalamus gates an active dendritic mechanism to facilitate the combination of sensory signals with top-down information streams into cortical output. Thus, in addition to being the central hub for sensory signals, thalamus is also likely to ensure that the signals it relays to cortex are perceived by the animal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unravelling the role of thyroid hormones in seasonal neuroplasticity in European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris)</a></h4>

              
                Thyroid hormones clearly play a role in the seasonal regulation of reproduction, but any role they might play in song behavior and the associated seasonal neuroplasticity in songbirds remains to be elucidated. To pursue this question, we first established seasonal patterns in the expression of thyroid hormone regulating genes in male European starlings employing in situ hybridization methods. Thyroid hormone transporter LAT1 expression in the song nucleus HVC was elevated during the photosensitive phase, pointing towards an active role of thyroid hormones during this window of possible neuroplasticity. In contrast, DIO3 expression was high in HVC during the photostimulated phase, limiting the possible effect of thyroid hormones to maintain song stability during the breeding season. Next, we studied the effect of hypothyroidism on song behavior and neuroplasticity using in vivo MRI. Hypothyroidism inhibited the photostimulation-induced increase in testosterone, confirming the role of thyroid hormones in activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Surprisingly, apart from the myelination of several tracts during the photostimulated phase, most neuroplasticity related to song production was unaffected by hypothyroidism. Remarkably, T3 plasma concentrations were negatively correlated to the microstructural changes in several song control nuclei. Potentially, a global reduction of circulating thyroid hormones during the photosensitive period is necessary to lift the brake imposed by the photorefractory period, whereas local fine-tuning of thyroid hormone concentrations through LAT1 could activate underlying neuroplasticity mechanisms. Given the complexity of thyroid hormone effects, this study is a steppingstone to disentangle the influence of thyroid hormones on seasonal neuroplasticity.

                Pattern recognition is a major scientific topic. Strikingly, while machine learning algorithms are constantly refined, the human brain emerges as an ancestral biological example of such complex procedure. However, how it transforms sequences of single objects into meaningful temporal patterns remains elusive. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we discovered and mathematically modelled an inedited dual simultaneous processing responsible for pattern recognition in the brain. Indeed, while the objects of the temporal pattern were independently elaborated by a local, rapid brain processing, their combination into a meaningful superordinate pattern depended on a concurrent global, slower processing involving a widespread network of sequentially active brain areas. Expanding the established knowledge of neural information flow from low- to high-order brain areas, we revealed a novel brain mechanism based on simultaneous activity in different frequency bands within the same brain regions, highlighting its crucial role underlying complex cognitive functions.

                The genesis of broad neuronal classes from multipotential neural progenitor cells has been extensively studied, but less is known about the diversification of a single neuronal class into multiple types. We used single-cell RNA-seq to study how newly-born (postmitotic) mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) precursors diversify into ~45 discrete types. Computational analysis provides evidence that RGC type identity is not specified at mitotic exit, but acquired by gradual, asynchronous fate restriction of postmitotic multipotential precursors. Some types are not identifiable until a week after they are generated. Immature RGCs may be specified to project ipsilaterally or contralaterally to the rest of the brain before their type identity has been determined. Optimal transport inference identifies groups of RGC precursors with largely non-overlapping fates, distinguished by selectively expressed transcription factors that could act as fate determinants. Our study provides a framework for investigating the molecular diversification of discrete types within a neuronal class.

                In developing Xenopus tadpoles, the optic tectum begins to receive patterned visual input while visuomotor circuits are still undergoing neurogenesis and circuit assembly. This visual input regulates neural progenitor cell fate decisions such that maintaining tadpoles in the dark increases proliferation, expanding the progenitor pool, while visual stimulation promotes neuronal differentiation. To identify regulators of activity-dependent neural progenitor cell fate, we used RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptomes of proliferating neural progenitor cells and newly-differentiated immature neurons. Out of 1,130 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts, we identified six DE transcription factors which are predicted to regulate the majority of the other DE transcripts. Here we focused on Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and the ETS-family transcription factor, ELK-1. BRCA1 is known for its role in cancers, but relatively little is known about its potential role in regulating neural progenitor cell fate. ELK-1 is a multifunctional transcription factor which regulates immediate early gene expression. We investigated the effect of BRCA1 and ELK-1 on activity-regulated neurogenesis in the tadpole visual system using in vivo timelapse imaging to monitor the fate of turbo-GFP-expressing SOX2+ neural progenitor cells in the optic tectum. Our longitudinal in vivo imaging analysis shows that knockdown of either BRCA1 or ELK-1 altered the fates of neural progenitor cells, and furthermore that the effects of visual experience on neurogenesis depend on BRCA1 expression, while the effects of visual experience on neuronal differentiation depend on ELK-1 expression. These studies provide insight into the potential mechanisms by which neural activity affects neural progenitor cell fate.

                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive ataxia and degeneration of specific neuronal populations, including Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum. Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for various evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways in cerebellar patterning, such as the Wnt-{beta}-catenin pathway; however, the roles of these pathways in adult cerebellar function and cerebellar neurodegeneration are largely unknown. In this study, we found that Wnt-{beta}-catenin activity was progressively enhanced in multiple cell types in the adult SCA1 mouse cerebellum, and that activation of this signaling occurs in an ataxin-1 polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion-dependent manner. Genetic manipulation of the Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling pathway in specific cerebellar cell populations revealed that activation of Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling in PCs alone was not sufficient to induce SCA1-like phenotypes, while its activation in astrocytes including Bergmann glia (BG) resulted in gliosis and disrupted BG localization, which was replicated in SCA1 mouse models. Our studies identify a novel mechanism in which polyQ-expanded ataxin-1 positively regulates Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling, and demonstrate that different cell types have distinct responses to the enhanced Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling in the SCA1 cerebellum, underscoring an important role of BG in SCA1 pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plasticity of Neural Connections Underlying Oxytocin-mediated Parental Behaviors of Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                The adult brain can flexibly adapt behaviors to specific life-stage demands. For example, while sexually naive male mice are aggressive to the conspecific young, they start to provide caregiving to infants around the time when their own young are expected. How such behavioral plasticity is implemented at the level of neural connections remains poorly understood. Using viral-genetic approaches, here we establish hypothalamic oxytocin neurons as key regulators of parental caregiving behaviors of male mice. We then used rabies virus-mediated unbiased screen to identify excitatory neural connections originating from the lateral hypothalamus to the oxytocin neurons to be drastically strengthened when male mice become fathers. These connections are functionally relevant, as their activation suppresses pup-directed aggression in virgin males. These results demonstrate the life-stage associated, long-distance, and cell-type-specific plasticity of neural connections in the hypothalamus, the brain region classically assumed to be hard-wired.

                I demonstrate theoretically that calcium waves in astrocytes can compute anything neurons can. A foundational result in neural computation was proving the firing rate model of neurons defines a universal function approximator. In this work I show a similar proof extends to a model of calcium waves in astrocytes, which I confirm in a series of computer simulations. I argue the major limit in astrocyte computation is not their ability to find approximate solutions, but their computational complexity. I suggest some initial experiments that might be used to confirm these predictions.

                Repeat expansions in C9orf72 cause Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) eliciting toxic effects through generation of RNA foci, dipeptide repeat proteins and/or loss of C9orf72 protein. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) have been implicated as a pathogenic mechanism underlying repeat expansion toxicity. Here, we show that loss of C9orf72 causes neuronal specific phenotypes, disrupting the Ran-GTPase gradient both in vitro and in vivo. We describe compositionally different types of cytoplasmic Importin {beta}-1 granules that exhibit neuronal subtype-specific properties in vivo. We show that the abundance of Importin {beta}-1 granules is increased in the context of C9orf72 deficiency, disrupting interactions with nuclear pore complex proteins. These granules appear to bud from the nuclear envelope and are co-immunoreactive for G3BP1 and K63-ubiquitin. These findings link loss of C9orf72 protein to gain-of-function mechanisms and defects in NCT.

                The mechanisms underlying memory loss associated with Alzheimers disease and related dementias (ADRD) remain unclear, and no effective treatments exist. Fundamental studies have shown that a set of transcriptional regulatory proteins of the nuclear receptor 4a (Nr4a) family serve as molecular switches for long-term memory. Here, we show that Nr4a proteins regulate the transcription of a group of genes encoding chaperones that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which function to traffic plasticity-related proteins to the cell surface during long lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. Nr4a transcription factors and ER chaperones are linked to ADRD in human samples as well as mouse models, and overexpressing Nr4a1 or the ER chaperone Hspa5 ameliorates the long-term memory deficits in a tau-based mouse model of ADRD, pointing towards novel therapeutic approaches for treating memory loss. Thus, our findings establish protein folding in the ER as a novel molecular concept underlying long-term memory, providing new insights into the mechanistic basis of cognitive deficits in dementia.

                Recent evidence has suggested that the carotid bodies might act as immunological sensors, detecting pro-inflammatory mediators and signalling to the central nervous system, which, in turn, orchestrates autonomic responses. Here, we demonstrated that the TNF- receptor type I is expressed in the carotid bodies of rats. The systemic administration of TNF- increased carotid body afferent discharge and activated glutamatergic neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) that project to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), where the majority of pre-sympathetic neurons reside. The activation of these neurons was accompanied by generalized activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Carotid body ablation blunted the TNF--induced activation of RVLM-projecting NTS neurons and the increase in splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity. Finally, plasma and spleen levels of cytokines after TNF- administration were higher in rats subjected to either carotid body ablation or splanchnic sympathetic denervation. Collectively, our findings indicate that the carotid body detects circulating TNF- to activate a counteracting sympathetic anti-inflammatory mechanism.

                The human brain readily learns tasks in sequence without forgetting previous ones. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), on the other hand, need to be modified to achieve similar performance. While effective, many algorithms that accomplish this are based on weight importance methods that do not correspond to biological mechanisms. Here we introduce a simple, biologically plausible method for enabling effective continual learning in ANNs. We show that it is possible to learn a weight-dependent plasticity function that prevents catastrophic forgetting over multiple tasks. We highlight the effectiveness of our method by evaluating it on a set of MNIST classification tasks. We further find that the use of our method promotes synaptic multi-modality, similar to that seen in biology.

                Healthy neuronal networks rely on homeostatic plasticity to maintain stable firing rates despite changing synaptic drive. These mechanisms, however, can themselves be destabilizing if activated inappropriately or excessively. For example, prolonged activity deprivation can lead to rebound hyperactivity and seizures. While many forms of homeostasis have been described, whether and how the magnitude of homeostatic plasticity is constrained remains unknown. Here we uncover negative regulation of cortical network homeostasis by PAR bZIP family of transcription factors. In their absence the network response to prolonged activity withdrawal is too strong and this is driven by exaggerated upregulation of recurrent excitatory synaptic transmission. These data indicate that transcriptional activation is not only required for many forms of homeostatic plasticity but is also involved in restraint of the response to activity deprivation.

                In complex nervous systems, neurons must identify their correct partners to form synaptic connections. The prevailing model to ensure correct recognition posits that cell surface proteins (CSPs) in individual neurons act as identification tags. Thus, knowing what cells express which CSPs would provide insights into neural development, synaptic connectivity, and nervous system evolution. Here, we investigated expression of dprs and DIPs, two CSP subfamilies belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), in Drosophila larval motor neurons (MNs), sensory neurons (SNs), peripheral glia and muscles using a collection of GAL4 driver lines. We found that dprs are more broadly expressed than DIPs in MNs and SNs, and each examined neuron expresses a unique combination of dprs and DIPs. Interestingly, many dprs and DIPs are not robustly expressed, but instead, are found in gradient and temporal expression patterns. Hierarchical clustering showed a similar expression pattern of dprs and DIPs in neurons from the same type and with shared synaptic partners, suggesting these CSPs may facilitate synaptic wiring. In addition, the unique expression patterns of dprs and DIPs revealed three uncharacterized MNs - MN23-Ib, MN6-Ib (A2) and MN7-Ib (A2). This study sets the stage for exploring the functions of dprs and DIPs in Drosophila MNs and SNs and provides genetic access to subsets of neurons.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to establish a macroscopic reference coordinate system of laminar and cytoarchitectural boundaries. Cell counting is obtained with both traditional immunohistochemistry, to provide a stereological gold-standard, and with a custom-made inverted confocal light-sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM) for 3D imaging at cellular resolution. Finally, mesoscale optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables the registration of the distorted histological cell typing obtained with LSFM to the MRI-based atlas coordinate system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Persistent synaptic inhibition of the subthalamic nucleus by high frequency stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides symptomatic relief in a growing number of neurological indications, but local synaptic dynamics in response to electrical stimulation that may relate to its mechanism of action have not been fully characterized. Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) study local synaptic dynamics during high frequency extracellular stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and (2) compare STN synaptic dynamics with those of the neighboring substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Methods: Two microelectrodes were advanced into the STN and SNr of patients undergoing DBS surgery for PD. Neuronal firing and evoked field potentials (fEPs) were recorded with one microelectrode during stimulation from an adjacent microelectrode. Results: Excitatory and inhibitory fEPs could be discerned within the STN and their amplitudes predicted bidirectional effects on neuronal firing (p = .007). There were no differences between STN and SNr inhibitory fEP dynamics at low stimulation frequencies (p > .999). However, inhibitory neuronal responses were sustained over time in STN during high frequency stimulation, but not SNr (p < .001) where depression of inhibitory input was coupled with a return of neuronal firing (p = .003). Interpretation: Persistent inhibitory input to the STN suggests a local synaptic mechanism for the suppression of subthalamic firing during high frequency stimulation. Moreover, differences in the resiliency versus vulnerability of inhibitory inputs to the STN and SNr suggest a projection source- and frequency-specificity for this mechanism. The feasibility of targeting electrophysiologically-identified neural structures may provide insight into how DBS achieves frequency-specific modulation of neuronal projections.

                Reward-associated conditioned stimuli (CS) can acquire predictive value, evoking conditioned approach behaviors that prepare animals to engage with forthcoming rewards. Such CS can also acquire conditioned reinforcing value, becoming attractive and pursued. Through their predictive and conditioned reinforcing properties, CS can promote adaptive (e.g., locating food) but also maladaptive responses (e.g., drug use). Basolateral amygdala neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core (BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons) mediate the response to appetitive CS, but the extent to which this involves effects on the predictive and/or conditioned reinforcing properties of CS is unclear. Thus, we examined the effects of optogenetic stimulation of BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons on conditioned approach behavior and on the instrumental pursuit of a CS, the latter a measure of conditioned reinforcement. Water-restricted, adult male rats learned that a light-tone compound cue (CS) predicts water delivery. Pairing optogenetic stimulation of BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons with CS presentation potentiated conditioned approach behavior, and did so even under extinction conditions, when water was omitted. This suggests that BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons promote cue-induced expectation of rewards. Rats also received instrumental conditioning sessions during which they could lever press for CS presentations, without water delivery. Optogenetic stimulation of BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons either during these instrumental test sessions or during prior CS-water conditioning did not influence lever responding for the CS. This suggests that BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons do not influence the conditioned reinforcing effects of CS. We conclude that BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons promote cue-induced control over behavior by increasing cue-triggered anticipation of rewards, without influencing cue 'wanting'.

                Psychostimulant exposure alters the activity of ventral pallidum (VP) projection-neurons. However, the molecular underpinnings of these circuit dysfunctions are unclear. Using RNA-sequencing followed by circuit-specific gene expression assays, we revealed a key role for the VP to mediodorsal thalamus (VP-MDT) projection neurons in cocaine-related behaviors in mice. Our analyses demonstrated that the transcription factor Nr4a1 bidirectionally modulated dendritic spine dynamics in VP-MDT neurons and positively regulated pathological drug use.

                The main challenge in the clinical assessment of Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) is the lack of an electroencephalographic marker in the electroencephalography (EEG) readout. Although decades of EEG studies have focused on detecting cortical brain function underlying PNES, the principle of PNES remains poorly understood. To address this problem, electric potentials generated by large populations of neurons were collected during the resting state to be processed after that by Power Spectrum Density (PSD) for possible analysis of PNES signatures. Additionally, the integration of distributed information of regular and synchronized multi-scale communication within and across inter-regional brain areas has been observed using functional connectivity tools like Phase Lag Index (PLI) and graph-derived metrics. A cohort study of 20 PNES and 19 Healthy Control subjects (HC) were enrolled. The major finding is that PNES patients exhibited significant differences in alpha-power spectrum in brain regions related to cognitive operations, attention, working memory, and movement regulation. Noticeably, we observed that there exists an altered oscillatory activity and a widespread inter-regional phase desynchronization. This indicates changes in global efficiency, node betweenness, shortest path length, and small worldness in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Finally, our findings look into new evidence of the intrinsic organization of functional brain networks that reflects a dysfunctional level of integration of local activity across brain regions, which can provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of PNES.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combination of structural and functional connectivity explains unique variation in specific domains of cognitive function.</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between structural and functional brain networks has been characterised as complex: the two networks mirror each other and show mutual influence but they also diverge in their organisation. This work explored whether a combination of structural and functional connectivity can improve models of cognitive performance, and whether this differs by cognitive domain. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to cognitive data from the Human Connectome Project. Four components were obtained, reflecting Retention and Retrieval, Processing Speed, Self-regulation, and Encoding. The PCA-Regression approach was applied to predict cognitive performance using structural, functional and joint structural-functional components. Model quality was evaluated using model evidence, model fit and generalisability. Functional connectivity components produced the most effective models of Retention and Retrieval and Encoding, whereas joint structural-functional components produced most effective models of Processing Speed, and Self-regulation. The present study demonstrates that multimodal data fusion using structural and functional connectivity can help predict cognitive performance, but that the additional explanatory value (relative to overfitting) may depend on the specific selection of cognitive domain. We discuss the implications of these results for studies of the brain basis of cognition in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abstract representations emerge naturally in neural networks trained to perform multiple tasks</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals demonstrate a remarkable ability to generalize knowledge across distinct contexts and objects during natural behavior. We posit that this ability depends on the geometry of the neural population representations of these objects and contexts. Specifically, abstract, or disentangled, neural representations -- in which neural population activity is a linear function of the variables important for making a decision -- are known to allow for this kind of generalization. Further, recent neurophysiological studies have shown that the brain has sufficiently abstract representations of some sensory and cognitive variables to enable generalization across distinct contexts. However, it is unknown how these abstract representations emerge. Here, using feedforward neural networks, we demonstrate a simple mechanism by which these abstract representations can be produced: The learning of multiple distinct classification tasks. We demonstrate that, despite heterogeneity in the task structure, abstract representations that enable reliable generalization can be produced from a variety of different inputs -- including standard nonlinearly mixed inputs, inputs that mimic putative representations from early sensory areas, and even simple image inputs from a standard machine learning data set. Thus, we conclude that abstract representations of sensory and cognitive variables emerge from the multiple behaviors that animals exhibit in the natural world, and may be pervasive in high-level brain regions. We make several specific predictions about which variables will be represented abstractly as well as show how these representations can be detected.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Executive and Attentional Resting-State Hubs of the Human Cortical Connectome Revealed by a Causal Discovery Method for Data-Driven Effective Connectivity Analysis</a></h4>

              
                We introduce a data-driven causal discovery method (Greedy Adjacencies and Non-Gaussian Orientations; GANGO) for calculating a "causal connectome" of directed connectivity from resting-state fMRI data and characterizing hubs of directed information transfer across the human cortex. Prominent hubs of the causal connectome were situated in attentional (dorsal attention) and executive (frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular) networks. These hub networks had distinctly different connectivity profiles. Attentional networks shared incoming connections with sensory regions and outgoing connections with higher cognitive networks, while executive networks primarily connected to other higher cognitive networks and had a high degree of bidirected connectivity. Virtual lesion analyses accentuated these findings, demonstrating that attentional and executive hubs are points of critical vulnerability in the human causal connectome. These data highlight the central role of attention and executive control networks in the human cortical connectome and set the stage for future applications of data-driven causal ("effective") connectivity analysis in psychiatry.

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a high-cost/high-burden problem. Early intervention may prevent development of the disorder, improving child outcomes and reducing long-term consequences. However, few studies have investigated the role of early intervention in children younger than two years. This study aims to examine the effect of early intervention in 18-month-old high-risk siblings of children with ASD (HR-ASD) with clinical signs of autism. The intervention is based on the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis and focuses on the development of early precursors to social and communicative competence (joint attention and imitation behaviors). After controlling for baseline differences, two comparison HR-ASD groups were included: 15 HR-ASD toddlers receiving behavioral intervention for 3 h per week for 5 months (INT+) and 15 HR-ASD toddlers who were only clinically monitored from age 18 months (INT−). Changes in social communication, restricted/repetitive behaviors, and language were assessed using standardized measures at pre- (T0) and post-intervention (T1). From T0 to T1, the INT+ group showed significant improvements in communication, social interaction, and language compared to INT− group. There was no effect on restricted/repetitive behaviors. Our findings highlighted the importance of early detection/intervention in autism and supported a positive impact of targeted interventions to improve outcomes in at-risk children.</p>

	<p>Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is prevalent in the general population, particularly among Hispanic adults. SCD increases the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. While non-pharmacologic interventions are recommended to mitigate cognitive decline and preserve daily function in SCD and MCI, such interventions are not readily available for Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults with SCD. This pilot study, preregistered at clinicialtrials.gov, aimed to develop a linguistically and culturally appropriate adaptation of an existing memory compensation intervention, the Memory Support System (MSS), from English to Spanish, and to gather data to assess its impact in this population. Twenty Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults with SCD and 16 support partners were recruited. Measures of treatment adherence, daily function, self-efficacy for memory, quality of life, mood, anxiety, and caregiver burden were assessed at baseline, treatment end, and 8-week follow-up. By treatment end, participants with SCD improved their general functional status, daily activities requiring organizational skills, and depression and anxiety symptoms. Partners reported improvement in anxiety by treatment end and in caregiver burden at follow-up. The MSS was successfully translated into Spanish and readily learned by participants with SCD and their partners. The MSS in Spanish may help with daily functioning and aspects of patient and family well-being.</p>

	<p>To test the scaffolding theory when applied to the teaching and learning of writing English as a foreign language, this cross-sectional study was conducted to collect physiological data. A total of 53 participants were randomly assigned into two groups, and brain activity was investigated during a guided-writing task using storytelling pictures. The writing task was further divided into four parts using graded levels of difficulty. The experimental group performed tasks in sequence from easy to difficult, whereas the comparison group performed the tasks at random. Outcomes included handwriting assessments and fMRI measurements. Writing outcome assessments were analyzed using SPSS, and scanned images were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software. The results revealed a positive learning effect associated with scaffolding instruction. The experimental group performed better during the writing tasks, and the fMRI images showed less intense and weaker reactions in the language processing region than were observed in the comparison group. The fMRI results also presented the experimental group with reduced motor and cognitive functions when writing in English. This study provides insight regarding brain activity during writing tasks in humans and may have implications for English-language instruction.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to assess the effect of the auditory feedback gait training (AFGT) using smart insole on the gait variables, dynamic balance, and activities of daily living (ADL) of stroke patients. In this case, 45 chronic stroke patients who were diagnosed with a stroke before 6 months and could walk more than 10 m were included in this study. Participants were randomly allocated to the smart insole training group (n = 23), in which the AFGT system was used, or to the general gait training group (GGTG) (n = 22). Both groups completed conventional rehabilitation, including conventional physiotherapy and gait training, lasting 60 min per session, five times per week for 4 weeks. Instead of gait training, the smart insole training group received smart insole training twice per week for 4 weeks. Participants were assessed using the GAITRite for gait variables and Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) for dynamic balance, and Modified Barthel Index (MBI) for ADL. The spatiotemporal gait parameters, symmetry of gait, TUG, BBS, and MBI in the smart insole training group were significantly improved compared to those in the GGTG (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The AFGT system approach is a helpful method for improving gait variables, dynamic balance, and ADL in chronic stroke patients.</p>

	<p>DNA methylation clocks are used as molecular estimators of epigenetic age, but with little evidence in mothers and none in neglectful mothering. We investigated differences in epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and the role of empathy using the PhenoAge clock. We collected saliva samples from mothers with extreme disregard for their child’s needs (50 in the neglect group, NG) and mothers with non-neglectful caregiving (87 in the control group, CG). Mothers completed an empathy scale, along with questionnaires of their own childhood maltreatment, adverse life events and psychiatric disorders. Sociodemographic variables potentially affecting EAA were also measured. The ANCOVA solution showed a significant increase in EAA in the NG compared to the CG, after adjustment for maternal age, number of pregnancies, financial assistance, adverse events, childhood maltreatment and psychiatric disorder. The group interaction effects showed a reduction in EAA for greater empathic concern and for a higher education level both as positive factors, and an increment in EAA for mothers living in a two-parent family as a risk factor, all in the NG. Our findings open the search for protective factors of EAA associated with caregiver behavior to reduce health vulnerabilities and poor social functioning, especially for mothers at risk of maladaptive caregiving.</p>

<p>Characterization of early myelin ensheathment during Xenopus mid-larval development was performed by immunostaining for myelin basic protein and by third harmonic generation microscopy. Temporally patterned visual stimuli regulated the extent of myelination.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myelination allows for the regulation of conduction velocity, affecting the precise timing of neuronal inputs important for the development and function of brain circuits. In turn, myelination may be altered by changes in experience, neuronal activity, and vesicular release, but the links between sensory experience, corresponding neuronal activity, and resulting alterations in myelination require further investigation. We thus studied the development of myelination in the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpole, a classic model for studies of visual system development and function because it is translucent and visually responsive throughout the formation of its retinotectal system. We begin with a systematic characterization of the timecourse of early myelin ensheathment in the <i>Xenopus</i> retinotectal system using immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) along with third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, a label-free structural imaging technique. Based on the mid-larval developmental progression of MBP expression in <i>Xenopus</i>, we identified an appropriate developmental window in which to assess the effects of early temporally patterned visual experience on myelin ensheathment. We used calcium imaging of axon terminals in vivo to characterize the responses of retinal ganglion cells over a range of stroboscopic stimulation frequencies. Strobe frequencies that reliably elicited robust versus dampened calcium responses were then presented to animals for 7 d, and differences in the amount of early myelin ensheathment at the optic chiasm were subsequently quantified. This study provides evidence that it is not just the presence but also to the specific temporal properties of sensory stimuli that are important for myelin plasticity.</p>

<p>This study characterizes the temporal and spatial expression pattern of genetically encoded reporters following Cre-mediated recombination from three Cre drivers selective for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within the thalamus, including thalamocortical (TC) neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to TC neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Subpopulations of neurons and associated neural circuits can be targeted in mice with genetic tools in a highly selective manner for visualization and manipulation. However, there are not well-defined Cre “driver” lines that target the expression of Cre recombinase to thalamocortical (TC) neurons. Here, we characterize three Cre driver lines for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre</i>. We examined the postnatal distribution of Cre expression for each of these lines with the Cre-dependent reporter <i>CAG-tdTomato</i> (<i>Ai9)</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within the thalamus, including TC neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to TC neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. Cre expression is present by the time of natural birth in all three lines, underscoring their utility for developmental studies. To demonstrate the utility of these Cre drivers for studying sensory TC circuitry, we targeted the expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to thalamus from the <i>CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP (Ai32)</i> allele with either <i>HDC-Cre</i> or <i>CRH-Cre</i>. Optogenetic activation of TC afferents in primary visual cortex was sufficient to measure frequency-dependent depression. Thus, these Cre drivers provide selective Cre-dependent gene expression in thalamus suitable for both anatomical and functional studies.</p>

<p>Using the unbiased stereological methods, we found that long-term, regular and moderate running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to be closely associated with emotional processes, decision making, and memory. Previous studies have identified the prefrontal cortex as one of the most vulnerable brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Running exercise has widely been recognized as a simple and effective method of physical activity that enhances brain function and slows the progression of AD. However, the effect of exercise on the mPFC of AD is unclear. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of 4 months of exercise on the numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of 12-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model mice using stereological methods. The spatial learning and memory abilities of mice were tested using the Morris water maze. Four months of running exercise delayed declines in spatial learning and memory abilities. The stereological results showed significantly lower numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type control group. The numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of running APP/PS1 mice were significantly greater than those in the APP/PS1 control mice. In addition, running-induced improvements in spatial learning and memory were significantly associated with running-induced increases in spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons numbers in the mPFC. Running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.</p>

     alt="Comparative neuroanatomical distribution and expression levels of neuropeptide F in the central nervous system of the female freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, during the ovarian cycle"/>
<p>We investigated the comparative neuroanatomical distribution of neuropeptide F in the female prawn, <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i> (MrNPF), and its expression levels in the entire CNS during the ovarian cycle. Interestingly, we found a correlation between changes in MrNPF neuroanatomical expression in various parts of the prawn CNS and different stages of the ovarian cycle. Our findings suggest that MrNPF may be a key coordinator that mediates sensory inputs, including photoreception, chemoreception, gustatory reception with feeding, and ovarian development in this female prawn.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide F (NPF) plays critical roles in controlling the feeding and reproduction of prawns. In the present study, we investigated changes in the expression levels of <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i> neuropeptide F (MrNPF), and its neuroanatomical distribution in eyestalk (ES), brain (BR), subesophageal ganglion (SEG), thoracic ganglia (TG), and abdominal ganglia (AG), during the ovarian cycle of female prawn. By qRT-PCR, the amount of <i>MrNPF</i> transcripts exhibited a gradual increase in the ES, BR, and combined SEG and TG from stages I and II, to reach a maximum level at stage III, and slightly declined at stage IV, respectively. The highest to lowest expression levels were detected in combined SEG and TG, BR, ES, and AG, respectively. MrNPF immunolabeling was observed in several neuronal clusters, associated fibers, and neuropils of these central nervous system (CNS) tissues. MrNPF-ir was more intense in neurons and neuropils of SEG and TG than those found in other parts of the CNS. The number of MrNPF-ir neurons and intensity of MrNPF-ir were higher in the ES, BR, SEG, and TG at the late stages than those at the early stages of the ovarian cycle, while those in AG exhibited insignificant change. Taken together, there is a correlation between changes in the neuroanatomical distribution of MrNPF and stages of the ovarian cycle, implying that MrNPF may be an important neuropeptide that integrates sensory stimuli, including photo-, chemo-, and gustatory receptions, to control feeding and reproduction, particularly ovarian development, of this female prawn, <i>M. rosenbergii</i>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with knowledge, attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-19 in health care professionals in Lima, Peru [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nowadays, we are facing a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, known globally as COVID-19, which is considered a threat to global health due to its high contagiousness and rapid spread. Methods: Analytical cross-sectional study in 302 health professionals. An online questionnaire consisting of questions about knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 was applied. Socio-demographic, occupational and comorbidities factors were explored. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with KAP. Results: Of the total, 25.2%, 31.5% and 37.4% had high levels of knowledge, preventive practices and risk perception attitudes respectively. Being married aOR=6.75 IC(1.46-31.2) p=0.014, having a master's degree aOR=0.4, IC(0.21-0.80) p=0.009, having a working day with less than ten hours ORa=0.49 IC(0.25-0.95) p=0.036 and obesity aOR=0.38 IC (0.15-0.95) p=0.039 were associated with a low level of knowledge of COVID-19. The variables associated with preventive practices were being over the age of 50 aOR=0.52 IC(0.27-0.98) p=0.007, working in the hospitalization area aOR=1.86 IC(1.08-3.18) p= 0.018 and having comorbidities such as arterial hypertension aOR=0.28 IC(0.081-0.99) p=0.02 and obesity aOR=0.35 IC(0.14-0.83) p=0.019. In relation to negative attitudes towards COVID-19, it was found that physical contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis aOR=1.84 IC (1.14-2.97) p=0.006 and having asthma aOR=2.13 IC(1.081-4.22) p=0.029 were associated with these attitudes. Conclusion: Our study revealed that health professionals have an insufficient level of knowledge of COVID-19. This is why we recommend implementing strategies such as health literacy programs among health care workers. Thus, they can help develop positive attitudes towards the acquisition of self-care habits at work that, in turn, improve their confidence so that health care workers can provide adequate care for their patients and protect themselves.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Toward an Anti-Racist Approach to Biomedical and Neuroscience Research</a></h4>

              
                <p>Racism is a threat to public health. Race is a sociopolitical construct that has been used for generations to create disparities in educational access, housing conditions, exposure to environmental contaminants, and access to health care. Collectively, these disparities have a negative impact on the health of non-white Americans. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds biomedical research, including basic neuroscience research, aimed at understanding the mechanisms and consequences of health and disease in Americans. NIH has recently acknowledged its own structural racism, the disadvantage this perpetuates in the biomedical research enterprise, and has announced its commitment to eliminating these disparities. Here, we discuss different rates of disease in U.S. citizens from different racial backgrounds. We next describe ways in which the biomedical research enterprise (1) has contributed to health disparities and (2) can contribute to the solving this problem. Based on our own scientific expertise, we use neuroscience in general and mental health/addiction disorders more specifically as examples of a broader issue. The NIH, including its neuroscience-focused Institutes, and NIH-funded scientists, including neuroscientists, should prioritize research topics that reflect the health conditions that affect all Americans, not just white Americans.</p>
