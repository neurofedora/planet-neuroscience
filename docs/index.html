              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13451">Benchmarking spike source localization algorithms in high density probes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating neuron location from extracellular recordings is essential for developing advanced brain-machine interfaces. Accurate neuron localization improves spike sorting, which involves detecting action potentials and assigning them to individual neurons. It also helps monitor probe drift, which affects long-term probe reliability. Although several localization algorithms are currently in use, the field is nascent and arguments for using one algorithm over another are largely theoretical or based on visual analysis of clustering results. We present a first-of-its-kind benchmarking of commonly used neuron localization algorithms. We tested these algorithms using two ground truth datasets: a biophysically realistic simulated dataset, and experimental data combining patch-clamp and Neuropixels probes. We systematically evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and runtime of these algorithms in ideal conditions and long-term recording conditions with electrode decay. Our findings highlight significant performance differences; while more complex and physically realistic models perform better in ideal situations, simple heuristics demonstrate superior robustness to noise and electrode degradation in experimental datasets, making them more suitable for long-term neural recordings. This work provides a framework for assessing localization algorithms and developing robust, biologically grounded algorithms to advance the development of brain-machine interfaces.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13807">EEG Blink Artifacts Can Identify Read Music in Listening and Imagery</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eye-movement related artifacts including blinks and saccades are significantly larger in amplitude than cortical activity as recorded by scalp electroencephalography (EEG), but are typically discarded in EEG studies focusing on cognitive mechanisms as explained by cortical source activity. Accumulating evidence however indicates that spontaneous eye blinks are not necessarily random, and can be modulated by attention and cognition beyond just physiological necessities. In this exploratory analysis we reanalyze a public EEG dataset of musicians listening to or imagining music (Bach chorales) while simultaneously reading from a sheet of music. We ask whether blink timing in reading music, accompanied by listening or imagery, is sufficient to uniquely identify the music being read from a given score. Intra-subject blink counts and timing are compared across trials using a spike train distance metric (Victor and Purpura, 1997). One-trial-left-out cross-validation is used to identify the music being read with above chance level accuracy (best subject: 56\%, chance: 25\%), where accuracy is seen to vary with subject, condition, and a tunable cost factor for time shifts. Future studies may consider incorporating eye blink contributions to brain decoding, especially in wearables where eye blinks could be easier to record than EEG given their higher amplitudes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13846">Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.13846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which drives and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09523">Functional Ultrasound Imaging Combined with Machine Learning for Whole-Brain Analysis of Drug-Induced Hemodynamic Changes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.09523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a cutting-edge technology that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) by detecting backscattered echoes from red blood cells moving within its field of view (FOV). It offers high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity, allowing for detailed visualization of cerebral blood flow dynamics. While fUSI has been utilized in preclinical drug development studies to explore the mechanisms of action of various drugs targeting the central nervous system, many of these studies rely on predetermined regions of interest (ROIs). This focus may overlook relevant brain activity outside these specific areas, which could influence the results. To address this limitation, we compared three machine learning approaches-convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and vision transformer (ViT)-combined with fUSI to analyze the pharmacodynamics of Dizocilpine (MK-801), a potent non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist commonly used in preclinical models for memory and learning impairments. While all three machine learning techniques could distinguish between drug and control conditions, CNN proved particularly effective due to their ability to capture hierarchical spatial features while maintaining anatomical specificity. Class activation mapping revealed brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, that are significantly affected by drug administration, consistent with the literature reporting a high density of NMDA receptors in these areas. Overall, the combination of fUSI and CNN creates a novel analytical framework for examining pharmacological mechanisms, allowing for data-driven identification and regional mapping of drug effects while preserving anatomical context and physiological relevance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19094">Accurate identification of communication between multiple interacting neural populations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.19094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations, leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS), a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information processing.

                arXiv:2508.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired models known for low power consumption and superior potential for temporal processing, but identifying suitable learning mechanisms remains a challenge. Despite the presence of multiple coexisting learning strategies in the brain, current SNN training methods typically rely on a single form of synaptic plasticity, which limits their adaptability and representational capability. In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired training framework that incorporates multiple synergistic plasticity mechanisms for more effective SNN training. Our method enables diverse learning algorithms to cooperatively modulate the accumulation of information, while allowing each mechanism to preserve its own relatively independent update dynamics. We evaluated our approach on both static image and dynamic neuromorphic datasets to demonstrate that our framework significantly improves performance and robustness compared to conventional learning mechanism models. This work provides a general and extensible foundation for developing more powerful SNNs guided by multi-strategy brain-inspired learning.

                arXiv:2508.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to discover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a priori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly used technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an evolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical expressions through the mechanism of natural selection. In this work we analyze the efficiency of the evolutionary search in GP and show that many points in the search space are re-visited and re-evaluated multiple times by the algorithm, leading to wasted computational effort. We address this issue by introducing a caching mechanism based on the Zobrist hash, a type of hashing frequently used in abstract board games for the efficient construction and subsequent update of transposition tables. We implement our caching approach using the open-source framework Operon and demonstrate its performance on a selection of real-world regression problems, where we observe up to 34\% speedups without any detrimental effects on search quality. The hashing approach represents a straightforward way to improve runtime performance while also offering some interesting possibilities for adjusting search strategy based on cached information.

                arXiv:2508.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation (EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and superior query efficiency.

                arXiv:2508.13436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge. Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by (1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space. Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection, meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space reduction strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13812">Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.13812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications. This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse (A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable attack success rate.

Abstract: Cellular automata and their differentiable counterparts, Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), are highly expressive and capable of surprisingly complex behaviors. This paper explores how NCAs perform when applied to tasks requiring precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) as a domain that challenges their capabilities in ways not previously explored. Specifically, this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and training constraints, this work examines the behavior and properties of NCAs applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing systems.

                arXiv:2407.10780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a common discussion. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a method for decorrelating inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, and expand on these to provide a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, benefit significantly in their accuracy and convergence speed. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.

">White Matter Tract Vulnerability to Amyloid Pathology on the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss, due to the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) plaques, followed by tau pathology, and a gradually spreading pattern of neuronal loss. Understanding how amyloid positivity affects the brain's neural pathways is critical for understanding how the brain changes with AD pathology. Tractometry offers a powerful approach for the in vivo, 3D quantitative assessment of white matter tracts, enabling the localization of microstructural abnormalities in diseased populations and those at risk. In this study, we applied BUAN (Bundle Analytics) tractometry to multi-cohort diffusion MRI data from a total of 1,908 participants: 606 participants in ADNI3 (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 3) and 1,302 participants from the HABS-HD (Health and Aging Brain Study - Healthy Diversity). Using BUAN and along-tract statistical analysis, we assessed the localized effects of amyloid positivity, potentially mediated by tau, on white matter pathways, with amyloid positivity quantified via amyloid-sensitive positron emission tomography (PET). BUAN enables tract-specific quantification of white matter microstructure and supports statistical testing along the full length of fiber bundles to detect subtle, spatially localized associations. We present 3D visualizations of tract-wise amyloid associations, highlighting distinct patterns of white matter degeneration in AD.

">Discrete Subfields and Continuous Gradients Coexist: A Multi-Scale View of Hippocampal Organization</a></h4>

              
                The human hippocampus is studied via two competing frameworks: one dividing it into discrete anatomical subfields with distinct computational processes, and another describing it as a continuous, functional gradients along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes. How these organizational principles relate to one another, particularly regarding intrinsic neural timescales of the hippocampus, remains unknown. Here, we used high-resolution resting-state fMRI to investigate how single-voxel autocorrelation, a measure of intrinsic neural timescale, maps onto hippocampal subfields. We found evidence for a hybrid organization. First, consistent with our predictions, we observed significantly higher autocorrelation (longer timescales) in the subiculum compared to the other subfields. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that CA1, which is implicated in integration, had low autocorrelation whereas CA2/3 and CA4DG, which are linked to pattern separation, had intermediate autocorrelation. Second, we discovered that the overarching anterior-posterior and medial-lateral gradients of autocorrelation were recapitulated within each individual subfield. Finally, data-driven clusters of autocorrelation values aligned more strongly with the continuous gradients than with the discrete anatomical boundaries, particularly in the right hemisphere. These results suggest that the discrete and continuous views of hippocampal organization are not mutually exclusive but coexist across different spatial scales. We therefore propose a new comprehensive model of hippocampal function that integrates both its modular, subfield-specific properties and its graded, large-scale organization.

">Functional organization of multisensory integration network in children and youth with neurodevelopmental disorders predicts clinical sensory issues</a></h4>

              
                Differences in sensory processing in neurodevelopmental conditions, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), cascade into downstream clinical symptomatology. This includes differences in combining sensory information from multiple modalities into a unified percept, known as multisensory integration. Little is known about the functional organization of multisensory network (MSN) in these groups, its relation to clinical sensory issues, or its interaction with other higher-order cortical networks. We examined resting-state fMRI data from 417 participants in the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Network (ASD=174, ADHD=130, Typical Development=113; Mean age=11.96, SD = 4.10). Timeseries data were extracted from the MSN and seven additional resting-state cortical networks (RSNs). Undirected and directed functional connectivity (FC) metrics were computed within the MSN and between the MSN and other RSNs. FC was compared across diagnoses and related to clinical sensory characteristics. The thalamus emerged as a hub region in both undirected and directed FC within the MSN and between the MSN-RSNs. Some diagnosis-related differences were observed, with increased MSN-RSN FC particularly in ADHD; however, associations with sensory characteristics were stronger in both undirected and directed FC within the MSN and between the MSN-RSNs, regardless of diagnosis. Converging evidence was seen in data-driven clusters based on FC metrics, which did not align with diagnosis, but instead mapped on to the overall level of sensory issues reported. That the data-driven clusters sorted not by diagnosis but by sensory characteristics suggests that these sensory characteristics and their underlying neurobiology are transdiagnostic in nature as opposed to specific to ASD or ADHD.

">Distinct roles of hippocampus and neocortex in symbolic compositional generalization</a></h4>

              
                Humans can combine symbols to generate new meanings. Here, we studied the regional neural mechanisms that might make this possible. We asked participants to combine two discrete, symbolic features (a shape and a colour) to make a novel spatial inference. BOLD data suggested that the hippocampus encoded elementary visual attributes in a high-dimensional, parallel format that permitted flexible individuation. In ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and primary visual cortex (V1), neural patterns for novel stimuli (composites) could be predicted as a linear combination of signals for familiar stimuli (elements). In vmPFC, this composition occurred in a high-dimensional format, but in PPC and V1, it took place in a low-dimensional, spatial, response-consistent frame of reference. These data offer new insights into the neural circuit underlying compositional generalization.

Whether the onset of sensory organ motor control directly influences the development of corresponding sensory cortices remains unknown. Here, we confirm and exploit the late onset of whisking behavior in mice to address this question in the somatosensory system. Using ex vivo electrophysiology, we describe a transient increase in the intrinsic excitability of excitatory neurons in layer IV of the barrel cortex, which processes whisker input, immediately following the onset of active whisking on postnatal days 13 and 14. This increase in neuronal gain is specific to layer IV, independent of changes in synaptic strength, and requires prior sensory experience. Further, these effects are not expressed in inhibitory interneurons in barrel cortex. The transient increase in excitability is not evident in layer II/III of barrel cortex or in the visual cortex upon eye opening, suggesting a unique interaction between the development of active sensing and the thalamocortical input layer in the somatosensory isocortex. Predictive modeling indicates that, immediately following the onset of active whisking, changes in active membrane conductances alone can reliably distinguish neurons in control but not whisker-deprived hemispheres. Our findings demonstrate an experience-dependent, lamina-specific refinement of neuronal excitability tightly linked to the emergence of active whisking. This transient increase in the gain of the thalamic input layer coincides with a critical period for synaptic plasticity in downstream layers, suggesting a role in cortical maturation and sensory processing.</p>

                <p>by Mohamed Fawzy, Joseph A. Marsh</p>

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are central to diverse cellular processes but present unique challenges for interpreting genetic variants implicated in human disease. Unlike structured protein domains, IDRs lack stable three-dimensional conformations and are often involved in regulation through transient interactions and post-translational modifications. These features can affect both the distribution of pathogenic variants and the performance of computational tools used to predict their effects. Here, we systematically assessed the distribution of pathogenic <i>vs</i> benign missense variants across disordered, intermediate, and structured protein regions in the human proteome. Pathogenic variants were notably depleted in IDRs yet were associated with distinct molecular mechanisms, particularly dominant gain- and loss-of-function effects. We evaluated 33 variant effect predictors (VEPs), revealing widespread reductions in sensitivity for pathogenic variants in IDRs, despite high AUROC scores driven by accurate benign variant predictions. We also observed substantial discordance among VEP classifications in disordered regions, underscoring the need for region-aware thresholds and disorder-informed prediction strategies. Incorporating features reflective of IDR biology, such as transient interaction motifs and modification sites, may enhance the accuracy and interpretability of future tools.

Mathematical models tend to oversimplify the biological details of vaccine or infection-derived immunity effectiveness. [0pc][-1pc]Please check and confirm the corresponding authors have been correctly identified amend if necessary.Yet, epidemiological outcomes may diverge when assuming polarised immunity—individuals are either fully susceptible or completely immune—compared to leaky immunity—where all individuals are partially protected. We explore the differences between the two by taking advantage of a non-Markovian framework, which allows us to explicitly record the ‘age’ of the immunity and vary its effectiveness accordingly. A basic scenario reveals that leaky immunity leads to a shorter time between reinfections. A more data-driven scenario based on SARS-CoV-2 data finds that leaky immunity yields substantially more reinfections than polarised immunity and a higher number of infected individuals, yet with a lower probability of hospitalisation. Our findings emphasize the critical role of immune memory modelling assumptions, especially for long-term epidemiological dynamics and public health policies.

The computational modeling of chromatin structure is highly complex due to the hierarchical organization of chromatin, which reflects its diverse biophysical principles, as well as inherent dynamism, which underlies its complexity. Chromatin structure modeling can be based on diverse approaches and assumptions, making it essential to determine how different methods influence the modeling outcomes. We conducted a project at the NIH-funded 4D Nucleome Hackathon on March 18–21, 2024, at The University of Washington in Seattle, USA. The hackathon provided an amazing opportunity to gather an international, multi-institutional and unbiased group of experts to discuss, understand and undertake the challenges of chromatin model comparison and validation. Here we give an overview of the current state of the 3D chromatin field and discuss our efforts to run and validate the models. We used distance matrices to represent chromatin models and we calculated Spearman correlation coefficients to estimate differences between models, as well as between models and experimental data. In addition, we discuss challenges in chromatin structure modeling that include: 1) different aspects of chromatin biophysics and scales complicate model comparisons, 2) large diversity of experimental data (e.g., population-based, single-cell, protein-specific) that differ in mathematical properties, heatmap smoothness, noise and resolutions complicates model validation, 3) expertise in biology, bioinformatics, and physics is necessary to conduct comprehensive research on chromatin structure, 4) bioinformatic software, which is often developed in academic settings, is characterized by insufficient support and documentation. We also emphasize the importance of establishing guidelines for software development and standardization.

                <p>by Yuki Kubota, Taiki Fukiage</p>

Human depth perception from 2D images is systematically distorted, yet the nature of these distortions is not fully understood. By examining error patterns in depth estimation for both humans and deep neural networks (DNNs), which have shown remarkable abilities in monocular depth estimation, we can gain insights into constructing functional models of this human 3D vision and designing artificial models with improved interpretability. Here, we propose a comprehensive human-DNN comparison framework for a monocular depth judgment task. Using a novel human-annotated dataset of natural indoor scenes and a systematic analysis of absolute depth judgments, we investigate error patterns in both humans and DNNs. Employing exponential-affine fitting, we decompose depth estimation errors into depth compression, per-image affine transformations (including scaling, shearing, and translation), and residual errors. Our analysis reveals that human depth judgments exhibit systematic and consistent biases, including depth compression, a vertical bias (perceiving objects in the lower visual field as closer), and consistent per-image affine distortions across participants. Intriguingly, we find that DNNs with higher accuracy partially recapitulate these human biases, demonstrating greater similarity in affine parameters and residual error patterns. This suggests that these seemingly suboptimal human biases may reflect efficient, ecologically adapted strategies for depth inference from inherently ambiguous monocular images. However, while DNNs capture metric-level residual error patterns similar to humans, they fail to reproduce human-level accuracy in ordinal depth perception within the affine-invariant space. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating error patterns beyond raw accuracy, providing new insights into how humans and computational models resolve depth ambiguity. Our dataset and methodology provide a framework for evaluating the alignment between computational models and human perceptual biases, thereby advancing our understanding of visual space representation and guiding the development of models that more faithfully capture human depth perception.

                <p>by Malte Kobelt, Gerd T. Waldhauser, Marie-Christin Fellner, Nikolai Axmacher</p>

Involuntary memory retrieval is a hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder and a frequent phenomenon in everyday autobiographical memory. However, the neural mechanisms that drive involuntary retrieval remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate how involuntary retrieval spontaneously initiates memory reactivation and how the reactivated neural representations differ in their content, distinctiveness and temporal compression from voluntary retrieval. Combining a visual half-field paradigm with electroencephalography recordings (EEG) in humans, we tracked reactivation of item-specific neural representations and sensory feature representations measured as representational similarity between different items sharing the same sensory feature – the visual field at encoding. We show that involuntary retrieval reactivated sensory feature-dependent yet item-unspecific representations via temporally extended memory replay, accompanied by rapid mid-frontal theta-power increases, indicating memory interference. This neural process differed from voluntary retrieval which recruited goal-directed memory search processes in prefrontal-medial temporal lobe theta-bands to reactivate temporally compressed item-specific representations devoid of visual field specific sensory feature representations at encoding. Our findings demonstrate that involuntary memories rely on distinct neural processes that access different representational formats compared to voluntary retrieval offering a nuanced understanding of episodic memory functioning relevant to psychological well-being.

                Gu et al. showed that in rats fed a high-salt diet, reactive microglia accumulate around vasopressin-secreting neurons, phagocytosing astrocytic elements and pruning astrocytes. This causes glutamate spillover, increased neuronal activity, and excessive vasopressin release, contributing to salt-induced hypertension. The study reveals a novel mechanism by which microglia regulate synaptic transmission and neuronal activity through structural remodeling of astrocytes in the adult brain.

                Zhang, Epstein, and Schaefer et al. generate a temporal single-cell and spatial transcriptomic atlas to reveal the effect of caloric restriction (CR) on mouse brain aging. They show that CR rescues key aging-associated cell population changes and transcriptional signatures, providing mechanistic details of how CR slows the aging process.

                Panthi et al. demonstrate that alternative splicing of the first coding intron of the human IRF7 gene is regulated in a cell- and signal-dependent manner. They also show that the isoform of IRF7 generated by intron retention has enhanced dimerization capacity and enhanced transcriptional activity compared to the shorter, canonical isoform.

                Vander Donck and Victor et al. use synthetic communities and metabolic modeling to explore how Lactobacillus crispatus dominates the vaginal microbiome independently of host factors. They show that L. crispatus forms stable, host-independent communities with other lactobacilli through nutrient sharing, offering insights for microbiome-based therapies.

Such synergy may underly substrate specificity and regulation of the important DEAH helicases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96076">Gliogenesis from the subventricular zone modulates the extracellular matrix at the glial scar after brain ischemia</a></h4>

              
                Activation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) following cerebral ischemia is one of the brain’s early responses to counteract neuron loss and minimize tissue damage. Impaired brain regions communicate with the SVZ through various chemotactic signals that promote cell migration and differentiation, primarily involving neural stem cells, neuroblasts, or glioblasts. However, the activation of gliogenesis and the role of newly formed astrocytes in the post-ischemic scenario remain subjects of debate. We have previously demonstrated that adenosine release after brain ischemia prompts the SVZ to generate new astrocytes. Here, we used transient brain ischemia in mice to identify the cellular origin of these astrocytes within the SVZ neurogenic niche and investigate their role in the pathological process. By combining immunofluorescence, BrdU-tracing, and genetic cell labeling, we tracked the migration of newborn astrocytes, positive for the proteoglycan marker Thbs4, from the dorsal and medial SVZ to the perilesional barrier surrounding the ischemic core, known as the ‘glial scar’. We found that these Thbs4-positive astrocytes modulate the dense extracellular matrix at the lesion border by both synthesizing and degrading hyaluronan. We also show that while the accumulation of hyaluronan at the lesion site is sufficient to recruit newborn astrocytes, its degradation at the SVZ correlates with gliogenesis. These findings suggest that newborn astrocytes could be a promising pharmacological target for modulating the glial scar after brain ischemia and facilitating tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101814">Identification of the trail-following pheromone receptor in termites</a></h4>

              
                Pheromone communication is the cornerstone of eusocial insect societies since it mediates the social hierarchy, division of labor, and concerted activities of colony members. The current knowledge on molecular mechanisms of social insect pheromone detection by odorant receptors (ORs) is limited to bees and ants, while no OR was yet functionally characterized in termites, the oldest eusocial insect clade. Here, we present the first OR deorphanization in termites. We selected four OR sequences from the annotated antennal transcriptome of the termite <i>Prorhinotermes simplex</i> (Psammotermitidae), expressed them in Empty Neuron <i>Drosophila</i>, and functionally characterized them using single sensillum recording (SSR). For one of the selected ORs, PsimOR14, we obtained strong responses to the main component of <i>P. simplex</i> trail-following pheromone, the monocyclic diterpene neocembrene. PsimOR14 showed a narrow tuning to neocembrene with only one additional compound out of 67 tested generating non-negligible responses. We report on homology-based modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of ligand binding by PsimOR14. Subsequently, we used SSR in <i>P. simplex</i> workers and identified the olfactory sensillum responding to neocembrene, thus likely expressing <i>PsimOR14</i>. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>PsimOR14</i> is significantly more expressed in worker antennae compared to soldiers, which correlates with higher sensitivity of workers to neocembrene.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101924">Benchmarking and optimization of methods for the detection of identity-by-descent in high-recombining Plasmodium falciparum genomes</a></h4>

              
                Genomic surveillance is crucial for identifying at-risk populations for targeted malaria control and elimination. Identity-by-descent (IBD) is increasingly being used in <i>Plasmodium</i> population genomics to estimate genetic relatedness, effective population size (<i>N</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>), population structure, and signals of positive selection. Despite its potential, a thorough evaluation of IBD segment detection tools for species with high recombination rates, such as <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, remains absent. Here, we perform comprehensive benchmarking of IBD callers – probabilistic (<span class="monospace">hmmIBD</span>, <span class="monospace">isoRelate</span>), identity-by-state-based (<span class="monospace">hap-IBD</span>, <span class="monospace">phased IBD</span>) and others (<span class="monospace">Refined IBD</span>) – using population genetic simulations tailored for high recombination, and IBD quality metrics at both the IBD segment level and the IBD-based downstream inference level. Our results demonstrate that low marker density per genetic unit, related to high recombination relative to mutation, significantly compromises the accuracy of detected IBD segments. In genomes with high recombination rates resembling <i>P. falciparum</i>, most IBD callers exhibit high false negative rates for shorter IBD segments, which can be partially mitigated through optimization of IBD caller parameters, especially those related to marker density. Notably, IBD detected with optimized parameters allows for more accurate capture of selection signals and population structure; IBD-based <i>N</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> inference is very sensitive to IBD detection errors, with IBD called from <span class="monospace">hmmIBD</span> uniquely providing less biased estimates of <i>N</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> in this context. Validation with empirical data from the MalariaGEN <i>Pf</i>7 database, representing different transmission settings, corroborates these findings. We conclude that context-specific evaluation and parameter optimization are essential for accurate IBD detection in high-recombining species and recommend <span class="monospace">hmmIBD</span> for <i>Plasmodium</i> species, especially for quality-sensitive analyses, such as estimation of <i>N</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>. Our optimization and high-level benchmarking methods not only improve IBD segment detection in high-recombining genomes but also enhance overall genomic analysis, paving the way for more accurate genomic surveillance and targeted intervention strategies for malaria.

">White matter microstructure predicts effort and reward sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                From rodents to humans, animals constantly face a central question: is the reward worth the effort? Effort and reward sensitivity in such situations vary substantially across individuals and ultimately shape goal-directed behavior. Yet, the brain mechanisms underlying this variability across individuals remain unclear. Here, we combined computational modeling of effort and reward sensitivity during decision-making with whole-brain diffusion MRI in 45 healthy participants to identify white matter substrates of individual sensitivity. A data-driven, cluster-based analysis of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity revealed 12 clusters: five linked to effort sensitivity, all within tracts connected to major frontal valuation nodes (e.g., supplementary motor area [SMA], dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC], orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]), and seven linked to reward sensitivity, spanning frontal valuation, fronto-parietal, and sensorimotor networks. The strongest associations involved two SMA-connected clusters, one shared across effort and reward sensitivity and another consistent across both microstructural metrics. Critically, microstructural features from the five effort-related and seven reward-related clusters reliably predicted individual effort and reward sensitivity in out-of-sample machine learning analyses, respectively, whereas randomly sampled clusters did not. SMA-connected tracts were the dominant predictors in these decoding analyses, with additional contributions from fronto-parietal and sensorimotor pathways for reward sensitivity. These findings reveal a distributed white matter architecture underlying inter-individual differences in effort and reward sensitivity, with SMA pathways emerging as central hubs. They demonstrate that localized white matter microstructure can robustly predict these individual differences, offering a framework to forecast the impact of lesions or interventions on goal-directed behavior, including apathy and impulsivity.

">Developmental plasticity facilitates the structural maturation of cochlear inner hair cell ribbon synapses</a></h4>

              
                Sound detection occurs in the cochlea, where sensory inner hair cells (IHC) accurately convert auditory stimuli into neurochemical signals. Presynaptically, IHCs harbor synaptic ribbons, specialized scaffolds that facilitate ultrafast and indefatigable exocytosis. During synapse assembly and subsequent maturation, IHC ribbons increase in volume and synaptic vesicle tethering capacity. This development is thought to result from progressive precursor aggregation. However, the underlying mechanisms of ribbon synapse formation have remained elusive thus far. In this study, we established a novel triple-color live-cell imaging approach to monitor IHC presynaptogenesis in situ. We found that ribbon precursors are highly dynamic and undergo bidirectional plasticity. The presynaptic active zone (AZ) forms a focal point for dramatic structural remodeling of precursors, which the AZ recruits, confines and redistributes. Furthermore, silencing spontaneous synaptic activity decreased precursor mobility and plasticity at the AZ. This suggests a fundamental role for activity-dependent Ca2+ influx in the plastic development shaping the unique properties of auditory ribbon synapses.

">Sleep Renormalizes Negative Emotional Generalization</a></h4>

              
                Overgeneralization of negative experiences, in which aversive responses spread to otherwise safe stimuli, often co-occurs with sleep disruption, and both are central features of anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, we show that sleep shifts emotional generalization away from the negative and toward the positive. Across three experiments combining behavior, fMRI, and sleep electrophysiology, participants learned to associate three faces with positive, negative, or neutral outcomes. Participants were tested using morphed faces that blended the original stimuli in varying proportions. Immediate generalization was assessed post-learning, and delayed generalization was assessed after overnight sleep or daytime wakefulness. Behaviorally, we found that sleep selectively promotes positive generalization, whereas prolonged daytime wakefulness favors generalization of the negative face. In the fMRI scanner, amygdala and limbic activity during outcome processing predicted stronger immediate generalization of the negative face, and subsequent shift from negative to positive face generalization that occurred only after sleep. Overnight sleep spindle activity, extracted from high-density sleep EEG, positively correlated both with positive face generalization and with the shift from negative to positive generalization following sleep. These findings reveal a potential neural mechanism by which sleep attenuates negative bias and enhances positive representations, suggesting a potential method to buffer against maladaptive generalization in anxiety and PTSD.

">Postnatal plasticity in the olfactory system of the juvenile swine brain</a></h4>

              
                Swine have an excellent sense of smell and highly complex olfactory brain structures, which play a crucial role in their complex social interactions. In other mammals the olfactory system is known to exhibit significant plasticity, even during adulthood. The aim of this study was to investigate postnatal plasticity in olfactory areas of juvenile swine brains by studying immature cells immunoreactive for the microtubule-associated protein doublecortin (DCX). Using immunofluorescence, we studied DCX coexpression with the cell proliferation marker Ki-67, and different neuronal markers. Our results show the existence of numerous DCX+ cells throughout the olfactory pallial areas. In some of them, we found DCX+/Ki-67+ coexpressing cells, suggesting that they were proliferating. Some of these proliferating cells were grouped in tangentially-oriented migratory-like chains, forming the rostral migratory stream to anterior olfactory area and olfactory bulb. Moreover, chains of DCX+ cells were found in the external capsule and white matter adjacent to the temporal horn of the ventricle. Chains of DCX+ cells were observed crossing the internal layers of the piriform and entorhinal cortices. In layer II of these cortices, DCX+ cells of varying maturity degrees and neuronal phenotypes (including NeuN expression) were present. This suggests the existence of multiple migratory streams along the anteroposterior axis. Most DCX+ immature cells in the migratory chains and in the anterior olfactory area, piriform and entorhinal cortices expressed the transcription factor Brn2 (Pou3f2), suggesting the incorporation of new glutamatergic neurons in these areas. Together, these results highlight the interest of swine to study the role of postnatal brain plasticity and their potential for regeneration in large, gyrencephalic brains.

">Neuromodulator control of energy reserves in dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a metabolically vulnerable organ as neurons have both high resting metabolic rates and the need for local rapid conversion of carbon sources to ATP during activity. Midbrain dopamine neurons are thought to be particularly vulnerable to metabolic perturbations, as a subset of these are the first to undergo degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder long suspected to be in part driven by deficits in mid-brain bioenergetics (1). In skeletal muscle, energy homeostasis under varying demands is achieved in part by its ability to rely on glycogen as a fuel store, whose conversion to ATP is under hormonal regulatory control. In neurons however the absence of easily observable glycogen granules has cast doubt on whether this fuel store is operational, even though brain neurons express the key regulatory enzymes associated with building or burning glycogen (2). We show here that that in primary mid brain dopaminergic neurons, glycogen availability is under the control of dopamine auto receptors (D2R), such that dopamine itself provides a signal to store glycogen. We find that when glycogen stores are present, they provide remarkable resilience to dopamine nerve terminal function under extreme hypometabolic conditions, but loss of this dopamine derived signal, or impairment of access to glycogen, makes them hypersensitive to fuel deprivation. These data show that neurons can use an extracellular cue to regulate local metabolism and suggest that loss of dopamine secretion might make dopamine neurons particularly subject to neurodegeneration driven by metabolic stress.

">EEG-decodability of facial expressions and their stereoscopic depth cues in immersive virtual reality</a></h4>

              
                Face perception typically occurs in three-dimensional space, where stereoscopic depth cues enrich the perception of facial features. Yet, most neurophysiological research on face processing relies on two-dimensional displays, potentially overlooking the role of stereoscopic depth information. Here, we combine immersive virtual reality (VR), electroencephalography (EEG), and eye tracking to examine the neural representation of faces under controlled manipulations of stereoscopic depth. Thirty-four participants viewed computer-generated faces with neutral, happy, angry, and surprised expressions in frontal view under monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing conditions. Using time-resolved multivariate decoding, we show that EEG signals in immersive VR conditions can reliably differentiate facial expressions. Stereoscopic depth cues elicited a distinct and decodable neural signature, confirming the sensitivity of our approach to depth-related processing. Yet, expression decoding remained robust across depth conditions, indicating that under controlled frontal viewing, the neural encoding of facial expressions is invariant to binocular depth cues. Eye tracking showed that expression-related gaze patterns contained comparable information but did not account for neural representations, while depth information was absent in gaze patterns---consistent with dissociable representational processes. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based neural decoding in fully immersive VR as a tool for investigating face perception in naturalistic settings and provide new evidence for the stability of expression representations across depth variations in three-dimensional viewing conditions.

">Deterministic versus Probabilistic Tractography: Impact on White Matter Bundle Shape</a></h4>

              
                In diffusion MRI-based tractography, deterministic and probabilistic algorithms reconstruct white matter using distinct strategies, yet their impact on bundle morphology remains uncertain. Using bundle shape similarity analysis, we compared both methods for the left arcuate fasciculus (AF_L) (The left arcuate fasciculus is a critical white matter tract that connects language comprehension and production areas in the human brain, enabling fluent language processing) across four datasets: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Human Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-A), National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), and Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING). Probabilistic tractography consistently produced higher inter-subject shape similarity, by capturing broader anatomical trajectories and enhancing reproducibility. However, this extensive coverage may obscure subtle pathological variations critical for clinical detection. Bundle shape similarity analysis with atlas corroborated these findings, showing stronger alignment for probabilistic tracking and highlighting its utility in quantitative quality control. These results emphasize the need to balance morphological consistency with sensitivity to neuroanatomical variation when selecting tractography methods for research and clinical applications.

">Ongoing thoughts at rest reflect functional brain organization and behavior</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)-brain connectivity observed when people rest with no external tasks-predicts individual differences in behavior. Yet, rest is not idle; it involves streams of thoughts. Are these ongoing thoughts reflected in rsFC? To test this question, we developed a novel annotated rest paradigm where participants rated and verbally described their thoughts after each rest period during functional MRI (N = 60). Our findings revealed rich and idiosyncratic thoughts across individuals. Similarity in thoughts was associated with more similar rsFC patterns within and across individuals. In addition, both thought ratings and topics could be decoded from rsFC. Furthermore, neuromarkers of these thoughts generalized to unseen individuals in the Human Connectome Project dataset (N = 908), where decoded thought patterns during rest predicted positive vs. negative trait-level individual differences. Together, our findings reveal that ongoing thoughts at rest are reflected in brain dynamics and these network patterns predict everyday cognition and experiences. Understanding subjective in-scanner experiences is thus crucial in characterizing the relationship between individual differences in functional brain organization and behavior.

">Dynamic representation of sound locations during task engagement in marmoset auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                In auditory cortex, neural responses to stimuli inside receptive fields (RFs) can be further facilitated by behavioral demands, such as attending to a spatial location. It is less clear how off-RF stimuli modulate neural responses and contribute to behavioral tasks. Our recent study revealed a particular form of location-specific facilitation evoked by repeated stimulation from an off-RF location, suggesting behavioral modulation of spatial RFs. To further explore this question, we trained marmosets to attend to sound locations that were either inside or outside the RFs of auditory cortical neurons. The majority of neurons showed increased firing rates at target locations inside their RFs. Interestingly, this increase also occurred outside the RFs, sometimes exceeding the responses at the RF center during passive listening. These task-related off-RF facilitation were much more common in the caudal area than in the rostral area and the primary auditory cortex. A normalization model reproduced the off-RF facilitation using widespread suppression. The model's prediction was confirmed by experimental observations of widespread reductions in firing rate and hyperpolarized membrane potentials for off-RF stimuli. These results suggest that behavioral task demands recruit a broader range of neurons than those that are responsive to a target sound in the passive state.

">Systemic neonatal AAV9 gene therapy delivery improves behavioral and phenotypic outcomes comparable to intracerebroventricular delivery in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick disease, type C1</a></h4>

              
                Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC), is an inherited fatal lysosomal storage disorder caused by a mutation in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes and characterized by impaired lysosomal cholesterol export. Previous studies have demonstrated that delivery of the NPC1 gene to the central nervous system (CNS) via an adeno-associated virus (AAV) can substantially improve lifespan and mitigate signs of disease in Npc1-deficient mouse models of NPC. To determine the optimal parameters for an efficacious AAV-based gene therapy for NPC, we measured the survival and disease phenotypes of mice treated systemically as neonates or at weaning age, along with neonatal mice treated via intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery, with a construct containing either a ubiquitous truncated EF1 promoter or a truncated Mecp2 promoter. While all constructs and delivery methods resulted in improvement compared with baseline, mice treated as neonates survived significantly longer and experienced slower disease progression compared with those treated systemically at weaning age. Systemic delivery to neonates was capable of increasing survival and phenotypic improvement comparable to that of ICV delivery, and neonatal systemic and ICV delivery were both similarly capable of near-total Purkinje cell rescue. We also found no difference between a ubiquitous EF1-derived promoter and an Mecp2-derived promoter. Ultimately, early treatment with maximal access to the CNS, whether via systemic or direct CNS delivery, is key to the efficacy of gene therapy in treating NPC.

                Brain aging is a major risk for neurodegeneration, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we performed an integrative proteo-transcriptomic analysis of the aging mouse brain, uncovering molecular signatures of aging through the assessment of protein aggregation, mRNA relocalization, and comparative proteomics across eight models of premature aging and neurodegeneration. We identified dynamic changes in physiological aging highlighting differences in synaptic maintenance and energy-allocation. These were linked to changes associated with fundamental protein biochemical properties such as size and net charge. Network analysis highlighted a decrease in mitochondrial complex I proteins not compensated at the mRNA level. Aggregation of 60S ribosome subunits indicated deteriorating translation efficiency and was accompanied by mitochondrial and proteasomal imbalance. The analysis of the nine models revealed key similarities and differences between physiological aging and pathology. Overall, our study provides an extensive resource on molecular aging, and offers insights into mechanisms predisposing to neurodegeneration, easily accessible at our Brain Aging and Molecular Atlas Project (BrainAging-MAP) website.

">Strain variation identifies a neural substrate for behavioral evolution in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sexual selection acts on heritable differences within species, driving the parallel diversification of signal production in one sex and behavioral responses in the other. This coevolution implies that sensory preferences are themselves variable traits, yet the neural basis of such variation remains unclear. Here, we identify striking strain-specific differences in Drosophila melanogaster male mate preferences that arise from differential sensitivity to heterospecific female pheromones. We map this variation to an ascending inhibitory pathway targeting a central circuit node known to dynamically pattern courtship. Inhibitory circuits thus emerge as a key locus for shaping mate discrimination via transient suppression of a male's pursuit. Our findings highlight how variation within sensory circuitry serves as a substrate for selection, fueling the evolution of reproductive barriers between species.

                We have developed and validated a pioneering 'IHC/LCM-Seq' method for transcriptome profiling of spatially defined neuronal cell types detected with immunohistochemistry in sections of formaldehyde-fixed human brains. IHC/LCM-Seq provided unprecedented insight, with 14,000-16,000 transcripts identified, into the gene expression landscape of human agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, which drive appetite and energy storage, and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which suppress feeding and promote energy expenditure. These cells differed from each other, and from fertility-regulating kisspeptin neurons, in their distinct enrichments of co-transmitters, transcription factors, and receptors. The AgRP neuron transcriptome was rich in receptors for proinflammatory cytokines, metabolic hormones and growth hormone, whereas POMC neurons expressed reproductive hormone-, glucagon-like peptide- and endocannabinoid receptors. IHC/LCM-Seq, a versatile spatial transcriptomic approach for characterizing cell types in postmortem brains, opened a new window onto molecular mechanisms regulating energy homeostasis in the human hypothalamus and highlighted possible pharmacological targets for weight management.

We recently identified an anatomically diverse population of abdominal interneurons, the DDAG neurons, which express the Tlx-like nuclear receptor dissatisfaction (dsf) and influence several female mating behaviors. Here, we searched the dsf locus for cis-regulatory enhancer fragments that regulate its spatial expression in the adult and larval central nervous system. We found several enhancers, most located within two introns, that drove reporter expression in subsets of dsf-expressing neurons throughout the brain and nerve cord. Using one of these enhancers, we genetically isolated a single subtype of female-specific DDAG local interneurons. Optogenetic activation of these neurons triggered vaginal plate opening in both unmated and mated females, a behavior used by Drosophila females to signal receptivity to courting males. Our findings offer new reagents to target dsf-expressing cells and new insights into the neural substrates in Drosophila females that express their mating decisions during courtship.

">An Anterior Cingulate Cortex Neuronal Ensemble Controls Contextual Opioid Analgesic Tolerance</a></h4>

              
                Despite well-established cellular and molecular adaptations, opioid analgesic tolerance can be rapidly reversed in settings where these drugs are not expected. The specific neuronal populations that orchestrate this expectation-based tolerance remain poorly defined. In this study, we used a contextual tolerance training method alongside whole-brain clearing and immunostaining to identify brain regions involved in contextual tolerance and to pinpoint a specific neuronal ensemble in the ACC activated by this process. We observed that calcium activity in principal neurons of the ACC is suppressed by fentanyl in opioid-naive mice or during contextual reversal but not during contextual tolerance. Chemogenetic silencing of the ACC induced tolerance reversal in the opioid-associated context without affecting thermal nociception in opioid-free mice. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of the ACC contextual tolerance-active neuronal ensemble triggered analgesic tolerance in an unassociated context. This research highlights a role for ACC neuronal ensembles in mediating expectation-driven, contextual opioid analgesic tolerance without affecting basal nociception. Therefore, modulating the ACC could provide a promising strategy to improve pain relief while maintaining the essential ability to detect harmful stimuli.

">Large vision model framework for automated C. elegans analysis: From static morphometry to dynamic neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Quantitative phenotyping of Caenorhabditis elegans is essential across numerous fields, yet data extraction remains a significant analytical bottleneck. Traditional segmentation methods, typically reliant on pixel-intensity thresholding, are highly sensitive to variations in imaging conditions and often fail in the presence of noise, overlaps, or uneven illumination. These failures necessitate meticulous experimental setups, expensive hardware, or extensive manual curation, which reduces throughput and introduces bias. Here, we introduce TWARDIS (Tools for Worm Automated Recognition & Dynamic Imaging System), a modular, Python-based analysis suite that leverages large foundation vision models, specifically the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) and a fine-tuned vision transformer classifier, to overcome these limitations. We demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our AI compound system across diverse modalities. For static morphological analysis, TWARDIS successfully resolved overlapping worms in noisy images without human intervention, showing a 0.999 correlation with manual segmentation. In behavioral assays (swimming and crawling), the pipeline enabled high-definition postural analysis even in low-resolution, wide-field recordings where the worm occupied only ~0.25% of the field of view, accurately resolving complex postures without frame rejection. Finally, when applied to calcium imaging of semi-restricted animals, TWARDIS provided precise, frame-by-frame segmentation of neural compartments, reducing the artificial signal flattening common in traditional region-of-interest-based approaches and enabling the extraction of biologically accurate, absolute head positions. The system's hardware-scalable architecture and modular design ensure both current accessibility and future improvements without restructuring. By automating the most time-consuming aspects of image analysis, TWARDIS removes critical bottlenecks and tradeoffs in C. elegans research, enabling researchers to focus on biological questions rather than technical image processing challenges.

">Choroid plexus sex differences in secretory signalling and immune compartments</a></h4>

              
                The choroid plexus (ChP)- cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) axis is emerging as a key regulator of the brain environment. The ChP is a multi-functional structure, which forms the blood-CSF barrier, and acts as a sensor of inputs from the periphery and the brain, dynamically responding by modulating its secretome into the CSF. However, sex differences in the ChP have been little explored. Molecular profiling of the adult mouse ChP at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels revealed sex differences across multiple cell types, with immune signatures enriched in females. Interestingly, border associated macrophages showed distinct sex differences in the stromal and epiplexus compartments. We further uncovered sex differences in ChP secretory signalling, with functional differences between males and females. Finally, the human LVChP showed largely similar sex differences. Together, our findings highlight that sex differences may play an important role in ChP function in both health and disease.

">Neuroinflammation in Olfactory Circuits Underlies Odor Hypersensitivity in a Rodent Model of Depression</a></h4>

              
                Depression can affect quality of life in several ways, including reduced concentration, motivation, and energy. Olfactory anhedonia in depressed patients results in a decreased attraction to pleasant smells and increased aversion to unpleasant odors. We used the Unpredictable Chronic Mild Stress (UCMS) as an induced-depression model to study olfactory perception and avoidance in mice of both sexes. After inducing a depression-like state, we observed an increased sensitivity to aversive odorants as well as an associated increase in escape behavior in an odorized environment. Previous studies using a similar model of induced depression have demonstrated increased neuroinflammation in brain areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex, but few have explored the effects in olfactory processing centers. We used immunohistochemistry to measure changes in astrocytic activation and microglia in multiple olfactory regions of the brain to further investigate the connection between neuroinflammation and odor hypersensitivity. We found an increase in the number of astrocytes in the medial amygdala, which receives direct input from the accessory olfactory bulb, and more complex microglial morphology in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex. Additional analysis revealed a relationship between the extent of neuroinflammation and odor aversion. Our findings indicate that glial cells in sensory processing centers are sensitive to stress-induced depression and contribute to altered olfactory perception.

">Depression symptoms enhance goal-directed behavior underuncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Achieving goals in uncertain environments requires integrating expected benefits, costs, and the likelihood of outcomes - processes that may be disrupted in depression. Although depression is characterized by affective and motivational biases, the computational mechanisms by which these symptoms shape goal-directed decision-making remain poorly understood. We investigated these mechanisms using a novel goal-directed decision task. After learning the structure of the environments, participants (n = 384) chose between certain rewards and risky goals varying in both reward magnitude and distance, where greater goal distance led to higher compounded risk of failure. Using transdiagnostic symptom factors derived from clinical questionnaires, we found that individuals with higher apathy-anhedonia symptoms reported lower expectations of goal success yet showed enhanced performance across multiple aspects of goal-directed behavior. These results reveal a dissociation between perceived risk and its influence on choice in individuals with motivational symptoms, and uncover a novel positive link between these symptoms and adaptive behavior.

">Neural representation of emotional valence in human amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala is a core structure for encoding the affective value of external stimuli. Animal studies suggest that positive and negative emotions are separately encoded by distinct neuronal populations within the amygdala; however, this hypothesis has rarely been tested in humans. The current study examined this hypothesis by comparing the distributed emotion encoding model, as proposed in animal studies, with the univariate emotion encoding model using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging. More specifically, we applied univariate regression, using average amygdala activation to represent global activation level, and multivariate regression, using distributed voxel-level pattern within the amygdala, to predict normative valence of affective images from the IAPS library. In the core amygdala, the multivariate model prediction performance was not better than that of the univariate model, with weight map analysis revealing an overwhelming predominance of voxels selectively responsive to negative stimuli. When the region of interest was expanded to include voxels with lower anatomical probability of belonging to the amygdala as well as voxels from adjacent areas, the multivariate model significantly outperformed the univariate model, with the voxels selectively responsive to positive valence primarily located in regions surrounding the core amygdala. These findings suggest that in the human amygdala, the core region encodes emotional valence primarily through a global activation signal, rather than distributed patterns consisting of separate clusters of positive and negative voxels, and a more distributed valence representation emerges when voxels surrounding the amygdala are taken into consideration.

">Low-intensity focused ultrasound to human amygdala reveals a causal role in ambiguous emotion processing and alters local and network-level activity</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala is a core region changed in depression, a disorder characterized by compromised emotion, motivation and learning processes. However, lesion studies in humans examining amygdala function have largely focused on its role in processing fear. It currently remains unclear what causal role the human amygdala plays in more complex emotion, motivation and learning processes in daily life. This is because it has not been possible to reversibly modulate amygdala activity non-invasively in humans. Here, we used transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) to bilaterally perturb neural activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). In separate sessions (n = 87), 29 healthy volunteers received offline-TUS to bilateral BLA, mid-insula or sham before playing a novel emotional learning task validated in an independent large cohort online (n = 210). 7T-resting-state and metabolite signals clearly demonstrated target engagement. BLA-TUS reduced the BLA's connectivity fingerprint and decreased its excitation/inhibition balance, suggesting an inhibitory effect of our TUS protocol on BLA activity. In behaviour, BLA-TUS caused a stimulation volume-dependent increase in the tendency to approach neutral, emotionally ambiguous faces, treating them more similarly to happy faces, and a slowing of reaction times for those two emotion categories. These effects were functionally and regionally specific and suggest a causal role for the amygdala in resolving emotional ambiguity. Our results provide important insights for future studies into mood disorders where ambiguous situations might be harder to resolve, which could contribute to existing emotional and learning biases.

                Depression shows significant sex differences in prevalence and neurobiological underpinnings, yet preclinical research investigating the pathophysiology of depression and the efficacy of antidepressants has predominantly relied on male models. Here, we establish a novel female chronic social defeat stress paradigm by leveraging the natural aggression of parous CD1 females, co-housed with castrated males to induce aggression while eliminating confounding sexual behaviors and without hormonal or surgical manipulations. Selected aggressive females reliably displayed offensive behaviors toward C57BL/6NCrl intruders across repeated encounters. Defeated female mice exhibited pronounced depression-like behaviors, including social withdrawal, anhedonia, behavioral despair, and elevated anxiety-like responses. Biochemical analysis revealed elevated glutamate levels in Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) and caudate putamen (CPu). Alterations in EAAT1, GRIN2B, and Neurabin expression were observed in CPu, indicating excitotoxic stress and compromised synaptic integrity. Label free Quantitative MS-MS analysis of NAc revealed 1194 significantly dysregulated proteins. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis highlighted canonical pathway disruptions in synaptogenesis signaling pathway and glutamate signaling pathway. Disease and function analysis revealed enrichment in neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Given the extensive literature on male CSDS and its established pathophysiology, we aimed and successfully developed female-specific replica model of traditional male CSDS, enabling direct comparison and elucidation of sex differences in depression pathophysiology.

                Neural transplantation holds the potential to repair damaged neural circuits in neurological diseases. However, it remains unknown how the grafted neurons project axons to and make functional connections with the appropriate targets to repair the damaged circuit at the adult stage. Here we report that human cortical progenitors, transplanted into the ischemic mouse motor cortex, matured and integrated into cortical and subcortical neural circuits including the corticospinal tract. Neuronal tracing combined with single-nuclei RNA sequencing revealed the close relationship between the transcription profiles of a cortical neuronal subtype, especially those of axon guidance and synapse assembly, with the specific target projection and synapse organization. Machine learning-based regression further identified the transcriptional codes for the targeted projection and circuit integration to reconstruct the damaged circuits. Our finding opens a promising strategy for treating neurological diseases through promoting regeneration and neural transplantation.

">A neural entero-pancreatic pathway that regulatesinsulin secretion and glucose tolerance</a></h4>

              
                Signals from the gut enhance pancreatic secretion of insulin and thus influence glucose metabolism. This phenomenon, known as the incretin effect, is thought to be mediated by hormones secreted from enteroendocrine cells. The endocrine model, however, does not fully capture the complexity of gut-pancreas interactions. Anatomical studies identified a direct neural connection between the gut and the pancreas, known as the entero-pancreatic plexus. The role of this connection in regulating glucose metabolism remains unknown. Here we identify and functionally characterize a subpopulation of nitridergic myenteric neurons in the proximal duodenum that project directly to the pancreas. The anatomical and transcriptomic signature of these neurons places them downstream of glutamatergic and enkephalinergic enteric interneurons that indirectly respond to luminal nutrient stimuli. Their axonal projections to the pancreas contact neuro-insular ganglia and reach into the islet parenchyma. When activated chemogenetically, this circuit increases Ca2+ responses in pancreatic beta cells, enhances insulin secretion, and improves glucose tolerance in vivo. Our findings reveal a direct gut-pancreas neural pathway that complements incretin signaling in potentiating insulin secretion. This unexpectedly strong neuronal modulation of beta cell function could be harnessed to improve glycemic control in diabetes.

">Revisiting alpha-theta cross-frequency dynamics during working memory</a></h4>

              
                Prior Electroencephalography (EEG) research has shown that during working memory delay, alpha (8-14 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations tend to form a 2:1 frequency ratio. According to the Binary Hierarchy Brain Body Oscillation Theory (BHBBOT), a recent model grounded in mathematical analysis, such harmonic (2:1) alpha-theta frequency configurations reflect enhanced connectivity between brain regions generating these rhythms. However, this prediction has not yet been empirically tested. In this study, we leveraged Information Theory and the Theory of Weakly Coupled Oscillators (TWCO) to examine whether the previously observed frequency modulations in alpha and theta rhythms during working memory are accompanied by changes in inter-areal connectivity. Contrary to the BHBBOT predictions, both Information Theory metrics and TWCO parameters showed that connectivity between frontal theta and parietal alpha rhythms was significantly reduced during the working-memory delay period (while the proportion of 2:1 ratios increased). In addition, phase locking value, a standard measure of synchrony, was also significantly reduced during working memory delay and was negatively associated with behavioural performance. In conclusion, our results show that the increased occurrence of 2:1 alpha:theta cross-frequency ratios during working memory reflects functional segregation (rather than integration) between frontal and parietal regions.

">The TRP-channel painless mediates substrate stiffness sensing in the legs during Drosophila oviposition</a></h4>

              
                The distinct textural properties of fruits in varying stages of ripening present unique ecological opportunities for several species of fruit flies, resulting, over evolutionary times, in specialized egg-laying behaviors. In this study we identified a TrpA channel-dependent mechanosensory pathway in the legs, through the gene painless, that modulates the discernment of softer patches for oviposition in gravid D. melanogaster females. We report that the stiffness-sensing role of tarsi is mediated through external sensory organs housed, namely ventral mechanosensory bristles and subsets of campaniform sensilla present primarily at the joints between tarsomeres. Our findings provide new evidence that campaniform sensilla function as indirect stiffness sensors of oviposition substrates, owing to their placement at joints that experience maximal cuticular distortion. We show that Painless is expressed in mechanosensory neurons innervating peripheral organs where it likely participates in the transduction of stiffness-evoked stimuli. Furthermore, we observed that overexpression of painless in both campaniform sensilla and mechanosensory bristles partially rescues preference for the softer substrates in painless mutants, indicating that painless activity in these organs is necessary to mediate the preference. We propose that different interactions with a soft vs. a hard substrate (compression of the cuticle, distribution of contacts) results in differential mechanotransduction in painless-expressing neurons, determining oviposition preferences.

Parity asymmetry responses emerged significantly over the occipito-temporal (OT) cortex, and were larger than control asymmetry responses to isolated physical stimulus differences, replicating a previous study. Following 20-s adaptation to cross-font even numerals, larger parity responses were recorded over the right OT cortex, further supporting distinct representations of even/odd numbers; there was no corresponding control adaptation effect. Interestingly, adaptation to even canonical dot stimuli also produced significantly larger parity asymmetry responses; adaptation to even number words trended non-significantly. These results are in line with parity being processed automatically, even across formats. More generally, they suggest that parity is a useful means for probing abstract representation of number in the human brain.</span>

                <p>The two main cell types in the striatum, dopamine receptor 1 and adenosine receptor 2a spiny projection neurons (D1-SPNs and A2A-SPNs), have distinct roles in regulating motor- and reward-related behaviors. Cre-selective CRISPR-dCas9 systems allow for cell-type specific, epigenomic-based manipulation of gene expression with gene-specific single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and have potential to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying striatal subtype mediated behaviors. Conditional transgenic Rosa26:LSL-dCas9-p300 mice were recently generated to allow for robust expression of dCas9-p300 expression with Cre-driven cell-type specificity. This system utilizes p300, a histone acetyltransferase which regulates gene expression by unwinding chromatin and making that region of the genome more accessible for transcription. Rosa26-LSL-dCas9-p300 mice were paired with Drd1-Cre and Ador2a-Cre mice to generate Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 and Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 mouse lines and underwent behavioral phenotyping when sgRNAs were not present. Both Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 and Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 have cell-type&ndash;specific expression of spCas9 mRNA. Baseline behavioral assessments revealed that, under a sgRNA absent nontargeted state, Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 mice display repetitive spinning behavior, hyperlocomotion, and enhanced acquisition of reward learning in comparison with all genotypic littermates. In contrast, Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 do not exhibit any changes in behavior in comparison with their littermates. Electrophysiological recordings of dorsal striatum D1-SPNs revealed that Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 mice have increased input resistance and increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude, together suggesting greater excitatory drive of D1-SPNs. Overall, these data demonstrate the necessity to validate CRISPR-dCas9 lines for research investigations. Additionally, the Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 line has the potential to be used to study underlying mechanisms of stereotypy and reward learning.</p>

                <p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a pivotal role in processing pain and emotion, communicating with both cortical and subcortical regions involved in these functions. The claustrum (CLA), a subcortical region with extensive connectivity to the ACC, also plays a critical role in pain perception and consciousness. Both ACC and CLA express Kappa (KOR), Mu (MOR), and Delta (DOR) opioid receptors, yet whether and how opioid receptors modulate this circuit are poorly understood. This study investigates the effects of opioid receptor activation on glutamatergic signaling in CLA-&gt;ACC circuitry using spatial transcriptomics, brain slice electrophysiology, optogenetics, and pharmacological approaches in mice of both sexes. Our results demonstrated that excitatory synaptic transmission generated by the CLA onto Layer 5 pyramidal (L5 PYR) cells in the ACC are reduced by KOR, MOR, and DOR agonists. However, only KOR agonists reduce monosynaptic transmission from the CLA onto L5 ACC PYR cells, highlighting the unique role of KOR in modulating the CLA-&gt;ACC pathway. MOR and DOR agonists only reduced slower, longer-latency recurrent excitatory responses. These findings provide new insights into how opioid receptors regulate the claustrocingulate circuit and demonstrate the distinct, receptor-specific modulation of synaptic transmission within this network.</p>

                <p>by Farhad Razi, Belén Sancristóbal</p>

Perceptual awareness of auditory stimuli decreases from wakefulness to sleep, largely due to reduced cortical responsiveness. During wakefulness, neural responses to external stimuli in most cortical areas exhibit a broader spatiotemporal propagation pattern compared to deep sleep. A potential mechanism for this phenomenon is the synaptic upscaling of cortical excitatory connections during wakefulness, as posited by the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis. However, we argue that uniform synaptic upscaling alone cannot fully account for this observation. We propose a novel mechanism suggesting that the upscaling of excitatory connections between different cortical areas exceeds that within individual cortical areas during wakefulness. Our computational results demonstrate that the former promotes the transfer of neural responses and information, whereas the latter has diminishing effects. These findings highlight the necessity of heterogeneous synaptic upscaling and suggest the presence of heterogeneity in receptor expression for neuromodulators involved in synaptic modulation along the dendrite.

                <p>by Fenil R. Doshi, Talia Konkle, George A. Alvarez</p>

Deep neural network models provide a powerful experimental platform for exploring core mechanisms underlying human visual perception, such as perceptual grouping and contour integration—the process of linking local edge elements to arrive at a unified perceptual representation of a complete contour. Here, we demonstrate that feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fine-tuned on contour detection show this human-like capacity, but without relying on mechanisms proposed in prior work, such as lateral connections, recurrence, or top-down feedback. We identified two key properties needed for ImageNet pre-trained, feed-forward models to yield human-like contour integration: first, progressively increasing receptive field structure served as a critical architectural motif to support this capacity; and second, biased fine-tuning for contour-detection specifically for gradual curves (~20 degrees) resulted in human-like sensitivity to curvature. We further demonstrate that fine-tuning ImageNet pretrained models uncovers other hidden human-like capacities in feed-forward networks, including uncrowding (reduced interference from distractors as the number of distractors increases), which is considered a signature of human perceptual grouping. Thus, taken together these results provide a computational existence proof that purely feedforward hierarchical computations are capable of implementing gestalt “good continuation” and perceptual organization needed for human-like contour-integration and uncrowding. More broadly, these results raise the possibility that in human vision, later stages of processing play a more prominent role in perceptual-organization than implied by theories focused on recurrence and early lateral connections.

                <p>by Hui Yuan, Mingzhu Liu, Yushan Qiu, Wai-Ki Ching, Quan Zou</p>

The development of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technologies has enabled the simultaneous analysis of multi-omics data within the same cell. Accurate clustering of these cells is crucial for downstream analyses of complex biological functions. Despite significant advances in multi-omics integration approaches, current methodologies exhibit two major limitations. First, they inadequately incorporate prior biological knowledge from various omic layers. Second, these methods often conduct independent dimensionality reduction on individual omic datasets, thereby failing to capture the intrinsic complementary information and potentially overlooking crucial cross-platform interactions. Motivated by these, this study investigates a non-negative matrix factorization model called PLNMFG, which integrates the unified latent representation learning that retains the features between and within omics and the cluster structure learning that retains the intrinsic structure of the data into one joint framework. Specially, PLNMFG performs adaptive imputation to handle dropout events and uses prior pseudo-labels as constraints during the process of collective non-negative matrix factorization, as a result, a more robust latent representation that preserves the double similarity information is obtained. Graph Laplacian constraint is applied during clustering which further preserves structure characteristic of multi-omics data. In addition, the weight of each omic is adaptively learned based on the omic contribution. A series of experiments on 8 benchmark datasets show that our model performs well in terms of clustering accuracy and computational efficiency.

                <p>by Thien-Minh Le, Jukka-Pekka Onnela</p>

Infectious disease modeling is used to forecast epidemics and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Although the core assumption of mass-action models of homogeneously mixed population is often implausible, they are nevertheless routinely used in studying epidemics and provide useful insights. Network models can account for the heterogeneous mixing of populations, which is especially important for studying sexually transmitted diseases. Despite the abundance of research on mass-action and network models, the relationship between them is not well understood. Here, we attempt to bridge the gap by first identifying a spreading rule that results in an exact match between disease spreading on a fully connected network and the classic mass-action models. We then propose a method for mapping epidemic spread on arbitrary networks to a form similar to that of mass-action models. We also provide a theoretical justification for the procedure. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed method in the theoretical analysis of reproduction numbers and the estimation of model parameters using synthetic data based on an empirical network. The method proves advantageous in explicitly handling both finite and infinite networks, significantly reducing the computation time required to estimate model parameters for spreading processes on networks. These findings help us understand when mass-action models and network models are expected to provide similar results and identify reasons when they do not.

                <p>by Francesca Mastrogiuseppe, Joana Carmona, Christian K. Machens</p>

The geometrical and statistical properties of brain activity depend on the way neurons connect to form recurrent circuits. However, the link between connectivity structure and emergent activity remains incompletely understood. We investigate this relationship in recurrent neural networks with additive stochastic inputs. We assume that the synaptic connectivity can be expressed in a low-rank form, parameterized by a handful of connectivity vectors, and examine how the geometry of emergent activity relates to these vectors. Our findings reveal that this relationship critically depends on the dimensionality of the external stochastic inputs. When inputs are low-dimensional, activity remains low-dimensional, and recurrent dynamics influence it within a subspace spanned by a subset of the connectivity vectors, with dimensionality equal to the rank of the connectivity matrix. In contrast, when inputs are high-dimensional, activity also becomes potentially high-dimensional. The contribution of recurrent dynamics is apparent within a subspace spanned by the totality of the connectivity vectors, with dimensionality equal to twice the rank of the connectivity matrix. Applying our formalism to excitatory-inhibitory networks, we discuss how the input configuration also plays a crucial role in determining the amount of amplification generated by non-normal dynamics. Our work provides a foundation for studying activity in structured brain circuits under realistic noise conditions, and offers a framework for interpreting stochastic models inferred from experimental data.

G-quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acid secondary structures with important regulatory functions. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), one of the most common forms of genetic variation, can potentially impact the formation of G4 structures if they occur within G4 regions. However, there is currently a lack of software tools specifically designed to assess such effects. Here, we present an R/Bioconductor package named G4SNVHunter, which enables rapid detection of variants that may disrupt G4 structures. This tool, based on the core principles of the G4Hunter algorithm, can provide precise quantitative assessment of the propensity for G4 formation within genomic sequences. Specialized experimental methods can then be designed based on the results provided by G4SNVHunter to further verify the specific functions of the affected G4 structures, facilitating deeper insights into the biological impacts of genetic variants from the perspective of G4 structures. To showcase the functionality of the G4SNVHunter package, we analyzed the Neandertal and Denisovan archaic introgressed variants detected by the Sprime software, and identified approximately 5,800 variants located within G4 regions, among which around 230 may impair G4 structure formation propensity. The source code for the G4SNVHunter package has been publicly released under the MIT license at https://github.com/rongxinzh/G4SNVHunter and https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/G4SNVHunter.html.

                <p>by Xunxun Wang, Ya-Zhou Shi</p>

Understanding the three-dimensional (3D) structure and stability of DNA is essential for elucidating its biological functions and advancing structure-based drug design. Here, we present an improved coarse-grained (CG) model for <i>ab initio</i> prediction of DNA folding, integrating a refined electrostatic potential, replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations, and weighted histogram analysis. The model accurately predicts the 3D structures of DNA with multi-way junctions (e.g., achieving a mean RMSD of ~8.8 Å for top-ranked structures across four DNAs with three- or four-way junctions) from sequence, outperforming existing fragment-assembly and AI-based approaches. The model also reproduces the thermal stability of junctions across diverse sequences and lengths, with predicted melting temperatures deviating by less than 5 °C from experimental values, under both monovalent (Na⁺) and divalent (Mg<sup>2</sup>⁺) ionic conditions. Furthermore, analysis of the thermal unfolding pathways reveals that the overall stability of multi-way junctions is primarily determined by the relative free energies of key intermediate states. These results provide a robust framework for predicting complex DNA architectures and offer mechanistic insights into DNA folding and function.

                <p>by Amy Gill, Karina Kinghorn, Victoria L. Bautch, Feilim Mac Gabhann</p>

Constitutively secreted by endothelial cells, soluble FLT1 (sFLT1 or sVEGFR1) binds and sequesters extracellular vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), thereby reducing VEGF binding to VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream signaling. In doing so, sFLT1 plays an important role in vascular development and in the patterning of new blood vessels in angiogenesis. Here, we develop multiple mechanistic models of sFLT1 secretion and identify a minimal mechanistic model that recapitulates key qualitative and quantitative features of temporal experimental datasets of sFLT1 secretion from multiple studies. We show that the experimental data on sFLT1 secretion is best represented by a delay differential equation (DDE) system including a maturation term, reflecting the time required between synthesis and secretion. Using optimization to identify appropriate values for the key mechanistic parameters in the model, we show that two model parameters (extracellular degradation rate constant and maturation time) are very strongly constrained by the experimental data, and that the remaining parameters are related by two strongly constrained constants. Thus, only one degree of freedom remains, and measurements of the intracellular levels of sFLT1 would fix the remaining parameters. Comparison between simulation predictions and additional experimental data of the outcomes of chemical inhibitors and genetic perturbations suggest that intermediate values of the secretion rate constant best match the simulation with experiments, which would completely constrain the model. However, some of the inhibitors tested produce results that cannot be reproduced by the model simulations, suggesting that additional mechanisms not included here are required to explain those inhibitors. Overall, the model reproduces most available experimental data and suggests targets for further quantitative investigation of the sFLT1 system.

                <p>by Isaac J. Stopard, Ellie Sherrard-Smith, Hilary Ranson, Kobié Hyacinthe Toe, Jackie Cook, Joseph Biggs, Ben Lambert, Thomas S. Churcher</p>

Entomological surveillance is an important component of mosquito-borne disease control. Mosquito abundance, infection prevalence and the entomological inoculation rate are the most widely reported entomological metrics, although these data are notoriously noisy and difficult to interpret. For many infections, only older mosquitoes are infectious, which is why, in part, vector control tools that reduce mosquito life expectancy have been so successful. The age structure of wild mosquitoes has been proposed as a metric to assess the effectiveness of interventions that kill adult mosquitoes, and age grading tools are becoming increasingly advanced. Mosquito populations show seasonal dynamics with temporal fluctuations. How seasonal changes in adult mosquito emergence and vector control could affect the mosquito age distribution or other important metrics is unclear. We develop stochastic mathematical models of mosquito population dynamics to show how variability in mosquito emergence causes substantial heterogeneity in the mosquito age distribution, with low frequency, positively autocorrelated changes in emergence being the most important driver of this variability. Fitting a population model to mosquito abundance data collected in experimental hut trials indicates these dynamics are likely to exist in wild <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> populations. Incorporating age structuring into an established compartmental model of mosquito dynamics and vector control, indicates that the use of mosquito age as a metric to assess the efficacy of vector-control tools will require an understanding of underlying variability in mosquito ages, with the mean age and other entomological metrics affected by short-term and seasonal fluctuations in mosquito emergence.

                <p>by Lianxia Li, Unimunkh Uriyanghai, Christine Wai, Hong Yuan, Eric W. Livingston, Edward M. Bahnson, Vinay Sudarsanam, Samuel Haddad, Prabir Roy-Chaudhury, Boyce E. Griffith, Gang Xi</p>

In this study, we investigated the hemodynamic characteristics of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) in murine models using micro-CT based computational fluid dynamics (CFD). By combining high-resolution micro-CT imaging with ultrasound flow measurements, our methodology offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional MRI-based approaches. CFD simulations performed at 7 and 21 days post-surgery revealed significant temporal changes in both geometry and hemodynamics. Geometric analysis showed that the proximal artery diameter increased from 0.29 mm to 0.38 mm, whereas the initial 2 mm fistula segment showed a 21.6% decrease (0.74 mm to 0.58 mm). Blood flow through the AVF nearly doubled from 1.33 mL/min to 2.57 mL/min. Time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) peak values and locations changed from 142 Pa (day 7) within the proximal artery to 200 Pa (day 21) in the stenotic region. The oscillatory shear index (OSI) showed marked elevation at the anastomosis (increasing from 0.22 to 0.48), indicating disturbed flow development. An inverse relationship between TAWSS and OSI was identified, consistent with previous studies. Our methodology demonstrates the capability to analyze relationships between early hemodynamics and subsequent geometric changes. This approach could enable identification of regions susceptible to stenosis development and monitoring of AVF maturation, which could ultimately lead to quantitative metrics to evaluate surgical outcomes and early therapeutic interventions.

                <p>by Farzaneh Darki, James Rankin, Piotr Słowiński</p>

Auditory stream segregation plays a crucial role in understanding the auditory scene. This study investigates the role of tactile stimulation in auditory stream segregation through psychophysics experiments and a computational model of audio-tactile interactions. We examine how tactile pulses, synchronized with one group of tones (high- or low-frequency tones) in a sequence of interleaved high- and low-frequency tones (ABA- triplets), influence the likelihood of perceiving integrated or segregated auditory streams. Our findings reveal that tactile pulses synchronized with a single tone sequence (either the A-tone or B-tone sequence) enhance perceptual segregation, while pulses synchronized with both tone sequences promote integration. Based on these findings, we developed a dynamical model that captures interactions between auditory and tactile neural circuits, including recurrent excitation, mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise. The proposed model shows excellent agreement with the experiment. Model predictions are validated through psychophysics experiments. In the model, we assume that selective tactile stimulation dynamically modulates the tonotopic organization within the auditory cortex. This modulation facilitates segregation by reinforcing specific tonotopic responses through single-tone synchronization while smoothing neural activity patterns with dual-tone alignment to promote integration. The model offers a robust computational framework for exploring cross-modal effects on stream segregation and predicts neural behavior under varying tactile conditions. Our findings imply that cross-modal synchronization, with carefully timed tactile cues, could improve auditory perception with potential applications in auditory assistive technologies aimed at enhancing speech recognition in noisy settings.

                <p>by Sakurako Tanida, Kana Fuji, Linjie Lu, Tristan Guyomar, Byung Ho Lee, Alf Honigmann, Anne Grapin-Botton, Daniel Riveline, Tetsuya Hiraiwa, Makiko Nonomura, Masaki Sano</p>

Organoids are ideal systems to predict the phenotypes of organs. However, there is currently a lack of understanding regarding the generalized rules that enable use of simple cellular principles to make morphological predictions of entire organoids. Therefore, we employed a phase field model with the following basic components: the minimum conditions for the timing and volume of cell division, lumen nucleation rules, and lumenal pressure. Through our model, we could compute and generate a myriad of organoid phenotypes observed till date. We propose morphological indices necessary to characterize the shapes and construct phase diagrams and show their dependencies on proliferation time and lumen pressure. Additionally, we introduced the lumen-index parameter, which helped in examining the criteria to maintain organoids as spherical structures comprising a single layer of cells and enclosing an intact lumen. Finally, we predict a star-like organoid phenotype that did not undergo differentiation, suggesting that the volume constraint during cell division may determine the final phenotype. In summary, our approach provides researchers with guidelines to test the mechanisms of self-organization and predict the shape of organoid.

                Chuard et al. show that GIV-derived viral insulin/IGF1-like peptides (VILPs) inhibit IGF-1 signaling by competing for IGF1R, reducing cell proliferation, and enhancing viral replication. VILPs are secreted early in infection and expressed in zebrafish, revealing a viral mimicry strategy that subverts host IGF-1 signaling for a replication advantage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104302">A pair of congenic mice for imaging of transplants by positron emission tomography using anti-transferrin receptor nanobodies</a></h4>

              
                Two anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) nanobodies, V<sub>H</sub>H123 specific for mouse TfR and V<sub>H</sub>H188 specific for human TfR, were used to track transplants non-invasively by PET/CT in mouse models, without the need for genetic modification of the transferred cells. We provide a comparison of the specificity and kinetics of the PET signals acquired when using nanobodies radiolabeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu, and <sup>18</sup>F, and find that the chelation of the <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu radioisotopes to anti-TfR nanobodies results in radioisotope release upon endocytosis of the radiolabeled nanobodies. We used a knock-in mouse that expresses a TfR with a human ectodomain (Tfrc<i><sup>hu/hu</sup></i>) as a source of bone marrow for transplants into C57BL/6 recipients and show that V<sub>H</sub>H188 detects such transplants by PET/CT. Conversely, C57BL/6 bone marrow and B16.F10 melanoma cell line transplanted into Tfrc<i><sup>hu/hu</sup></i> recipients can be imaged with V<sub>H</sub>H123. In C57BL/6 mice impregnated by Tfrc<i><sup>hu/hu</sup></i> males, we saw an intense V<sub>H</sub>H188 signal in the placenta, showing that TfR-specific V<sub>H</sub>Hs accumulate at the placental barrier but do not enter the fetal tissue. We were unable to observe accumulation of the anti-TfR radiotracers in the central nervous system (CNS) by PET/CT but showed evidence of CNS accumulation by radiospectrometry. The model presented here can be used to track many transplanted cell types by PET/CT, provided cells express TfR, as is typically the case for proliferating cells such as tumor lines.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107114">Structural mechanism of strand exchange by the RAD51 filament</a></h4>

              
                Homologous recombination (HR) preserves genomic stability by repairing double-strand DNA breaks and ensuring efficient DNA replication. Central to HR is the strand-exchange reaction taking place within the three-stranded synapsis wherein a RAD51 nucleoprotein filament binds to a donor DNA. Here, we present the cryoEM structure of a displacement loop of human RAD51 that captures the synaptic state when the filament has become tightly bound to the donor DNA. The structure elucidates the mechanism of strand exchange by RAD51, including the filament engagement with the donor DNA, the strand invasion and pairing with the complementary sequence of the donor DNA, the capture of the non-complementary strand and the polarity of the strand-exchange reaction. Our findings provide fundamental mechanistic insights into the biochemical reaction of eukaryotic HR.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intracranial language localization with electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) and high-gamma modulation (HGM) mapping relies on artificial, repetitive tasks, requiring sustained cooperation from patients. Herein, we tested the validity of unstructured, interpersonal, naturalistic conversation for language localization, using a novel methodology: Behavior-iEEG-Spectral-Power correlation (BESPoC). We first validated BESPoC against ESM, HGM, and neuropsychological outcomes using well-established language tasks, then demonstrated the validity of naturalistic conversation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 134 patients (59 females), aged 2–29 years, undergoing standard-of-care stereo-electroencephalography monitoring who engaged in picture naming, auditory naming, story listening, and conversed with a family member. ESM and HGM analysis were performed using established methods. BESPoC methodology quantified correlation between stereo-electroencephalography spectral power from task recordings, obviating the need for any trial-based epochs, and behavioral markers. The large sample size allowed mixed-effects modeling to compare BESPoC with HGM and ESM.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>BESPoC showed high specificity (0.79–0.83) and sensitivity (0.64–0.86) for localizing HGM language sites across the tasks. BESPoC also compared well with HGM across all language tasks for localizing ESM speech/language sites. With conventional tasks, BESPoC was superior to HGM for modeling neuropsychological deficits seen, despite preserving ESM speech/language sites. Naturalistic conversation compared well with standard tasks for localization of HGM and ESM language sites, and determined neuropsychological outcomes better than conventional tasks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using BESPoC methodology naturalistic conversation is shown to produce valid cortical language maps of both expressive and receptive language, and determine neuropsychological outcomes after epilepsy surgery. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In brains of individuals who had sustained repetitive head trauma, advanced pathologic tau protein in neurons and axons within temporal cortices followed patterns seen in homologous cortico-cortical connections in nonhuman primates. The relational Structural Model, which is based on the universal principle of the systematic variation of cortical laminar structure, has successfully predicted the relative laminar distribution of cortico-cortical connections based on the relative similarity/difference in laminar structure in pairs of linked areas. Here, the Structural Model successfully predicted the graded laminar distribution and density of pathologic tau in chronic traumatic encephalopathy and was validated by a computational progression model. By contrast, early and sporadic tau pathology in the depths of sulci in chronic traumatic encephalopathy followed local columnar connectivity rules. These findings support applicability of a theoretical model to unravel the direction and progression of tau pathology in neurodegeneration via cortical connection mechanisms. Cortical pathways converging on temporal cortices may help explain the inexorable spread of pathologic tau to widespread cortical areas accompanied by decline in emotional and cognitive processes in humans with repetitive head trauma.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous research has shown that transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) promotes declarative fear extinction, but its neural mechanisms in this process are still unclear. This study aimed to explore tVNS’s impacts on physiological (skin conductance response [SCR]) and neural (event-related potentials, ERP) fear-related responses. Forty healthy participants were randomly assigned to the tVNS or Sham group. During a fear-conditioned memory paradigm, electroencephalograph (EEG) and SCR were measured. We analyzed SCR amplitude, ERP components, EEG signal spectral analysis, and the correlation between SCR and EEG metrics. Results showed that compared with the Sham group, the tVNS group had a remarkable decrease in SCR amplitudes for conditioned stimuli (CS+) during retrieval and recall, suggesting reduced sympathetic arousal. ERP analysis revealed a notable decline in late positive potential (LPP) (400–800 ms) amplitudes for CS+ in the tVNS group during these phases, indicating weakened neural reactivity. A significant group-by-phase interaction showed that tVNS effectively suppressed immediate and sustained fear responses, maintaining lower fear-related physiological and neural activity levels. These findings suggest that tVNS modulates neural circuits involved in fear processing, clarifies the mechanisms underlying fear extinction, and highlights its therapeutic potential for fear-related disorders.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Biological motion (BM) perception is crucial for survival and social interaction. Previous studies have shown that form structure influences the perception of walking direction and body orientation. However, the neural mechanisms underlying how form modulates the processing of these features remain unclear. To investigate how form is encoded and its interaction with the processing of walking direction and body orientation, we combined EEG and multivariate pattern analyses. Participants viewed classic point-light displays with different forms, walking directions, and body orientations. The decoding results revealed that form information was significantly decoded starting around 85 ms, peaking at 275 ms. The time generalization analysis revealed that the neural representation of form was transient before ~ 200 ms, and became stable thereafter. Importantly, decoding accuracy became significant at 100 ms for both body orientation and walking direction when form was intact, but remained at chance level for walking direction and was reduced for body orientation when form was scrambled. These results indicate that form structure influences the time course of body orientation and walking direction processing. These findings shed light on the encoding of form structure and its role in shaping the neural representation of other BM features.</span>

     alt="Biallelic Variants in the DARS2 Gene as a Novel Cause of Axonal Charcot–Marie–Tooth Disease"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease is a heterogeneous group of genetic neuropathies, with &gt;90 genes identified. Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been linked to CMT. <i>DARS2</i>, encoding the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, has been typically associated with leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation. This study aimed to investigate the association between biallelic <i>DARS2</i> variants and axonal CMT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated 5 individuals from 3 unrelated families with axonal CMT and biallelic <i>DARS2</i> variants. Functional studies in fibroblasts assessed their effects on DARS2 expression, localization, and mitochondrial function. Enzymatic activity was evaluated in HEK293 cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 5 individuals, including 4 adults, presented with childhood-onset progressive axonal CMT. None had leukoencephalopathy, but one showed central nervous system involvement, with intellectual disability and epilepsy. Genetic analysis identified compound heterozygous <i>DARS2</i> variants: family A, p.Ser238Phe and p.Arg336Cys; family B, p.Ser238Phe and p.Ile25Thrfs*38; family C, c.492+2T&gt;C and p.Pro503Leu. Functional studies revealed reduced DARS2 protein levels, mitochondrial network abnormalities, and impaired mitochondrial function. p.Ser238Phe behaves as a hypomorphic allele, whereas p.Pro503Leu reduced DARS2 enzymatic activity by 75%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings expand the <i>DARS2</i>-related disease spectrum, establishing a novel association with axonal CMT. Hypomorphic variants, such as p.Ser238Phe, when paired with more deleterious variants, result in isolated axonal CMT, whereas more severe combinations—although not as deleterious as those seen in leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation—result in axonal CMT with central nervous system involvement, albeit without leukoencephalopathy. These observations raise the possibility that <i>DARS2</i>-associated diseases form a continuum rather than representing strictly distinct central or peripheral nervous system disorders.

                The brain regulates breathing in response to changes in CO2/H+ by a process referred to as respiratory chemoreception. The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is essential for this function. RTN neurons are intrinsically activated by CO2/H+. Astrocytes contribute as well, by providing a CO2/H+-dependent purinergic drive to augment neural activity directly and indirectly by causing vasoconstriction. Here, we summarize preclinical studies in rodents that identify: (i) mechanisms of CO2/H+ detection by RTN neurons; (ii) how this information is integrated at the neural network level; and (iii) how RTN neural activity is shaped by CO2/H+ sensitive astrocytes. We also discuss how disruption of RTN chemoreception might contribute to breathing problems in disease, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting CO2/H+-dependent and -independent regulatory elements of RTN neurons.

                Lo et al. show that binge feeding suppresses piriform (olfactory) cortex activity, reducing the brain’s representation of food flavor. This suppression is driven by the olfactory tubercle and promotes continued eating by decreasing sensory satiation. The findings link sensory suppression to overeating and highlight a cortical mechanism regulating appetite.

                Yuan et al. combine deep brain stimulation with neural activity monitoring to optimize stimulation parameters for the anterior cingulate cortex. They show that inhibitory DBS produces rapid, long-lasting antidepressant-like effects and suppresses mood-regulating networks, offering a circuit-based blueprint for optimizing neuromodulation therapies.
