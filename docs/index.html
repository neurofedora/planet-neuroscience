">Loss of Intracellular Fibroblast Growth Factor 14 (iFGF14) Increases the Excitability of Mature Hippocampal and Cortical Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in FGF14, which encodes intracellular fibroblast growth factor 14 (iFGF14), have been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 27 (SCA27), a multisystem disorder associated with progressive deficits in motor coordination and cognitive function. Mice (Fgf14-/-) lacking iFGF14 display similar phenotypes, and we have previously shown that the deficits in motor coordination reflect reduced excitability of cerebellar Purkinje neurons, owing to the loss of iFGF14-mediated regulation of the voltage-dependence of inactivation of the fast transient component of the voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) current, INaT. Here, we present the results of experiments designed to test the hypothesis that loss of iFGF14 also attenuates the intrinsic excitability of mature hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons. Current-clamp recordings from adult mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute in vitro slices, however, revealed that repetitive firing rates were higher in Fgf14-/-, than in wild type (WT), cells. In addition, the waveforms of individual action potentials were altered in Fgf14-/- hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, and the loss of iFGF14 reduced the time delay between the initiation of axonal and somal action potentials. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that the loss of iFGF14 altered the voltage-dependence of activation, but not inactivation, of INaT in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Similar effects of the loss of iFGF14 on firing properties were evident in current-clamp recordings from layer 5 visual cortical pyramidal neurons. Additional experiments demonstrated that the loss of iFGF14 does not alter the distribution of anti-Nav1.6 or anti-ankyrin G immunofluorescence labeling intensity along the axon initial segments (AIS) of mature hippocampal CA1 or layer 5 visual cortical pyramidal neurons in situ. Taken together, the results demonstrate that, in contrast with results reported for neonatal (rat) hippocampal pyramidal neurons in dissociated cell culture, the loss of iFGF14 does not disrupt AIS architecture or Nav1.6 localization/distribution along the AIS of mature hippocampal (or cortical) pyramidal neurons in situ.

">Exploring sex-specific neuroendocrine influences on the sensorimotor-association axis in single individuals</a></h4>

              
                Human neuroimaging studies consistently show multimodal patterns of variability along a key principle of macroscale cortical organization - the sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis. However, little is known about day-to-day fluctuations in functional activity along this axis within an individual, including sex-specific neuroendocrine factors contributing to such transient changes. We leveraged data from two densely sampled healthy young adults, one female and one male, to investigate intra-individual daily variability along the S-A axis, which we computed as our measure of functional cortical organization by reducing the dimensionality of functional connectivity matrices. Daily variability was greatest in temporal limbic and ventral prefrontal regions in both participants, and was more strongly pronounced in the male subject. Next, we probed local- and system-level effects of steroid hormones and self-reported perceived stress on functional organization. Our findings revealed modest effects that differed between participants, hinting at subtle -potentially sex-specific- associations between neuroendocrine fluctuations and intra-individual variability along the S-A axis. In sum, our study points to neuroendocrine factors as possible modulators of intra-individual variability in functional brain organization, highlighting the need for further research in larger samples.

">A gentle palette of plasma membrane dyes</a></h4>

              
                Plasma membrane stains are one of the most important organelle markers for unambiguous assignments of individual cells and monitoring membrane morphology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art PM stains are bright, specific, fluorogenic, and compatible with super-resolution imaging. However, when recording membrane dynamics, particularly under light-intensive microscopes, PM is prone to photodynamic damages due to its phospholipid bilayer nature. Here we developed PK Mem dyes tailored for time-lapse fluorescence imaging. By integrating triplet-state quenchers into the MemBright dyes featuring cyanine chromophores and amphiphilic zwitterion anchors, PK Mem dyes exhibited a three-fold reduction in phototoxicity and a more than four-fold improvement in photostability in imaging experiments. These dyes enable 2D and 3D imaging of live or fixed cancer cell lines and a wide range of primary cells, at the same time pair well with various fluorescent markers. PK Mem dyes can be applied to neuronal imaging in brain slices and in vivo two-photon imaging. The gentle nature of PK Mem palette enables ultralong-term recording of cell migration and cardiomyocyte beating. Notably, PK Mem dyes are optically compatible with STED/SIM imaging, which can handily upgrade the routine of time-lapse neuronal imaging, such as growth cone tracking and mitochondrial transportations, into nanoscopic resolutions.

">A neurometabolic mechanism for effort-based decision-making in the dmPFC/dACC</a></h4>

              
                Motivation levels vary across individuals, yet the underlying mechanisms driving these differences remain elusive. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC/dACC) and the anterior insula (aIns) play crucial roles in effort-based decision-making. Here, we investigate the influence of lactate, a key metabolite indicating energy deficit, on decisions involving both physical and mental effort, as well as its effects on neural activation. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional MRI in 75 participants, we find that higher lactate levels in the dmPFC/dACC are associated with reduced motivation for physical effort, a relationship mediated by neural activity within this region. Additionally, plasma and dmPFC/dACC lactate levels correlate, suggesting a systemic influence on brain metabolism. Supported by path analysis, our results highlight lactate's role as a modulator of dmPFC/dACC activity, hinting at a neurometabolic mechanism that integrates both peripheral and central metabolic states with brain function in effort-based decision-making.

">Acetylcholine demixes heterogeneous dopamine signals for learning and moving</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine neurons promote reinforcement learning and movement vigor. A major outstanding question is how dopamine-recipient neurons in the striatum parse these heterogeneous signals. Here we characterized dopamine and acetylcholine release in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of rats perform- ing a decision-making task. We found that dopamine acted as a reward prediction error (RPE), modulating behavior and DMS spiking on subsequent trials when coincident with pauses in cholinergic release. In contrast, at task events that elicited coincident bursts of acetylcholine and dopamine, dopamine preceded contralateral movements and predicted movement vigor without inducing plastic changes in DMS firing rates. Our findings provide a circuit-level mechanism by which cholinergic modulation allows the same dopamine signals to be used for either movement or learning depending on instantaneous behavioral context.

">Protective role of parenthood on age-related brain function in mid- to late-life</a></h4>

              
                The experience of parenthood can profoundly alter ones body, mind, and environment, yet we know little about the long-term associations between parenthood and brain function and aging in adulthood. Here, we investigate the link between number of children parented (parity) and age on brain function in 19,964 females and 17,607 males from the UK Biobank. In both females and males, increased parity was positively associated with functional connectivity, particularly within the somato/motor network. Critically, the spatial topography of parity-linked effects was inversely correlated with the impact of age on functional connectivity across the brain for both females and males, suggesting that a higher number of children is associated with patterns of brain function in the opposite direction to age-related alterations. These results indicate that the changes accompanying parenthood may confer benefits to brain health across the lifespan, highlighting the importance of future work to understand the associated mechanisms.

">Sexually dimorphic phenotypes and the role of androgen receptors in UBE3A-dependent autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by social, communication, and behavioral challenges. UBE3A is one of the most common ASD genes. ASDs display a remarkable sex difference with a 4:1 male to female prevalence ratio; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Using the UBE3A-overexpressing mouse model for ASD, we studied sex differences at behavioral, genetic, and molecular levels. We found that male mice with extra copies of Ube3A exhibited greater impairments in social interaction, repetitive self-grooming behavior, memory, and pain sensitivity, whereas female mice with UBE3A overexpression displayed greater olfactory defects. Social communication was impaired in both sexes, with males making more calls and females preferring complex syllables. At the molecular level, androgen receptor (AR) levels were reduced in both sexes due to enhanced degradation mediated by UBE3A. However, AR reduction significantly dysregulated AR target genes only in male, not female, UBE3A-overexpressing mice. Importantly, restoring AR levels in the brain effectively normalized the expression of AR target genes, and rescued the deficits in social preference, grooming behavior, and memory in male UBE3A-overexpressing mice, without affecting females. These findings suggest that AR and its signaling cascade play an essential role in mediating the sexually dimorphic changes in UBE3A-dependent ASD.

">Dorsal prefrontal cortex drives perseverative behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Perseveration -- repeating one choice when others would generate larger rewards -- is a common behavior, but neither its purpose nor neuronal mechanisms are understood. Here we demonstrate a neural correlate and causal role of dorsal prefrontal cortex (area MOs) in perseveration in mice performing a dynamic reward learning task. An auditory go cue signaled mice to turn a wheel either left or right, with the reward probability of each action switching in blocks. Mice perseverated, gaining suboptimal reward, but were faster when making repeated choices. Neuropixels recordings found neurons whose activity correlated with perseveration and predicted rapid reaction times, almost exclusively in MOs. Optogenetically inhibiting MOs reduced perseveration and slowed reaction times. In contrast, inactivating medial prefrontal cortex at choice time did not have any effect but impaired learning if delivered after reward delivery. In this task, therefore, MOs encodes a perseverative decision variable, and is necessary for mediating the effect of this decision variable on choice and reaction time.

">Modulation of aggression by social novelty recognition memory in the hippocampal CA2 region</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal CA2 subregion (dCA2) of the hippocampus exerts a critical role in social novelty recognition (SNR) memory and in the promotion of social aggression. Whether the social aggression and SNR memory functions of dCA2 are related or represent independent processes is unknown. Here we investigated the hypotheses that an animal is more likely to attack a novel compared to familiar animal and that dCA2 promotes social aggression through its ability to discriminate between novel and familiar conspecifics. To test these ideas, we conducted a multi-day resident intruder (R-I) test of aggression towards novel and familiar conspecifics. We found that mice were more likely to attack a novel compared to familiarized intruder and that silencing of dCA2 caused a more profound inhibition of aggression towards a novel than familiarized intruder. To explore whether and how dCA2 pyramidal neurons encode aggression, we recorded their activity using microendoscopic calcium imaging throughout the days of the R-I test. We found that a fraction of dCA2 neurons were selectively activated or inhibited during exploration, dominance, and attack behaviors and that these signals were enhanced during interaction with a novel compared to familiarized conspecific. Based on dCA2 population activity, a set of binary linear classifiers accurately decoded whether an animal was engaged in each of these forms of social behavior. Of particular interest, the accuracy of decoding aggression was greater with novel compared to familiarized intruders, with significant cross-day decoding using the same familiar animal on each day but not for a familiar-novel pair. Together, these findings demonstrate that dCA2 integrates information about social novelty with signals of behavioral state to promote aggression towards novel conspecifics.

">Dopamine and acetylcholine correlations in the nucleus accumbens depend on behavioral task states</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine in the nucleus accumbens ramps up as animals approach desired goals. These ramps have received intense scrutiny because they seem to violate long-held hypotheses on dopamine function. Furthermore, it has been proposed that they are driven by local acetylcholine release, i.e., that they are mechanistically separate from dopamine signals related to reward prediction errors. Here, we tested this hypothesis by simultaneously recording accumbal dopamine and acetylcholine signals in rats executing a task involving motivated approach. Contrary to recent reports, we found that dopamine ramps were not coincidental with changes in acetylcholine. Instead, we found that acetylcholine could be positively, negatively, or uncorrelated with dopamine depending on whether the task phase was determined by a salient cue, reward prediction error, or active approach, respectively. Our results suggest that accumbal dopamine and acetylcholine are largely independent but may combine to engage different postsynaptic mechanisms depending on the behavioral task states.

                <p>Elicited upon violation of regularity in stimulus presentation, mismatch negativity (MMN) reflects the brain's ability to perform automatic comparisons between consecutive stimuli and provides an electrophysiological index of sensory error detection whereas P300 is associated with cognitive processes such as updating of the working memory. To date, there has been extensive research on the roles of MMN and P300 individually, because of their potential to be used as clinical markers of consciousness and attention, respectively. Here, we intend to explore with an unsupervised and rigorous source estimation approach, the underlying cortical generators of MMN and P300, in the context of prediction error propagation along the hierarchies of brain information processing in healthy human participants. The existing methods of characterizing the two ERPs involve only approximate estimations of their amplitudes and latencies based on specific sensors of interest. Our objective is twofold: first, we introduce a novel data-driven unsupervised approach to compute latencies and amplitude of ERP components accurately on an individual-subject basis and reconfirm earlier findings. Second, we demonstrate that in multisensory environments, MMN generators seem to reflect a significant overlap of "modality-specific" and "modality-independent" information processing while P300 generators mark a shift toward completely "modality-independent" processing. Advancing earlier understanding that multisensory contexts speed up early sensory processing, our study reveals that temporal facilitation extends to even the later components of prediction error processing, using EEG experiments. Such knowledge can be of value to clinical research for characterizing the key developmental stages of lifespan aging, schizophrenia, and depression.</p>

                <p>Canonically, action potentials of most mammalian neurons initiate at the axon initial segment (AIS) and propagate bidirectionally: orthodromically along the distal axon and retrogradely into the soma and dendrites. Under some circumstances, action potentials may initiate ectopically, at sites distal to the AIS, and propagate antidromically along the axon. These "ectopic action potentials" (EAPs) have been observed in experimental models of seizures and chronic pain, and more rarely in nonpathological forebrain neurons. Here we report that a large majority of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the upper layers of mouse neocortex, from both orbitofrontal and primary somatosensory areas, fire EAPs after sufficient activation of their somata. Somatostatin-expressing interneurons also fire EAPs, though less robustly. Ectopic firing in PV+ cells occurs in varying temporal patterns and can persist for several seconds. PV+ cells evoke strong synaptic inhibition in pyramidal neurons and interneurons and play critical roles in cortical function. Our results suggest that ectopic spiking of PV+ interneurons is common and may contribute to both normal and pathological network functions of the neocortex.</p>

                Background In this cross-sectional study conducted in Wakiso, Uganda, from May to July 2023, we investigated the interactions among age, sex, education, and heart rate in relation to dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) among individuals aged 65 years and older. Methods We purposively sampled 106 participants, focusing on those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, leveraging collaborations with local health teams. Data collection involved comprehensive questionnaires covering sociodemographic details and health parameters, and employed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool for dementia screening. Results Our findings highlight a nuanced landscape of risk factors; each additional year of age was associated with a 1.19- and 1.22-times increased risk of MCI and dementia, respectively. Gender analysis revealed a protective effect against MCI in males, but no significant impact on dementia risk. Education emerged as a protective factor, with each additional year associated with a 28% reduction in MCI risk, although its effect on dementia risk remains ambiguous. Significantly, an elevated heart rate was strongly linked to an increased risk of both MCI and dementia, underscoring the potential cardiovascular dimension in cognitive health. Conclusions This study contributes to the understanding of the complex interplay of risk factors for dementia, emphasizing the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and interventions for healthy cognitive aging in the older adult population.

                A 56-year-old female with a medical history of unspecified hyperthyroidism and a recent thyroid storm presented to the ED with tachycardia, hypertension, and bilateral enlarged parotid glands. During a previous hospitalization, she was diagnosed with unspecified hyperthyroidism and started on methimazole. During hospitalization, laboratory findings suggested Graves’ disease with an acute thyroid storm. The patient also complained of enlarged parotid glands bilaterally. CT tomography of the neck revealed no calculi of the parotid glands but showed extensive fatty replacement, possibly related to methimazole use. Treatment with propranolol and IV hydrocortisone improved thyroid function. Due to the suspicion of methimazole-induced parotitis, she was transitioned to a reduced methimazole dosage for treatment of Graves’ disease, which subsequently improved her parotitis. Methimazole, the standard initial treatment for Graves’ disease, is generally well-tolerated. It can cause adverse reactions; however, parotitis is very rare and has been documented in only a few case reports. Owing to the limited number of reports, its incidence is currently unknown. Here, we present a case of methimazole-induced parotitis as an unusual presentation of thyroid storm. Drug-induced reactions can only be considered once common causes of parotitis such as viral infection, obstruction, and autoimmune diseases are ruled out. Treatment involves dosage adjustments and supportive care. Methimazole-induced parotitis is often misdiagnosed and overlooked because of the lack of reported cases. This necessitates future research into the reaction mechanisms and optimal treatment.

                Background This study investigated the utility of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with COVID-19 with respect to age, early (a week) vs. delayed recovery (> a week) and mortality. Methods This was a retrospective study including 1,016 COVID-19 patients. The discriminatory power and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. Results The mean age of patients was 45 (± 13.9), and 75.7% were males. Older patients had elevated NLR, PLR, D-dimer, CRP, and Interleukin-6 levels and longer hospital stay than the younger group (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in older adults (26.9% vs. 6.6%, p =0.001). On-admission NLR (5.8 vs. 3.2; P= 0.001) and PLR (253.9±221.1 vs. 192.2±158.5; p = 0.004) were higher in the non-survivors than survivors. Both PLR and NLR displayed significant discriminatory ability for mortality. NLR had a higher AUC and specificity, while PLR exhibited slightly higher sensitivity. In individuals aged ≤55, NLR showed superior discrimination (AUC=0.717) compared to PLR (AUC=0.620). Conversely, for older adults, PLR displayed enhanced discrimination (AUC=0.710), while NLR showed AUC=0.693. Conclusion Higher admission NLR and PLR levels were associated with delayed recovery, whereas an enhanced NLR was associated with considerably higher mortality in older COVID-19 patients.

                Background Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are a group of structural abnormalities affecting these vital organs, frequently leading to chronic kidney disease in children. This study aims to comprehensively understand the clinical profile of CAKUT in children in Central India, an area with unique socio-demographic characteristics and limited prior research on this topic. Methods A prospective observational study will be conducted over three years in the pediatric department of AVBRH, a tertiary healthcare center in Central India. Data were collected through interviews with parents or guardians of children up to 18 admitted to the hospital. Clinical symptoms, prenatal history, physical examinations, and diagnostic investigations were meticulously documented. Expected outcome The study is expected to reveal the prevalence and clinical profile of CAKUT in Central Indian children. Anticipated outcomes include insights into anomalies, clinical symptoms, and potential correlations with factors like prenatal care and consanguineous marriages. Diagnostic investigations will help assess the severity of renal impairment. The results may also uncover regional variations and have implications for public health initiatives aimed at early intervention and improved patient care. However, these are preliminary expectations that are subject to confirmation through the completion of the study.

                Introduction The Central Sterile Supply Department (CSSD) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical instruments and equipment used in healthcare settings. Effective workload management and quality control are essential for maintaining high standards of patient care and minimizing the risk of healthcare-associated infections. This study protocol aims to assess the implementation and impact of a new workload management model and enhanced quality control measures in a CSSD setting. Methods The study will employ a mixed-methods approach, including quantitative analysis of workload data, qualitative interviews with CSSD staff, and observational assessments of workflow and quality control procedures. The workload management model under investigation involves the allocation of resources based on demand patterns and the implementation of scheduling algorithms to optimize staff efficiency. Enhanced quality control measures include the implementation of advanced sterilization technologies, rigorous inspection protocols, and continuous staff training initiatives. Results The study expects to provide insights into the effectiveness of the workload management model in optimizing resource allocation and improving staff productivity. Additionally, it aims to evaluate the impact of enhanced quality control measures on the reliability and safety of instrument sterilization processes. Findings from this study will inform recommendations for further improvements in CSSD operations and contribute to the advancement of best practices in sterile supply management. Conclusion The successful implementation of an effective workload management model and enhanced quality control measures in the CSSD is crucial for maintaining patient safety and ensuring the efficient functioning of healthcare facilities. By systematically evaluating the implementation and impact of these interventions, this study protocol seeks to contribute to the ongoing improvement of CSSD operations and the enhancement of healthcare quality.

                <p>by Phoebe Asplin, Matt J. Keeling, Rebecca Mancy, Edward M. Hill</p>
Background <p>Respiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied.</p> Methods and findings <p>We propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, <i>α</i>. Varying <i>α</i> tunes the model from having no symptom propagation (<i>α</i> = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate (<i>α</i> = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens—seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2—we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB_MB).In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB_MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all strengths of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that, for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation.</p> Conclusions <p>Overall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.</p>

                <p>by Sebastien Benzekry, Michalis Mastri, Chiara Nicolò, John M. L. Ebos</p>

Clinical trials involving systemic neoadjuvant treatments in breast cancer aim to shrink tumors before surgery while simultaneously allowing for controlled evaluation of biomarkers, toxicity, and suppression of distant (occult) metastatic disease. Yet neoadjuvant clinical trials are rarely preceded by preclinical testing involving neoadjuvant treatment, surgery, and post-surgery monitoring of the disease. Here we used a mouse model of spontaneous metastasis occurring after surgical removal of orthotopically implanted primary tumors to develop a predictive mathematical model of neoadjuvant treatment response to sunitinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI). Treatment outcomes were used to validate a novel mathematical kinetics-pharmacodynamics model predictive of perioperative disease progression. Longitudinal measurements of presurgical primary tumor size and postsurgical metastatic burden were compiled using 128 mice receiving variable neoadjuvant treatment doses and schedules (released publicly at https://zenodo.org/records/10607753). A non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach quantified inter-animal variabilities in metastatic dynamics and survival, and machine-learning algorithms were applied to investigate the significance of several biomarkers at resection as predictors of individual kinetics. Biomarkers included circulating tumor- and immune-based cells (i.e., circulating tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells) as well as immunohistochemical tumor proteins (i.e., CD31 and Ki67). Our computational simulations show that neoadjuvant RTKI treatment inhibits primary tumor growth but has little efficacy in preventing (micro)-metastatic disease progression after surgery and treatment cessation. Machine learning algorithms that included support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks, confirmed a lack of definitive biomarkers, which shows the value of preclinical modeling studies to identify potential failures that should be avoided clinically.

                <p>by David Mezey, Dominik Deffner, Ralf H. J. M. Kurvers, Pawel Romanczuk</p>

Collective dynamics emerge from individual-level decisions, yet we still poorly understand the link between individual-level decision-making processes and collective outcomes in realistic physical systems. Using collective foraging to study the key trade-off between personal and social information use, we present a mechanistic, spatially-explicit agent-based model that combines individual-level evidence accumulation of personal and (visual) social cues with particle-based movement. Under idealized conditions without physical constraints, our mechanistic framework reproduces findings from established probabilistic models, but explains how individual-level decision processes generate collective outcomes in a bottom-up way. In clustered environments, groups performed best if agents reacted strongly to social information, while in uniform environments, individualistic search was most beneficial. Incorporating different real-world physical and perceptual constraints profoundly shaped collective performance, and could even buffer maladaptive herding by facilitating self-organized exploration. Our study uncovers the mechanisms linking individual cognition to collective outcomes in human and animal foraging and paves the way for decentralized robotic applications.

                <p>by An Qi Zhang, Martin R. Ralph, Adam R. Stinchcombe</p>

Many self-motivated and goal-directed behaviours display highly flexible, approximately 4 hour ultradian (shorter than a day) oscillations. Despite lacking direct correspondence to physical cycles in the environment, these ultradian rhythms may be involved in optimizing functional interactions with the environment and reflect intrinsic neural dynamics. Current evidence supports a role of mesostriatal dopamine (DA) in the expression and propagation of ultradian rhythmicity, however, the biochemical processes underpinning these oscillations remain to be identified. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate D2 autoreceptor-dependent DA self-regulation as the source of ultradian behavioural rhythms. DA concentration at the midbrain-striatal synapses is governed through a dual-negative feedback-loop structure, which naturally gives rise to rhythmicity. This model shows the propensity of striatal DA to produce an ultradian oscillation characterized by a flexible period that is highly sensitive to parameter variations. Circadian (approximately 24 hour) regulation consolidates the ultradian oscillations and alters their response to the phase-dependent, rapid-resetting effect of a transient excitatory stimulus. Within a circadian framework, the ultradian rhythm orchestrates behavioural activity and enhances responsiveness to an external stimulus. This suggests a role for the circadian-ultradian timekeeping hierarchy in governing organized behaviour and shaping daily experience through coordinating the motivation to engage in recurring, albeit not highly predictable events, such as social interactions.

To optimize proteins for particular traits holds great promise for industrial and pharmaceutical purposes. Machine Learning is increasingly applied in this field to <i>predict</i> properties of proteins, thereby guiding the experimental optimization process. A natural question is: How much progress are we making with such predictions, and how important is the choice of regressor and representation? In this paper, we demonstrate that different assessment criteria for regressor performance can lead to dramatically different conclusions, depending on the choice of metric, and how one defines generalization. We highlight the fundamental issues of sample bias in typical regression scenarios and how this can lead to misleading conclusions about regressor performance. Finally, we make the case for the importance of calibrated uncertainty in this domain.

                <p>by Paulina Clara Dagnino, Anira Escrichs, Ane López-González, Olivia Gosseries, Jitka Annen, Yonatan Sanz Perl, Morten L. Kringelbach, Steven Laureys, Gustavo Deco</p>

A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is accurately defining brain states and predicting how and where to perturb the brain to force a transition. Here, we investigated resting-state fMRI data of patients suffering from disorders of consciousness (DoC) after coma (minimally conscious and unresponsive wakefulness states) and healthy controls. We applied model-free and model-based approaches to help elucidate the underlying brain mechanisms of patients with DoC. The model-free approach allowed us to characterize brain states in DoC and healthy controls as a probabilistic metastable substate (PMS) space. The PMS of each group was defined by a repertoire of unique patterns (i.e., metastable substates) with different probabilities of occurrence. In the model-based approach, we adjusted the PMS of each DoC group to a causal whole-brain model. This allowed us to explore optimal strategies for promoting transitions by applying off-line <i>in silico</i> probing. Furthermore, this approach enabled us to evaluate the impact of local perturbations in terms of their global effects and sensitivity to stimulation, which is a model-based biomarker providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying DoC. Our results show that transitions were obtained in a synchronous protocol, in which the somatomotor network, thalamus, precuneus and insula were the most sensitive areas to perturbation. This motivates further work to continue understanding brain function and treatments of disorders of consciousness.

                Background Prosthetic joint infection is a serious complication that can arise after total joint replacement surgery. When bacteria colonise an orthopaedic implant, they form biofilms that protect them from their environment, making them difficult to remove. Treatment is further complicated by a global rise of antimicrobial resistance. These protective mechanisms make treatment of prosthetic joint infection increasingly complex. Non-contact induction heating is an upcoming technology that uses heat to eradicate bacteria that are present on the surface of metallic implants. This study aims to provide insight into the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating on metallic implants that are in direct contact with other biomaterials, such as coatings composed of hydroxyapatite and bone cement composed of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Methods Characterisation of hydroxyapatite coatings and adhesion strength tests were conducted according to standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO 13779-2). The fixation strength of acrylic bone cement was tested according to an adapted method from ISO. Results It was found that non-contact induction heating did not significantly affect the adhesion strength of hydroxyapatite coatings (p=0.697). In contrast to hydroxyapatite coatings, acrylic bone cement softened temporarily as the temperature exceeded the glass transition temperature (83.38 ± 10.88°C). However, the induction heating temperature had no significant effect on the fixation strength after the cement was allowed to cool down (p=0.535). Conclusion This study shows the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating up to 80°C when bone cement or ceramic coatings are present in contact with infected metallic implants.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent work has identified a critical role for the hippocampus in reward-sensitive behaviors, including motivated memory, reinforcement learning, and decision-making. Animal histology and human functional neuroimaging have shown that brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation are more interconnected with the ventral/anterior hippocampus. However, direct evidence examining gradients of structural connectivity between reward regions and the hippocampus in humans is lacking. The present study used diffusion MRI (dMRI) and probabilistic tractography to quantify the structural connectivity of the hippocampus with key reward processing regions in vivo. Using a large sample of subjects (<i>N</i> = 628) from the human connectome dMRI data release, we found that connectivity profiles with the hippocampus varied widely between different regions of the reward circuit. While the dopaminergic midbrain (ventral tegmental area) showed stronger connectivity with the anterior versus posterior hippocampus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed stronger connectivity with the posterior hippocampus. The limbic (ventral) striatum demonstrated a more homogeneous connectivity profile along the hippocampal long axis. This is the first study to generate a probabilistic atlas of the hippocampal structural connectivity with reward-related networks, which is essential to investigating how these circuits contribute to normative adaptive behavior and maladaptive behaviors in psychiatric illness. These findings describe nuanced structural connectivity that sets the foundation to better understand how the hippocampus influences reward-guided behavior in humans.</p>

                Background One central characteristic of schizophrenia is cognitive dysfunction, which typically has modest to severe effects on a variety of cognitive areas. Evidence suggests that cognitive impairment may occur far sooner than the clinical symptoms. The connection between cognitive deficiencies and functional outcome indicators has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Cognitive deficits are widely known to affect overall functioning, In India, few studies have been conducted to determine the profile of cognitive abnormalities in individuals in the chronic phase of schizophrenia as well as those in remission. Research from developing nations is crucial because schizophrenia prevalence in these nations is thought to be lower than that in industrialized nations. The aim of this study will be to assess the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia and examine the relationship between cognitive dysfunction with psychopathology and quality of life in individuals with schizophrenia. Protocol This will be a cross sectional hospital-based study. After ethical clearance, all patients in the Psychiatry Department meeting the criteria of Schizophrenia, according to the ICD-10, will be part of the study. The expected number of participants is 228. All participants within the age group of 18 to 65 years who are clinically diagnosed to have schizophrenia using ICD-10 and who are able to give written informed consent will be included in the study. The patient’s sociodemographic data will be collected in Outpatient or inpatient basis and then the following questionnaires will be applied to them: i) Socio-demographic Proforma; ii) The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); iii) The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF scale (WHOQOL-BREF); and iv) Addenbrooke’s cognitive examination III (ACE). Once the aforementioned questionnaires are completed, the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia will be assessed, and its relationship with psychopathology and quality of life will be studied.

                Information seeking is an integral, yet often overlooked aspect of value-based decision-making. Kobayashi and Kable review recent findings on the neural mechanisms of information seeking, highlighting an emerging hypothesis that the reward system represents the subjective value of information.

                Using single-nucleus RNA-seq coupled with activity-regulated genes, Guo et al. identify one galanin neuronal subtype in the preoptic area activated during recovery sleep and show cell-type-specific increases in Htr2a and P2ry14. RNAscope studies using identified marker genes reveal the anatomical location of this galanin subtype as the ventrolateral preoptic area.

                Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an essential modulator for neuroplasticity in sensory and emotional domains. Here, we investigated the role of CCK in motor learning using a single pellet reaching task in mice. Mice with a knockout of <i>Cck</i> gene (<i>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></i>) or blockade of CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) showed defective motor learning ability; the success rate of retrieving reward remained at the baseline level compared to the wildtype mice with significantly increased success rate. We observed no long-term potentiation upon high-frequency stimulation in the motor cortex of <i>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice, indicating a possible association between motor learning deficiency and neuroplasticity in the motor cortex. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrated that the deficiency of CCK signaling disrupted the refinement of population neuronal activity in the motor cortex during motor skill training. Anatomical tracing revealed direct projections from CCK-expressing neurons in the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex. Inactivation of the CCK neurons in the rhinal cortex that project to the motor cortex bilaterally using chemogenetic methods significantly suppressed motor learning, and intraperitoneal application of CCK4, a tetrapeptide CCK agonist, rescued the motor learning deficits of <i>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice. In summary, our results suggest that CCK, which could be provided from the rhinal cortex, may surpport motor skill learning by modulating neuroplasticity in the motor cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87529">Therapeutic doses of ketamine acutely attenuate the aversive effect of losses during decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The discovery of rapid-acting antidepressant, ketamine has opened a pathway to a new generation of treatments for depression, and inspired neuroscientific investigation based on a new perspective that non-adaptive changes in the intrinsic excitatory and inhibitory circuitry might underlie the pathophysiology of depression. Nevertheless, it still remains largely unknown how the hypothesized molecular and synaptic levels of changes in the circuitry might mediate behavioral and neuropsychological changes underlying depression, and how ketamine might restore adaptive behavior. Here, we used computational models to analyze behavioral changes induced by therapeutic doses of ketamine, while rhesus macaques were iteratively making decisions based on gains and losses of tokens. When administered intramuscularly or intranasally, ketamine reduced the aversiveness of undesirable outcomes such as losses of tokens without significantly affecting the evaluation of gains, behavioral perseveration, motivation, and other cognitive aspects of learning such as temporal credit assignment and time scales of choice and outcome memory. Ketamine’s potentially antidepressant effect was separable from other side effects such as fixation errors, which unlike outcome evaluation, was readily countered with strong motivation to avoid errors. We discuss how the acute effect of ketamine to reduce the initial impact of negative events could potentially mediate longer-term antidepressant effects through mitigating the cumulative effect of those events produced by slowly decaying memory, and how the disruption-resistant affective memory might pose challenges in treating depression. Our study also invites future investigations on ketamine’s antidepressant action over diverse mood states and with affective events exerting their impacts at diverse time scales.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91034">A dynamic neural resource model bridges sensory and working memory</a></h4>

              
                Probing memory of a complex visual image within a few hundred milliseconds after its disappearance reveals significantly greater fidelity of recall than if the probe is delayed by as little as a second. Classically interpreted, the former taps into a detailed but rapidly decaying visual sensory or ‘iconic’ memory (IM), while the latter relies on capacity-limited but comparatively stable visual working memory (VWM). While iconic decay and VWM capacity have been extensively studied independently, currently no single framework quantitatively accounts for the dynamics of memory fidelity over these time scales. Here, we extend a stationary neural population model of VWM with a temporal dimension, incorporating rapid sensory-driven accumulation of activity encoding each visual feature in memory, and a slower accumulation of internal error that causes memorized features to randomly drift over time. Instead of facilitating read-out from an independent sensory store, an early cue benefits recall by lifting the effective limit on VWM signal strength imposed when multiple items compete for representation, allowing memory for the cued item to be supplemented with information from the decaying sensory trace. Empirical measurements of human recall dynamics validate these predictions while excluding alternative model architectures. A key conclusion is that differences in capacity classically thought to distinguish IM and VWM are in fact contingent upon a single resource-limited WM store.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88510">Metabolic and neurobehavioral disturbances induced by purine recycling deficiency in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) are two structurally related enzymes involved in purine recycling in humans. Inherited mutations that suppress HGPRT activity are associated with Lesch–Nyhan disease (LND), a rare X-linked metabolic and neurological disorder in children, characterized by hyperuricemia, dystonia, and compulsive self-injury. To date, no treatment is available for these neurological defects and no animal model recapitulates all symptoms of LND patients. Here, we studied LND-related mechanisms in the fruit fly. By combining enzymatic assays and phylogenetic analysis, we confirm that no HGPRT activity is expressed in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, making the APRT homolog (Aprt) the only purine-recycling enzyme in this organism. Whereas APRT deficiency does not trigger neurological defects in humans, we observed that <i>Drosophila Aprt</i> mutants show both metabolic and neurobehavioral disturbances, including increased uric acid levels, locomotor impairments, sleep alterations, seizure-like behavior, reduced lifespan, and reduction of adenosine signaling and content. Locomotor defects could be rescued by Aprt re-expression in neurons and reproduced by knocking down <i>Aprt</i> selectively in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) dopaminergic neurons, the mushroom bodies, or glia subsets. Ingestion of allopurinol rescued uric acid levels in <i>Aprt</i>-deficient mutants but not neurological defects, as is the case in LND patients, while feeding adenosine or <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) during development fully rescued the epileptic behavior. Intriguingly, pan-neuronal expression of an LND-associated mutant form of human HGPRT (I42T), but not the wild-type enzyme, resulted in early locomotor defects and seizure in flies, similar to <i>Aprt</i> deficiency. Overall, our results suggest that <i>Drosophila</i> could be used in different ways to better understand LND and seek a cure for this dramatic disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89967">The MODY-associated KCNK16 L114P mutation increases islet glucagon secretion and limits insulin secretion resulting in transient neonatal diabetes and glucose dyshomeostasis in adults</a></h4>

              
                The gain-of-function mutation in the TALK-1 K<sup>+</sup> channel (p.L114P) is associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). TALK-1 is a key regulator of β-cell electrical activity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The <i>KCNK16</i> gene encoding TALK-1 is the most abundant and β-cell-restricted K<sup>+</sup> channel transcript. To investigate the impact of <i>KCNK16</i> L114P on glucose homeostasis and confirm its association with MODY, a mouse model containing the <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mutation was generated. Heterozygous and homozygous <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mice exhibit increased neonatal lethality in the C57BL/6J and the CD-1 (ICR) genetic background, respectively. Lethality is likely a result of severe hyperglycemia observed in the homozygous <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P neonates due to lack of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and can be reduced with insulin treatment. <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P increased whole-cell β-cell K<sup>+</sup> currents resulting in blunted glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and loss of glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Thus, adult <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mice have reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and plasma insulin levels, which significantly impairs glucose homeostasis. Taken together, this study shows that the MODY-associated <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mutation disrupts glucose homeostasis in adult mice resembling a MODY phenotype and causes neonatal lethality by inhibiting islet insulin secretion during development. These data suggest that TALK-1 is an islet-restricted target for the treatment for diabetes.

                Plastic changes in the brain are primarily limited to early postnatal periods. Recovery of adult brain plasticity is critical for the effective development of therapies. A brief (1-2 week) duration of visual deprivation (dark exposure, DE) in adult mice can trigger functional plasticity of thalamocortical and intracortical circuits in the primary auditory cortex suggesting improved sound processing. We tested if DE enhances the ability of adult mice to detect sounds. We trained and continuously evaluated the behavioral performance of mice in control and DE conditions using automated home-cage training. Consistent with age-related peripheral hearing loss present in C57BL/6J mice, we observed decreased performance for high-frequency sounds with age, which was reduced by DE. In CBA mice with preserved peripheral hearing, we also found that DE enhanced auditory performance in low and mid frequencies over time compared to the control.

">Two routes to value-based decisions in Parkinsons disease: differentiating incremental reinforcement learning from episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                Patients with Parkinsons disease are impaired at incremental reward-based learning. It is typically assumed that this impairment reflects a loss of striatal dopamine. However, many open questions remain about the nature of reward-based learning deficits in Parkinsons. Recent studies have found that a combination of different cognitive and computational strategies contribute even to simple reward-based learning tasks, suggesting a possible role for episodic memory. These findings raise critical questions about how incremental learning and episodic memory interact to support learning from past experience and what their relative contributions are to impaired decision-making in Parkinsons disease. Here we addressed these questions by asking patients with Parkinsons disease (n=26) both on and off their dopamine replacement medication and age- and education-matched healthy controls (n=26) to complete a task designed to isolate the contributions of incremental learning and episodic memory to reward-based learning and decision-making. We found that Parkinsons patients performed as well as healthy controls when using episodic memory, but were impaired at incremental reward-based learning. Dopamine replacement medication remediated this deficit while enhancing subsequent episodic memory for the value of motivationally relevant stimuli. These results demonstrate that Parkinsons patients are impaired at learning about reward from trial-and-error when episodic memory is properly controlled for, and that learning based on the value of single experiences remains intact in patients with Parkinsons disease.

">Does age protect against loss of tonotopy after acute deafness in adulthood?</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian auditory system develops a topographical organization of sound frequencies along its pathways, also called tonotopy, as a result of early auditory input. In contrast, sensory deprivation during early development results in no or only rudimentary tonotopic organization. This study addresses two questions: 1) How robust is the tonotopy when hearing fails in adulthood? 2) What role does age play at time of deafness? To address these questions, we deafened young and old adult rats with normal hearing. One month after deafness, both groups were unilaterally supplied with cochlear implants and electrically stimulated for two hours. The central auditory neurons, which were activated as a result of the local electrical intracochlear stimulation, were visualized using Fos staining. While the auditory system of young rats lost the tonotopic organization throughout the brainstem, the auditory system of the older rats mainly sustained its tonotopy. It can be proposed that neuronal plasticity prevails in the central auditory system of young adult rats, while neuronal stability prevails in the brains of aging rats. Consequently, age may be an important factor in protecting a hearing-experienced adult auditory system from a rapid loss of tonotopy when suffering from acute hearing loss. Furthermore, the study provides compelling evidence that acute deafness in young adult patients should be diagnosed as early as possible to prevent maladaptation of the central auditory system and thus achieve the optimal hearing outcome with a hearing prosthesis.

">Prefrontal dopamine circuits are required for active avoidance learning but not fear learning</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) resolves approach-avoidance conflicts and mediates associative processes required for learning to avoid threats. Dopamine (DA) projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the mPFC carry information about aversive outcomes that may inform prefrontal computations. However, the role of prefrontal DA in learning based on aversive outcomes remains poorly understood. Here, we used platform mediated avoidance (PMA) to study the role of mPFC DA in threat avoidance learning in mice. We show that activity within dopaminergic VTA terminals in the mPFC is required for signaled avoidance learning, but not for escape, conditioned fear, or to recall a previously learned avoidance strategy. Using a Rescorla-Wagner model fit to the behavior of individual mice, we discovered that VTA-mPFC activity drives experience-dependent transitions in the mode of learning. As mice learn PMA, changes in avoidance behavior were initially driven by experiences of shock and later by successful shock avoidance. Inhibition of VTA-mPFC terminals prevented this transition. Taken together, these data indicate that mPFC DA is necessary to rapidly form associations between predictive cues and actions that preempt aversive outcomes.

	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is effectively employed to describe cognitive patterns corresponding to different tasks of motor functions for brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (BCI) implementation. Explicit information processing is necessary to reduce the computational complexity of practical BCI systems. This paper presents an entropy-based approach to select effective EEG channels for motor imagery (MI) classification in brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (BCI) systems. The method identifies channels with higher entropy scores, which is an indication of greater information content. It discards redundant or noisy channels leading to reduced computational complexity and improved classification accuracy. High entropy means a more disordered pattern, whereas low entropy means a less disordered pattern with less information. The entropy of each channel for individual trials is calculated. The weight of each channel is represented by the mean entropy of the channel over all the trials. A set of channels with higher mean entropy are selected as effective channels for MI classification. A limited number of sub-band signals are created by decomposing the selected channels. To extract the spatial features, the common spatial pattern (CSP) is applied to each sub-band space of EEG signals. The CSP-based features are used to classify the right-hand and right-foot MI tasks using a support vector machine (SVM). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using two publicly available EEG datasets, known as BCI competition III&amp;amp;ndash;IV(A) and BCI competition IV&amp;amp;ndash;I. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses cutting-edge techniques.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-440/v1?src=rss">Systematic review of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy: global perspectives and implications. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The acceptance rate towards COVID-19 vaccination among the global population could be higher due to the need for more education or awareness of prevention strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, there is a dire need to reduce the population’s reluctance towards COVID-19 vaccination across the globe, which will ultimately lead to the implementation of prevention and control strategies against the COVID-19 virus and improving health outcomes across the globe. The following study intends to conduct a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and the current trends related to COVID-19 vaccination faced by the global population. The methodology employed in this study primarily focused on assessing secondary data by conducting a systematic literature review. Internet and electronic databases were used to select research articles to obtain secondary sources. Six articles were selected from ScienceDirect and Google Scholar for a systematic literature review. The keywords used for the selection of articles were “COVID-19,” “Global trends,” Reluctance, “and “vaccination.” The selected articles that were most suitable for the topic consisted of global trends related to COVID-19 vaccination. Six articles relevant to the topic were selected and reviewed. The selected articles showed data collection results from different research journals. The findings of the six research articles depicted common themes, such as each vaccine having a different level of access attitude towards the regional existence, which primarily depends on the variability to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness. Further studies are required to evaluate the factors and strategies that help healthcare organizations and governments reduce the reluctance to use the COVID-19 vaccine among populations worldwide.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-439/v1?src=rss">There is no easy fix to peer review but paying referees and regulating the number of submissions might help [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The exponential increase in the number of submissions, further accelerated by generative AI, and the decline in the availability of experts are burdening the peer review process. This has led to high unethical desk rejection rates, a growing appeal for the publication of unreviewed preprints, and a worrying proliferation of predatory journals. The idea of monetarily compensating peer reviewers has been around for many years; maybe, it is time to take it seriously as one way to save the peer review process. Here, I argue that paying reviewers, when done in a fair and transparent way, is a viable solution. Like the case of professional language editors, part-time or full-time professional reviewers, managed by universities or for-profit companies, can be an integral part of modern peer review. Being a professional reviewer could be financially attractive to retired senior researchers and to researchers who enjoy evaluating papers but are not motivated to do so for free. Moreover, not all produced research needs to go through peer review, and thus persuading researchers to limit submissions to their most novel and useful research could also help bring submission volumes to manageable levels. Overall, this paper reckons that the problem is not the peer review process per se but rather its function within an academic ecosystem dominated by an unhealthy culture of ‘publish or perish’. Instead of reforming the peer review process, academia has to look for better science dissemination schemes that promote collaboration over competition, engagement over judgement, and research quality and sustainability over quantity.

                Background Dentocraniofacial asymmetry is a common condition that affects many individuals. Accurate diagnosis of this condition is essential for effective treatment planning. Aim This study aimed to compare the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial asymmetry using two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods. Methods A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at the Orthodontic Specialist Clinic of the Dental Hospital Faculty of Dentistry, University of Indonesia from March to April 2023. The study included 15 patients who had not undergone orthodontic treatment and were diagnosed with dentocraniofacial asymmetry. The study compared the results of diagnosing asymmetry in 15 different facial features, including the anterior nasal spine, upper and lower first incisors, pterygomaxillary fissure, orbita, menton, porion, upper and lower first molars, coronoid process, gonion, zygoma, latero nasale, and jugulare. Results The study found that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two- and three-dimensional methods across all 15 parameters measured. The researchers used Fisher's Exact Test to compare the proportion between dependent variables and found that the p-value was greater than 0.05, indicating that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two methods. The study also used Kappa Cohen analysis to measure the strength of agreement between the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods on each parameter. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that both two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods are equally effective in diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry. This information may be useful for orthodontists in deciding which method to use when diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry.

                Introduction It is essential to improve global public health and to achieve sustainable developmental goals. Mental health problems are common during menstruation in adolescent girls. Menstrual problems affect academic performance, personal lives, and social lives. Menstrual problems are both affective and somatic. This study is undertaken to study the Impact of Menstruation on the Mental Health of young adolescent girls. The participants ‘ ages range from 15 to 19 years. Adolescent coping method ds Mental health, psychological well-being, and spiritual well-being were assessed. Menstrual-phase respondents exhibited increased psychological traits as a measure of adolescent girls’ coping with mental difficulties. Objectives To evaluate menstruation-related knowledge, attitude, sources of information, and psychological well-being To determine the mental health problems during the menstrual cycle. To find out the association between sociodemographic variables and mental health problems during menstrual cycle Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural area of the Wardha district. This study used a descriptive cross-sectional research design. A sample of 364 individuals was selected using random sampling. The inclusion criteria were adolescent girls aged 15–19 years who attained menstruation. Exclusion criteria: Girls younger than 15 years and above 19 years, as well as those who were hesitant and uncomfortable asking for information to participate in the study, were excluded. Outcomes Adolescent girls experienced menstruation-related psychosocial issues that are not uncommon. Menstrual distress, burden, stigma, lack of counselling services, lack of preparation menarche, lack of easy access to clean resources, vacy concerns when changing pads are necessary, lack of facilities for disposing sanitary napkins, and inadequate psychological and social support. Most girls experienced stress, mood swings, and restlessness during their menstrual cycle. These findings are consistent with past studies that found that the majority of girls were agitated during menstruation. Approximately 25% of them felt ashamed and guilty about their pubertal changes, and experienced menarche in fear, shyness, and sadness. On the first day of menstruation, girls report psychological problems such as anxiety, trouble concentrating, sadness, irritability, and excitement7. Approximately two-thirds of teenagers in the current study were unaware that menarche occurred earlier.

                Background The primary goal of this research is to underscore the significance of molecular docking in the context of malaria drug discovery. Molecular docking plays a crucial role in comprehending the interactions between prospective drugs and the target proteins found in Plasmodium parasites. The study delves into the docking interactions of various compounds, emphasizing the necessity of stabilizing the active site to formulate potent and selective drugs. Methods The research focuses on highlighting compound-specific interactions with residues, stressing the importance of stabilizing the active site to design drugs tailored to specific target proteins. Inhibiting the function of these target proteins disrupts the life cycle of the malaria parasite. Quantum Similarity Analysis, utilizing Overlap and Coulomb operators, is employed to identify electronic similarities. The resulting quantum similarity values guide subsequent chemical reactivity analysis. Global reactivity indices such as chemical potential, hardness, softness, and electrophilicity contribute to drug design by showcasing compound-specific indices that underscore the significance of stability and electrophilicity. Fukui functions are utilized to visualize regions for stabilization, providing insights crucial for potential malaria treatment. Results The enhancement of drug-target binding affinity is observed through stabilizing interactions in the active site. Understanding electrophilicity at the active site emerges as a critical factor in drug design and selectivity. The rational manipulation of electrophilic interactions holds promise for developing potent and selective drugs against malaria. Consequently, the integration of molecular docking, quantum similarity analysis, and chemical reactivity indices offers a comprehensive approach to malaria drug discovery. Conclusions The study identifies potential lead compounds, emphasizing the crucial role of stabilizing the active site. Additionally, it sheds light on electronic considerations vital for the design of effective and resistance-resistant drugs. The insights provided by Fukui functions into regions susceptible to -H bond formation make these compounds promising candidates for malaria treatment.

                <p>by Valdemar Kargård Olsen, Jonathan R. Whitlock, Yasser Roudi</p>

We investigate the ability of the pairwise maximum entropy (PME) model to describe the spiking activity of large populations of neurons recorded from the visual, auditory, motor, and somatosensory cortices. To quantify this performance, we use (1) Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, (2) the extent to which the pairwise model predicts third-order correlations, and (3) its ability to predict the probability that multiple neurons are simultaneously active. We compare these with the performance of a model with independent neurons and study the relationship between the different performance measures, while varying the population size, mean firing rate of the chosen population, and the bin size used for binarizing the data. We confirm the previously reported excellent performance of the PME model for small population sizes <i>N</i> < 20. But we also find that larger mean firing rates and bin sizes generally decreases performance. The performance for larger populations were generally not as good. For large populations, pairwise models may be good in terms of predicting third-order correlations and the probability of multiple neurons being active, but still significantly worse than small populations in terms of their improvement over the independent model in KL-divergence. We show that these results are independent of the cortical area and of whether approximate methods or Boltzmann learning are used for inferring the pairwise couplings. We compared the scaling of the inferred couplings with <i>N</i> and find it to be well explained by the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, whose strong coupling regime shows a complex phase with many metastable states. We find that, up to the maximum population size studied here, the fitted PME model remains outside its complex phase. However, the standard deviation of the couplings compared to their mean increases, and the model gets closer to the boundary of the complex phase as the population size grows.

                <p>by Zheng Yuan, Mark F. van Delft, Mark Xiang Li, Fransisca Sumardy, Brian J. Smith, David C. S. Huang, Guillaume Lessene, Yelena Khakam, Ruitao Jin, Sitong He, Nicholas A. Smith, Richard W. Birkinshaw, Peter E. Czabotar, Grant Dewson</p>

BAK and BAX execute intrinsic apoptosis by permeabilising the mitochondrial outer membrane. Their activity is regulated through interactions with pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins and with non-BCL-2 proteins including the mitochondrial porin VDAC2. VDAC2 is important for bringing both BAK and BAX to mitochondria where they execute their apoptotic function. Despite this important function in apoptosis, while interactions with pro-survival family members are well characterised and have culminated in the development of drugs that target these interfaces to induce cancer cell apoptosis, the interaction between BAK and VDAC2 remains largely undefined. Deep scanning mutagenesis coupled with cysteine linkage identified key residues in the interaction between BAK and VDAC2. Obstructive labelling of specific residues in the BH3 domain or hydrophobic groove of BAK disrupted this interaction. Conversely, mutating specific residues in a cytosol-exposed region of VDAC2 stabilised the interaction with BAK and inhibited BAK apoptotic activity. Thus, this VDAC2–BAK interaction site can potentially be targeted to either inhibit BAK-mediated apoptosis in scenarios where excessive apoptosis contributes to disease or to promote BAK-mediated apoptosis for cancer therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-628/v3?src=rss">Screening for antifolate and artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum dried-blood spots from three hospitals of Eritrea [version 3; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Antimalarial drug resistance is a major challenge hampering malaria control and elimination. About three-quarters of Eritrea’s population resides in the malaria-endemic western lowlands of the country. Plasmodium falciparum, the leading causative parasite species, has developed resistance to basically all antimalarials. Continued surveillance of drug resistance using genetic markers provides important molecular data for treatment policies which complements clinical studies, and strengthens control efforts. This study sought to genotype point mutations associated with P. falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemisinin, in dried-blood spots from three hospitals in the western lowlands of Eritrea. Methods Dried-blood spot samples were collected from patients visiting Adi Quala, Keren and Gash Barka Hospitals, between July and October, 2014. The patients were followed up after treatment with first line artesunate-amodiaquine, and dried-blood spots were collected on day three after treatment. Nested polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing techniques were employed to genotype point mutations in the Pfdhfr (PF3D7_0417200), Pfdhps (PF3D7_0810800) and PfK13 (PF3D7_1343700) partial gene regions. Results Sequence data analyses of PCR-positive isolates found wild-type artemisinin haplotypes associated with resistance (Y493Y, R539R, I543I) in three isolates, whereas four mutant antifolate haplotypes associated with resistance were observed in six isolates. These included the triple-mutant Pfdhfr (S108N, C59R, N51I) haplotype, the double-mutant Pfdhfr (N51I, S108N) haplotype, the single-mutant Pfdhfr (K540E) haplotype, and the mixed-mutant Pfdhfr-Pfdhps (S108N, N51I + K540E) haplotype. Other findings observed were, a rare non-synonymous Pfdhfr V45A mutation in four isolates, and a synonymous Pfdhps R449R in one isolate. Conclusions The mutant antifolate haplotypes observed indicate a likely existence of full SP resistance. Further studies can be carried out to estimate the prevalence of SP resistance. The wild-type artemisinin haplotypes observed suggest artemisinin is still an effective treatment. Continuous monitoring of point mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance in ART clinical studies is recommended.

The study identified four novel risk loci associated with MSA and prioritized significantly associated genes (USP38-DT, KCTD7, and lnc-KCTD7-2) within these loci. This initiative's data constitute a valuable resource for the research community.

                Ghosh and Maunsell show that LC norepinephrine neurons are selectively modulated by visual-spatial attention toward contralateral stimulus. By activating the LC optogenetically during sensory selection, they demonstrate that it drives perceptual sensitivity, improving attentional performance. This LC contribution is independent of motor processing and general arousal.

SMYD2 loss attenuates PI3K inhibitor-induced KMT2D chromatin binding at estrogen-receptor (ER) loci and ER-dependent transcription. SMYD2 inhibition sensitizes cells, patient-derived organoids, and tumors to PI3K/AKT inhibition and endocrine therapy through KMT2D K1330 methylation.

                Martinez-Sarmiento et al. demonstrate that, during heterokaryon reprogramming, global chromatin decondensation and loss of repressive histone modifications occur at late stages after cell fusion. Activation of OCT4 precedes global chromatin decompaction and does not require the opening of its local genomic region. Conversely, NANOG activation occurs after OCT4 activation, and the NANOG locus undergoes opening prior to its transcriptional activation.

                Cuhadar et al. find that the abundance of LGI1 at the presynaptic surface controls glutamatergic transmission. Synaptic surface LGI1 increases with neuronal activity but is reduced by patient-derived autoantibodies against LGI1. Results support the role of LGI1 in the control of synaptic transmission and its causal role in epilepsy.

                The reconstruction of complete microbial metabolic pathways using ‘omics data from environmental samples remains challenging. Computational pipelines for pathway reconstruction that utilize machine learning methods to predict the presence or absence of KEGG modules in incomplete genomes are lacking. Here, we present MetaPathPredict, a software tool that incorporates machine learning models to predict the presence of complete KEGG modules within bacterial genomic datasets. Using gene annotation data and information from the KEGG module database, MetaPathPredict employs deep learning models to predict the presence of KEGG modules in a genome. MetaPathPredict can be used as a command line tool or as a Python module, and both options are designed to be run locally or on a compute cluster. Benchmarks show that MetaPathPredict makes robust predictions of KEGG module presence within highly incomplete genomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90996">The substrate-binding domains of the osmoregulatory ABC importer OpuA transiently interact</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria utilize various strategies to prevent internal dehydration during hypertonic stress. A common approach to countering the effects of the stress is to import compatible solutes such as glycine betaine, leading to simultaneous passive water fluxes following the osmotic gradient. OpuA from <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> is a type I ABC-importer that uses two substrate-binding domains (SBDs) to capture extracellular glycine betaine and deliver the substrate to the transmembrane domains for subsequent transport. OpuA senses osmotic stress via changes in the internal ionic strength and is furthermore regulated by the 2nd messenger cyclic-di-AMP. We now show, by means of solution-based single-molecule FRET and analysis with multi-parameter photon-by-photon hidden Markov modeling, that the SBDs transiently interact in an ionic strength-dependent manner. The smFRET data are in accordance with the apparent cooperativity in transport and supported by new cryo-EM data of OpuA. We propose that the physical interactions between SBDs and cooperativity in substrate delivery are part of the transport mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89424">Septin 7 interacts with Numb to preserve sarcomere structural organization and muscle contractile function</a></h4>

              
                Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which aging-related reductions of the levels of <i>Numb</i> in skeletal muscle fibers contribute to loss of muscle strength and power, two critical features of sarcopenia. Numb is an adaptor protein best known for its critical roles in development, including asymmetric cell division, cell-type specification, and termination of intracellular signaling. <i>Numb</i> expression is reduced in old humans and mice. We previously showed that, in mouse skeletal muscle fibers, Numb is localized to sarcomeres where it is concentrated near triads; conditional inactivation of <i>Numb</i> and a closely related protein <i>Numb</i>-like (<i>Numbl</i>) in mouse myofibers caused weakness, disorganization of sarcomeres, and smaller mitochondria with impaired function. Here, we found that a single knockout of <i>Numb</i> in myofibers causes reduction in tetanic force comparable to a double <i>Numb</i>, <i>Numbl</i> knockout. We found by proteomics analysis of protein complexes isolated from C2C12 myotubes by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Numb that Septin 7 is a potential Numb-binding partner. Septin 7 is a member of the family of GTP-binding proteins that organize into filaments, sheets, and rings, and is considered part of the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a partial overlap of staining for Numb and Septin 7 in myofibers. Conditional, inducible knockouts of <i>Numb</i> led to disorganization of Septin 7 staining in myofibers. These findings indicate that Septin 7 is a Numb-binding partner and suggest that interactions between Numb and Septin 7 are critical for structural organization of the sarcomere and muscle contractile function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90069">Representational drift as a result of implicit regularization</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies show that, even in constant environments, the tuning of single neurons changes over time in a variety of brain regions. This representational drift has been suggested to be a consequence of continuous learning under noise, but its properties are still not fully understood. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we trained an artificial network on a simplified navigational task. The network quickly reached a state of high performance, and many units exhibited spatial tuning. We then continued training the network and noticed that the activity became sparser with time. Initial learning was orders of magnitude faster than ensuing sparsification. This sparsification is consistent with recent results in machine learning, in which networks slowly move within their solution space until they reach a flat area of the loss function. We analyzed four datasets from different labs, all demonstrating that CA1 neurons become sparser and more spatially informative with exposure to the same environment. We conclude that learning is divided into three overlapping phases: (i) Fast familiarity with the environment; (ii) slow implicit regularization; and (iii) a steady state of null drift. The variability in drift dynamics opens the possibility of inferring learning algorithms from observations of drift statistics.

">Non-invasive evidence for rhythmic interactions between the human brain, spinal cord, and muscle</a></h4>

              
                Voluntary human movement relies on interactions between the spinal cord, brain, and sensory afferents. The integrative function of the spinal cord has proven particularly difficult to study directly and non-invasively in humans due to challenges in measuring spinal cord activity. Investigations of sensorimotor integration often rely on cortico-muscular coupling, which can capture interactions between the brain and muscle, but cannot reveal how the spinal cord mediates this communication. Here, we introduce a system for direct, non-invasive imaging of concurrent brain and cervical spinal cord activity in humans using optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs). We used this system to study endogenous interactions between the brain, spinal cord, and muscle involved in sensorimotor control during simple maintained contraction. Participants (n=3) performed a hand contraction with real-time visual feedback while we recorded brain and spinal cord activity using OPMs and muscle activity using EMG. We first identify the part of the spinal cord exhibiting a peak in estimated current flow in the cervical region during contraction. We then demonstrate that rhythmic activity in the spinal cord exhibits significant coupling with both brain and muscle activity in the 5-35 Hz frequency range. These findings evidence the possibility of concurrent spatio-temporal imaging along the entire neuro-axis.

                Learning disabilities affect a significant proportion of children worldwide, with far-reaching consequences for their academic, professional, and personal lives. Here we develop digital twins - biologically plausible personalized Deep Neural Networks (pDNNs) - to investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying learning disabilities in children. Our pDNN reproduces behavioral and neural activity patterns observed in affected children, including lower performance accuracy, slower learning rates, neural hyper-excitability, and reduced neural differentiation of numerical problems. Crucially, pDNN models reveal aberrancies in the geometry of manifold structure, providing a comprehensive view of how neural excitability influences both learning performance and the internal structure of neural representations. Our findings not only advance knowledge of the neurophysiological underpinnings of learning differences but also open avenues for targeted, personalized strategies designed to bridge cognitive gaps in affected children. This work reveals the power of digital twins integrating AI and neuroscience to uncover mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Behavioural evidence of spectral opponent processing in the visual system of stomatopod crustaceans</a></h4>

              
                Stomatopods, commonly known as mantis shrimps, possess an intricate colour vision with up to 12 photoreceptor classes organised in four specialised ommatidia rows (rows 1-4 in the midband region of the eye) for colour perception. While 2-4 spectral sensitivities suffice for most visual systems, the mechanism behind stomatopods' 12-channel colour vision remains unclear. Based on neuroarchitecture, it was initially suggested that rows 1-4 may function as four parallel dichromatic channels allowing fine spectral discrimination and strong colour constancy in narrow spectral zones. Subsequently, unexpectedly low resolution in behavioural experiments indicated that a binning processing system may operate instead of or in addition to the 'normal' opponent processing system, categorising information into separate channels to create an activation pattern for rapid colour recognition. Previous anatomical and behavioural studies have speculated on the potential coexistence of these two systems in stomatopods' colour vision. However, no behavioural study has specifically investigated the potential for colour opponency in their colour vision. Our findings provide the first direct behavioural evidence for spectral opponency in stomatopods' visual system, showing that rows 1-4 operate, at least some of the time, as multiple dichromatic channels.

">Clinical Response to Neurofeedback in Major Depression Relates to Subtypes of Whole-Brain Activation Patterns During Training</a></h4>

              
                Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) presents a significant public health challenge. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) shows promise as a treatment for this disorder, although its mechanisms of action remain unclear. This study investigated whole-brain response patterns during rtfMRI-NF training to explain interindividual variability in clinical efficacy in MDD. We analyzed data from 95 participants (67 active, 28 control) with MDD from previous rtfMRI-NF studies designed to increase left amygdala activation through positive autobiographical memory recall. We focused on whole-brain activation patterns during two critical epochs of the neurofeedback procedure: activation during the self-regulation period and transient responses to feedback signal presentation. Through a systematic process involving feature selection, manifold extraction, and clustering with cross-validation, we identified subtypes within these patterns. Significant symptom reduction was observed in the active group (t=-4.404, d=-0.704, p<0.001) but not in the control group (t=-1.609, d=-0.430, p=0.111); however, left amygdala activation did not account for the variability in clinical efficacy. Subtyping analysis revealed two subtypes in regulation activation and three subtypes in brain responses to feedback signals (regulation: F=8.735, p=0.005; feedback response: F=5.326, p=0.008; interaction: F=3.471, p=0.039). Subtypes associated with significant symptom reduction were characterized by selective increases in control regions, including lateral prefrontal areas, and decreases in regions associated with self-referential thinking, such as default mode areas. These findings suggest that large-scale brain activity is more critical for clinical efficacy than the level of activation in the neurofeedback target region during training. Tailoring neurofeedback training to incorporate these patterns could significantly enhance its therapeutic efficacy.

">Disentangling neural correlates of tinnitus and hyperacusis following noise exposure in auditory cortex of rats</a></h4>

              
                Both tinnitus and hyperacusis, likely triggered by hearing loss, can be attributed to maladaptive plasticity in auditory perception. However, owing to their co-occurrence, disentangling their neural mechanisms proves difficult. We hypothesized that the neural correlates of tinnitus are associated with neural activities triggered by low-intensity tones, while hyperacusis is linked to responses to moderate- and high-intensity tones. To test these hypotheses, we conducted behavioral and electrophysiological experiments in rats 2 to 8 days after traumatic tone exposure. In the behavioral experiments, prepulse and gap inhibition tended to exhibit different frequency characteristics (although not reaching sufficient statistical levels), suggesting that exposure to traumatic tones resulted in hyperacusis and tinnitus symptoms at different frequency ranges. When examining the auditory cortex at the thalamocortical recipient layer, we observed that tinnitus symptoms correlated with a disorganized tonotopic map, typically characterized by responses to low-intensity tones. Neural correlates of hyperacusis were found in the cortical recruitment function at the multi-unit activity (MUA) level, but not at the local field potential (LFP) level, in response to moderate- and high-intensity tones. This shift from LFP to MUA was associated with a loss of monotonicity, suggesting a crucial role for inhibitory synapses. Thus, in acute symptoms of traumatic tone exposure, our experiments successfully disentangled the neural correlates of tinnitus and hyperacusis at the thalamocortical recipient layer of the auditory cortex. They also suggested that tinnitus is linked to central noise, whereas hyperacusis is associated with aberrant gain control. Further interactions between animal experiments and clinical studies will offer insights into neural mechanisms, diagnosis and treatments of tinnitus and hyperacusis, specifically in terms of long-term plasticity of chronic symptoms.

">Human hippocampal CA3 uses specific functional connectivity rules for efficient associative memory</a></h4>

              
                The human brain has remarkable computational power. It generates sophisticated behavioral sequences, stores engrams over an individual's lifetime, and produces higher cognitive functions up to the level of consciousness. However, so little of our neuroscience knowledge covers the human brain, and it remains unknown whether this organ is truly unique, or is a scaled version of the extensively studied rodent brain. To address this fundamental question, we determined the cellular, synaptic, and connectivity rules of the hippocampal CA3 recurrent circuit using multicellular patch clamp-recording. This circuit is the largest autoassociative network in the brain, and plays a key role in memory and higher-order computations such as pattern separation and pattern completion. We demonstrate that human hippocampal CA3 employs sparse connectivity, in stark contrast to neocortical recurrent networks. Connectivity sparsifies from rodents to humans, providing a circuit architecture that maximizes associational power. Unitary synaptic events at human CA3-CA3 synapses showed both distinct species-specific and circuit-dependent properties, with high reliability, unique amplitude precision, and long integration times. We also identify differential scaling rules between hippocampal pathways from rodents to humans, with a moderate increase in the convergence of CA3 inputs per cell, but a marked increase in human mossy fiber innervation. Anatomically guided full-scale modeling suggests that the human brain's sparse connectivity, expanded neuronal number, and reliable synaptic signaling combine to enhance the associative memory storage capacity of CA3. Together, our results reveal unique rules of connectivity and synaptic signaling in the human hippocampus, demonstrating the absolute necessity of human brain research and beginning to unravel the remarkable performance of our autoassociative memory circuits.

">A prefrontal cortex-lateral hypothalamus circuit controls stress-driven food intake</a></h4>

              
                Stress can drive excessive intake of palatable high-caloric food. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in this, but through unknown downstream circuits and mechanisms. Here we show, in mice, that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) is a critical substrate for stress-driven fat intake. We show that optogenetic stimulation of the mPFC-LHA increases fat intake under naive conditions. Using in vivo electrophysiology and ensemble tagging, we demonstrate that the mPFC-LHA network acutely responds to social stress. Combining patch clamp and optogenetics, we show that after social stress, plasticity occurs specifically at mPFC synapses onto LHA glutamatergic (but not GABAergic) neurons. Prior social stress primes the efficacy with which optogenetic stimulation of mPFC-LHA pathways drives fat intake, while chemogenetic inhibition of this network specifically blocks stress-driven increased fat intake. Our findings identify the mPFC as a top-down regulator of distinct LHA feeding networks, necessary for stress-eating behavior.

">Analysis of Hippocampal Synaptic Function in a Rodent Model of Early Life Stress</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early life stress (ELS) is an important risk factor in the aetiology of depression. Developmental glucocorticoid exposure impacts multiple brain regions with the hippocampus being particularly vulnerable. Hippocampal mediated behaviours are dependent upon the ability of neurones to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) mediated process. In this study we investigated the effect of ELS upon hippocampal NMDAR function. Methods: Hooded Long-Evans rat pups (n=82) were either undisturbed or maternally separated for 180 minutes per day (MS180) between post-natal day (PND) 1 and PND14. Model validation consisted of sucrose preference (n=18) and novelty supressed feeding (NSFT, n=34) tests alongside assessment of corticosterone (CORT) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) cFos reactivity to stress and hippocampal neurogenesis (all n=18). AMPA/NMDA ratios (n=19), miniEPSC currents (n=19) and LTP (n=15) were assessed in whole-cell patch clamp experiments in CA1 pyramidal neurones. Results: MS180 animals showed increased feeding latency in the NSFT alongside increased overall CORT in the restraint stress experiment and increased PVN cFos expression in males but no changes in neurogenesis or sucrose preference. MS180 was associated with a lower AMPA/NMDA ratio with no change in miniEPSC amplitude or area. There was no difference in short- or long-term potentiation between MS180 and control animals nor were there any changes during the induction protocol. Conclusions: The MS180 model showed a behavioural phenotype consistent with previous work. MS180 animals showed increased NMDAR function with preliminary evidence suggesting that this was not concurrent with an increase in LTP.

">Neurocognitive Mechanism of Radiologists Perceptual Errors: Results of Preliminary Studies</a></h4>

              
                Background: The most prevalent type of radiologist error is failing to detect abnormalities on images, the so-called perceptual error. This error type has been consistently measured and its prevalence remains essentially unchanged since it was first described in 1949. Purpose: The purpose of this research is to identify a potential neurocognitive mechanism for perceptual error, in order to inform intervention strategies to reduce such errors in practice. These experiments evaluated the relationship between brain network activation states and radiologists perceptual errors on two distinct visual tasks utilizing functional MRI (fMRI) and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRs). Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out with two fMRI experiments conducted on radiologist participants utilizing distinct types of visual tasks: the first requiring their continuous attention and the second task requiring visual search. For the first experiment, two modalities of functional brain imaging, functional MRI (fMRI) and functional Near-Infrared Spectrosocpic Imaging (fNIRs) were utilized. The second experiment was performed using fMRI alone, supplemented with eye-tracking. A third experiment using fNIRs alone was an observational study of subjects neurocognitive states during their usual practice. Results: A nearly fourfold increased risk of false-negative (FN) errors (misses) was demonstrated in the presence of a particular error-prone neurocognitive state (EPS) involving simultaneous co-activation of elements of the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Frontoparietal Network (FPN). We also found a high prevalence of the EPS in radiologists performing their normal interpretive tasks in their actual practice setting. Conclusion: Our results suggest that dynamic interactions between brain networks leading to a particular error-prone state (EPS) may underlie a substantial fraction of radiologists perceptual errors. We demonstrate that this EPS can be detected unobtrusively in the clinical setting. These results suggest potential intervention strategies for perceptual error, the largest class of radiologist errors in practice.

	<p>Background: Theory of Mind (ToM) impairment has repeatedly been found in paranoid schizophrenia. The current study aims at investigating whether this is related to a deficit in ToM (undermentalizing) or an increased ToM ability to hyperattribute others&amp;amp;rsquo; mental states (overmentalizing). Methods: Mental state attribution was examined in 24 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (12 acute paranoid (APS) and 12 post-acute paranoid (PPS)) with regard to positive symptoms as well as matched healthy persons using a moving shapes paradigm. We used 3-T-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to provide insights into the neural underpinnings of ToM due to attributional processes in different states of paranoid schizophrenia. Results: In the condition that makes demands on theory of mind skills (ToM condition), in patients with diagnosed schizophrenia less appropriate mental state descriptions have been used, and they attributed mental states less often to the moving shapes than healthy persons. On a neural level, patients suffering from schizophrenia exhibited within the ToM network hypoactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and hyperactivity in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) as compared to the healthy sample. Conclusions: Our results indicate both undermentalizing and hypoactivity in the MPFC and increased overattribution related to hyperactivity in the TPJ in paranoid schizophrenia, providing new implications for understanding ToM in paranoid schizophrenia.</p>

                <p>Human neuroimaging studies of episodic memory retrieval routinely observe the engagement of specific cortical regions beyond the medial temporal lobe. Of these, medial parietal cortex (MPC) is of particular interest given its distinct functional characteristics during different retrieval tasks. Specifically, while recognition and autobiographical recall tasks are both used to probe episodic retrieval, these paradigms consistently drive distinct spatial patterns of response within MPC. However, other studies have emphasized alternate MPC functional dissociations in terms of brain network connectivity profiles or stimulus category selectivity. As the unique contributions of MPC to episodic memory remain unclear, adjudicating between these different accounts can provide better consensus regarding MPC function. Therefore, we used a precision-neuroimaging dataset (7T functional magnetic resonance imaging) to examine how MPC regions are differentially engaged during recognition memory and how these task-related dissociations may also reflect distinct connectivity and stimulus category functional profiles. We observed interleaved, though spatially distinct, subregions of MPC where responses were sensitive to either recognition decisions or the semantic representation of stimuli. In addition, this dissociation was further accentuated by functional subregions displaying distinct profiles of connectivity with the hippocampus during task and rest. Finally, we show that recent observations of dissociable person and place selectivity within the MPC reflect category-specific responses from within identified semantic regions that are sensitive to mnemonic demands. Together, by examining precision functional mapping within individuals, these data suggest that previously distinct observations of functional dissociation within MPC conform to a common principle of organization throughout hippocampal&ndash;neocortical memory systems.</p>

                <p>Sleep is regulated by homeostatic sleep drive and the circadian clock. While tremendous progress has been made in elucidating the molecular components of the core circadian oscillator, the output mechanisms by which this robust oscillator generates rhythmic sleep behavior remain poorly understood. At the cellular level, growing evidence suggests that subcircuits in the master circadian pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals and in the clock network in <I>Drosophila</I> regulate distinct aspects of sleep. Thus, to identify novel molecules regulating the circadian timing of sleep, we conducted a large-scale screen of mouse SCN-enriched genes in <I>Drosophila</I>. Here, we show that Tob (Transducer of ERB-B2) regulates the timing of sleep onset at night in female fruit flies. Knockdown of Tob pan-neuronally, either constitutively or conditionally, advances sleep onset at night. We show that Tob is specifically required in "evening neurons" (the LNds and the fifth s-LNv) of the clock network for proper timing of sleep onset. Tob levels cycle in a clock-dependent manner in these neurons. Silencing of these "evening" clock neurons results in an advanced sleep onset at night, similar to that seen with Tob knockdown. Finally, sharp intracellular recordings demonstrate that the amplitude and kinetics of LNd postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) cycle between day and night, and this cycling is attenuated with Tob knockdown in these cells. Our data suggest that Tob acts as a clock output molecule in a subset of clock neurons to potentiate their activity in the evening and enable the proper timing of sleep onset at night.</p>

                <p>Economic choice theories usually assume that humans maximize utility in their choices. However, studies have shown that humans make inconsistent choices, leading to suboptimal behavior, even without context-dependent manipulations. Previous studies showed that activation in value and motor networks are associated with inconsistent choices at the moment of choice. Here, we investigated if the neural predispositions, measured before a choice task, can predict choice inconsistency in a later risky choice task. Using functional connectivity (FC) measures from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), derived before any choice was made, we aimed to predict subjects&rsquo; inconsistency levels in a later-performed choice task. We hypothesized that rsfMRI FC measures extracted from value and motor brain areas would predict inconsistency. Forty subjects (21 females) completed a rsfMRI scan before performing a risky choice task. We compared models that were trained on FC that included only hypothesized value and motor regions with models trained on whole-brain FC. We found that both model types significantly predicted inconsistency levels. Moreover, even the whole-brain models relied mostly on FC between value and motor areas. For external validation, we used a neural network pretrained on FC matrices of 37,000 subjects and fine-tuned it on our data and again showed significant predictions. Together, this shows that the tendency for choice inconsistency is predicted by predispositions of the nervous system and that synchrony between the motor and value networks plays a crucial role in this tendency.</p>

                <p>Several studies have shown white matter (WM) abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nonetheless, robust characterization of WM changes has been challenging due to the methodological limitations of DTI. We applied fixel-based analyses (FBA) to examine microscopic differences in fiber density (FD) and macroscopic changes in fiber cross-section (FC) in early stages of AD (<I>N</I> = 393, 212 females). FBA was also compared with DTI, free-water corrected (FW)-DTI and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). We further investigated the correlation of FBA and tensor-derived metrics with AD pathology and cognition. FBA metrics were decreased in the entire cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus and anterior thalamic radiations in A&beta;-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment compared to control groups. Metrics derived from DKI, and FW-DTI showed similar alterations whereas WM degeneration detected by DTI was more widespread. Tau-PET uptake in medial temporal regions was only correlated with reduced FC mainly in the parahippocampal cingulum in A&beta;-positive individuals. This tau-related WM alteration was also associated with impaired memory. Despite the spatially extensive between-group differences in DTI-metrics, the link between WM and tau aggregation was only revealed using FBA metrics implying high sensitivity but low specificity of DTI-based measures in identifying subtle tau-related WM degeneration. No relationship was found between amyloid load and any diffusion-MRI measures. Our results indicate that early tau-related WM alterations in AD are due to macrostructural changes specifically captured by FBA metrics. Thus, future studies assessing the effects of AD pathology in WM tracts should consider using FBA metrics.</p>

                <p>Repetitive firing of granule cells (GCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) facilitates synaptic transmission to the CA3 region. This facilitation can gate and amplify the flow of information through the hippocampus. High-frequency bursts in the DG are linked to behavior and plasticity, but GCs do not readily burst. Under normal conditions, a single shock to the perforant path in a hippocampal slice typically drives a GC to fire a single spike, and only occasionally more than one spike is seen. Repetitive spiking in GCs is not robust, and the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we used a hybrid genetically encoded voltage sensor to image voltage changes evoked by cortical inputs in many mature GCs simultaneously in hippocampal slices from male and female mice. This enabled us to study relatively infrequent double and triple spikes. We found GCs are relatively homogeneous and their double spiking behavior is cell autonomous. Blockade of GABA type A receptors increased multiple spikes and prolonged the interspike interval, indicating inhibitory interneurons limit repetitive spiking and set the time window for successive spikes. Inhibiting synaptic glutamate release showed that recurrent excitation mediated by hilar mossy cells contributes to, but is not necessary for, multiple spiking. Blockade of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels did not reduce multiple spiking but prolonged interspike intervals. Imaging voltage changes in different GC compartments revealed that second spikes can be initiated in either dendrites or somata. Thus, pharmacological and biophysical experiments reveal roles for both synaptic circuitry and intrinsic excitability in GC repetitive spiking.</p>

                <p>Synapses maintain two forms of neurotransmitter release to support communication in the brain. First, evoked neurotransmitter release is triggered by the invasion of an action potential (AP) across en passant boutons that form along axons. The probability of evoked release (<I>Pr</I>) varies substantially across boutons, even within a single axon. Such heterogeneity is the result of differences in the probability of a single synaptic vesicle (SV) fusing (Pv) and in the number of vesicles available for immediate release, known as the readily releasable pool (RRP). Spontaneous release (also known as a mini) is an important form of neurotransmission that occurs in the absence of APs. Because it cannot be triggered with electrical stimulation, much less is known about potential heterogeneity in the frequency of spontaneous release between boutons. We utilized a photostable and bright fluorescent indicator of glutamate release (iGluSnFR3) to quantify both spontaneous and evoked release at individual glutamatergic boutons. We found that the rate of spontaneous release is quite heterogenous at the level of individual boutons. Interestingly, when measuring both evoked and spontaneous release at single synapses, we found that boutons with the highest rates of spontaneous release also displayed the largest evoked responses. Using a new optical method to measure RRP at individual boutons, we found that this heterogeneity in spontaneous release was strongly correlated with the size of the RRP, but not related to Pv. We conclude that the RRP is a critical and dynamic aspect of synaptic strength that contributes to both evoked and spontaneous vesicle release.</p>

                <p>Drugs of abuse induce neuroadaptations, including synaptic plasticity, that are critical for transition to addiction, and genes and pathways that regulate these neuroadaptations are potential therapeutic targets. <I>Tropomodulin 2</I> (<I>Tmod2</I>) is an actin-regulating gene that plays an important role in synapse maturation and dendritic arborization and has been implicated in substance abuse and intellectual disability in humans. Here, we mine the KOMP2 data and find that <I>Tmod</I>2 knock-out mice show emotionality phenotypes that are predictive of addiction vulnerability. Detailed addiction phenotyping shows that <I>Tmod2</I> deletion does not affect the acute locomotor response to cocaine administration. However, sensitized locomotor responses are highly attenuated in these knock-outs, indicating perturbed drug-induced plasticity. In addition, <I>Tmod2</I> mutant animals do not self-administer cocaine indicating lack of hedonic responses to cocaine. Whole-brain MR imaging shows differences in brain volume across multiple regions, although transcriptomic experiments did not reveal perturbations in gene coexpression networks. Detailed electrophysiological characterization of <I>Tmod2</I> KO neurons showed increased spontaneous firing rate of early postnatal and adult cortical and striatal neurons. Cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity that is critical for sensitization is either missing or reciprocal in <I>Tmod2</I> KO nucleus accumbens shell medium spiny neurons, providing a mechanistic explanation of the cocaine response phenotypes. Combined, these data, collected from both males and females, provide compelling evidence that <I>Tmod2</I> is a major regulator of plasticity in the mesolimbic system and regulates the reinforcing and addictive properties of cocaine.</p>

                <p>An organizational feature of neural circuits is the specificity of synaptic connections. A striking example is the direction-selective (DS) circuit of the retina. There are multiple subtypes of DS retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) that prefer motion along one of four preferred directions. This computation is mediated by selective wiring of a single inhibitory interneuron, the starburst amacrine cell (SAC), with each DSGC subtype preferentially receiving input from a subset of SAC processes. We hypothesize that the molecular basis of this wiring is mediated in part by unique expression profiles of DSGC subtypes. To test this, we first performed paired recordings from isolated mouse retinas of both sexes to determine that postnatal day 10 (P10) represents the age at which asymmetric synapses form. Second, we performed RNA sequencing and differential expression analysis on isolated P10 ON&ndash;OFF DSGCs tuned for either nasal or ventral motion and identified candidates which may promote direction-specific wiring. We then used a conditional knock-out strategy to test the role of one candidate, the secreted synaptic organizer cerebellin-4 (Cbln4), in the development of DS tuning. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we observed a small deficit in directional tuning among ventral-preferring DSGCs lacking Cbln4, though whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings did not identify a significant change in inhibitory inputs. This suggests that Cbln4 does not function primarily via a cell-autonomous mechanism to instruct wiring of DS circuits. Nevertheless, our transcriptomic analysis identified unique candidate factors for gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms that instruct wiring specificity in the DS circuit.</p>

                <p>The ventral pallidum (VP) is a central hub in the reward circuitry with diverse projections that have different behavioral roles attributed mostly to the connectivity with the downstream target. However, different VP projections may represent, as in the striatum, separate neuronal populations that differ in more than just connectivity. In this study, we performed in mice of both sexes a multimodal dissection of four major projections of the VP&mdash;to the lateral hypothalamus (VP<SUB>-&gt;LH</SUB>), ventral tegmental area (VP<SUB>-&gt;VTA</SUB>), lateral habenula (VP<SUB>-&gt;LHb</SUB>), and mediodorsal thalamus (VP<SUB>-&gt;MDT</SUB>)&mdash;with physiological, anatomical, genetic, and behavioral tools. We also tested for physiological differences between VP neurons receiving input from nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that express either the D1 (D1-MSNs) or the D2 (D2-MSNs) dopamine receptor. We show that each VP projection (1) when inhibited during a cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) test affects performance differently, (2) receives a different pattern of inputs using rabies retrograde labeling, (3) shows differentially expressed genes using RNA sequencing, and (4) has projection-specific characteristics in excitability and synaptic input characteristics using whole-cell patch clamp. VP<SUB>-&gt;LH</SUB> and VP<SUB>-&gt;VTA</SUB> projections have different effects on CPP and show low overlap in circuit tracing experiments, as VP<SUB>-&gt;VTA</SUB> neurons receive more striatal input, while VP<SUB>-&gt;LH</SUB> neurons receive more olfactory input. Additionally, VP<SUB>-&gt;VTA</SUB> neurons are less excitable, while VP<SUB>-&gt;LH</SUB> neurons are more excitable than the average VP neuron, a difference driven mainly by D2-MSN-responding neurons. Thus, VP<SUB>-&gt;VTA</SUB> and VP<SUB>-&gt;LH</SUB> neurons may represent largely distinct populations of VP neurons.</p>

                <p>Locomotion allows us to move and interact with our surroundings. Spinal networks that control locomotion produce rhythm and left&ndash;right and flexor&ndash;extensor coordination. Several glutamatergic populations, Shox2 non-V2a, Hb9-derived interneurons, and, recently, spinocerebellar neurons have been proposed to be involved in the mouse rhythm generating networks. These cells make up only a smaller fraction of the excitatory cells in the ventral spinal cord. Here, we set out to identify additional populations of excitatory spinal neurons that may be involved in rhythm generation or other functions in the locomotor network. We use RNA sequencing from glutamatergic, non-glutamatergic, and Shox2 cells in the neonatal mice from both sexes followed by differential gene expression analyses. These analyses identified transcription factors that are highly expressed by glutamatergic spinal neurons and differentially expressed between Shox2 neurons and glutamatergic neurons. From this latter category, we identified the Lhx9-derived neurons as having a restricted spinal expression pattern with no Shox2 neuron overlap. They are purely glutamatergic and ipsilaterally projecting. Ablation of the glutamatergic transmission or acute inactivation of the neuronal activity of Lhx9-derived neurons leads to a decrease in the frequency of locomotor-like activity without change in coordination pattern. Optogenetic activation of Lhx9-derived neurons promotes locomotor-like activity and modulates the frequency of the locomotor activity. Calcium activities of Lhx9-derived neurons show strong left&ndash;right out-of-phase rhythmicity during locomotor-like activity. Our study identifies a distinct population of spinal excitatory neurons that regulates the frequency of locomotor output with a suggested role in rhythm-generation in the mouse alongside other spinal populations.</p>

                <p>A long-standing question in vision science is how the three cone photoreceptor types&mdash;long (L), medium (M), and short (S) wavelength sensitive&mdash;combine to generate our perception of color. Hue perception can be described along two opponent axes: red&ndash;green and blue&ndash;yellow. Psychophysical measurements of color appearance indicate that the cone inputs to the red&ndash;green and blue&ndash;yellow opponent axes are M vs. L + S and L vs. M + S, respectively. However, the "cardinal directions of color space" revealed by psychophysical measurements of color detection thresholds following adaptation are L vs. M and S vs. L + M. These cardinal directions match the most common cone-opponent retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the primate retina. Accordingly, the cone opponency necessary for color appearance is thought to be established in the cortex. While neurons with the appropriate M vs. L + S and L vs. M + S opponency have been reported in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus, their existence continues to be debated. Resolving this long-standing debate is necessary because a complete account of the cone opponency in the retinal output is critical for understanding how downstream neural circuits process color. Here, we performed adaptive optics calcium imaging to noninvasively measure foveal RGC light responses in the living <I>Macaca fascicularis</I> eye. We confirm the presence of L vs. M + S and M vs. L + S neurons with noncardinal cone opponency and demonstrate that cone-opponent signals in the retinal output are more diverse than classically thought.</p>

                <p>Episodic memory retrieval is associated with the holistic neocortical reinstatement of all event information, an effect driven by hippocampal pattern completion. However, whether holistic reinstatement occurs, and whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to drive reinstatement, after a period of consolidation is unclear. Theories of systems consolidation predict either a time-variant or time-invariant role of the hippocampus in the holistic retrieval of episodic events. Here, we assessed whether episodic events continue to be reinstated holistically and whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to facilitate holistic reinstatement following a period of consolidation. Female and male human participants learned "events" that comprised multiple overlapping pairs of event elements (e.g., person&ndash;location, object&ndash;location, location&ndash;person). Importantly, encoding occurred either immediately before or 24&nbsp;h before retrieval. Using fMRI during the retrieval of events, we show evidence for holistic reinstatement, as well as a correlation between reinstatement and hippocampal pattern completion, regardless of whether retrieval occurred immediately or 24&nbsp;h after encoding. Thus, hippocampal pattern completion continues to contribute to holistic reinstatement after a delay. However, our results also revealed that some holistic reinstatement can occur without evidence for a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion after a delay (but not immediately after encoding). We therefore show that hippocampal pattern completion, in addition to a nonhippocampal process, has a role in holistic reinstatement following a period of consolidation. Our results point to a consolidation process where the hippocampus and neocortex may work in an additive, rather than compensatory, manner to support episodic memory retrieval.</p>

                <p>Associative learning involves complex interactions of multiple cognitive factors. While adult subjects can articulate these factors verbally, for model animals such as macaques, we rely on behavioral outputs. In our study, we used pupillary responses as an alternative measure to capture these underlying cognitive changes. We recorded the dynamic changes in the pupils of three male macaques when they learned the associations between visual stimuli and reward sizes under the classical Pavlovian experimental paradigm. We found that during the long-term learning process, the gradual changes in the pupillary response reflect the changes in the cognitive state of the animals. The pupillary response can be explained by a linear combination of components corresponding to multiple cognitive factors. These components reflect the impact of visual stimuli on the pupils, the prediction of reward values associated with the visual stimuli, and the macaques' understanding of the current experimental reward rules. The changing patterns of these factors during interday and intraday learning clearly demonstrate the enhancement of current reward-stimulus association and the weakening of previous reward-stimulus association. Our study shows that the dynamic response of pupils can serve as an objective indicator to characterize the psychological changes of animals, understand their learning process, and provide important tools for exploring animal behavior during the learning process.</p>

                <p>Accurately decoding external variables from observations of neural activity is a major challenge in systems neuroscience. Bayesian decoders, which provide probabilistic estimates, are some of the most widely used. Here we show how, in many common settings, the probabilistic predictions made by traditional Bayesian decoders are overconfident. That is, the estimates for the decoded stimulus or movement variables are more certain than they should be. We then show how Bayesian decoding with latent variables, taking account of low-dimensional shared variability in the observations, can improve calibration, although additional correction for overconfidence is still needed. Using data from males, we examine (1) decoding the direction of grating stimuli from spike recordings in the primary visual cortex in monkeys, (2) decoding movement direction from recordings in the primary motor cortex in monkeys, (3) decoding natural images from multiregion recordings in mice, and (4) decoding position from hippocampal recordings in rats. For each setting, we characterize the overconfidence, and we describe a possible method to correct miscalibration post hoc. Properly calibrated Bayesian decoders may alter theoretical results on probabilistic population coding and lead to brain&ndash;machine interfaces that more accurately reflect confidence levels when identifying external variables.</p>

                <p>Hearing loss is a major disability in everyday life and therapeutic interventions to protect hearing would benefit a large portion of the world population. Here we found that mice devoid of the protein kinase suppressor of RAS 1 (KSR1) in their tissues (germline KO mice) exhibit resistance to both cisplatin- and noise-induced permanent hearing loss compared with their wild-type KSR1 littermates. KSR1 is a scaffold protein that brings in proximity the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins BRAF, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 and assists in their activation through a phosphorylation cascade induced by both cisplatin and noise insults in the cochlear cells. KSR1, BRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 are all ubiquitously expressed in the cochlea. Deleting the KSR1 protein tempered down the MAPK phosphorylation cascade in the cochlear cells following both cisplatin and noise insults and conferred hearing protection of up to 30&nbsp;dB SPL in three tested frequencies in male and female mice. Treatment with dabrafenib, an FDA-approved oral BRAF inhibitor, protected male and female KSR1 wild-type mice from both cisplatin- and noise-induced hearing loss. Dabrafenib treatment did not enhance the protection of KO KSR1 mice, providing evidence dabrafenib works primarily through the MAPK pathway. Thus, either elimination of the KSR1 gene expression or drug inhibition of the MAPK cellular pathway in mice resulted in profound protection from both cisplatin- and noise-induced hearing loss. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway, a cellular pathway that responds to damage in the cochlear cells, can prove a valuable strategy to protect and treat hearing loss.</p>

                Background Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance have individually been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, and their potential interplay in the context of Acute Ischemic Stroke remains a subject of investigation. This study aims to elucidate the association between NAFLD, insulin resistance, and Acute Ischemic Stroke, exploring risk factors, etiology, and potential implications for patient management. Methods This prospective observational cross-sectional study will be conducted at Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, enrolling patients aged 40-79 diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke between 2022 and 2025. Diagnostic confirmation will involve brain imaging, and abdominal ultrasonography will assess NAFLD severity. Biochemical parameters will be measured for insulin resistance evaluation, including blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting insulin levels. The Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) will be calculated. Statistical analyses, including descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariate analyses, will be applied to explore associations and potential risk factors. Expected Outcome Anticipated findings include insights into the prevalence and severity of NAFLD in Acute Ischemic Stroke patients, the association between insulin resistance and stroke incidence, and potential risk factors contributing to this association. The study provides a foundation for understanding the complex relationship between NAFLD, insulin resistance, and Acute Ischemic Stroke, offering valuable implications for risk stratification and patient management in clinical practice. Identifying modifiable risk factors may guide targeted interventions, contributing to improved outcomes in this patient population.

                An array of congenital cardiac disorders known as partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections (PAPVC) occur when pulmonary veins, abnormally drain into the right atrium. This can happen directly into the right atrium or via draining into systemic veins. A 10 year old female patient had chief complaints of difficulty in breathing and frequent fever hence she visited rural hospital where 2D echo was done which reviled PAPVC associated with 16 mm ASD (Atrial Septal Defect). She underwent ASD closure along with pulmonary valvotomy as a part of surgical management after which a well-planned cardiac rehabilitation has been ingrained through several breathing methods such as breathing exercises, respiratory muscle strength and home exercise program, helping the patient to carry out her activities of daily living. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Respiratory Muscle Strength using MicroRPM device, 6 Minute Walk Distance (MWD), Borg Scale and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). In this present instance, carefully thought-out physical therapy rehabilitation has been shown to be successful in enhancing functional capacity, respiratory muscle strength, optimizing functional capacity, and lowering fatigue.

                Background Dietary supplements (DS) use among Lebanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased widely due to the country’s economic and financial situation. This study was conducted (1) to estimate the prevalence of DS use among persons with T2DM amid the escalating economic crisis in Lebanon; (2) to explore the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of DS use; and (3) to determine any significant association between socio-economic and socio-demographic factors and the use of DS modality Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the worst episode of the economic crisis between October and April 2022 on 460 adult patients with T2DM of both sexes. Patients were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire. Results Almost 4 out of 10 patients with T2DM in our study were found to be using DS, where 27.6% take multivitamins frequently. One-third of the participants agreed that nutritional supplements are necessary to control diabetes symptoms and complications. Around 41.1% of the participants complained about hypoglycemia and used DS to control their blood sugar levels (56.4%), while the rest used it to improve their health (35.5%) and control their diet (2.2%). The predictors of DS usage were the patient’s level of education [OR=3.9, CI=1.5-10, p=0.003), self-monitoring of blood sugars (OR=4.9, CI=1.68-14.6; p=0.004) and reading the nutrition label [OR=59.3, CI=6.3-55.8, p=0.000]. Conclusion This study estimated the prevalence of DS use and abuse, among persons with diabetes type II and found three significant predictors of DS use among patients with T2DM. Public health experts should encourage healthy discussions and awareness with their patients to comprehend their views regarding DS use.

                <p>by Keiji Ota, Laurence T. Maloney</p>

Bayesian decision theory (BDT) is frequently used to model normative performance in perceptual, motor, and cognitive decision tasks where the possible outcomes of actions are associated with rewards or penalties. The resulting normative models specify how decision makers should encode and combine information about uncertainty and value–step by step–in order to maximize their expected reward. When prior, likelihood, and posterior are probabilities, the Bayesian computation requires only simple arithmetic operations: addition, etc. We focus on visual cognitive tasks where Bayesian computations are carried out not on probabilities but on (1) <i>probability density functions</i> and (2) these probability density functions are derived from <i>samples</i>. We break the BDT model into a series of computations and test human ability to carry out each of these computations in isolation. We test three necessary properties of normative use of pdf information derived from a sample–<i>accuracy</i>, <i>additivity</i> and <i>influence</i>. Influence measures allow us to assess how much weight <i>each point</i> in the sample is assigned in making decisions and allow us to compare normative use (weighting) of samples to actual, point by point. We find that human decision makers violate accuracy and additivity systematically but that the cost of failure in accuracy or additivity would be minor in common decision tasks. However, a comparison of measured influence for each sample point with normative influence measures demonstrates that the individual’s use of sample information is markedly different from the predictions of BDT. We will show that the normative BDT model takes into account the geometric symmetries of the pdf while the human decision maker does not. An alternative model basing decisions on a single extreme sample point provided a better account for participants’ data than the normative BDT model.

Stomata are pores on plant aerial surfaces, each bordered by a pair of guard cells. They control gas exchange vital for plant survival. Understanding how guard cells respond to environmental signals such as atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels is not only insightful to fundamental biology but also relevant to real-world issues of crop productivity under global climate change. In the past decade, multiple important signaling elements for stomatal closure induced by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> have been identified. Yet, there is no comprehensive understanding of high CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure. In this work, we assemble a cellular signaling network underlying high CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure by integrating evidence from a comprehensive literature analysis. We further construct a Boolean dynamic model of the network, which allows in silico simulation of the stomatal closure response to high CO<sub>2</sub> in wild-type <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants and in cases of pharmacological or genetic manipulation of network nodes. Our model has a 91% accuracy in capturing known experimental observations. We perform network-based logical analysis and reveal a feedback core of the network, which dictates cellular decisions in closure response to high CO<sub>2</sub>. Based on these analyses, we predict and experimentally confirm that applying nitric oxide (NO) induces stomatal closure in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> and causes hypersensitivity to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, we predict a negative regulatory relationship between NO and the protein phosphatase ABI2 and find experimentally that NO inhibits ABI2 phosphatase activity. The experimental validation of these model predictions demonstrates the effectiveness of network-based modeling and highlights the decision-making role of the feedback core of the network in signal transduction. We further explore the model’s potential in predicting targets of signaling elements not yet connected to the CO<sub>2</sub> network. Our combination of network science, in silico model simulation, and experimental assays demonstrates an effective interdisciplinary approach to understanding system-level biology.

                Background Non-publication, incomplete publication and excessively slow publication of clinical trial outcomes contribute to research waste and can harm patients. While research waste in German academic trials is well documented, research waste in Germany related to a specific disease area across non-commercial and commercial sponsors has not previously been assessed. Methods In this cohort study, we used public records from three clinical trial registries to identify 70 completed or terminated clinical trials involving women with metastatic breast cancer with trial sites in Germany. We then searched registries and the literature for trial outcomes and contacted sponsors about unreported studies. Results We found that 66/70 trials (94.3%) had made their results public. Only 13/70 (18.6%) trials had reported results within one year of completion as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The outcomes of 4/70 trials (5.7%) had not been made public at all, but only one of those trials had recruited a significant number of patients. Conclusions Discussions about research waste in clinical trials commonly focus on weakly designed or unreported trials. We believe that late reporting of results is another important form of research waste. In addition, a discussion regarding the appropriate ethical and legal rules for reporting the results of terminated trials might add value. German legislation now requires sponsors to upload the results of some clinical trials onto a trial registry within one year of trial completion, but these laws only cover around half of all trials. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of extending the scope of national legislation to cover all interventional clinical trials involving German patients.
