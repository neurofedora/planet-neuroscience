                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in <i>HCN2</i>, encoding for the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN) gated channel 2.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>GeneMatcher facilitated the recruitment of 21 individuals with <i>HCN2</i> variants from 15 unrelated families, carrying <i>HCN2</i> variants. In vitro functional studies were performed by electrophysiology with <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and membrane trafficking was investigated in HEK cells by confocal imaging. Structural 3D-analysis of the <i>HCN2</i> variants was performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The phenotypic spectrum included developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 17/21), epilepsy (10/21), language disorders (16/21), movement disorders (12/21), and axial hypotonia (10/21). Thirteen pathogenic variants (12 new and 1 already described) were identified: 11 missense (8 monoallelic and 3 biallelic), 1 recurrent inframe deletion (monoallelic), and 1 frameshift (biallelic). Functional analysis of p.(Arg324His) variant showed a strong increase of HCN2 conductance, whereas p.(Ala363Val) and p.(Met374Leu) exhibited dominant negative effects. The p.(Leu377His), p.(Pro493Leu), and p.(Gly587Asp) variants rendered HCN2 electrophysiologically silent and impaired membrane trafficking. Structural 3D-analysis revealed that, except for p.(Arg324His), all variants altered HCN2 stability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings broadened the HCN2 disease clinical spectrum to include DD/ID with or without epilepsy. Functional analysis in cellular models reveal that pathogenic <i>HCN2</i> variants can cause either loss-of-function or gain-of-function, providing critical information for the development of targeted therapies for <i>HCN2</i>-related disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03214">A Pre-trained Framework for Multilingual Brain Decoding Using Non-invasive Recordings</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with speech decoding from brain recordings have broad application potential in fields such as clinical rehabilitation and cognitive neuroscience. However, current decoding methods remain limited to single-language, single-subject, and single neuroimaging modality settings, restricting their clinical applicability and generalizability. Here we propose a joint multilingual, multi-subject and multimodal decoding framework. It maps diverse brain recordings into a unified semantic space defined by a pre-trained multilingual model (PMM), enabling decoding across multiple languages, multiple subjects and multiple neuroimaging modalities. The proposed framework is validated using non-invasive brain recordings from 159 participants across four languages. Experimental results show that it exhibits strong generalization across multilingual, multi-subject, and multimodal settings. More importantly, the proposed framework can promote linguistic fairness, which is vital for underrepresented languages in BCI applications. The unified semantic space enables cross-lingual mapping enhancement, allowing the framework to boost the decoding performance of underrepresented languages, thereby promoting linguistic fairness. Overall, the proposed framework establishes a new potential paradigm for brain decoding, opening new paths for broader applications of BCI.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03293">Learning to cluster neuronal function</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks trained to predict neural activity from visual input and behaviour have shown great potential to serve as digital twins of the visual cortex. Per-neuron embeddings derived from these models could potentially be used to map the functional landscape or identify cell types. However, state-of-the-art predictive models of mouse V1 do not generate functional embeddings that exhibit clear clustering patterns which would correspond to cell types. This raises the question whether the lack of clustered structure is due to limitations of current models or a true feature of the functional organization of mouse V1. In this work, we introduce DECEMber -- Deep Embedding Clustering via Expectation Maximization-based refinement -- an explicit inductive bias into predictive models that enhances clustering by adding an auxiliary $t$-distribution-inspired loss function that enforces structured organization among per-neuron embeddings. We jointly optimize both neuronal feature embeddings and clustering parameters, updating cluster centers and scale matrices using the EM-algorithm. We demonstrate that these modifications improve cluster consistency while preserving high predictive performance and surpassing standard clustering methods in terms of stability. Moreover, DECEMber generalizes well across species (mice, primates) and visual areas (retina, V1, V4). The code is available at https://github.com/Nisone2000/sensorium/tree/neuroips_version.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03640">Robust Scaling in Human Brain Dynamics Despite Latent Variables and Limited Sampling Distortions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea that information-processing systems operate near criticality to enhance computational performance is supported by scaling signatures in brain activity. However, external signals raise the question of whether this behavior is intrinsic or input-driven. We show that autocorrelated inputs and temporal resolution influence observed scaling exponents in simple neural models. We also demonstrate analytically that under subsampling, non-critical systems driven by independent autocorrelated signals can exhibit strong signatures of apparent criticality. To address these pitfalls, we develop a robust framework and apply it to pooled neural data, revealing resting-state brain activity at the population level is slightly sub-critical yet near-critical. Notably, the extracted critical exponents closely match predictions from a simple recurrent firing-rate model, supporting the emergence of near-critical dynamics from reverberant network activity, with potential implications for information processing and artificial intelligence.

                arXiv:2506.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To establish sub-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) as a viable option for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, particularly for chronic use, by demonstrating its effectiveness in recording and classifying sensorimotor neural activity. Approach: Two experiments were conducted in this study. The first aim was to demonstrate the high spatial resolution of sub-scalp EEG through analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials in sheep models. The second focused on the practical application of sub-scalp EEG, classifying motor execution using data collected during a sheep behavioural experiment. Main Results: We successfully demonstrated the recording of sensorimotor rhythms using sub-scalp EEG in sheep models. Important spatial, temporal, and spectral features of these signals were identified, and we were able to classify motor execution with above-chance performance. These results are comparable to previous work that investigated signal quality and motor execution classification using ECoG and endovascular arrays in sheep models. Significance: These results suggest that sub-scalp EEG may provide signal quality that approaches that of more invasive neural recording methods such as ECoG and endovascular arrays, and support the use of sub-scalp EEG for chronic BCI applications.

                arXiv:2506.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained self-supervised speech models excel in speech tasks but do not reflect the hierarchy of human speech processing, as they encode rich semantics in middle layers and poor semantics in late layers. Recent work showed that brain-tuning (fine-tuning models using human brain recordings) improves speech models' semantic understanding. Here, we examine how well brain-tuned models further reflect the brain's intermediate stages of speech processing. We find that late layers of brain-tuned models substantially improve over pretrained models in their alignment with semantic language regions. Further layer-wise probing reveals that early layers remain dedicated to low-level acoustic features, while late layers become the best at complex high-level tasks. These findings show that brain-tuned models not only perform better but also exhibit a well-defined hierarchical processing going from acoustic to semantic representations, making them better model organisms for human speech processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03959">From Spikes to Speech: NeuroVoc -- A Biologically Plausible Vocoder Framework for Auditory Perception and Cochlear Implant Simulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present NeuroVoc, a flexible model-agnostic vocoder framework that reconstructs acoustic waveforms from simulated neural activity patterns using an inverse Fourier transform. The system applies straightforward signal processing to neurogram representations, time-frequency binned outputs from auditory nerve fiber models. Crucially, the model architecture is modular, allowing for easy substitution or modification of the underlying auditory models. This flexibility eliminates the need for speech-coding-strategy-specific vocoder implementations when simulating auditory perception in cochlear implant (CI) users. It also allows direct comparisons between normal hearing (NH) and electrical hearing (EH) models, as demonstrated in this study. The vocoder preserves distinctive features of each model; for example, the NH model retains harmonic structure more faithfully than the EH model. We evaluated perceptual intelligibility in noise using an online Digits-in-Noise (DIN) test, where participants completed three test conditions: one with standard speech, and two with vocoded speech using the NH and EH models. Both the standard DIN test and the EH-vocoded groups were statistically equivalent to clinically reported data for NH and CI listeners. On average, the NH and EH vocoded groups increased SRT compared to the standard test by 2.4 dB and 7.1 dB, respectively. These findings show that, although some degradation occurs, the vocoder can reconstruct intelligible speech under both hearing models and accurately reflects the reduced speech-in-noise performance experienced by CI users.

                arXiv:2501.09805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modularity is a well-established concept for assessing community structures in various single and multi-layer networks, including those in biological and social domains. Brain networks are known to exhibit community structure at local, meso, and global scale. However, modularity is limited as a metric to a global scale describing the overall strength of community structure, overlooking important variations in community structure at node level. To address this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel measure of nodal modularity (nQ) captures both mesoscale and local-scale changes in modularity. We hypothesized that nQ would illuminate granular changes in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored nQ in multiplex networks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the early stages of AD. While limited by sample size, changes in nQ for individual regions of interest (ROIs) in our fMRI networks were predominantly observed in visual, limbic, and paralimbic systems in the brain, aligning with known AD trajectories and linked to amyloid-$\beta$ and tau deposition. Furthermore, observed changes in white-matter microstructure in our DTI networks in parietal and frontal regions may compliment studies of white-matter integrity in poor memory binders. Additionally, nQ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters indicating that nQ may be sensitive to this key turning point of AD. Our findings demonstrate the utility of nQ as a measure of localized group structure, providing novel insights into task and disease-related variability at the node level. Given the widespread application of modularity as a global measure, nQ represents a significant advancement, providing a granular measure of network organization applicable to a wide range of disciplines.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17433">Dynamical phases of short-term memory mechanisms in RNNs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.17433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-term memory is essential for cognitive processing, yet our understanding of its neural mechanisms remains unclear. Neuroscience has long focused on how sequential activity patterns, where neurons fire one after another within large networks, can explain how information is maintained. While recurrent connections were shown to drive sequential dynamics, a mechanistic understanding of this process still remains unknown. In this work, we introduce two unique mechanisms that can support this form of short-term memory: slow-point manifolds generating direct sequences or limit cycles providing temporally localized approximations. Using analytical models, we identify fundamental properties that govern the selection of each mechanism. Precisely, on short-term memory tasks (delayed cue-discrimination tasks), we derive theoretical scaling laws for critical learning rates as a function of the delay period length, beyond which no learning is possible. We empirically verify these results by training and evaluating approximately 80,000 recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are publicly available for further analysis. Overall, our work provides new insights into short-term memory mechanisms and proposes experimentally testable predictions for systems neuroscience.

Abstract: Monitoring wildlife is essential for ecology and ethology, especially in light of the increasing human impact on ecosystems. Camera traps have emerged as habitat-centric sensors enabling the study of wildlife populations at scale with minimal disturbance. However, the lack of annotated video datasets limits the development of powerful video understanding models needed to process the vast amount of fieldwork data collected. To advance research in wild animal behavior monitoring we present MammAlps, a multimodal and multi-view dataset of wildlife behavior monitoring from 9 camera-traps in the Swiss National Park. MammAlps contains over 14 hours of video with audio, 2D segmentation maps and 8.5 hours of individual tracks densely labeled for species and behavior. Based on 6135 single animal clips, we propose the first hierarchical and multimodal animal behavior recognition benchmark using audio, video and reference scene segmentation maps as inputs. Furthermore, we also propose a second ecology-oriented benchmark aiming at identifying activities, species, number of individuals and meteorological conditions from 397 multi-view and long-term ecological events, including false positive triggers. We advocate that both tasks are complementary and contribute to bridging the gap between machine learning and ecology. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/eceo-epfl/MammAlps

                arXiv:2504.18073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational approaches which emulate in-vivo nervous system are needed to investigate mechanisms of the brain to orchestrate behavior. Such approaches must integrate a series of biophysical models encompassing the nervous system, muscles, biomechanics to allow observing the system in its entirety while supporting model variations. Here we develop modWorm: a modular modeling framework for the nematode C. elegans. modWorm allows for construction of a model as an integrated series of configurable, exchangeable modules each describing specific biophysical processes across different modalities. Utilizing modWorm, we propose a base neuro-mechanical model for C. elegans built upon the complete connectome. The model integrates a series of 7 modules: i) intra-cellular dynamics, ii) electrical and iii) chemical extra-cellular neural dynamics, iv) translation of neural activity to muscle calcium dynamics, v) muscle calcium dynamics to muscle forces, vi) muscle forces to body postures and vii) proprioceptive feedback. We validate the base model by in-silico injection of constant currents into neurons known to be associated with locomotion behaviors and by applying external forces to the body. Applications of in-silico neural stimuli experimentally known to modulate locomotion show that the model can recapitulate natural behavioral responses such as forward and backward locomotion as well as mid-locomotion responses such as avoidance and turns. Furthermore, through in-silico ablation surveys, the model can infer novel neural circuits involved in sensorimotor behaviors. To further dissect mechanisms of locomotion, we utilize modWorm to introduce empirical based model variations and model optimizations to elucidate their effects on simulated locomotion. Our results show that modWorm can be utilized to identify neural circuits which control, mediate and generate natural behavior.

                arXiv:2506.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inventory routing problem (IRP) focuses on jointly optimizing inventory and distribution operations from a supplier to retailers over multiple days. Compared to other problems from the vehicle routing family, the interrelations between inventory and routing decisions render IRP optimization more challenging and call for advanced solution techniques. A few studies have focused on developing large neighborhood search approaches for this class of problems, but this remains a research area with vast possibilities due to the challenges related to the integration of inventory and routing decisions. In this study, we advance this research area by developing a new large neighborhood search operator tailored for the IRP. Specifically, the operator optimally removes and reinserts all visits to a specific retailer while minimizing routing and inventory costs. We propose an efficient tailored dynamic programming algorithm that exploits preprocessing and acceleration strategies. The operator is used to build an effective local search routine, and included in a state-of-the-art routing algorithm, i.e., Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS). Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting heuristic algorithm leads to solutions of unmatched quality up to this date, especially on large-scale benchmark instances.

Abstract: This paper introduces SENMap, a mapping and synthesis tool for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic computing architecture frameworks. SENECA is a flexible architectural design optimized for executing edge AI SNN/ANN inference applications efficiently. To speed up the silicon tape-out and chip design for SENECA, an accurate emulator, SENSIM, was designed. While SENSIM supports direct mapping of SNNs on neuromorphic architectures, as the SNN and ANNs grow in size, achieving optimal mapping for objectives like energy, throughput, area, and accuracy becomes challenging. This paper introduces SENMap, flexible mapping software for efficiently mapping large SNN and ANN applications onto adaptable architectures. SENMap considers architectural, pretrained SNN and ANN realistic examples, and event rate-based parameters and is open-sourced along with SENSIM to aid flexible neuromorphic chip design before fabrication. Experimental results show SENMap enables 40 percent energy improvements for a baseline SENSIM operating in timestep asynchronous mode of operation. SENMap is designed in such a way that it facilitates mapping large spiking neural networks for future modifications as well.

                arXiv:2506.03847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots have proven to outperform traditional robots in applications related to propagation in geometrically constrained environments. Designing these robots and their controllers is an intricate task, since their building materials exhibit non-linear properties. Human designs may be biased; hence, alternative designing processes should be considered. We present a cooperative neuro coevolution approach to designing the morphologies of soft actuators and their controllers for applications in drug delivery apparatus. Morphologies and controllers are encoded as compositional pattern-producing networks evolved by Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT) and in cooperative coevolution methodology, taking into account different collaboration methods. Four collaboration methods are studied: n best individuals, n worst individuals, n best and worst individuals, and n random individuals. As a performance baseline, the results from the implementation of Age-Fitness Pareto Optimisation (AFPO) are considered. The metrics used are the maximum displacement in upward bending and the robustness of the devices in terms of applying to the same evolved morphology a diverse set of controllers. Results suggest that the cooperative neuro coevolution approach can produce more suitable morphologies for the intended devices than AFPO.

Abstract: Retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Macular Hole (MH) significantly impact vision and affect millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial, as DR, a complication of diabetes, damages retinal blood vessels, potentially leading to blindness, while MH disrupts central vision, affecting tasks like reading and facial recognition. This paper employed two lightweight and efficient Convolution Neural Network architectures, MobileNet and NASNetMobile, for the classification of Normal, DR, and MH retinal images. The models were trained on the RFMiD dataset, consisting of 3,200 fundus images, after undergoing preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation. To address data scarcity, this study leveraged transfer learning and data augmentation techniques, enhancing model generalization and performance. The experimental results demonstrate that MobileNetV2 achieved the highest accuracy of 90.8%, outperforming NASNetMobile, which achieved 89.5% accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of CNNs in retinal disease classification, providing a foundation for AI-assisted ophthalmic diagnosis and early intervention.

                arXiv:2506.03225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning's high sensitivity to hyperparameters is a source of instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales. This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without actually tuning hyperparameters.

                arXiv:2506.03302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) uniquely combine high accuracy with interpretability, making them valuable for scientific modeling. However, it is unclear a priori how deep a network needs to be for any given task, and deeper KANs can be difficult to optimize. Here we introduce multi-exit KANs, where each layer includes its own prediction branch, enabling the network to make accurate predictions at multiple depths simultaneously. This architecture provides deep supervision that improves training while discovering the right level of model complexity for each task. Multi-exit KANs consistently outperform standard, single-exit versions on synthetic functions, dynamical systems, and real-world datasets. Remarkably, the best predictions often come from earlier, simpler exits, revealing that these networks naturally identify smaller, more parsimonious and interpretable models without sacrificing accuracy. To automate this discovery, we develop a differentiable "learning to exit" algorithm that balances contributions from exits during training. Our approach offers scientists a practical way to achieve both high performance and interpretability, addressing a fundamental challenge in machine learning for scientific discovery.

                arXiv:2506.03588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decision-making process significantly influences the predictions of machine learning models. This is especially important in rule-based systems such as Learning Fuzzy-Classifier Systems (LFCSs) where the selection and application of rules directly determine prediction accuracy and reliability. LFCSs combine evolutionary algorithms with supervised learning to optimize fuzzy classification rules, offering enhanced interpretability and robustness. Despite these advantages, research on improving decision-making mechanisms (i.e., class inference schemes) in LFCSs remains limited. Most LFCSs use voting-based or single-winner-based inference schemes. These schemes rely on classification performance on training data and may not perform well on unseen data, risking overfitting. To address these limitations, this article introduces a novel class inference scheme for LFCSs based on the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DS theory). The proposed scheme handles uncertainty well. By using the DS theory, the scheme calculates belief masses (i.e., measures of belief) for each specific class and the ``I don't know'' state from each fuzzy rule and infers a class from these belief masses. Unlike the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme also considers the ``I don't know'' state that reflects uncertainty, thereby improving the transparency and reliability of LFCSs. Applied to a variant of LFCS (i.e., Fuzzy-UCS), the proposed scheme demonstrates statistically significant improvements in terms of test macro F1 scores across 30 real-world datasets compared to conventional voting-based and single-winner-based fuzzy inference schemes. It forms smoother decision boundaries, provides reliable confidence measures, and enhances the robustness and generalizability of LFCSs in real-world applications. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/jUCS.

                arXiv:2506.03602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rule representations significantly influence the search capabilities and decision boundaries within the search space of Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs), a family of rule-based machine learning systems that evolve interpretable models through evolutionary processes. However, it is very difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem. Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS incorporates a generalization bias favoring crisp rules where feasible, enhancing model interpretability without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS achieves significantly superior test accuracy and produces more compact rule sets.

                arXiv:2506.03996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computing resources, weight pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve SNNs' efficiency. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a new one-shot post-training pruning/quantization framework, Optimal Spiking Brain Compression (OSBC), that adapts the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) method of [Frantar, Singh, and Alistarh, 2023] for SNNs. Rather than minimizing the loss on neuron input current as OBC does, OSBC achieves more efficient and accurate SNN compression in one pass by minimizing the loss on spiking neuron membrane potential with a small sample dataset. Our experiments on neuromorphic datasets (N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-Gesture) demonstrate that OSBC can achieve 97% sparsity through pruning with 1.41%, 10.20%, and 1.74% accuracy loss, or 4-bit symmetric quantization with 0.17%, 1.54%, and 7.71% accuracy loss, respectively. Code will be available on GitHub.

                arXiv:2501.09976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backpropagation is the foundational algorithm for training neural networks and a key driver of deep learning's success. However, its biological plausibility has been challenged due to three primary limitations: weight symmetry, reliance on global error signals, and the dual-phase nature of training, as highlighted by the existing literature. Although various alternative learning approaches have been proposed to address these issues, most either fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously or yield suboptimal results. Inspired by the dynamics and plasticity of pyramidal neurons, we propose Dendritic Localized Learning (DLL), a novel learning algorithm designed to overcome these challenges. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that DLL satisfies all three criteria of biological plausibility while achieving state-of-the-art performance among algorithms that meet these requirements. Furthermore, DLL exhibits strong generalization across a range of architectures, including MLPs, CNNs, and RNNs. These results, benchmarked against existing biologically plausible learning algorithms, offer valuable empirical insights for future research. We hope this study can inspire the development of new biologically plausible algorithms for training multilayer networks and advancing progress in both neuroscience and machine learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lvchangze/Dendritic-Localized-Learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02120">Random-key genetic algorithms: Principles and applications</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.02120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random-key genetic algorithm is an evolutionary metaheuristic for discrete and global optimization. Each solution is encoded as a vector of N random keys, where a random key is a real number randomly generated in the continuous interval [0, 1). A decoder maps each vector of random keys to a solution of the optimization problem being solved and computes its cost. The benefit of this approach is that all genetic operators and transformations can be maintained within the unitary hypercube, regardless of the problem being addressed. This enhances the productivity and maintainability of the core framework. The algorithm starts with a population of P vectors of random keys. At each iteration, the vectors are partitioned into two sets: a smaller set of high-valued elite solutions and the remaining non-elite solutions. All elite elements are copied, without change, to the next population. A small number of random-key vectors (the mutants) is added to the population of the next iteration. The remaining elements of the population of the next iteration are generated by combining, with the parametrized uniform crossover of Spears and DeJong (1991), pairs of solutions. This chapter reviews random-key genetic algorithms and describes an effective variant called biased random-key genetic algorithms.

                arXiv:2501.07930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal convolutional layers are valuable components in multiple areas of machine learning, such as adversarial robustness, normalizing flows, GANs, and Lipschitz-constrained models. Their ability to preserve norms and ensure stable gradient propagation makes them valuable for a large range of problems. Despite their promise, the deployment of orthogonal convolution in large-scale applications is a significant challenge due to computational overhead and limited support for modern features like strides, dilations, group convolutions, and transposed convolutions. In this paper, we introduce AOC (Adaptative Orthogonal Convolution), a scalable method that extends a previous method (BCOP), effectively overcoming existing limitations in the construction of orthogonal convolutions. This advancement unlocks the construction of architectures that were previously considered impractical. We demonstrate through our experiments that our method produces expressive models that become increasingly efficient as they scale. To foster further advancement, we provide an open-source python package implementing this method, called Orthogonium ( https://github.com/deel-ai/orthogonium ) .

                <p>Adaptive behavior in complex environments requires integrating visual perception with memory of our spatial environment. Recent work has implicated three brain areas in posterior cerebral cortex&mdash;the place memory areas (PMAs) that are anterior to the three visual scene perception areas (SPAs)&ndash;in this function. However, PMAs' relationship to the broader cortical hierarchy remains unclear due to limited group-level characterization. Here, we examined the PMA and SPA locations across three fMRI datasets (44 participants, 29 female). SPAs were identified using a standard visual localizer where participants viewed scenes versus faces. PMAs were identified by contrasting activity when participants recalled personally familiar places versus familiar faces (Datasets 1&ndash;2) or places versus multiple categories (familiar faces, bodies, and objects, and famous faces; Dataset 3). Across datasets, the PMAs were located anterior to the SPAs on the ventral and lateral cortical surfaces. The anterior displacement between PMAs and SPAs was highly reproducible. Compared with public atlases, the PMAs fell at the boundary between externally oriented networks (dorsal attention) and internally oriented networks (default mode). Additionally, while SPAs overlapped with retinotopic maps, the PMAs were consistently located anterior to mapped visual cortex. These results establish the anatomical position of the PMAs at inflection points along the cortical hierarchy between unimodal sensory and transmodal, apical regions, which informs broader theories of how the brain integrates perception and memory for scenes. We have released probabilistic parcels of these regions to facilitate future research into their roles in spatial cognition.</p>

                <p>Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE), a rare autosomal recessively inherited metabolic disease, results from mutations in ALDH7A1, a gene crucial for lysine metabolism. Although early high-dose pyridoxine treatment can control seizures, ~75% of PDE patients still have intellectual disabilities. In this study, we test the hypothesis of substrate reduction therapy for PDE by genetically perturbing lysine &alpha;-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR), an enzyme upstream of the defective ALDH7A1, in male and female laboratory mice. A homozygous mutation in LKR completely abolishes the accumulation of toxic lysine catabolism intermediates (&alpha;-aminoadipic--semialdehyde and its cyclic form, -1-piperideine-6-carboxylate), ends the epileptic state, and restores the defective brain development and cognitive impairments in ALDH7A1-deficient mice. Therefore, these genetic data prove the concept of the effectiveness of substrate reduction therapy for PDE via LKR inhibition.</p>

                <p>Voluntary movement control depends on plasticity in several interconnected brain regions, including the cerebellum (CB), primary motor cortex (M1), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). It is thought that one role of the CB is to regulate communication between PPC and M1, but causal evidence for this regulatory role in humans remains lacking. Here, we evaluated how transiently altering activity in CB via intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) affects PPC&ndash;M1 connectivity and plasticity by assessing the effectiveness of subsequent Hebbian-like cortical paired associative stimulation (cPAS) to PPC and M1. Using a within-subject design, we administered four different single-session stimulation conditions to the CB and parietal&ndash;motor pathway of the motor network and measured the aftereffects on plasticity (both sexes). We administered iTBS to the right CB or right visual cortex, followed by cPAS of a parietal&ndash;motor circuit in the left hemisphere. In a subset of participants, we performed two additional control conditions to assess the effect of CB iTBS alone and Hebbian-like cPAS of the PPC&ndash;M1 circuit alone. We evaluated motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation as a measure of motor cortical excitability before and after each plasticity induction protocol. Cerebellar iTBS reduced cPAS-induced plasticity in the parietal&ndash;motor circuit, as evidenced by a decrease in MEPs. These responses were selective, as no decreases in excitability were observed during the control experiments. These findings suggest that CB activity can modify distal neural activity in a network-connected parietal&ndash;motor circuit through heterosynaptic metaplasticity.</p>

                <p>Damage to retinal cells from disease or injury causes vision loss and remodeling of downstream visual information processing circuits. As retinal cell replacement therapies and prosthetics become increasingly viable, we must understand the postretinal consequences of retinal cell loss to optimally recover visual perception. Here, we asked whether loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) differentially impacts postsynaptic neurons in the visual thalamus&mdash;the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)&mdash;of ferrets, highly visual carnivores. We hypothesized that RGC loss might impact X more than Y LGN neurons, as there is less divergence in X retinogeniculate connections. We induced excitotoxic lesions of RGCs in a single eye and recorded neurophysiological responses of both contra- and ipsilesional LGN neurons to a variety of visual stimuli. We observed loss of responses among many LGN neurons, presumably with receptive fields within the scotoma. We also observed contralesional LGN neurons with receptive fields within or at the border of the scotoma that responded consistently to drifting sinusoidal gratings and spatiotemporally dynamic stimuli, enabling their classification as X or Y cells. Contralesional Y cell responses remained intact while contralesional X cells demonstrated higher firing rates, altered tuning to stimulus contrast and temporal frequency, and reduced spike timing precision. Consistent with neurophysiological results, alpha RGCs appeared relatively spared compared with beta RGCs. Together, our findings show that retinal cell loss differentially impacts downstream neuronal circuits, suggesting that supplemental vision recovery therapies may need to target visual circuits specialized for acuity vision.</p>

                <p>Primates, including humans, use stimulus&ndash;reward associations to guide foraging. We previously showed that both the rhinal cortex (Rh) and rostromedial caudate (rmCD) of rhesus monkeys play causal roles in assigning value to visual stimuli. Layer 5 neurons in Rh project to rmCD. Here, we reversibly interrupted this Layer 5 connection in two male monkeys by combining a unilateral Rh lesion with contralateral expression of an inhibitory DREADD delivered using a retrograde lentivirus (fusion glycoprotein type E) injected into rmCD. Interruption of projection neurons from Rh to rmCD had little effect on already learned stimulus&ndash;reward associations but impaired the learning of new associations. The learning impairment appeared when the projection neurons from the perirhinal cortex (PRh) to rmCD were silenced using microinjections of deschloroclozapine into PRh. The pathway-specific silencing led to a significant deficit in learning new stimulus&ndash;reward associations. These results suggest that the learning, but not retrieval, of visual stimulus&ndash;reward associations involves projection neurons from PRh to rmCD.</p>

                <p>Aligning one's decisions with the prevailing social norms and expectations of those around us constitutes a fundamental facet of moral decision-making. When faced with conflicting moral values, one adaptive approach is to rely on intuitive moral preference. Although theoretical accounts have proposed a link between moral preferences and interoceptive awareness&mdash;the capacity to sense internal bodily signals, this connection has not been empirically examined. This study examines the relationship between moral preferences and interoception, measured with self-report, heartbeat counting task, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Two independent experiments demonstrate that both male and female participants&rsquo; interoceptive awareness and accuracy are associated with their moral preferences aligned with group consensus. In addition, the fractional occupancies of resting-state brain states involving the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus mediated this relationship. These findings provide empirical evidence of the neural mechanism linking interoception to moral preferences aligned with group consensus.</p>

                <p>The cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia are essential for flexible learning in mammals. Although traditionally thought to operate under different learning rules, recent evidence suggests that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum may employ reinforcement learning mechanisms. This raises the question of how these structures coordinate when a common reward prediction error mechanism is active. To address this issue, we first examined output signals from the basal ganglia and cerebellum following the activity of the cerebral cortex. We recorded single-neuron activity from the output regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia&mdash;the cerebellar nuclei (CN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)&mdash;in both male and female ChR2 transgenic rats. Neurons in the CN and SNr exhibited distinct temporal response patterns; notably, the fast excitatory response in the CN, driven by mossy fiber input, was synchronized with the inhibitory response in the SNr, mediated via the direct pathway. Using these experimental findings together with connectome data, we developed both a semirealistic spiking network model and a reservoir-based reinforcement learning model. In the latter model, successful learning depended on synaptic plasticity in both the cerebellum and basal ganglia with a temporal precision on the order of 10&nbsp;ms. Furthermore, cortical &beta;-oscillations enhanced learning and optimal reinforcement learning occurred when the output of cerebellar and basal ganglia signal phase-locked at the frequency of cortical oscillation. Taken together, our results suggest that the coordinated output of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, driven by tightly tuned cortical input, underlies brain-wide synergistic reinforcement learning.</p>

                <p>Repeated stimulus exposure alters the brain's response to the stimulus. Recording fMRI data from both men and women viewing 120 presentations of two Gabor patches (each Gabor repeating 60 times), we evaluated support for two prominent models of stimulus repetition, the fatigue model and the sharpening model. Our results uncovered a two-stage learning process in the primary visual cortex. In Stage 1, univariate BOLD activation in V1 decreased over the first 14 repetitions of the stimuli, replicating the well known effect of repetition suppression. Applying moving-window multivoxel pattern analysis decoding, we found that (1) the decoding accuracy between the two Gabors decreased from the above-chance level (~60 to ~70%) at the beginning of the stage to the chance level at the end of the stage (~50%). This result, together with the accompanying weight map analysis, suggested that the learning dynamics in Stage 1 were consistent with the predictions of the fatigue model. In Stage 2, univariate BOLD activation for the remaining 46 repetitions of the two stimuli exhibited significant fluctuations but no systematic trend. The moving-window decoding accuracy between the two Gabor patches was at the chance level initially and became progressively higher as stimulus repetition continued, rising above and staying above the chance level starting at the ~36th repetition. Thus, results from the second stage supported the notion that sustained and prolonged stimulus repetition prompts sharpened representations. Additional analyses addressed (1) whether the neural patterns within each learning stage remained stable and (2) whether new neural patterns were evoked in Stage 2 relative to Stage 1.</p>

                <p>Extracellular single-unit responses to tone-in-noise (TIN) stimuli were recorded in the inferior colliculus (IC) of awake female Dutch-belted rabbits. Stimuli consisted of wideband and narrowband TIN with on-and-off characteristic frequency tones. Neural responses to wideband TIN showed a pattern of rates that increased when the tone matched CF and decreased (with respect to noise-alone responses) when the tone was above or below CF. This result differed from narrowband TIN IC responses that depended on envelope fluctuations in the stimulus, consistent with neural-fluctuation sensitivity. The wideband TIN responses could be fit with a difference-of-Gaussians model that had narrow excitation and broad inhibition; responses to TIN could not be predicted by response maps or spectrotemporal receptive fields. Responses to diotic and contralateral presentations of wideband TIN did not differ due to presentation ear. A single-CF computational model of the IC could not predict responses to wideband TIN. However, adding local off-CF inhibitory inputs to an on-CF IC model improved accuracy. These results suggest that broad inhibition could explain encoding of wideband TIN at suprathreshold signal-to-noise ratios, whereas neural fluctuation sensitivity is more important for narrowband sounds.</p>

                <p>To navigate social life, humans make inferences about the intentions, beliefs, emotions, and personalities of other people, i.e., they mentalize. A network of brain regions consistently engages more during mentalizing than during carefully controlled comparison tasks, sometimes cited as evidence of domain-specific mentalizing processes. Here we investigated the possibility that engagement of these regions during mentalizing may be due to uncertainty. We scanned 46 participants (33 female, 13 male) using fMRI as they made mental and non-mental inferences (about human minds, human bodies, and physical objects) under varying levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty explained activation in a key region of the mentalizing network: the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). Higher uncertainty was associated with greater DMPFC engagement across conditions, and, when controlling for uncertainty, DMPFC engagement did not differentiate mental from non-mental inferences. Results suggest that the apparently selective DMPFC engagement during social inference may be better understood as a response to uncertainty, which is often elevated in social contexts, with implications for the cognitive architecture of the social brain and disorders of social function.</p>

                <p>An age-dependent decline in the amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;)-degrading enzyme neprilysin (NEP) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently identified risk alleles in the NEP-coding gene further support its role in AD etiology. However, evidence for the impact of NEP on the pathophysiological progression of A&beta; plaque formation, particularly in comparison with another A&beta;-degrading enzyme, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), is still lacking. Furthermore, the functional impact of the NEP mutation, M8V, caused by the AD risk allele in the NEP gene, remains unexplored. Here we found that NEP deficiency in <I>App</I><I><sup>NL-F</sup></I> mice accelerates A&beta; plaque formation more prominently than IDE deficiency in both male and female mice. Additionally, NEP/IDE double knock-out further exacerbated the plaque deposition of <I>App</I><I><sup>NL-F</sup></I> mice, demonstrating a synergistic effect between the two enzymes. We also revealed that the M8V mutation in NEP reduced extracellular A&beta; degradation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, not by impairing catalytic activity but by increasing phosphorylation at an intracellular serine residue. This alteration in phosphorylation decreases NEP localization on the cell surface and extracellular vesicles, thereby limiting extracellular A&beta; degradation. These observations point to the role of aging-associated neprilysin decline in sporadic AD pathogenesis and endorse the strategy of upregulating neprilysin activity to treat preclinical AD.</p>

                <p>Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) is a promising neuromodulation technique capable of noninvasively modulating focal neuronal activities and neural circuits in both animals and humans. The cell-type selectivity of tFUS within targeted areas such as the somatosensory cortex (S1) during sonication has been shown to be parameter related. However, it remains unclear how tFUS affects neural circuits by changing the correlation between neurons and how to optimize the tFUS parameters to modulate neural pathways. In this study, multisite intracranial recordings are used in anesthetized male rats to quantify the neuronal responses to tFUS stimulation recorded from S1 and posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POm) of cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathway. Different tFUS parameters including ranges of pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) and duty cycles (DCs) are tested. We find that when targeting at S1, only regular-spiking units (RSUs) respond to specific tFUS parameters during sonication (DC, 6&ndash;60%; PRF, 1,500, 3,000 and 4,500&nbsp;Hz), and RSUs from the POm exhibit a synchronized response. The changes of directional correlation between S1 RSUs and POm RSUs indicate the activation of feedback modulation. Delayed responses and correlation changes were further observed at ~200&nbsp;ms postsonication from the neurons in S1 and POm, indicating feedforward modulation. Our results reveal that tFUS can modulate the feedback and feedforward CTC pathways by selectively activating cortical RSUs and adjusting the tFUS parameters, particularly the PRF, to maximize cortical RSU activity could enhance the modulation of the CTC pathway.</p>

                <p>Neural states shape perception at earliest cortical processing levels. Previous work in humans showed a relationship between initial cortical excitation, as indicated by the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), prestimulus alpha oscillations, and the perceived intensity in a somatosensory discrimination paradigm. Here we address the follow-up question whether these excitability dynamics reflect changes in feedforward or feedback signals. To distinguish feedforward neural signals from feedback signals, we leveraged high-frequency oscillations (HFO) which have previously been shown to correspond to neuronal population spiking activity of the first excitatory feedforward volley in the somatosensory cortex. We examined these HFO in electroencephalography (EEG) data of 32 male human participants, performing a somatosensory intensity discrimination task. Spatial filtering and time&ndash;frequency analyses allowed to clearly distinguish HFO from the lower-frequency, conventional SEP. Using Bayesian statistics, we found evidence against the involvement of HFO in moment-to-moment variability of perceived stimulus intensity, in contrast to previously observed prestimulus alpha and N20 effects of the conventional SEP. Given that the N20 component presumably reflects backpropagating membrane potentials toward the apical dendrites (distal dendritic sites), we argue that top-down feedback processes (e.g., related to alpha oscillations) may thus rely on activity modulations at those distal dendrites of involved pyramidal cells rather than on synchronous output firing changes at their basal compartments.</p>

Moreover, the insula was proposed to preferentially process events and stimuli in the aversive domain, rather than in a domain-general fashion. Here, we aimed to illuminate these issues. In a Pavlovian task, participants (<I>n</I> = 41; 19 women) rated both cues and outcomes, allowing us to quantify not only objective but also trial-specific subjective risk prediction errors. We found preferential coding of subjective risk prediction errors in the anterior insula and adjacent frontal cortex. This contrasted with preferential coding of objective risk prediction errors in the mid-insula. The anterior insula encoded the subjective risk prediction errors not only at the time of outcomes but also at the time of cues, in line with a temporally fine-grained computation of these prediction errors. Cue-induced subjective risk prediction error signals occurred predominantly in the aversive domain, while outcome-induced subjective risk prediction error signals occurred also in the appetitive domain. Domain-specific analyses of risk prediction errors elicited by the preceding outcome at the time of the next cue indicated that the anterior insula updates risk predictions more strongly in the aversive than the appetitive domain. Together, our findings specify the nature of risk prediction errors processed by the anterior insula as subjective, time-resolved, partly domain-general (outcome), and partly domain-preferential (cue), thereby reconciling apparently disparate lines of research.</p>

Accurate estimation of malignant cell fractions in tissues plays a critical role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and subsequent treatment decisions. However, most currently available methods provide only point estimates, neglecting the quantification of uncertainties, which is essential for both clinical and research applications. This study introduces DeepDeconUQ, a deep neural network model developed to estimate prediction intervals for malignant cell fractions based on bulk RNA-seq data. This approach addresses limitations in current malignant cell fraction estimation methods by integrating uncertainty quantification into predictions of cancer cell fractions. DeepDeconUQ leverages single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in conjunction with conformalized quantile regression to produce reliable prediction intervals. The model trains a quantile regression neural network to establish upper and lower bounds for cancer cell proportions, followed by a calibration step that refines these intervals to ensure both statistical validity (coverage probability) and discrimination (narrow intervals). Benchmark analyses indicate that DeepDeconUQ consistently surpasses existing methods, achieving high coverage accuracy with tight prediction intervals across simulated and real cancer datasets. The robustness of DeepDeconUQ is further demonstrated by its resilience to various gene expression perturbations. The DeepDeconUQ method is publicly accessible at https://github.com/jiaweih14/DeepDeconUQ.

                <p>by Emre Baspinar, Martina Simonti, Hadi Srour, Mathieu Desroches, Daniele Avitabile, Massimo Mantegazza</p>

Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a wave of depolarization with local onset and extended propagation implicated in several pathological conditions. Its mechanisms have been extensively investigated, including our recent studies showing with experimental and computational approaches that the hyperactivity of GABAergic neurons‚Äô can initiate migraine-related CSD because of spiking-generated extracellular potassium (K+) build-up. However, less is known about the role played by GABAergic neurons in CSD propagation. Here we studied mechanisms of CSD propagation, focusing on the role of GABAergic neurons, with experiments performed in mouse brain slices and with a new spatially extended neural field computational model. Experimentally, we induced CSD by applying brief puffs of potassium chloride (KCl) in somatosensory cortex slices from wild type and VGAT-ChR2-tdtomato mice, which specifically express the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in GABAergic neurons. We evaluated the role of GABAergic neurons in CSD propagation by modulating their activity with optogenetic illumination and their synaptic connections with pharmacological tools. We have developed the computational model to obtain realistic simulations of both initiation and propagation of CSD. It includes large populations of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the effect of extracellular ion concentrations on their features. We found that the decrease of the synaptic activity of GABAergic neurons can enhance CSD propagation, because of the reduction of the inhibitory synaptic weight, whereas their spiking activity can enhance CSD propagation because of extracellular K+ upload. However, differently than for CSD initiation, the latter effect is normally hidden by the action of GABAergic synaptic transmission. A reduction of GABAergic synaptic transmission, which can be observed in pathological states, can reveal the potentiating effect of the K+ upload induced by GABAergic activation. The neural field model that we implemented can generate accurate simulations of CSD, providing testable hypotheses on mechanisms, and can also be used for modeling other (patho)-physiological activities of neuronal networks.

                <p>by Ehsan Sabri, Renata Batista-Brito</p>

Neural oscillations are prominent features of brain activity, characterized by frequency-specific power changes in electroencephalograms (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP). These oscillations also appear as rhythmic coherence across brain regions. While the identification of oscillations has primarily relied on EEG and LFP, they are also present in neuronal spiking. However, several questions remain unanswered: How do spiking oscillations relate to field potential oscillations? How are spiking oscillations correlated across brain regions? And how are they connected to other physiological and behavioral measures. In this study, we explore the potential to detect individual cycles of neural rhythms solely through the spiking activity of neurons, leveraging recent advances in the high-density recording of large neuronal populations within local networks. The pooled spiking rate of many neurons within a local population reflects shared variation in the membrane potential of nearby neurons, allowing us to identify cyclic patterns. To achieve this, we utilize a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, pre-trained on synthetic data, to effectively isolate and align individual cycles of neural oscillations in the spiking of a densely recorded population of neurons. We applied this approach to robustly isolate specific neural cycles across various brain regions in mice, covering a broad range of timescales, from gamma rhythms to ultra-slow rhythms lasting up to hundreds of seconds. These ultra-slow rhythms, often underrepresented in the LFP, were also detected in behavioral measures of arousal, such as pupil size and mouse facial motion. Interestingly, these rhythms showed delayed coherence with corresponding rhythms in the population spiking activity. Using these isolated neural cycles, we addressed two key questions: 1) How can we account for biological variation in neural signal transmission timing across trials during the sensory stimulation experiments? By isolating gamma cycles driven by sensory input, we achieved a more accurate trial alignment in the sensory stimulation experiments conducted in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice. This alignment accounts for biological variability in sensory signal transmission times from the retina to V1 across trials, enabling a clearer understanding of neural dynamics in response to sensory stimuli. 2) How do spiking correlations across brain regions vary by timescale? We used the distinct spiking cycles in simultaneously recorded brain regions to examine the correlation of spiking across brain regions, separately for different timescales. Our findings revealed that the delays in population spiking between brain regions vary depending on the brain regions involved and the timescale of the oscillations. This work demonstrates the utility of population spiking activity for isolating neural rhythms, providing insights into oscillatory dynamics across brain regions and their relationship to physiological and behavioral measures.

                <p>by Caroline I. Larkin, Matthew D. Dunn, Jason E. Shoemaker, William B. Klimstra, James R. Faeder</p>

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an arthropod-borne, positive-sense RNA alphavirus posing a substantial threat to public health. Unlike similar viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, EEEV replicates efficiently in neurons, producing progeny viral particles as soon as 3‚Äì4 hours post-infection. EEEV infection, which can cause severe encephalitis with a human mortality rate surpassing 30%, has no licensed, targeted therapies, leaving patients to rely on supportive care. Although the general characteristics of EEEV infection within the host cell are well-studied, it remains unclear how these interactions lead to rapid production of progeny viral particles, limiting development of antiviral therapies. Here, we present a novel rule-based model that describes attachment, entry, uncoating, replication, assembly, and export of both infectious virions and virus-like particles within mammalian cells. Additionally, it quantitatively characterizes host ribosome activity in EEEV replication via a model parameter defining ribosome density on viral RNA. To calibrate the model, we performed experiments to quantify viral RNA, protein, and infectious particle production during acute infection. We used Bayesian inference to calibrate the model, discovering in the process that an additional constraint was required to ensure consistency with previous experimental observations of a high ratio between the amounts of full-length positive-sense viral genome and negative-sense template strand. Overall, the model recapitulates the experimental data and predicts that EEEV rapidly concentrates host ribosomes densely on viral RNA. Dense packing of host ribosomes was determined to be critical to establishing the characteristic positive to negative RNA strand ratio because of its role in governing the kinetics of transcription. Sensitivity analysis identified viral transcription as the critical step for infectious particle production, making it a potential target for future therapeutic development.

                <p>by Jana Masselink, Markus Lappe</p>

In current computational models on oculomotor learning ‚Äòthe‚Äô movement vector is adapted in response to targeting errors. However, for saccadic eye movements, learning exhibits a spatially distributive nature, i.e. it transfers to surrounding positions. This adaptation field resembles the topographic maps of visual and motor activity in the brain and suggests that learning does not act on the population vector but already on the level of the 2D population response. Here we present a population-based gain field model for saccade adaptation in which sensorimotor transformations are implemented as error-sensitive gain field maps that modulate the population response of visual and motor signals and of the internal saccade estimate based on corollary discharge (CD). We fit the model to saccades and visual target localizations across adaptation, showing that adaptation and its spatial transfer can be explained by locally distributive learning that operates on visual, motor and CD gain field maps. We show that 1) the scaled locality of the adaptation field is explained by population coding, 2) its radial shape is explained by error encoding in polar-angle coordinates, and 3) its asymmetry is explained by an asymmetric shape of learning rates along the amplitude dimension. Learning exhibits the highest peak rate, the widest spatial extension and a pronounced asymmetry in the motor domain, while in the visual and the internal saccade domain learning appears more localized. Moreover, our results suggest that the CD-based internal saccade representation has a response field that monitors only part of the ongoing saccade changes during learning. Our framework opens the door to study spatial generalization and interference of learning in multiple contexts.

                <p>by Tongjia Zhang, Shujie Wang, Yue Zhou, Zitao Jiao, Kejia Lu, Xinyi Liu, Hui Li, Wei Jiang, Xiaowei Zhang</p>

Indisulam, a sulfonamide-based compound, is employed as a second-line therapy for NSCLC due to its anti-tumor activity. However, its clinical efficacy is hindered by acquired resistance, the molecular basis of which remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that hypermethylation of RNA-binding protein 39 (RBM39), a specific target of Indisulam, is closely associated with Indisulam resistance. PRMT6 methylates RBM39 at R92. This methylation inhibits Indisulam-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of RBM39, increases RBM39 protein levels, promotes alternative splicing and expression of proto-oncogenes, and ultimately leads to malignant proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells and tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Inhibiting PRMT6 with MS023 or mutating the RBM39 methylation site enhances Indisulam sensitivity in NSCLC and significantly improves its anti-tumor efficacy. Our findings identify methylated RBM39 as a key biomarker of Indisulam resistance and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.

                Background Depression, anxiety, and insomnia significantly impact global health and impose substantial health burdens worldwide. Conventional treatments including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy face limitations in efficacy, side effects, and accessibility. Despite preliminary evidence suggesting the potential of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in managing these conditions, large-scale evaluations are lacking. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of CHM for the treatment of adults experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Methods This study will be a multicenter, assessor-blinded, pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial. Districts will be randomized to receive the CHM intervention sequentially in four steps based on a computer-generated number, while control districts remain unexposed until their respective intervention phase. The intervention consists of a three-level stepped-care approach: Level 1 involves herbal tisane for mild symptoms, Level 2 offers standardized CHM for moderate symptoms or non-responders to Level 1, and Level 3 combines personalized CHM with psychotherapy for those not improved by Level 2. Symptom severity will be assessed using validated scales, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, and Insomnia Severity Index for insomnia, with primary outcomes measured at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. The study was approved by the Hong Kong Baptist University Research Ethics Committee (Approval No.: REC/22-23/0709). Discussion This study will provide significant insights into the effectiveness of a stepped-care CHM intervention for alleviating depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

                Recognition refers to the ability to identify previously encountered stimuli, whereas navigation pertains to the capacity to employ flexible strategies to reach a destination. Despite their functional distinctions, the neural substrates of recognition and navigation share some commonalities, but many aspects of their relationship remain debated, particularly concerning the role of the hippocampus. We synthesize recent primate studies to examine how the hippocampus and related regions contribute to recognition memory and spatial navigation. We highlight that scene recognition, an ethologically relevant process for primates, is closely linked to spatial navigation. Emerging behavioral and physiological evidence suggests that while recognition and navigation share overlapping circuitry, they engage partially dissociable neural mechanisms. We argue that their interplay can be better understood through the framework of reference frame transformation.

                The Œ≤-sheet-rich core region of Œ±-synuclein fibrils is important for defining disease manifestation. In this issue of Neuron, Han et al. demonstrate that the comparatively less structured fibril fuzzy coat region also modulates Œ±-synuclein seeding activity in neurons and mice.

                The nociceptive apparatus has the remarkable ability to regulate itself by amplifying and attenuating nociception and thus pain in a context-dependent way. In this issue of Neuron, Li et al. identified a subpopulation of pontospinal projection neurons that dampen nociception in mice.

                Research on learning and memory has primarily focused on neurons. This perspective argues that understanding the biology of memory demands a comprehensive approach that encompasses not only neurons but all types of brain cells, including glial and vascular cells, and especially their interactions.

                Wu et al. identified pro-ferroptotic lipids as essential regulators of the formation and disassembly of caveolae, stress-sensing structures at the plasma membrane. A targeted miniscreen uncovered a lipid-driven mechanism that links caveola stability and dynamics to lipid metabolism, peroxidation, and cellular stress responses.

                Jiang et al. show that virus infection triggers excessive ROS production and peroxisome degradation via pexophagy mediated by the ATM-PEX5-p62 axis. This degradation leads to iron accumulation, enhanced ROS levels, activation of the Fenton reaction, and ferroptosis, highlighting the peroxisome‚Äôs role in viral interactions and redox regulation.

                Ma et al. identify PGK1 as a kinase regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation via non-glycolytic functions. Lipopolysaccharide induces CK2-mediated PGK1 S271 phosphorylation, enabling PGK1 to phosphorylate NLRP3 S448/449 and recruit USP14 for deubiquitylation, driving inflammation. It highlights a novel role of PGK1 in NLRP3-driven diseases and potential therapeutic targets.

Here, the authors introduce an AI-assisted fluorescence microscopy system to track mitophagic intermediates in live cells and identify Y040-7904, a potential modulator that enhances mitophagy and reduces amyloid-Œ≤ pathologies.

                Trastuzumab resistance remains a challenge for HER2-positive breast cancer treatment. Targeting metabolic reprogramming would provide novel insights for therapeutic strategies. Here, we integrated metabolomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics data of trastuzumab-sensitive and primary-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer to identify metabolic alterations. Aberrant cysteine metabolism was discovered in trastuzumab primary-resistant breast cancer at both circulating and intracellular levels. The inhibition of SLC7A11 and cysteine starvation could synergize with trastuzumab to induce ferroptosis. Mechanistically, increased H3K4me3 and decreased DNA methylation enhanced SLC7A11 transcription and cystine uptake in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer. The regulation of epigenetic modifications modulated cysteine metabolism and ferroptosis sensitivity. These results revealed an innovative approach for overcoming trastuzumab resistance by targeting specific amino acid metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97259">A ventral hippocampal-lateral septum pathway regulates social novelty preference</a></h4>

              
                The ability to distinguish strangers from familiar individuals is crucial for the survival of most mammalian species. In humans, an inability to recognize kin and familiar individuals and engage in appropriate behaviors is associated with several types of dementia, including Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Mice preferentially spend more time investigating a novel individual relative to a familiar individual. Yet, how social novelty-related information drives increased investigation of the novel animal remains poorly understood. Recent evidence has implicated the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) as a key node in encoding information about conspecific identity. Of particular interest are vHPC projections to the lateral septum (LS), a region that has been implicated in driving a wide range of motivated social behaviors. In this study using chemogenetics, optogenetics, and monosynaptic rabies tracing, we identified a novel vHPC-LS-ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathway that is necessary for mice to preferentially investigate novel conspecifics. Using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we established that LS neurons make direct monosynaptic connections onto dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Thus, we have identified a potential pathway via which conspecific identity could be transformed to drive motivated social behaviors.

">Human microglia in brain assembloids display region-specific diversity and respond to hyperexcitable neurons carrying SCN2A mutation</a></h4>

              
                Microglia critically shape neuronal circuit development and function, yet their region-specific properties and roles in distinct circuits of the human brain remain poorly understood. In this study, we generated region-specific brain organoids (cortical, striatal, and midbrain), each integrated with human microglia, to fill this critical gap. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered six distinct microglial subtypes exhibiting unique regional signatures, including a subtype highly enriched for the GABAB receptor gene within striatal organoids. To investigate the contributions of microglia to neural circuitry, we created microglia-incorporated midbrain-striatal assembloids, modeling a core circuit node for many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism. Using chemogenetics to activate this midbrain-striatal circuit, we observed increased calcium signaling in microglia involving GABAB receptors. Leveraging this model, we examined microglial responses within neural circuits harboring an SCN2A nonsense (C959X) mutation associated with profound autism. Remarkably, microglia displayed heightened calcium responses to SCN2A mutation-mediated neuronal hyperactivity, and engaged in excessive synaptic pruning. These pathological effects were reversed by pharmacological inhibition of microglial GABAB receptors. Collectively, our findings establish an advanced platform to dissect human neuroimmune interactions in sub-cortical regions, highlighting the important role of microglia in shaping critical circuitry related to neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Dendrite-targeting inhibitory interneurons form biased circuits with deep and superficial pyramidal cells in hippocampal CA1</a></h4>

              
                In CA1 hippocampus, pyramidal cells (PCs) can be classified as deep or superficial based on their radial position within the stratum pyramidale. Deep and superficial PCs form biased circuits with perisomatic-targeting PV+ basket cells, but it is unknown if such cell-type-specific circuit motifs extend to dendrite-targeting interneurons. Using male and female mice, we investigated synaptic connectivity and physiology in brain slices from four transgenic lines thought to capture distinct subsets of interneurons: SST-IRES-Cre, Nkx2.1-Cre, Chrna2-Cre, and Htr3a-GFP. First, we found that oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells captured by the Chrna2-Cre line are a subset of Htr3a-GFP+ cells in the hippocampus. This novel finding is consistent with previous work showing Nkx2.1-Cre OLM cells are distinct from both Chrna2-Cre and Htr3a-GFP+ cells. Indeed, in paired whole-cell recordings, Nkx2.1-Cre+ interneurons in the stratum oriens, but not Chrna2-Cre+ or Htr3a-GFP+ cells, received more excitatory synaptic connections from superficial PCs relative to deep PCs. Next, we used optogenetic-assisted circuit mapping to investigate inhibition along the proximal and distal dendrites of PCs. We found that superficial PCs received stronger inhibition along their proximal dendrites than deep PCs from SST+ interneurons. Furthermore, this circuit motif was dependent on layer but not PC projection class. Finally, Chrna2-Cre OLM cells provided stronger inhibition to the distal dendrites of deep PCs relative to superficial PCs. Our data reveal that superficial and deep PCs engage in cell-type-specific circuits with dendrite-targeting interneurons. Furthermore, they support that Nkx2.1-Cre OLM cells and Chrna2-Cre/Htr3a-GFP OLM cells are distinct subtypes that form unique circuits in CA1.

">Alterations in auditory midbrain processing is observed in both female andmale mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Sensory processing deficits presenting as auditory hypersensitivity is a common phenotype associated with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Auditory hypersensitivity can also be observed in the FMR1- knockout (KO) mice, a well-established mouse model of autism and FXS. FXS is an X-linked disorder that is more prevalent in males compared to females, as a result most auditory and electrophysiology studies are performed in males. Previous in-vivo electrophysiology studies at the inferior colliculus (IC), an essential component of the auditory pathway, in male FMR1-KO mice at post-natal days 14, 21 and 34 (P14, P21 and P34) demonstrated increased neuronal firing, suggesting that the IC could play a role in auditory hypersensitivity. However, very little is known about the role of the central nucleus of the IC (ICc) and auditory hypersensitivity in females. Methods: Here we investigated auditory processing at P20 and P30, representative of early and late developmental stage of auditory development, respectively, at the central nucleus of the IC (ICc) of both female and male FMR1-KO mice, compared with wildtype (WT) animals. Results: In-vivo electrophysiology recordings from the ICc neurons of the FMR1-KO mice at both developmental ages demonstrated increased response magnitude measured by spike number to pure tones of varying frequency and amplitude, compared with age- and sex-matched WT animals. In addition, within the FMR1-KO group we also observed significant developmental and sex difference wherein higher response magnitudes were displayed at P20 and in the female mice. Minimum threshold of ICc neuron in the KO mice was significantly decreased at both P20 and P30. The ICc neurons in the KO mice also displayed increased response duration compared to WT animals at both P20 and P30, but significant sex difference was only observed at P30. Our data also indicated that the ICc neurons of both groups displayed weak negative relationship between latency and response magnitude at P20, and at P30 the WT mice showed a stronger relationship only in the female group. In terms of developmental changes, we observed decreasing neuronal firing only in the KO mice between 20- and 30-day old female and male mice. Reduced response duration was observed in 30-day old mice of both sexes of both genotypes. Regarding minimum threshold, we observed a decline between early and late auditory development only in the male mice. Finally, our results also indicated that in the WT mice the reverse relationship between latency and response magnitude became more pronounced and consistent with age, a developmental trend that was absent in both the female and male FMR1-KO mice. Discussion: Overall, our findings demonstrate that auditory processing deficits can also be observed in the female FMR1-KO mice using in-vivo electrophysiology studies, highlighting the importance of including female subjects in future studies. These results also indicate that auditory hypersensitivity can be observed robustly in younger mice, suggesting that the early development stage could be an ideal target for interventions.

">Animate-inanimate object categorization from minimal visual information in the human brain, human behavior, and deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The distinction between animate and inanimate things is a main organizing principle of information in perception and cognition. Yet, animacy, as a visual property, has so far eluded operationalization. Which visual features are necessary and sufficient to see animacy? At which level of the visual hierarchy does the animate-inanimate distinction emerge? Here, we show that the animate-inanimate distinction is preserved even among images of objects that are made unrecognizable and only retain low- and mid-level visual features of their natural version. In particular, in three experiments, healthy human adults saw rapid sequences of images (6 Hz) where every five exemplars of a category (i.e., animate), an exemplar of another category (i.e., inanimate) was shown (1.2 Hz). Using frequency-tagging electroencephalography (ftEEG), we found significant neural responses at 1.2 Hz, indicating rapid and automatic detection of the periodic categorical change. Moreover, such effect was found -although increasingly weaker- for 'impoverished' stimulus-sets that retained only certain (high-, mid- or low-level) features of the original colorful images (i.e., grayscale, texform and phase-scrambled images), and even if the images were unrecognizable. Similar effects were found with two Deep Neural networks (DNNs) presented with the same stimulus-sets. In sum, reliable categorization effects for dramatically impoverished and unrecognizable images, in humans' EEG and DNN data, demonstrate that animacy representation emerges early in the visual hierarchy and is remarkably resilient to the loss of visual information.

">A Role for Exaptation in Sculpting Sexually Dimorphic Brains from Shared Neural Lineages.</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in behaviours arise from variations in female and male nervous systems, yet the cellular and molecular bases of these differences remain poorly defined. Here, we take an unbiased, single-cell transcriptomic approach to uncover how sex shapes the adult Drosophila melanogaster brain. We show that sex differences do not result from large-scale transcriptional reprogramming but through fine-tuning of otherwise shared developmental templates via the sex-differentiating transcription factors Doublesex and Fruitless. We reveal, with unprecedented resolution, the extraordinary genetic diversity within these sexually dimorphic cell types and find birth order represents a novel axis of sexual differentiation. Neuronal identity in the adult reflects spatiotemporal patterning and sex-specific survival, with female-biased neurons arising early and male-biased neurons arising late. This pattern reframes dimorphic neurons as 'paralogous' rather than 'orthologous', suggesting sex leverages distinct developmental windows to build behavioural circuits and highlights a role for exaptation in diversifying the brain.

">Expectation effects based on newly learnt object-scene associations are modulated by spatial frequency</a></h4>

              
                Objects typically appear within rich visual scenes. Some models of visual system function propose that scene information is extracted from low-spatial frequency components and rapidly propagates through the visual processing hierarchy. This contextual information may help bias perceptual inferences toward objects that are likely to appear within a scene, enacted via top-down feedback carrying predictions. We tested this hypothesised influence of low spatial frequency information through newly learnt predictive object-scene associations. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data from 40 participants who viewed high-spatial frequency objects embedded in either low- or high-spatial frequency scenes. Object-scene pairings were probabilistically manipulated such that certain objects more frequently appeared in certain scenes. We trained classifiers on EEG data from object-only trials and tested them on object plus scene trials. We did not observe differences in classification accuracy across expected and unexpected objects for both low- and high-spatial frequency scenes, nor any interaction between spatial frequency and expectation. However, we observed expectation effects on event-related potentials. These effects arose at similar latencies for both low- and high-spatial frequency scenes. Together, we report evidence that expectations induced by object-scene pairings influence visually evoked responses but do not modulate object representations.

">Focused ultrasound neuromodulation of mediodorsal thalamus disrupts decision flexibility during reward learning</a></h4>

              
                When learning to find the most beneficial course of action, the prefrontal cortex guides decisions by comparing estimates of the relative value of the options available. Basic neuroscience studies in animals support the view that the thalamus can regulate the activity within and across the prefrontal cortex. However, it is unknown if it can modify value-based decision making in humans. Understanding this is clinically important because disorders of value-based decision making underpin common motivational syndromes of apathy and impulsivity. Neuromodulation of the thalamus is routinely performed for motor symptoms and therefore could be a viable future target for these neuropsychiatric complications of neurodegenerative disease. Here, a group of patients (n=37) undergoing MR guided focused ultrasound for essential tremor, were tested using the restless bandit, a reward reinforcement learning task, immediately before and after thalamotomy. Performance was compared to a group of age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 32). Thalamotomy significantly impaired the proportion of switch choices during the task (P<0.001) without affecting overall performance. Importantly, this reduction in choice flexibility could not be attributed to diminished attention, as thalamotomy did not affect response time, accuracy, or lateralisation. A reinforcement learning model fitted to the patients' choices replicated the effect of thalamotomy when the model increased exploitation of the bandits' learnt value estimate. This shift in the explore-exploit trade-off, manifesting as reduced choice flexibility, co-varied with the extent of post-operative oedema extension into mediodorsal nucleus (R= 0.64, p<0.001), but no other, including the Ventral intermediate nucleus, targeted clinically during MRgFUS thalamotomy for tremor control. Furthermore, using a normative functional connectome, resting-state fMRI connectivity between the volume of oedema encroaching the mediodorsal nucleus and the prefrontal cortex, predicted individual patients change in bandit performance. Lastly, we used probabilistic tractography to confirm a thalamo-cortical circuit between the lateral portion of mediodorsal nucleus and the frontal polar cortex, which regulates decision flexibility and accounts for the thalamotomy induced behavioural effect observed in the restless bandit task. These findings confirm a causal role of the thalamus and specifically the mediodorsal nucleus, in regulating the extent to which value estimates are used to guide decisions and learning from reward. Neuromodulation of this target would be worthy of further investigation in patients with diminished motivation characteristic of apathy in conditions including Parkinson's disease.

">Two Sites, Two Languages: Dual-site tDCS and EEG Evidence for L1 Feature Transfer in L2</a></h4>

              
                The neural bases of syntactic and semantic processing remain unclear. While prior transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) studies have targeted either the inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) or left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG), we test whether dual stimulation of both alters second language (L2) anomaly based on native language (L1). Chinese and Korean participants evaluated Japanese sentence correctness; Japanese shares morpho-syntax with Korean and semantic radicals with Chinese. For the N400, dual anodal tDCS elicited a significant interaction stimulation and L1 (F (1,960.7) = 5.48, p = 0.0194), stimulation and sentence type (F (5,960.7) = 2.28, p = .0448), and L1 and sentence type (F (5, 960) = 2.28, p = 0.045). For the P600, a significant effect of stimulation and L1 interaction (F (1,1303.1) = 9.86, p = 0.0017), and stimulation x sentence type (F (5,1303.1) = 2.35, p = 0.039), suggesting L1 typology affected semantic integration during dual-stimulation tDCS.

">Dendritic computation for rule-based flexible categorization</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of intelligent behavior is the ability to flexibly respond to external sensory inputs based on dynamically changing rules. A central question is how neurons in the brain implement computations underlying intelligent behaviors. The neocortical pyramidal neurons use their elaborated dendritic arbors to segregate a plethora of inputs and dynamically integrate them--a process known as dendritic computation--which may play important roles in rule-dependent sensory processing. However, evidence directly linking dendritic computation with intelligent cognitive behaviors has been absent. Here we combine two-photon imaging and a rule-switching flexible categorization task in mice to show that a projectome-defined extratelencephalic (ET) cortical layer 5 (L5) neurons in the auditory cortex integrate dendritic rule information and somatic sensory input to enable rule-dependent flexible categorization. The apical dendrite and soma within the same ET neurons exhibit distinct compartmental representations for sensory and rule information, with the soma predominantly encoding sensory information and the dendrites representing inferred task rule. Simultaneous optogenetic dendritic inhibition and two-photon imaging revealed that dendritic rule coding is essential for somatic output of flexible categorization. Our findings indicate that nonlinear dendritic integration of rule and sensory information constitutes a neuronal computational mechanism underlying rule-switching flexible decision-making.

">Towards Unified Neural Decoding with Brain Functional Network Modeling</a></h4>

              
                Recent achievements in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) have demonstrated the potential to decode cognitive and motor behaviors with intracranial brain recordings; however, individual physiological and electrode implantation heterogeneities have constrained current approaches to neural decoding within single individuals, rendering interindividual neural decoding elusive. Here, we present Multi-individual Brain Region-Aggregated Network (MIBRAIN), a neural decoding framework that constructs a whole functional brain network model by integrating intracranial neurophysiological recordings across multiple individuals. MIBRAIN leverages self-supervised learning to derive generalized neural prototypes and supports group-level analysis of brain-region interactions and inter-subject neural synchrony. To validate our framework, we recorded stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) signals from a cohort of individuals performing Mandarin syllable articulation. Both real-time online and offline decoding experiments demonstrated significant improvements in both audible and silent articulation decoding, enhanced decoding accuracy with increased multi-subject data integration, and effective generalization to unseen subjects. Furthermore, neural predictions for regions without direct electrode coverage were validated against authentic neural data. Overall, this framework paves the way for robust neural decoding across individuals and offers insights for practical clinical applications.

                <p>Lifelong premature ejaculation (LPE) is associated with abnormal brain function, as evidenced by functional MRI (fMRI) studies. This study investigates the stability of brain network architectures in resting-state conditions following perturbation by erotic tasks in individuals with LPE. We assessed the resting-state fMRI in the task-free and task-modulated dataset in the 28 right-hand LPE and 17 age-matched normal controls (NCs). The dynamic functional connectome based on the phase-locking algorithm and ROI-wise gradient mapping was compared. The stability of dynamic functional gradient mapping was measure by linear mixed effects across the two datasets in the LPE and NCs. In both groups, the brain functional gradient exhibited a clear transition from unimodal to transmodal in the principal gradient. Additionally, there was a segregation of primary networks observed in the secondary gradient, either before or after the task. In LPE patients, we observed increased stability in the bilateral dorsal prefrontal cortex (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) and right temporo-occipital-parietal cortex (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) between the pre- and post-task fMRI datasets. The changes of the gradient stability were significantly correlated with the sexual behavior. Our findings suggest that dysfunction in the salience and default mode networks may contribute to delayed recovery from erotic task stimulation in LPE patients.</p>

                <p>The rodent brain contains 70,000,000+ neurons interconnected via complex axonal circuits with varying architectures. Neural pathologies are often associated with anatomical changes in these axonal projections and synaptic connections. Notably, axonal density variations of local and long-range projections increase or decrease as a function of the strengthening or weakening, respectively, of the information flow between brain regions. Traditionally, histological quantification of axonal inputs relied on assessing the fluorescence intensity in the brain region of interest. Despite yielding valuable insights, this conventional method is notably susceptible to background fluorescence, postacquisition adjustments, and inter-researcher variability. Additionally, it fails to account for nonuniform innervation across brain regions, thus overlooking critical data such as innervation percentages and axonal distribution patterns. In response to these challenges, we introduce AxoDen, an open-source semiautomated platform designed to increase the speed and rigor of axon quantifications for basic neuroscience discovery. AxoDen processes user-defined brain regions of interests incorporating dynamic thresholding of grayscale-transformed images to facilitate binarized pixel measurements. Here, in mice, we show that AxoDen segregates the image content into signal and nonsignal categories, effectively eliminating background interference and enabling the exclusive measurement of fluorescence from axonal projections. AxoDen provides detailed and accurate representations of axonal density and spatial distribution. AxoDen's advanced yet user-friendly platform enhances the reliability and efficiency of axonal density analysis and facilitates access to unbiased high-quality data analysis with no technical background or coding experience required. AxoDen is <I>ad libitum</I> available to everyone as a valuable neuroscience tool for dissecting axonal innervation patterns in precisely defined brain regions.</p>

                The Japanese Civil Code (JCC) was enacted in 1896. Since then, the Law of Obligations of the JCC had not undergone any major amendments for a long time. It was in 2017 that a significant revision was undertaken. And this revision also included the provisions regarding set-off. This paper explains the various set-off requirements stipulated by Japanese current law. In Japan, the conditions under which the statutory requirements for set-off are satisfied are described as ‚Äúeligibility for set-off‚Äù (Sousai-Tekijou), and the legal status of the parties in the set-off is called the right to set-off. Even if this eligibility for set-off arises, the parties may not exercise the right to set-off if there are circumstances that restrict the set-off. In addition, the Japanese Bankruptcy Act (JBA) modifies the requirements provided by the JCC to accommodate bankruptcy proceedings. In this paper, we will review in order the affirmative requirements for creating eligibility for set-off, the negative requirements for restricting the exercise of the right to set-off, and the requirements for set-off in bankruptcy proceedings. Please note that under Japanese law, when A intends to extinguish B‚Äôs claim Œ≤ against him by set-off against his claim Œ±, A‚Äôs claim Œ± is referred to as an active claim (Jido-Saiken), and B‚Äôs cross-claim Œ≤ as a passive claim (Judo-Saiken). This paper will also be described based on this terminology 1 .

                Aims To examine the correlation between iron, ferritin concentrations, and C. albicans infection in individuals with beta-thalassemia major and beta-thalassemia minor compared with healthy subjects. Materials and methods It involved 90 participants, thirty patients with thalassemia major and thirty patients with thalassemia minor compared with thirty healthy controls. Saliva samples were obtained and cultivated to isolate, identify, and calculate the viable colony count of C. albicans in (cfu/ml). In contrast, serum levels of iron and ferritin were quantified using chemical analyzers. Result Showed that 73.33% of thalassemia major group exhibited oral C. albicans colonization, which is significantly higher than that of thalassemia minor group 40% and control group 6.67%. Biochemical analyses revealed significantly higher iron 278.82 Œºg/dl and ferritin 2783.80 ng/ml levels in major group p<0.001 when compared with both thalassemia minor group 122.652 Œºg/dl, 74.723 ng/ml and control groups 127.438 Œºg/dl and 63.150 ng/ml respectively. C. albicans colony count in saliva was significantly elevated in beta-thalassemia major, as compared with beta-thalassemia minor group and control group. Conclusion Findings suggest that iron overload, which results from recurrent blood transfusions and causes immune dysfunction, contributes to higher risk of oral fungal infections in Beta-thalassemia patients compared with controls.

                Introduction Uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare cause of chronic to catastrophic vaginal bleeding. The basic pathology is an abnormal arteriovenous connection in the uterine myometrium, which is observed as an entangled serpentine vascular architecture on ultrasound. Color Doppler and higher imaging modalities with angiography are usually used to confirm a diagnosis. Materials and methods An electronic database of Obstetrics and Gynecology departments was searched for cases of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) between 2021 and 2025. Only cases of AVM confirmed by ultrasound or higher imaging were considered. Results We comprehensively reported 15 cases of arteriovenous malformations. All patients had acquired AVMs, with abnormal uterine bleeding as the main symptom in 93% of cases. The treatment provided was medical management in 26% of patients, conservative management by transcatheter embolization in 66%, and hysterectomy in 6.6%. Conclusion AVMs are rare in clinical practice, and an understanding of their pathophysiology and prompt diagnosis are highly important for managing this emergency. Fertility-preserving treatments include medical therapy and uterine artery embolization. Hysterectomy is the definitive treatment for this condition.

                Background Critical thinking is a collection of dispositions and abilities related to individuals‚Äô analytical, creative, and practical cognitive and decision-making skills. The development of optimal critical thinking skills better prepares students for college and their careers. The measurement of critical thinking actual abilities like inquisitiveness, open-mindedness, or systemic thinking among college students is limited. Similarly, the assessment of all types of critical thinking like creative or practical from the perspectives of students is meager. Methods This research utilizes original data collected from 803 college students between 2020 and 2021 after securing institutional review approval for the research. Self-reported data on 30 items instrument measuring students‚Äô ratings of their analytical, creative, and practical thinking is used. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and correlation analysis all were used to estimate the prevalence of critical thinking, and whether gender or language influence it or not. Results Results indicate that undergraduate students rated their abilities in critical thinking is very high. On all three types of critical thinking (analytical thinking, creative thinking, practical thinking), students scored between 117 and 123 on a 30-150 scale, indicating a high score. Additionally, gender and language have little to no influence over critical thinking scores. Further, analytical, creative, and practical thinking are independent from each other evident in the low correlations among all three elements. The results suggest the emergence of the Dunning-Kruger effect concerning students‚Äô critical thinking assessment. Conclusions There is a colossal gap between students- self-reported ratings and their actual performance on critical thinking instruments. More rigorous assessments of dispositions and abilities are needed utilizing existing validated instruments in literature.

                <p>by Priyan Bhattacharya, Alban Linnenbach, Andrew P. South, Ubaldo Martinez-Outschoorn, Joseph M. Curry, Jennifer M. Johnson, Larry A. Harshyne, M·ªπ G. Mahoney, Adam J. Luginbuhl, Rajanikanth Vadigepalli</p>

Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has emerged as a critical treatment strategy for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) that halts the immune escape of the tumor cells. Increasing evidence suggests that the onset, progression, and lack of/no response of HNSCC to ICI are emergent properties arising from the interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Deciphering how the diversity of cellular and molecular interactions leads to distinct HNSCC TME subtypes subsequently governing the ICI response remains largely unexplored. We developed a cellular-molecular model of the HNSCC TME that incorporates multiple cell types, cellular states, and transitions, and molecularly mediated paracrine interactions. Simulation across the selected parameter space of the HNSCC TME network shows that distinct mechanistic balances within the TME give rise to the five clinically observed TME subtypes such as immune/non-fibrotic, immune/fibrotic, fibrotic only and immune/fibrotic desert. We predict that the cancer-associated fibroblast, beyond a critical proliferation rate, drastically worsens the ICI response by hampering the accessibility of the CD8‚Äâ+‚Äâkiller T cells to the tumor cells. Our analysis reveals that while an Interleukin-2 (IL-2) + ICI combination therapy may improve response in the immune desert scenario, Osteopontin (OPN) and Leukemia Inhibition Factor (LIF) knockout with ICI yields the best response in a fibro-dominated scenario. Further, we predict Interleukin-8 (IL-8), and lactate can serve as crucial biomarkers for ICI-resistant HNSCC phenotypes. Overall, we provide an integrated quantitative framework that explains a wide range of TME-mediated resistance mechanisms for HNSCC and predicts TME subtype-specific targets that can lead to an improved ICI outcome.

                <p>by Katherine Owens, Aminur Rahman, Ivana Bozic</p>

The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in treating hematologic malignancies has generated widespread interest in translating this technology to solid cancers. However, issues like tumor infiltration, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and tumor heterogeneity limit its efficacy in the solid tumor setting. Recent experimental and clinical studies propose local administration directly into the tumor or at the tumor site to increase CAR T-cell infiltration and improve treatment outcomes. Characteristics of the types of solid tumors that may be the most receptive to this treatment approach remain unclear. In this work, we develop a simplified spatiotemporal model for CAR T-cell treatment of solid tumors, and use numerical simulations to compare the effect of introducing CAR T cells via intratumoral injection versus intracavitary administration in diverse cancer types. We demonstrate that the model can reproduce tumor and CAR T-cell data from small imaging studies of local administration of CAR T cells in mouse models. Our results suggest that locally administered CAR T cells will be most successful against slowly proliferating, highly diffusive tumors. In our simulations, assuming equal detectable tumor diameters at the time of treatment, low average tumor cell density is a better predictor of treatment success than total tumor burden or volume doubling time. These findings affirm the clinical observation that CAR T cells will not perform equally across different types of solid tumors, and suggest that measuring tumor density may be helpful when considering the feasibility of CAR T-cell therapy and planning dosages for a particular patient. We additionally find that local delivery of CAR T cells can result in deep tumor responses, provided that the initial CAR T-cell dose does not contain a significant fraction of exhausted cells.

                <p>by Ada Wing Chi Yan, Ildar Sadreev, Jonas Mackerodt, Yan Zhang, Derek Macallan, Robert Busch, Becca Asquith</p>

Stable isotope labelling is one of the best methods currently available for quantifying cell dynamics <i>in vivo</i>, particularly in humans where the absence of toxicity makes it preferable over other techniques such as CFSE or BrdU. Interpretation of stable isotope labelling data (as for BrdU and CFSE) necessitates simplifying assumptions. Here we investigate the impact of three of the most commonly used simplifying assumptions: (i) that the cell population of interest is closed, (ii) that the population of interest is kinetically homogeneous, and (iii) that the population is spatially homogeneous and suggest pragmatic ways in which the resulting errors can be reduced.

Inhaled anesthetics were first introduced into clinical use in the 1840s. Molecular and transgenic animal studies indicate that inhaled anesthetics act through several ion channels, including Œ≥-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) and two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup> (K2P) channels, but other targets may mediate anesthetic effects. Mutations in the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), which is a calcium release channel on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, are relevant to malignant hyperthermia, a condition that can be induced by inhaled anesthetics. However, it was previously uncertain whether inhaled anesthetics directly interact with RyR1. In our study, we demonstrated that isoflurane and other inhaled anesthetics activate wild-type RyR1. By employing systematic mutagenesis, we discovered that altering just one amino acid residue negates the response to isoflurane, thus helping us to pinpoint the potential binding site. Knock-in mice engineered to express a mutant form of RyR1 that is insensitive to isoflurane exhibited resistance to the loss of righting reflex (LORR) when exposed to isoflurane anesthesia. This observation suggests a connection between RyR1 activation and the anesthetic effects in vivo. Moreover, it was shown that RyR1 is involved in the neuronal response to isoflurane. Additionally, administering new RyR1 agonists, which share the same binding site as isoflurane, resulted in a sedation-like state in mice. We propose that isoflurane directly activates RyR1, and this activation is pertinent to its anesthetic/sedative effects.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to show the capacity of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures to serve as monitoring biomarkers for Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From 2 longitudinal studies of male <i>FMR1</i> premutation carriers, 2 brain MRI scans were selected from each participant, collected within a period of 2‚Äâyears (12 healthy controls, 17 carriers without FXTAS, and 51 carriers with FXTAS; all men, ages 40 to 80‚Äâyears), along with clinical measurements and <i>FMR1</i> cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat numbers. Candidate MRI biomarkers included whole brain white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cerebellar, brainstem, and whole brain volumes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the FXTAS group, mixed-effects models demonstrated significant volume loss across an average interval of 1.32‚Äâyears for the whole brain, cerebellum and brain stem volumes, and significant increases in WMH, with large magnitude effects for whole brain and WMH volumes. All MRI measures showed deterioration with advancing FXTAS stage, with the strongest pattern shown in WMH volume. CGG repeat number showed significant nonlinear associations with all 4 brain MRI metrics, with mid-range CGG repeat carriers evidencing the worst brain atrophy and WMHs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Structural brain MRI measurements, especially those capturing white matter deterioration, are correlated with <i>FMR1</i> premutation size of CGG repeat length and sensitive to FXTAS disease progression across a relatively short interval of less than 2‚Äâyears, making them potentially suitable as surrogate end points for clinical trials.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is the process by which new neurons are continuously generated from neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the adult dentate gyrus. AHN plays a pivotal role in cognitive functions, including learning, memory, and mood regulation. Transcription factors regulate AHN by maintaining the NSPC pool and facilitating lineage progression. The nuclear factor I (NFI) transcription factor family member NFIA is critical for neurogenesis and gliogenesis during early brain development, but its role in adult neurogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we generated an inducible <i>Nfia</i> loss-of-function mouse model to investigate the role of NFIA in <i>Ascl1-</i>lineage adult-born neurons. By tracking lineage progression from NSPCs to mature neurons, we found that NFIA deletion significantly reduced neurogenesis. Populations of NSPCs, neuroblasts, and mature granule neurons were all similarly diminished, indicating a primary defect in NSPC maintenance. Behaviorally, NFIA loss impaired hippocampal-dependent contextual fear memory without affecting locomotor activity, anxiety levels, spatial memory, or cued fear memory. Our findings demonstrate that NFIA is crucial for AHN and hippocampus-dependent contextual memory, thereby providing insights into its role in adult neurogenesis.</p>

                Background of the study The systematic impact of macroeconomic variables on stock market returns makes it crucial to comprehend the link between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. Stock prices are closely linked to macroeconomic indicators, a crucial aspect for investors, policymakers, and researchers in emerging markets like India, influencing investment decisions and policy formulation. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used in this study to examine the causal links between specific macroeconomic factors and Indian stock prices from April 2009 to March 2023. Results The outcomes of the research suggest that macroeconomic variables exert influence on the Indian stock market, across the short and long term. Moreover, the results of the paired Granger causality test suggest that the domestic macroeconomic variables possess predictive significance for stock prices in the Indian stock market. Conclusion The study reveals that macroeconomic variables significantly impact the Indian stock market, highlighting the need for investors and portfolio managers to monitor these conditions to optimize returns and mitigate risks. The Reserve Bank of India should maintain an optimal money supply to prevent inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, while bolstering the export sector and facilitating imports through initiatives like Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India. Policies focusing on productivity, infrastructure, and a favourable business environment are also crucial. Therefore, it is crucial for investors and portfolio managers to consistently analyse the current macroeconomic conditions in order to maximize their profits and minimize risks. This research has extensive significance for comprehending the intricate connections between the stock market and macroeconomic issues.

<p>Prenatal VPA exposure to pregnant Wistar rat dams causes autism-like symptoms in the offspring, possibly via abnormal CREB signaling (decreased phosphorylation). Treatment with Forskolin, an AC activator, increases phosphorylation of CREB at ser133 and ameliorates autism-like symptoms in these VPA-induced ASD Wistar rats.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social deficits, restricted interest, and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence is higher in males (4:1). FDA-approved drugs, Aripiprazole, and risperidone, only target comorbid conditions and have significant side effects. Dysregulation in cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) signaling is reported in autistic individuals. Forskolin is traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine with lesser side effects. It is a potent adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator, increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, thereby activating the protein kinase A (PKA)/CREB pathway with clinically proven benefits as an anticancer, anti-asthmatic, and in metabolic disorder, and crosses the blood‚Äìbrain-barrier (BBB) junction. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of Forskolin and sought to explore the role of estrogen beta (ERŒ≤/ESR2) receptors in a valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD. Pregnant Wistar rats received VPA or an equal volume of saline on gestational day (GD) 12.5. From postnatal day (PND) 23, male and female rats were divided separately into control, VPA, risperidone, and Forskolin (10‚Äì30‚Äâmg/kg) groups. Systemic administration of Forskolin ameliorated anxiety, social deficit, repetitive behavior, spatial recognition memory, motor coordination, gastrointestinal (GIT) motility, brain edema, and BBB permeability in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, chronic Forskolin treatment significantly alleviated VPA-induced neuronal damage in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC), and cerebellum, and increased the intracellular CREB ser133 protein phosphorylation. Forskolin upregulated the mRNA expression of CREB signaling, which was altered by prenatal VPA administration. Our findings indicate that Forskolin provides neuroprotection through CREB signaling, suggesting its therapeutic potential for ASD.</p>
