                The respiratory tract is a compartmentalised and heterogenous environment. The nasopharynx and sinuses of the upper airways have distinct properties from the lungs and these differences may shape bacterial adaptation and evolution. Upper airway niches act as early colonisation sites for respiratory bacterial pathogens, including those, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that can go on to establish chronic infection of the lungs in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Despite the importance of upper airway environments in facilitating early adaptation to host environments, currently available in vitro models for study of respiratory infection in CF focus exclusively on the lungs. Furthermore, animal models, widely used to bridge the gap between in vitro systems and the clinical scenario, do not allow the upper and lower airways to be studied in isolation. We have developed a suite of culture media reproducing key features of the upper and lower airways, for the study of bacterial adaptation and evolution in different respiratory environments. For both upper and lower airway-mimicking media, we have developed formulations that reflect airway conditions in health and those that reflect the altered environment of the CF respiratory tract. Here, we describe the development and validation of these media and their use for study of genetic and phenotypic adaptations in P. aeruginosa during growth under upper or lower airway conditions in health and in CF.

	<p>Previous studies have shown that some negative emotions hinder estimation strategy execution. However, these studies rarely investigate the influence of negative emotions on the estimation strategy execution in individuals with trait anxiety. The present study examines the relationship between negative emotions and trait anxiety in individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; estimation strategy execution. Moreover, it looks into the influence of different emotion regulation strategies on their estimation strategy execution. In October 2010, 803 college students were evaluated using the Trait Anxiety Scale. From these participants, individuals with high and low trait anxiety were selected to complete the double-digit multiplication estimation task. The results showed that the estimation strategy&amp;amp;rsquo;s execution speed in individuals with high trait anxiety was slower than those with low trait anxiety under negative emotions (t (113) = &amp;amp;minus;2.269, p = 0.025, d = 0.427). Both expression inhibition and cognitive reappraisal could significantly improve the execution speed of the estimation strategy in low trait anxiety (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). For individuals with high trait anxiety, cognitive reappraisal regulating negative emotions can promote the estimation strategy&amp;amp;rsquo;s execution speed (p = 0.031). However, the use of expression inhibition has no significant effect on estimation strategy execution (p = 0.101). In summary, the present study revealed that different emotion regulation strategies moderated the arithmetic strategy execution of individuals with trait anxiety, and cognitive reappraisal had a better effect in individuals with high trait anxiety.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tonotopic organization is a fundamental feature of the auditory system. In the developing auditory brainstem, the ontogeny and maturation of neurotransmission progress from high to low frequencies along the tonotopic axis. To explore the underlying mechanism of this tonotopic development, we aim to determine whether the presynaptic machinery responsible for neurotransmitter release is tonotopically differentiated during development. In the current study, we examined vesicular neurotransmitter transporters and calcium sensors, two central players responsible for loading neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles and for triggering neurotransmitter release in a calcium-dependent manner, respectively. Using immunocytochemistry, we characterized the distribution patterns of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) 1 and 2, vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT), and calcium sensor synaptotagmin (Syt) 1 and 2 in the developing mouse medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). We identified tonotopic gradients of VGLUT1, VGAT, Syt1, and Syt2 in the first postnatal week, with higher protein densities in the more medial (high-frequency) portion of the MNTB. These gradients gradually flattened before the onset of hearing. In contrast, VGLUT2 was distributed relatively uniformly along the tonotopic axis during this prehearing period. In mice lacking Fragile X mental retardation protein, an mRNA-binding protein that regulates synaptic development and plasticity, progress to achieve the mature-like organization was altered for VGLUT1, Syt1, and Syt2, but not for VGAT. Together, our results identified novel organization patterns of selective presynaptic proteins in immature auditory synapses, providing a potential mechanism that may contribute to tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission during normal and abnormal development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Phase Advancing Is a Common Property of Multiple Neuron Classes in the Mouse Retina</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Behavioral interactions with moving objects are challenged by response latencies within the sensory and motor nervous systems. In vision, the combined latency from phototransduction and synaptic transmission from the retina to central visual areas amounts to 50&ndash;100 ms, depending on stimulus conditions. Time required for generating appropriate motor output adds to this latency and further compounds the behavioral delay. Neuronal adaptations that help counter sensory latency within the retina have been demonstrated in some species, but how general these specializations are, and where in the circuitry they originate, remains unclear. To address this, we studied the timing of object motion-evoked responses at multiple signaling stages within the mouse retina using two-photon fluorescence calcium and glutamate imaging, targeted whole-cell electrophysiology, and computational modeling. We found that both ON-type and OFF-type ganglion cells, as well as the bipolar cells that innervate them, temporally advance the position encoding of a moving object and so help counter the inherent signaling delay in the retina. Model simulations show that this predictive capability is a direct consequence of the spatial extent of the cells&rsquo; linear visual receptive field, with no apparent specialized circuits that help predict beyond it.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics and Potential Significance of Spontaneous Activity in the Habenula</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The habenula is an evolutionarily conserved structure of the vertebrate brain that is essential for behavioral flexibility and mood control. It is spontaneously active and is able to access diverse states when the animal is exposed to sensory stimuli. Here we investigate the dynamics of habenula spontaneous activity, to gain insight into how sensitivity is optimized. Two-photon calcium imaging was performed in resting zebrafish larvae at single-cell resolution. An analysis of avalanches of inferred spikes suggests that the habenula is subcritical. Activity had low covariance and a small mean, arguing against dynamic criticality. A multiple regression estimator of autocorrelation time suggests that the habenula is neither fully asynchronous nor perfectly critical, but is reverberating. This pattern of dynamics may enable integration of information and high flexibility in the tuning of network properties, thus providing a potential mechanism for the optimal responses to a changing environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Automatic Vehicle Fueling System using PLC Controlled Robotic Arm [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The objective of this research is to design and develop a robotic arm for an automatic fuelling system using a PLC LogixPro simulation. The system includes the “FASS” concept, which is Fast, Accurate, Safe and Simple, to allow car users to have an efficient fuel filling system.   The design concept consists of three processes – identification of the vehicle, payment, and filling with the fuel. The first process identifies the presence of the car by the in-floor weight sensors. The weight sensor identifies the car, locks it in position, and activates the payment system. The second process activates the payment system. After payment is completed, the fuel cap will be opened to enable the system to start filling the fuel. If the payment doesn’t go through the car will be released, manual operation will be initialized, and the entire system will be reset.  A timer is included in the payment section to process the payment. In the third process, the filling arm is extended to the car, the fuel cap is opened, the fuel pump is inserted into the tank, and fuel is directed into the tank. Once the tank is full, filling is stopped, the pump is ejected, the fuel cap is closed, and the arm returned back to its position. Thus, an automatic vehicle fuelling system is created to overcome the problems of poor safety and longer waiting time during peak hours. The fuel cap is activated and deactivated by pressure and the sensor filler is stopped by a level sensor. The pump insert is activated and deactivated by a photosensor.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Public perceptions and interactions with UK COVID-19 Test, Trace and Isolate policies, and implications for pandemic infectious disease modelling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The efforts to contain SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been supported by Test, Trace and Isolate (TTI) systems in many settings, including the United Kingdom. Mathematical models of transmission and TTI interventions, used to inform design and policy choices, make assumptions about the public’s behaviour in the context of a rapidly unfolding and changeable emergency. This study investigates public perceptions and interactions with UK TTI policy in July 2021, assesses them against how TTI processes are conceptualised and represented in models, and then interprets the findings with modellers who have been contributing evidence to TTI policy. Methods 20 members of the public recruited via social media were interviewed for one hour about their perceptions and interactions with the UK TTI system. Thematic analysis identified key themes, which were then presented back to a workshop of pandemic infectious disease modellers who assessed these findings against assumptions made in TTI intervention modelling. Workshop members co-drafted this report. Results Themes included education about SARS-CoV-2, perceived risks, trust, mental health and practical concerns. Findings covered testing practices, including the uses of and trust in different types of testing, and the challenges of testing and isolating faced by different demographic groups. This information was judged as consequential to the modelling process, from guiding the selection of research questions, influencing choice of model structure, informing parameter ranges and validating or challenging assumptions, to highlighting where model assumptions are reasonable or where their poor reflection of practice might lead to uninformative results. Conclusions We conclude that deeper engagement with members of the public should be integrated at regular stages of public health intervention modelling.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Interstitial-intralesional laser therapy and laser-assisted new attachment procedure for the treatment of alveolar bone loss provoked by an aggressive pyogenic granuloma [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a common benign vascular lesion found in the oral cavity. The gold standard treatment of this lesion, comprising surgical excision and the elimination of etiological factors, cannot avoid tooth loss in the case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Because of the prominent properties of 980 nm and 635 nm diode lasers in photocoagulation and photobiomodulation, we applied these wavelengths in the treatment of a large pyogenic granuloma with alveolar bone loss. Case presentation: Our objective was to use a combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and laser-assisted new attachment procedure (LANAP) to preserve the teeth and periodontal tissue in a case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Results: The patient was a 13-year-old Thai male with a pyogenic granuloma involving the interdental papilla and lingual gingiva of the lower left first and second molars. The teeth were also displaced by the lesion. After treatment with three sessions of photocoagulation, three sessions of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy and two sessions of LANAP, the lesion was completely resolved. The periodontal status of the teeth was improved at the six-month follow-up. Conclusion: The combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and LANAP was able to treat an aggressive pyogenic granuloma with tooth preservation.

Exercise training and a sufficient supply of protein, calcium and vitamin D is recommended to reduce the loss of FFM. Objective: To investigate the effect of exercise training, protein, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation on the preservation of FFM during non-surgical and surgical weight loss and of the combination of all interventions together in adults with obesity. Methods: A systematic review was performed with a pairwise meta-analysis and an exploratory network meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. Results: Thirty studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The pairwise meta-analysis showed for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. High Protein a moderate and statistically significant effect size (SMD 0.45; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.86), for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. Exercise Training a high but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.91; 95% CI -0.59 to 2.41) and for Exercise Training alone vs. Control a moderate but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.67; 95% CI -0.25 to 1.60). In the exploratory network meta-analysis three interventions showed statistically significant effect sizes compared to Control and all of them included the treatment Exercise Training. Conclusions: Results underline the importance of exercise training and a sufficient protein intake to preserve FFM during weight loss in adults with obesity. The effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation remains controversial and further research are needed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Account of chickenpox progression over 10 days [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Chickenpox is an extremely contagious disease; caused by the varicella-zoster virus primary infection. A 27-year-old adult Black African male health care worker presented with severe headache, intermittent weakness and inability to walk, intermittent nausea, fever, nocturnal polydipsia, shortness of breath, itching, pruritus (intensely pruritic erythematous macules), lesions with pus on the skin, sleep disturbances, and nightmares for two days. The most commonly occurring symptom of chickenpox is a vesicular rash that appears on the scalp, back and front of the neck, face and scapulae, and then disseminates distally to the limbs. In this case report, the patient face, neck and scapulae were the most infected areas of the body and the rest of the body except the legs, hands, genital areas and buttocks, were also highly infected. Acyclovir 800 mg orally, five times a day was given for ten days to cure chickenpox infection because acyclovir inhibits the replication of the varicella zoster virus, and has the ability to eradicate varicella zoster virus and relieve the symptoms more readily.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Desirable attributes of theories, models, and frameworks for implementation strategy design in healthcare: a scoping review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Implementation strategies can facilitate the adoption of evidence-based practices and policies. A wide range of theoretical approaches—theories, models, and frameworks—can be used to inform implementation strategy design in different ways (e.g., guiding barrier and enabler assessment to implementing evidence-based interventions). While selection criteria and attributes of theoretical approaches for use in implementation strategy design have been studied, they have never been synthesized. Furthermore, theoretical approaches have never been classified according to desirable criteria and attributes for use in implementation strategy design. This scoping review aims to a) identify the literature reporting on the selection of theoretical approaches for informing implementation strategy design in healthcare and b) understand the suggested use of these approaches in implementation strategy design. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidelines will be used to conduct this scoping review. A search of three bibliographical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) will be conducted for peer-reviewed discussion, methods, protocol, or review papers. Data will be managed using the Covidence software. Two review team members will independently perform screening, full text review and data extraction. Results: Results will include a list of selection criteria and attributes of theoretical approaches for use in research on implementation strategy design. Descriptive data regarding selection criteria and attributes will be synthesized graphically and in table format. Data regarding the suggested use of theoretical approaches in implementation strategy design will be presented narratively. Conclusions: Results will be used to classify existing theoretical approaches according to the attributes and selection criteria identified in this scoping review. Envisioned next steps include an online tool that will be created to assist researchers in selecting theories, models, and frameworks for implementation strategy design.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of serum levels of vitamin D on lipid profiles, glycemic indices, and insulin resistance in obese type 2 diabetes patients: An observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diabetes patients have a higher chance of developing dyslipidemia and increased release of free fatty acids, which participate in developing insulin-resistant fat cells. On the other hand, vitamin D insufficiency is linked to the evolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study examines the impact of vitamin D serum levels on lipid profiles and insulin resistance concerning glycemic indices in obese T2DM patients. Methods: During the data collecting stage, 47 diabetes patients were chosen from the out-patient clinic. The control individuals were selected from the general population and were equivalent to the matching patients, with a total of 43 healthy participants. After an overnight fast, a venous blood sample was collected from each individual to test insulin and vitamin D3 levels using particular ELISA kits. In addition, by colorimetric test, serum was used to estimate total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Aside from that, fasting serum glucose levels were measured (FSG). Results: Fasting serum glucose (FSG), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol, and triglycerides, all of these values were significantly elevated in people with diabetes as compared to controls (p-value <0.05) when the serum level of vitamin D was markedly low. In contrast, insulin and high-density lipoprotein values had decreased significantly in the diabetic population compared to controls (p-value <0.05) and were not correlated to vitamin D levels. Conclusions: Diabetes patients had higher FSG, HOMA-IR, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios (TC: HDL-C), triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios (TG: HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios (LDL-C: HDL). In obese diabetic individuals, vitamin D levels had a significant impact on total cholesterol, LDL-C, and the TC:HDL-C ratio.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Smartphone applications are used for self-management, telerehabilitation, evaluation and data collection in low back pain healthcare: a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Technological developments have accelerated notably in the field of telecommunications in the last few decades. Smartphone use has grown in providing healthcare for patients with low back pain (LBP), but the literature lacks an analysis of the use of smartphone apps. This scoping review aimed to identify current areas of smartphone apps use for managing LBP. We also aimed to evaluate the current status of the effectiveness or scientific validity of such use and determine perspectives for their potential development. Methods: We searched PubMed, PEDro and Embase for articles published in English up to May 3rd, 2021 that investigated smartphone use for LBP healthcare and their purpose. All types of study design were accepted. Studies concerning telemedicine or telerehabilitation but without use of a smartphone were not included. The same search strategy was performed by two researchers independently and a third researcher validated the synthesis of the included studies. Results: We included 43 articles: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n=12), study protocols (n=6), reliability/validity studies (n=6), systematic reviews (n=7), cohort studies (n=4), qualitative studies (n=6), and case series (n=1). The purposes of the smartphone app were for 1) evaluation, 2) telerehabilitation, 3) self-management, and 4) data collection. Self-management was the most-studied use, showing promising results derived from moderate- to good-quality RCTs for patients with chronic LBP and patients after spinal surgery. Promising results exist regarding evaluation and data collection use and contradictory results regarding measurement use. Conclusions: This scoping review revealed a growing scientific literature regarding the use of smartphone apps for LBP patients. The identified purposes point to current scientific status and perspectives for further studies including RCTs and systematic reviews targeting specific usage. Caution should be taken to monitor the impact of smartphone-related compulsive behaviour.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Diversity and antimicrobial activity of marine nudibranch associated bacteria against tropical human skin pathogens [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Skin disease is the fourth most common disease among all diseases. The number of cases of skin diseases continues to increase, and people commonly use antibiotics to treat these diseases. Nevertheless, overuse of antibiotics can increase the resistance of these pathogens. Hence, the study of novel antibiotic compounds against multi-drug resistant (MDR) skin pathogens is urgently needed. Methods: This study describes the antimicrobial diversity of bacteria associated with three species of marine nudibranchs (Jorunna funebris, Gymnodoris rubropapulosa, and Glossodoris atromarginata) sampled from Jepara coastal waters, the North Java Sea in August 2020. A total of 115 bacterial strains were selected for their prospective antipathogenic compounds against the pathogens Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Malassezia furfur. Results: A total of 24 bacterial isolates (20.87%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against the pathogens that were selected and molecularly identified. Analyses of the gene of 16S rRNA discovered that these 24 isolates were associated with 11 genera of the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, including Bacillus as the dominant genus, followed by Streptomyces, Gordonia, Salinicola, Thalassospira, Halomonas, Dietzia, Brevibacterium, Paracoccus, Pseudovibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, and Pseudomonas. None of the 24 antimicrobial bacterial strains possessed type-1 polyketide synthases (PKS-I). One strain possessed type II polyketide synthases (PKS-II), and five strains possessed non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes. The amounts of bacterial genus and strains in the three nudibranchs differed significantly, as did the proportions of antimicrobial strains in each nudibranch species. The antibacterial strains isolated from G. atromarginata were the highest number (62.5%), followed by J. funebris (20.8%) and G. rubropapulosa (16.7%). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that nudibranch species harbor prominent and varied communities of bacteria and reveal that many nudibranch-associated bacteria have the potential for the advancement of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of mice that lack retinal input, a population of large terminals supplants the synaptic arrangements normally made by the missing retinogeniculate terminals. To identify potential sources of these “retinogeniculate replacement terminals,” we used mutant mice (<i>math5</i>

In this line, we labeled LGN terminals that originate from the primary visual cortex (V1) or the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG), and compared their ultrastructure to retinogeniculate, V1 or PBG terminals in the dLGN of C57Blk6 (WT) mice (schematically depicted above graph). Corticogeniculate terminals labeled in WT and <i>math5</i>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anticancer potential of turmeric (Curcuma longa) ethanol extract and prediction of its mechanism through the Akt1 pathway [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Turmeric (Curcuma longa) has high potential as a traditional anticancer drug. This study aimed to analyze the anticancer activity of turmeric ethanol extract on T47D cells and examine the interaction of Akt1 protein with compounds contained in turmeric. Methods: The cytotoxicity assay was conducted using WST-1 reagents. Apoptosis assay used annexin V-PI, whereas cell cycle assay used PI, and then the results were analyzed using a flow cytometer. LC-HRMS analysis was conducted to identify the active compounds. Docking between Akt1 and ligands was performed using Autodock 4.2 software. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted using YASARA with a time parameter of 20 ns, pH 7.4, and 37°C. Results: The extract had a strong toxicity on T47D cells (cytotoxicity IC50 value: 26.36 ± 1.55 µg/mL). The extract induced apoptosis of T47D cells at the IC50 dose (~30% cells) and induced the cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Curcumin, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid and caryophyllene oxide had lower binding energy into Akt1 than AZD5363 used as a positive control. Curcumin, Ar-turmerone, and α-curcumene bind in the ATP binding pocket of Akt1, so the compounds have a high potential to be an ATP-competitive Akt1 inhibitors. The interaction of Akt1 with the compound contained in turmeric had an RMSD backbone value that was more stable than that of ATP and AZD5363. Root-mean-square fluctuation values indicated that amino acid residues that had an essential role in ligand binding sites were stable during simulation. Conclusions: The turmeric ethanol extract had a potential anti-cancer effect by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell cycle progression on T47D cells. The docking analysis showed that the active compounds of the extract, such as curcumin, Ar-turmerone, caryophyllene oxide, and α-curcumene, were able to bind into the ATP binding pocket of Akt1 that might inhibit the protein activity and induce cell cycle arrest.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of the reaction-structure coupling in temperature compensation of the KaiABC circadian rhythm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Masaki Sasai</p>

When the mixture solution of cyanobacterial proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, is incubated with ATP in vitro, the phosphorylation level of KaiC shows stable oscillations with the temperature-compensated circadian period. Elucidating this temperature compensation is essential for understanding the KaiABC circadian clock, but its mechanism has remained a mystery. We analyzed the KaiABC temperature compensation by developing a theoretical model describing the feedback relations among reactions and structural transitions in the KaiC molecule. The model showed that the reduced structural cooperativity should weaken the negative feedback coupling among reactions and structural transitions, which enlarges the oscillation amplitude and period, explaining the observed significant period extension upon single amino-acid residue substitution. We propose that an increase in thermal fluctuations similarly attenuates the reaction-structure feedback, explaining the temperature compensation in the KaiABC clock. The model explained the experimentally observed responses of the oscillation phase to the temperature shift or the ADP-concentration change and suggested that the ATPase reactions in the CI domain of KaiC affect the period depending on how the reaction rates are modulated. The KaiABC clock provides a unique opportunity to analyze how the reaction-structure coupling regulates the system-level synchronized oscillations of molecules.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Probing the rules of cell coordination in live tissues by interpretable machine learning based on graph neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takaki Yamamoto, Katie Cockburn, Valentina Greco, Kyogo Kawaguchi</p>

Robustness in developing and homeostatic tissues is supported by various types of spatiotemporal cell-to-cell interactions. Although live imaging and cell tracking are powerful in providing direct evidence of cell coordination rules, extracting and comparing these rules across many tissues with potentially different length and timescales of coordination requires a versatile framework of analysis. Here we demonstrate that graph neural network (GNN) models are suited for this purpose, by showing how they can be applied to predict cell fate in tissues and utilized to infer the cell interactions governing the multicellular dynamics. Analyzing the live mammalian epidermis data, where spatiotemporal graphs constructed from cell tracks and cell contacts are given as inputs, GNN discovers distinct neighbor cell fate coordination rules that depend on the region of the body. This approach demonstrates how the GNN framework is powerful in inferring general cell interaction rules from live data without prior knowledge of the signaling involved.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimizing global COVID-19 vaccine allocation: An agent-based computational model of 148 countries</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qingfeng Li, Yajing Huang</p>
Background <p>Based on the principles of equity and effectiveness, the World Health Organization and COVAX formulate vaccine allocation as a mathematical optimization problem. This study aims to solve the optimization problem using agent-based simulations.</p> Methods <p>We built open-sourced agent-based models to simulate virus transition among a demographically representative sample of 198 million people in 148 countries using advanced computational services. <i>All countries continuing their current vaccine progress</i> is defined as the baseline scenario. Comparison scenarios include achieving minimum vaccination rates and allocating vaccines based on pandemic levels.</p> Findings <p>The simulations are fitted using the pandemic data from 148 countries from January 2020 to June 2021. Under the baseline scenario, the world will add 24.36 million cases and 468,945 deaths during the projection period of three months. Inoculating at least 10%, 20%, and 26% of populations in all countries requires 1.12, 3.31, and 5.00 million additional vaccine doses every day, respectively. Achieving these benchmarks reduces new cases by 0.56, 2.74, and 3.32 million, respectively. If allocated by the current global distribution, 5.00 million additional vaccine doses will only avert 1.45 million new cases. If those 5.00 million vaccines are allocated based on projected cases in each country, the averted cases will increase more than six-fold to 9.20 million. Similar differences between allocation methods are observed in averted deaths.</p> Conclusion <p>The global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines can be optimized to achieve better outcomes in terms of both equity and effectiveness. Alternative vaccine allocation methods may avert several times more cases and deaths than the current global distribution. With reasonable requirements on additional vaccines, COVAX could adopt alternative allocation strategies that reduce cross-country inequity and save more lives.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MouseNet: A biologically constrained convolutional neural network model for the mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jianghong Shi, Bryan Tripp, Eric Shea-Brown, Stefan Mihalas, Michael A. Buice</p>

Convolutional neural networks trained on object recognition derive inspiration from the neural architecture of the visual system in mammals, and have been used as models of the feedforward computation performed in the primate ventral stream. In contrast to the deep hierarchical organization of primates, the visual system of the mouse has a shallower arrangement. Since mice and primates are both capable of visually guided behavior, this raises questions about the role of architecture in neural computation. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for building a biologically constrained convolutional neural network model of the mouse visual cortex. The architecture and structural parameters of the network are derived from experimental measurements, specifically the 100-micrometer resolution interareal connectome, the estimates of numbers of neurons in each area and cortical layer, and the statistics of connections between cortical layers. This network is constructed to support detailed task-optimized models of mouse visual cortex, with neural populations that can be compared to specific corresponding populations in the mouse brain. Using a well-studied image classification task as our working example, we demonstrate the computational capability of this mouse-sized network. Given its relatively small size, MouseNet achieves roughly 2/3rds the performance level on ImageNet as VGG16. In combination with the large scale Allen Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset, we use representational similarity analysis to quantify the extent to which MouseNet recapitulates the neural representation in mouse visual cortex. Importantly, we provide evidence that optimizing for task performance does not improve similarity to the corresponding biological system beyond a certain point. We demonstrate that the distributions of some physiological quantities are closer to the observed distributions in the mouse brain after task training. We encourage the use of the MouseNet architecture by making the code freely available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">What lies underneath: Precise classification of brain states using time-dependent topological structure of dynamics</a></h4>

The self-organising global dynamics underlying brain states emerge from complex recursive nonlinear interactions between interconnected brain regions. Until now, most efforts of capturing the causal mechanistic generating principles have supposed underlying stationarity, being unable to describe the non-stationarity of brain dynamics, i.e. time-dependent changes. Here, we present a novel framework able to characterise brain states with high specificity, precisely by modelling the time-dependent dynamics. Through describing a topological structure associated to the brain state at each moment in time (its attractor or ‘information structure’), we are able to classify different brain states by using the statistics across time of these structures hitherto hidden in the neuroimaging dynamics. Proving the strong potential of this framework, we were able to classify resting-state BOLD fMRI signals from two classes of post-comatose patients (minimally conscious state and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) compared with healthy controls with very high precision.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">EpiBeds: Data informed modelling of the COVID-19 hospital burden in England</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher E. Overton, Lorenzo Pellis, Helena B. Stage, Francesca Scarabel, Joshua Burton, Christophe Fraser, Ian Hall, Thomas A. House, Chris Jewell, Anel Nurtay, Filippo Pagani, Katrina A. Lythgoe</p>

The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic put considerable strain on healthcare systems worldwide. In order to predict the effect of the local epidemic on hospital capacity in England, we used a variety of data streams to inform the construction and parameterisation of a hospital progression model, EpiBeds, which was coupled to a model of the generalised epidemic. In this model, individuals progress through different pathways (e.g. may recover, die, or progress to intensive care and recover or die) and data from a partially complete patient-pathway line-list was used to provide initial estimates of the mean duration that individuals spend in the different hospital compartments. We then fitted EpiBeds using complete data on hospital occupancy and hospital deaths, enabling estimation of the proportion of individuals that follow the different clinical pathways, the reproduction number of the generalised epidemic, and to make short-term predictions of hospital bed demand. The construction of EpiBeds makes it straightforward to adapt to different patient pathways and settings beyond England. As part of the UK response to the pandemic, EpiBeds provided weekly forecasts to the NHS for hospital bed occupancy and admissions in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland at national and regional scales.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computational framework for modelling infectious disease policy based on age and household structure with applications to the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joe Hilton, Heather Riley, Lorenzo Pellis, Rabia Aziza, Samuel P. C. Brand, Ivy K. Kombe, John Ojal, Andrea Parisi, Matt J. Keeling, D. James Nokes, Robert Manson-Sawko, Thomas House</p>

The widespread, and in many countries unprecedented, use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for mathematical models which can estimate the impact of these measures while accounting for the highly heterogeneous risk profile of COVID-19. Models accounting either for age structure or the household structure necessary to explicitly model many NPIs are commonly used in infectious disease modelling, but models incorporating both levels of structure present substantial computational and mathematical challenges due to their high dimensionality. Here we present a modelling framework for the spread of an epidemic that includes explicit representation of age structure and household structure. Our model is formulated in terms of tractable systems of ordinary differential equations for which we provide an open-source Python implementation. Such tractability leads to significant benefits for model calibration, exhaustive evaluation of possible parameter values, and interpretability of results. We demonstrate the flexibility of our model through four policy case studies, where we quantify the likely benefits of the following measures which were either considered or implemented in the UK during the current COVID-19 pandemic: control of within- and between-household mixing through NPIs; formation of support bubbles during lockdown periods; out-of-household isolation (OOHI); and temporary relaxation of NPIs during holiday periods. Our ordinary differential equation formulation and associated analysis demonstrate that multiple dimensions of risk stratification and social structure can be incorporated into infectious disease models without sacrificing mathematical tractability. This model and its software implementation expand the range of tools available to infectious disease policy analysts.

Comprehensive molecular characterization of cancer subtypes is essential for predicting clinical outcomes and searching for personalized treatments. We present bnClustOmics, a statistical model and computational tool for multi-omics unsupervised clustering, which serves a dual purpose: Clustering patient samples based on a Bayesian network mixture model and learning the networks of omics variables representing these clusters. The discovered networks encode interactions among all omics variables and provide a molecular characterization of each patient subgroup. We conducted simulation studies that demonstrated the advantages of our approach compared to other clustering methods in the case where the generative model is a mixture of Bayesian networks. We applied bnClustOmics to a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) dataset comprising genome (mutation and copy number), transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome data. We identified three main HCC subtypes together with molecular characteristics, some of which are associated with survival even when adjusting for the clinical stage. Cluster-specific networks shed light on the links between genotypes and molecular phenotypes of samples within their respective clusters and suggest targets for personalized treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A curated data resource of 214K metagenomes for characterization of the global antimicrobial resistome</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hannah-Marie Martiny, Patrick Munk, Christian Brinch, Frank M. Aarestrup, Thomas N. Petersen</p>

The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) calls for new epidemiological surveillance methods, as well as a deeper understanding of how antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) have been transmitted around the world. The large pool of sequencing data available in public repositories provides an excellent resource for monitoring the temporal and spatial dissemination of AMR in different ecological settings. However, only a limited number of research groups globally have the computational resources to analyze such data. We retrieved 442 Tbp of sequencing reads from 214,095 metagenomic samples from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and aligned them using a uniform approach against ARGs and 16S/18S rRNA genes. Here, we present the results of this extensive computational analysis and share the counts of reads aligned. Over 6.76∙10<sup>8</sup> read fragments were assigned to ARGs and 3.21∙10<sup>9</sup> to rRNA genes, where we observed distinct differences in both the abundance of ARGs and the link between microbiome and resistome compositions across various sampling types. This collection is another step towards establishing global surveillance of AMR and can serve as a resource for further research into the environmental spread and dynamic changes of ARGs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Anterior cingulate cortex causally supports flexible learning under motivationally challenging and cognitively demanding conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kianoush Banaie Boroujeni, Michelle K. Sigona, Robert Louie Treuting, Thomas J. Manuel, Charles F. Caskey, Thilo Womelsdorf</p>

Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum (STR) contain neurons encoding not only the expected values of actions, but also the value of stimulus features irrespective of actions. Values about stimulus features in ACC or STR might contribute to adaptive behavior by guiding fixational information sampling and biasing choices toward relevant objects, but they might also have indirect motivational functions by enabling subjects to estimate the value of putting effort into choosing objects. Here, we tested these possibilities by modulating neuronal activity in ACC and STR of nonhuman primates using transcranial ultrasound stimulation while subjects learned the relevance of objects in situations with varying motivational and cognitive demands. Motivational demand was indexed by varying gains and losses during learning, while cognitive demand was varied by increasing the uncertainty about which object features could be relevant during learning. We found that ultrasound stimulation of the ACC, but not the STR, reduced learning efficiency and prolonged information sampling when the task required averting losses and motivational demands were high. Reduced learning efficiency was particularly evident at high cognitive demands and immediately after subjects experienced a loss of already attained tokens. These results suggest that the ACC supports flexible learning of feature values when loss experiences impose a motivational challenge and when uncertainty about the relevance of objects is high. Taken together, these findings provide causal evidence that the ACC facilitates resource allocation and improves visual information sampling during adaptive behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Stress-dependent cell stiffening by tardigrade tolerance proteins that reversibly form a filamentous network and gel</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Akihiro Tanaka, Tomomi Nakano, Kento Watanabe, Kazutoshi Masuda, Gen Honda, Shuichi Kamata, Reitaro Yasui, Hiroko Kozuka-Hata, Chiho Watanabe, Takumi Chinen, Daiju Kitagawa, Satoshi Sawai, Masaaki Oyama, Miho Yanagisawa, Takekazu Kunieda</p>

Tardigrades are able to tolerate almost complete dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state called anhydrobiosis and resume their animation upon rehydration. Dehydrated tardigrades are exceptionally stable and withstand various physical extremes. Although trehalose and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins have been extensively studied as potent protectants against dehydration in other anhydrobiotic organisms, tardigrades produce high amounts of tardigrade-unique protective proteins. Cytoplasmic-abundant heat-soluble (CAHS) proteins are uniquely invented in the lineage of eutardigrades, a major class of the phylum Tardigrada and are essential for their anhydrobiotic survival. However, the precise mechanisms of their action in this protective role are not fully understood. In the present study, we first postulated the presence of tolerance proteins that form protective condensates via phase separation in a stress-dependent manner and searched for tardigrade proteins that reversibly form condensates upon dehydration-like stress. Through a comprehensive search using a desolvating agent, trifluoroethanol (TFE), we identified 336 proteins, collectively dubbed “TFE-Dependent ReversiblY condensing Proteins (T-DRYPs).” Unexpectedly, we rediscovered CAHS proteins as highly enriched in T-DRYPs, 3 of which were major components of T-DRYPs. We revealed that these CAHS proteins reversibly polymerize into many cytoskeleton-like filaments depending on hyperosmotic stress in cultured cells and undergo reversible gel-transition in vitro. Furthermore, CAHS proteins increased cell stiffness in a hyperosmotic stress-dependent manner and counteract the cell shrinkage caused by osmotic pressure, and even improved the survival against hyperosmotic stress. The conserved putative helical C-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for filament formation by CAHS proteins, and mutations disrupting the secondary structure of this region impaired both the filament formation and the gel transition. On the basis of these results, we propose that CAHS proteins are novel cytoskeleton-like proteins that form filamentous networks and undergo gel-transition in a stress-dependent manner to provide on-demand physical stabilization of cell integrity against deformative forces during dehydration and could contribute to the exceptional physical stability in a dehydrated state.

Potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) plays a critical role as an essential electrolyte in all biological systems. Genetically encoded fluorescent K<sup>+</sup> biosensors are promising tools to further improve our understanding of K<sup>+</sup>-dependent processes under normal and pathological conditions. Here, we report the crystal structure of a previously reported genetically encoded fluorescent K<sup>+</sup> biosensor, GINKO1, in the K<sup>+</sup>-bound state. Using structure-guided optimization and directed evolution, we have engineered an improved K<sup>+</sup> biosensor, designated GINKO2, with higher sensitivity and specificity. We have demonstrated the utility of GINKO2 for in vivo detection and imaging of K<sup>+</sup> dynamics in multiple model organisms, including bacteria, plants, and mice.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Polygenic signals of sex differences in selection in humans from the UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Filip Ruzicka, Luke Holman, Tim Connallon</p>

Sex differences in the fitness effects of genetic variants can influence the rate of adaptation and the maintenance of genetic variation. For example, “sexually antagonistic” (SA) variants, which are beneficial for one sex and harmful for the other, can both constrain adaptation and increase genetic variability for fitness components such as survival, fertility, and disease susceptibility. However, detecting variants with sex-differential fitness effects is difficult, requiring genome sequences and fitness measurements from large numbers of individuals. Here, we develop new theory for studying sex-differential selection across a complete life cycle and test our models with genotypic and reproductive success data from approximately 250,000 UK Biobank individuals. We uncover polygenic signals of sex-differential selection affecting survival, reproductive success, and overall fitness, with signals of sex-differential reproductive selection reflecting a combination of SA polymorphisms and sexually concordant polymorphisms in which the strength of selection differs between the sexes. Moreover, these signals hold up to rigorous controls that minimise the contributions of potential confounders, including sequence mapping errors, population structure, and ascertainment bias. Functional analyses reveal that sex-differentiated sites are enriched in phenotype-altering genomic regions, including coding regions and loci affecting a range of quantitative traits. Population genetic analyses show that sex-differentiated sites exhibit evolutionary histories dominated by genetic drift and/or transient balancing selection, but not long-term balancing selection, which is consistent with theoretical predictions of effectively weak SA balancing selection in historically small populations. Overall, our results are consistent with polygenic sex-differential—including SA—selection in humans. Evidence for sex-differential selection is particularly strong for variants affecting reproductive success, in which the potential contributions of nonrandom sampling to signals of sex differentiation can be excluded.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Clock gene-dependent glutamate dynamics in the bean bug brain regulate photoperiodic reproduction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Masaharu Hasebe, Sakiko Shiga</p>

Animals adequately modulate their physiological status and behavior according to the season. Many animals sense photoperiod for seasonal adaptation, and the circadian clock is suggested to play an essential role in photoperiodic time measurement. However, circadian clock-driven neural signals in the brain that convey photoperiodic information remain unclear. Here, we focused on brain extracellular dynamics of a classical neurotransmitter glutamate, which is widely used for brain neurotransmission, and analyzed its involvement in photoperiodic responses using the bean bug <i>Riptortus pedestris</i> that shows clear photoperiodism in reproduction. Extracellular glutamate levels in the whole brain were significantly higher under short-day conditions, which cause a reproductive diapause, than those under long-day conditions. The photoperiodic change in glutamate levels was clearly abolished by knockdown of the clock gene <i>period</i>. We also demonstrated that genetic modulation of glutamate dynamics by knockdown of glutamate-metabolizing enzyme genes, <i>glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase</i> (<i>got</i>) and <i>glutamine synthetase</i> (<i>gs</i>), attenuated photoperiodic responses in reproduction. Further, we investigated glutamate-mediated photoperiodic modulations at a cellular level, focusing on the pars intercerebralis (PI) neurons that photoperiodically change their neural activity and promote oviposition. Electrophysiological analyses showed that L-Glutamate acts as an inhibitory signal to PI neurons via glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl). Additionally, combination of electrophysiology and genetics revealed that knockdown of <i>got</i>, <i>gs</i>, and <i>glucl</i> disrupted cellular photoperiodic responses of the PI neurons, in addition to reproductive phenotypes. Our results reveal that the extracellular glutamate dynamics are photoperiodically regulated depending on the clock gene and play an essential role in the photoperiodic control of reproduction via inhibitory pathways.

Conventional cuvette-based and microfluidics-based electroporation approaches for bacterial gene delivery have distinct advantages, but they are typically limited to relatively small sample volumes, reducing their utility for applications requiring high throughput such as the generation of mutant libraries. Here, we present a scalable, large-scale bacterial gene delivery approach enabled by a disposable, user-friendly microfluidic electroporation device requiring minimal device fabrication and straightforward operation. We demonstrate that the proposed device can outperform conventional cuvettes in a range of situations, including across <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains with a range of electroporation efficiencies, and we use its large-volume bacterial electroporation capability to generate a library of transposon mutants in the anaerobic gut commensal <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Attractive serial dependence overcomes repulsive neuronal adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Timothy C. Sheehan, John T. Serences</p>

Sensory responses and behavior are strongly shaped by stimulus history. For example, perceptual reports are sometimes biased toward previously viewed stimuli (serial dependence). While behavioral studies have pointed to both perceptual and postperceptual origins of this phenomenon, neural data that could elucidate where these biases emerge is limited. We recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses while human participants (male and female) performed a delayed orientation discrimination task. While behavioral reports were attracted to the previous stimulus, response patterns in visual cortex were repelled. We reconciled these opposing neural and behavioral biases using a model where both sensory encoding and readout are shaped by stimulus history. First, neural adaptation reduces redundancy at encoding and leads to the repulsive biases that we observed in visual cortex. Second, our modeling work suggest that serial dependence is induced by readout mechanisms that account for adaptation in visual cortex. According to this account, the visual system can simultaneously improve efficiency via adaptation while still optimizing behavior based on the temporal structure of natural stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pax6 limits the competence of developing cerebral cortical cells to respond to inductive intercellular signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Martine Manuel, Kai Boon Tan, Zrinko Kozic, Michael Molinek, Tiago Sena Marcos, Maizatul Fazilah Abd Razak, Dániel Dobolyi, Ross Dobie, Beth E. P. Henderson, Neil C. Henderson, Wai Kit Chan, Michael I. Daw, John O. Mason, David J. Price</p>

The development of stable specialized cell types in multicellular organisms relies on mechanisms controlling inductive intercellular signals and the competence of cells to respond to such signals. In developing cerebral cortex, progenitors generate only glutamatergic excitatory neurons despite being exposed to signals with the potential to initiate the production of other neuronal types, suggesting that their competence is limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this limitation is due to their expression of transcription factor Pax6. We used bulk and single-cell RNAseq to show that conditional cortex-specific Pax6 deletion from the onset of cortical neurogenesis allowed some progenitors to generate abnormal lineages resembling those normally found outside the cortex. Analysis of selected gene expression showed that the changes occurred in specific spatiotemporal patterns. We then compared the responses of control and Pax6-deleted cortical cells to in vivo and in vitro manipulations of extracellular signals. We found that Pax6 loss increased cortical progenitors’ competence to generate inappropriate lineages in response to extracellular factors normally present in developing cortex, including the morphogens Shh and Bmp4. Regional variation in the levels of these factors could explain spatiotemporal patterns of fate change following Pax6 deletion in vivo. We propose that Pax6’s main role in developing cortical cells is to minimize the risk of their development being derailed by the potential side effects of morphogens engaged contemporaneously in other essential functions.

                Background: As Malaysia struggles with the battle to retain talented workers, the retention of persons with disabilities (PWDs) remains a major challenge in innovation management. Malaysia currently has the lowest retention of PWDs in innovation management in The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The purpose of this study is to develop a unique framework to enhance the inclusion of PWDs in Malaysia.  Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to 200 PWDs in the central region of Malaysia.   Results: Based on the results of this research, four crucial variables (salary, compensation, career advancement and reward management) contributed to the lack of involvement in innovation management among PWDs in Malaysia.  Conclusions: This study focuses on 200 PWDs in Malaysia. Despite the fact that PWDs’ involvement in innovation management is the lowest, there is a lack of research initiative and practitioner commitment to address this issue. Serving as preliminary research in Malaysia, this study develops a unique framework to fill the gap.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Periventricular white matter hyperintensities (pvWMHs) are commonly observed on MRI in older individuals and are associated with cognitive and motor decline. The etiology of pvWMH remains unknown. Venous collagenosis has been implicated, which may also interfere with perivascular fluid flow leading to dilation of perivascular spaces (PVS). Here, we examine relationships between in vivo pvWMH volume and ex vivo morphological quantification of collagenosis and the PVS in veins and arteries.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain tissue from 25 Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Research Center subjects was selected to cover the full range of WMH burden. Tissue from white matter abutting the ventricle was stained with Masson's trichrome and smooth muscle actin. An automated hue based algorithm identified and segmented vessel into collagenized vessel walls, lumen, and PVS. Multiple linear regressions with pvWMH volume as the dependent variable and either collagen thickness or PVS width were performed with covariates of vessel diameter, age at death, sex, and interval between MRI and death.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PVS width and collagen thickness were significantly correlated in both arteries (r = 0.21, p = 0.001) and veins (r = 0.23, p = 0.001). Increased venous collagen (p = 0.017) was a significant predictor of higher pvWMH burden while arterial collagen was not (p = 0.128). Neither PVS width in arteries (p = 0.937) nor veins (p = 0.133) predicted pvWMH burden.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings are consistent with a model in which venous collagenosis mediates the relationship between vascular risk factors and pvWMH. This study confirms the importance of changes to the venous system in contributing to MRI white matter lesions commonly observed with advanced age. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Stem cell technology is a powerful tool ready to respond to the needs of modern medicine that is experiencing rapid technological development. Given its potential in therapeutic applications, intellectual property rights (IPR) as a protection resource of knowledge are a relevant topic. Patent eligibility of stem cells has been controversial as restrictions to access the fundamental technologies open a gap between research and clinic. Therefore, we depicted the current patent landscape in the field to discuss if this approach moves forward in closing this breach by examining patent activity over the last decade from a transdisciplinary perspective. Stem cell therapeutic applications is an area of continuous growth where patent filing through the PCT is the preferred strategy. Patenting activity is concentrated in the USA, European Union, and Australia; this accumulation in a few key players leads to governance, regulation, and inequality concerns. To boost wealthiness and welfare in society - stem cell therapies' ultimate goal - while at post-pandemic recovery, critical elements in the field of IPR rise to overcome current limitations: to promote bridge builders able to connect the research and business worlds, regulatory updates, novel financing models, new vehicles (startups, spinouts, and spin-offs), and alternative figures of intellectual property.

                Chipman and colleagues characterize NMDA-receptor-dependent compensatory plasticity in the adult hippocampus, consistent with expression of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP). Mechanistically, the compensatory plasticity is driven by NMDAR-dependent spine growth and active zone expansion. Remarkably, compensatory plasticity at excitatory synapses is linked to potentiation of inhibitory transmission, ultimately favoring net inhibition.

                Takahashi et al. found elevated expression of the transposable element LINE-1 in the cerebella of ataxia telangiectasia patients. A mouse model in which LINE-1 is activated in cerebellar Purkinje neurons showed significant ataxia with neurodegeneration and electrophysical abnormalities. The progression of the ataxia was attenuated with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor treatment.

                Tao et al. show that Ku proteins act as co-sensors of cGAS. Ku proteins augment cGAS catalytic activity by increasing the DNA binding affinity of cGAS and promoting cGAS condensation, thus ensuring an efficient innate immune response to DNA virus infection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proton-transporting heliorhodopsins from marine giant viruses</a></h4>

              
                Rhodopsins convert light into signals and energy in animals and microbes. Heliorhodopsins (HeRs), a recently discovered new rhodopsin family, are widely present in archaea, bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, and giant viruses, but their function remains unknown. Here, we report that a viral HeR from Emiliania huxleyi virus 202 (V2HeR3) is a light-activated proton transporter. V2HeR3 absorbs blue-green light, and the active intermediate contains the deprotonated retinal Schiff base. Site-directed mutagenesis study revealed that E191 in TM6 constitutes the gate together with the retinal Schiff base. E205 and E215 form a PAG of the Schiff base, and mutations at these positions converted the protein into an outward proton pump. Three environmental viral HeRs from the same group as well as a more distantly related HeR exhibited similar proton-transport activity, indicating that HeR functions might be diverse similarly to type-1 microbial rhodopsins. Some strains of <i>E. huxleyi</i> contain one HeR that is related to the viral HeRs, while its viruses <i>Eh</i>V-201 and <i>Eh</i>V-202 contain two and three HeRs, respectively. Except for V2HeR3 from <i>Eh</i>V-202, none of these proteins exhibit ion transport activity. Thus, when expressed in the <i>E. huxleyi</i> cell membranes, only V2HeR3 has the potential to depolarize the host cells by light, possibly to overcome the host defense mechanisms or to prevent superinfection. The neuronal activity generated by V2HeR3 suggests that it can potentially be used as an optogenetic tool, similarly to type-1 microbial rhodopsins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural model of microtubule dynamics inhibition by kinesin-4 from the crystal structure of KLP-12 –tubulin complex</a></h4>

              
                Kinesin superfamily proteins are microtubule-based molecular motors driven by the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Among them, the kinesin-4 family is a unique motor that inhibits microtubule dynamics. Although mutations of kinesin-4 cause several diseases, its molecular mechanism is unclear because of the difficulty of visualizing the high-resolution structure of kinesin-4 working at the microtubule plus-end. Here, we report that KLP-12, a <i>C. elegans</i> kinesin-4 ortholog of KIF21A and KIF21B, is essential for proper length control of <i>C. elegans</i> axons, and its motor domain represses microtubule polymerization in vitro. The crystal structure of the KLP-12 motor domain complexed with tubulin, which represents the high-resolution structural snapshot of the inhibition state of microtubule-end dynamics, revealed the bending effect of KLP-12 for tubulin. Comparison with the KIF5B-tubulin and KIF2C-tubulin complexes, which represent the elongation and shrinking forms of microtubule ends, respectively, showed the curvature of tubulin introduced by KLP-12 is in between them. Taken together, KLP-12 controls the proper length of axons by modulating the curvature of the microtubule ends to inhibit the microtubule dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Machine learning-assisted fluoroscopy of bladder function in awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the lower urinary tract (LUT) and development of highly needed novel therapies to treat LUT disorders depends on accurate techniques to monitor LUT (dys)function in preclinical models. We recently developed videocystometry in rodents, which combines intravesical pressure measurements with X-ray-based fluoroscopy of the LUT, allowing the <i>in vivo</i> analysis of the process of urine storage and voiding with unprecedented detail. Videocystometry relies on the precise contrast-based determination of the bladder volume at high temporal resolution, which can readily be achieved in anesthetized or otherwise motion-restricted mice but not in awake and freely moving animals. To overcome this limitation, we developed a machine-learning method, in which we trained a neural network to automatically detect the bladder in fluoroscopic images, allowing the automatic analysis of bladder filling and voiding cycles based on large sets of time-lapse fluoroscopic images (&gt;3 hours at 30 images/second) from behaving mice and in a non-invasive manner. With this approach, we found that urethane, an injectable anesthetic that is commonly used in preclinical urological research, has a profound, dose-dependent effect on urethral relaxation and voiding duration. Moreover, both in awake and in anaesthetized mice, the bladder capacity was decreased ~4-fold when cystometry was performed acutely after surgical implantation of a suprapubic catheter. Our findings provide a paradigm for the non-invasive, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of a hollow organ in behaving animals and pinpoint important limitations of the current gold standard techniques to study the LUT in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mental health in medical and biomedical doctoral students during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and racial protests</a></h4>

              
                Concerns about the mental health of students, trainees and staff at universities and medical schools have been growing for many years. Recently, these have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and a period of heightened reckoning and protests about systemic racism in the United States in 2020. To better understand the mental health of medical students and biomedical doctoral students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during this challenging period, we performed a cross-sectional study (n=957) using institutional annual survey data on measures of depression, anxiety, hazardous alcohol use, problems related to substance use, and suicidal ideation. These data were collected in 2019 and 2020, and were analyzed by type of training program, race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and survey year. Results indicated significant differences for rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, with biomedical doctoral students showing greater incidence than medical students, and historically excluded students (e.g., people of color, women, LGBQ+ trainees) showing greater incidence compared to their peers. Of note, mental health remained poor for biomedical doctoral students in 2020 and declined for those belonging to historically excluded populations. The high rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported suggest that training environments need to be improved and support for mental health increased.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A crosstalk between hepcidin and IRE/IRP pathways controls ferroportin expression and determines serum iron levels in mice</a></h4>

              
                The iron hormone hepcidin is transcriptionally activated by iron or inflammation via distinct, partially overlapping pathways. We addressed how iron affects inflammatory hepcidin levels and the ensuing hypoferremic response. Dietary iron overload did not mitigate hepcidin induction in LPS-treated wt mice but prevented effective inflammatory hypoferremia. Likewise, LPS modestly decreased serum iron in hepcidin-deficient <i>Hjv-/-</i> mice, model of hemochromatosis. Synthetic hepcidin triggered hypoferremia in control but not iron-loaded wt animals. Furthermore, it dramatically decreased hepatic and splenic ferroportin in <i>Hjv-/-</i> mice on standard or iron-deficient diet, but only triggered hypoferremia in the latter. Mechanistically, iron antagonized hepcidin responsiveness by inactivating IRPs in the liver and spleen, to stimulate ferroportin mRNA translation. Prolonged LPS treatment eliminating ferroportin mRNA permitted hepcidin-mediated hypoferremia in iron-loaded mice. Thus, <i>de novo</i> ferroportin synthesis is critical determinant of serum iron and finetunes hepcidin-dependent functional outcomes. Our data uncover a crosstalk between hepcidin and IRE/IRP systems that controls tissue ferroportin expression and determines serum iron levels. Moreover, they suggest that hepcidin supplementation therapy is more efficient combined with iron depletion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recovering mixtures of fast-diffusing states from short single-particle trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Single-particle tracking (SPT) directly measures the dynamics of proteins in living cells and is a powerful tool to dissect molecular mechanisms of cellular regulation. Interpretation of SPT with fast-diffusing proteins in mammalian cells, however, is complicated by technical limitations imposed by fast image acquisition. These limitations include short trajectory length due to photobleaching and shallow depth of field, high localization error due to the low photon budget imposed by short integration times, and cell-to-cell variability. To address these issues, we investigated methods inspired by Bayesian nonparametrics to infer distributions of state parameters from SPT data with short trajectories, variable localization precision, and absence of prior knowledge about the number of underlying states. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches relative to other frameworks for SPT analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A specific role for Importin-5 and NASP in the import and nuclear hand-off of monomeric H3</a></h4>

              
                Core histones package chromosomal DNA and regulate genomic transactions, with their nuclear import and deposition involving importin- proteins and a dedicated repertoire of histone chaperones. Previously, a histone H3-H4 dimer has been isolated bound to Importin-4 (Imp4) and the chaperone ASF1, suggesting H3 and H4 fold together in the cytoplasm before nuclear import. However, other studies have shown the existence of monomeric H3 in the nucleus, indicating a post import folding pathway. Here we report that the predominant importin associated with cytoplasmic H3 is Importin-5 (Imp5), which hands off its monomeric cargo to nuclear sNASP. Imp5, in contrast to Imp4, binds to both H3 and H4 containing constitutively monomeric mutations and binds to newly synthesised, monomeric H3 tethered in the cytoplasm. Constitutively monomeric H3 retains its interaction with NASP, whereas monomeric H4 retains interactions specifically with HAT1 and RBBP7. High-resolution separation of NASP interactors shows the 's' isoform but not the 't' isoform associates with monomeric H3, whilst both isoforms associate with H3-H4 dimers in at least three discrete multi-chaperoning complexes. In vitro binding experiments show mutual exclusivity between sNASP and Imp5 in binding H3, suggesting direct competition for interaction sites, with the GTP-bound form of Ran required for histone transfer. Finally, using pulse-chase analysis, we show that cytoplasm tethered histones do not interact with endogenous NASP until they reach the nucleus, whereupon they bind rapidly. We propose an Imp5-specific import pathway for monomeric H3 that hands off to sNASP in the nucleus, with a parallel H4 pathway involving Imp5 and the HAT1-RBBP7 complex, followed by nuclear folding and hand-off to deposition factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CRISPR screens in 3D assembloids reveal disease genes associated with human interneuron development</a></h4>

              
                The assembly of cortical circuits involves the generation and migration of cortical interneurons from the ventral to the dorsal forebrain, which has been challenging to study in humans as these processes take place at inaccessible stages of late gestation and early postnatal development. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have been associated with abnormal cortical interneuron development, but which of the hundreds of NDD genes impact interneuron generation and migration into circuits and how they mediate these effects remain unknown. We previously developed a stem cell-based platform to study human cortical interneurons in self-organizing organoids resembling the ventral forebrain and their migration using forebrain assembloids. Here, we integrate assembloid technology with CRISPR screening to systematically investigate the involvement of 425 NDD genes in human interneuron development. The first screen aimed at interneuron generation revealed 13 candidate genes, including the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 and the canonical TGF{beta} signaling activator SMAD4. Then, we ran an interneuron migration screen in ~1,000 forebrain assembloids that identified 33 candidate genes, including cytoskeleton-related genes and, notably, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related gene LNPK. Interestingly, we discovered that, during interneuron migration, the ER is displaced along the leading neuronal branch prior to nuclear translocation. Deletion of LNPK interfered with this ER displacement and resulted in reduced interneuron saltation length, indicating a critical role for the ER in this migratory process. Taken together, these results highlight how this versatile CRISPR-assembloid platform can be used to systematically map disease genes onto early stages of human neural development and to reveal novel mechanisms regulating interneuron development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meningeal IL-17 producing T cells mediate cognitive impairment in salt-sensitive hypertension</a></h4>

              
                Hypertension, a disease afflicting over one billion individuals worldwide, is a leading cause of cognitive impairment, the mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. In a mouse model of hypertension involving brain angiotensin signaling, we found that the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction depends on IL-17, a cytokine elevated in the circulation of hypertensive individuals. However, neither circulating IL-17 or brain angiotensin signaling could account in full for the dysfunction. Rather, IL-17 produced by meningeal T-cells was the major culprit by activating IL-17 receptors on brain associated macrophages. Accordingly, depleting brain macrophages or suppressing meningeal T cells completely rescued cognitive function without attenuating blood pressure elevation, circulating IL-17 or brain angiotensin signaling. The data unveil a critical role of meningeal T-cells and macrophage IL-17 signaling in the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction of hypertension and suggest novel therapies to counteract the devastating effects of hypertension on cognitive health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep spindle maturation enhances slow oscillation-spindle coupling</a></h4>

              
                The synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindle activity (12.5-16 Hz) precisely during the slow oscillation up peak is considered an essential feature of adult non-rapid eye movement sleep. However, there is little knowledge on how this well-known coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops. Leveraging individualized detection of single events, we first provide a detailed cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling in children aged 5 to 6, 8 to 11, and 14 to 18 years. Critically, based on this, we then investigated how spindle and slow oscillation maturity substantiate age differences in their precise orchestration. While the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the canonical (adult-like) fast spindle range in all three age groups - but notably less precise in children. To corroborate these findings, we linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity, which indicate the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like fast spindles, and slow oscillation maturity, which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance, with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. Importantly, we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and precision. Taken together, our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns across child and adolescent development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The amyloid precursor protein regulates synaptic transmission at medial perforant path synapses</a></h4>

              
                The perforant path provides the main cortical excitatory input to the hippocampus. Due to its important role in information processing and coding, entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus have been studied in considerable detail. Nevertheless, a characterization of synaptic transmission between individual connected pairs of entorhinal stellate cells and dentate granule cells is still pending. Here, we have used organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures, in which the entorhino-dentate (EC-GC) projection is present and EC-GC pairs can be studied using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Using cultures of wildtype mice, the properties of EC-GC synapses formed by afferents from the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex were compared and differences in short-term plasticity were revealed. Since the perforant path is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease, we used cultures of APP-deficient mice to address the role of the amyloid-precursor protein (APP) at this synapse. APP-deficiency caused alterations in excitatory neurotransmission at medial perforant path synapses that were accompanied by transcriptomic and ultrastructural changes. Moreover, the deletion of pre- but not postsynaptic APP through the local injection of Cre-expressing AAVs in conditional APPflox/flox tissue cultures increased the efficacy of neurotransmission at perforant path synapses. Together, these data suggest a physiological role for presynaptic APP at medial perforant path synapses, which may be adversely affected under conditions of altered APP processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity in the human superior colliculus associated with reaching for tactile targets</a></h4>

              
                The superior colliculus (SC) plays a major role in orienting movements of eyes and the head and in the allocation of attention. Functions of the SC have been mostly investigated in animal models, including non-human primates. Differences in the SC's anatomy and function between different species question extrapolations of these studies to humans without further validation. Few electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies in animal models and humans have reported an unexpected role of the SC in visually guided reaching movements. Using BOLD fMRI imaging, We sought to decipher if the SC is also active during reaching movements guided by tactile stimulation. Participants executed reaching movements to visual or tactile target positions. When contrasted against visual and tactile stimulation without reaching, we found increased SC activity in correlation with reaching for both stimulus modalities. In agreement with previous studies across various species, we conclude that the SC is involved in the execution of reaching movements. Beyond a confirmation for visually guided reaching, our results showed that this involvement is independent from a specific sensory modality informing such movements and suggest a general involvement of the human SC in upper limb reaching movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural cognitive signals during spontaneous movements in the macaque</a></h4>

              
                The single neuron basis of cognitive processing in primates has mostly been studied in laboratory settings where movements are severely restricted. It is unclear, therefore, how natural movements might affect neural signatures of cognition in the brain. Moreover, studies in mice indicate that body movements, when measured, account for most of the neural dynamics in the cortex. To examine this issue, we recorded from single neuron ensembles in the prefrontal cortex in moving monkeys performing a cognitive task and characterized eyes, head, and body movements using video tracking. Despite significant trial-to-trial movement variability, single neuron tuning could be precisely measured and decision signals accurately decoded on a single-trial basis. Creating or abolishing spontaneous movements through head restraint and task manipulations had no measurable impact on neural responses. However, encoding models showed that uninstructed movements explained as much neural variance as task variables, with most of them aligned to task events. These results demonstrate that cognitive signals in the cortex are robust to natural movements, but also that unmeasured movements are potential confounds in cognitive neurophysiology experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter structural bases for predictive tapping synchronization</a></h4>

              
                We determined the intersubject association between rhythmic entrainment abilities of human subjects during a synchronization continuation tapping task (SCT) and the macro and microstructural properties of their superficial (SWM) and deep (dWM) white matter. Diffusion-weighted images were obtained from 32 subjects who also performed the SCT with auditory or visual metronomes and five tempos ranging from 550 to 950 ms. We developed a method to determine the fiber density of U-fibers running tangentially to the cortex. Notably, the right audiomotor system showed individual differences in the density of U-fibers that were correlated with the degree of predictive entrainment across subjects. These correlations were selective for the synchronization epoch with auditory metronomes and were specific for tempos around 1.5 Hz. In addition, there was a significant association between predictive rhythmic entrainment and the density and bundle diameter of the corpus callosum (CC), forming a chronotopic map where behavioural correlations of short and long intervals were found with the anterior and posterior portions of the CC. Finally, the fiber bundle cross-section of the arcuate fasciculus, the CC, and the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus showed a significant correlation with the mean asynchronies of the auditory SCT. These findings suggest that the structural properties of the SWM and dWM in the audiomotor system support the predictive abilities of subjects during rhythmic tapping, where the density of cortical U-fibers are linked to the preferred tapping tempo, while the bundle properties of CC define an interval selective topography that has an anterior posterior gradient.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The history of multisensory discrepancies affects the ventriloquism effect and the immediate aftereffect differentially.</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration and recalibration are two processes by which perception deals with discrepant multisensory signals. In the lab, integration can be probed via the presentation of simultaneous spatially discrepant audio-visual stimuli, i.e. in a spatial ventriloquism paradigm. Recalibration here manifests as an aftereffect bias in unisensory judgements following immediate or long-term exposure to discrepant audio-visual stimuli. Despite many studies exploring the ventriloquism effect (VE) and the immediate aftereffect (VAE), it remains unclear whether the VAE is a direct consequence of the integration of preceding discrepant multisensory signals. We here provide evidence that these two biases are not strictly related. First, we analysed data from ten experiments probing the dependence of each bias on audio-visual discrepancies experienced in multiple preceding trials. This revealed a seven-fold stronger dependence of the VAE on preceding discrepancies compared to the VE. Second, we analysed data from an experiment deviating from the typical trial context in which these biases are probed and found that the VAE can vanish despite the VE being present. We argue that integration may help maintaining a stable percept by reducing immediate sensory discrepancies, whereas recalibration may help maintaining an accurate percept by accounting for consistent discrepancies. Hence, the immediate VAE is not a direct and necessary consequence of the integration of discrepant signals and these two well-studied multisensory response biases can be experimentally dissociated.

                The functional neurological outcome of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) strongly relates to the degree of secondary brain injury (ICH SBI) evolving within days after the initial bleeding. Different mechanisms including the incitement of inflammatory pathways, dysfunction of the blood brain barrier (BBB), activation of resident microglia, and an influx of blood-borne immune cells, have been hypothesized to contribute to ICH SBI. Yet, the spatiotemporal interplay of specific inflammatory processes within different brain compartments has not been sufficiently characterized, limiting potential therapeutic interventions to prevent and treat ICH SBI. Using a whole-blood injection model in mice, we systematically characterized the spatial and temporal dynamics of inflammatory processes after ICH using 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spatial RNA sequencing (spRNAseq), functional BBB assessment, and immunofluorescence average intensity mapping. We identified a pronounced early response of the choroid plexus (CP) peaking at 12 to 24h, that was characterized by inflammatory cytokine expression, epithelial and endothelial expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, and the accumulation of leukocytes. In contrast, we observed a delayed secondary reaction pattern at the injection site (striatum) peaking at 96h, defined by gene expression corresponding to perilesional leukocyte infiltration and correlating to the delayed signal alteration seen on MRI. Pathway analysis revealed a dependence of the early inflammatory reaction in the CP on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). TLR4 and MyD88 knockout mice corroborated this observation, lacking the early upregulation of adhesion molecules and leukocyte infiltration within the CP 24h after whole-blood injection. In conclusion, we report a biphasic brain reaction pattern after ICH with a MyD88 TLR4 dependent early inflammatory response of the CP, preceding inflammation, edema and leukocyte infiltration at the lesion site. Pharmacological targeting of the early CP activation might harbor the potential to modulate the development of ICH SBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spreading depolarization causes reperfusion failure after cerebral ischemia</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite successful recanalization to treat acute ischemic stroke, reperfusion failure associated with poor functional outcomes develops in half of the patients. The cause of reperfusion failure remains the subject of intensive research. Here, we explore the possibility that spreading depolarization (SD), a potent ischemic injury mechanism is a significant contributor and reliable predictor of reperfusion failure. Methods: Young adult male and female C57BL/6 mice (n=69) were anesthetized with isoflurane (0.6-0.9%) and prepared for transcranial optical imaging. After 10 min of baseline, incomplete global forebrain ischemia was induced by transient (45 min) bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion, followed by 75 min reperfusion. SD and cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes were visualized with intrinsic optical signal imaging and laser speckle contrast imaging. To block SD, the irreversible NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 was applied (0.3 mg/kg, i.p., n=29). Neurological deficit was evaluated at baseline and post-ischemia with a composite Garcia Neuroscore scale. Collaterals of the circle of Willis were examined after loading the vasculature with carbon black ink. Ischemic neuronal injury was evaluated in hematoxylin-eosin-stained brain sections. Results: SD emerged after ischemia onset in one or both hemispheres under a perfusion threshold (CBF drop to 21.1+-4.6 vs. 33.6+-4.4 %, SD vs. no SD). The failure of later reperfusion (44.4+-12.5 %) was invariably linked to previous ischemic SD. In contrast, reperfusion was adequate (98.9+-7.4 %) in hemispheres devoid of SD during ischemia. CBF reduced below the perfusion threshold of SD, when the P1 segment was absent in the circle of Willis. SD occurrence and the linked reperfusion failure were associated with poor neurologic function, and greater neuronal necrosis. The inhibition of SD with MK801 significantly improved reperfusion. Conclusions: SD occurrence during ischemia impairs later reperfusion, prognosticating poor functional outcomes. The increased likelihood of SD occurrence is predicted by inadequate collaterals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-Echo Investigations of Positive and Negative CBF and Concomitant BOLD Changes</a></h4>

              
                Unlike the positive blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response (PBR), commonly taken as an indication of an 'activated' brain region, the physiological origin of negative BOLD signal changes (i.e. a negative BOLD response, NBR), also referred to as 'deactivation' is still being debated. In this work, an attempt was made to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanism by obtaining a comprehensive measure of the contributing cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its relationship to the NBR in the human visual cortex, in comparison to a simultaneously induced PBR in surrounding visual regions. To overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of CBF measurements, a newly developed multi-echo version of a center-out echo planar-imaging (EPI) readout was employed with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL). It achieved very short echo and inter-echo times and facilitated a simultaneous detection of functional CBF and BOLD changes at 3 T with improved sensitivity. Evaluations of the absolute and relative changes of CBF and the effective transverse relaxation rate, R2*, the coupling ratios, and their dependence on CBF at rest, CBFrest, indicated differences between activated and deactivated regions. Analysis of the shape of the respective functional responses also revealed faster negative responses with more pronounced post-stimulus transients. Resulting differences in the flow-metabolism coupling ratios were further examined for potential distinctions in the underlying neuronal contributions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NUDT6, the Antisense Protein of FGF2 Gene, Plays a Depressogenic Role by Promoting Inflammation and Suppressing Neurogenesis without Altering FGF2 Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is involved in the regulation of affective behavior and shows antidepressant effects through Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. NUDT6 is a protein encoded from the antisense strand of the FGF2 gene and its role in the regulation of affective behavior is unclear. Here, we show that increasing NUDT6 expression in the hippocampus results in depression-like behavior in rats without changing FGF2 levels or activating its downstream effectors, Akt and ERK1/2. Instead, NUDT6 acts by inducing inflammatory signaling, specifically by increasing S100A9 levels, activating NF-kB, and rising microglia number along with a reduction in neurogenesis. Conversely, inhibition of hippocampal NUDT6 expression by shRNA results in antidepressant effects and increases neurogenesis without altering FGF2 levels. Together these findings suggest that NUDT6 may play a role in major depression by inducing a proinflammatory state and serve as a novel therapeutic target for antidepressant development. The opposite effects of NUDT6 and FGF2 on depression-like behavior may serve as a mechanism to fine-tune affective behavior. Our findings open up new venues for studying the differential regulation and functional interactions of sense and antisense proteins in neural function and behavior as well as in neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Cell membranes and macromolecules or paramagnetic compounds interact with water proton spins, which modulates magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast providing information on tissue composition. For a further investigation, quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) parameters (at 3T), including the ratio of the macromolecular and water proton pools, F, and the exchange-rate constant as well as the (observed) longitudinal and the effective transverse relaxation rates (at 3T and 7T), R1obs and R2*, respectively, were measured at high spatial resolution (200 m) in a slice of fixed marmoset brain and compared to histology results obtained with Gallyas' myelin stain and Perls' iron stain. R1obs and R2* were linearly correlated with the iron content for the entire slice, whereas distinct differences were obtained between gray and white matter for correlations of relaxometry and qMT parameters with myelin content. The combined results suggest that the macromolecular pool interacting with water consists of myelin and (less efficient) non-myelin contributions. Despite strong correlation of F and R1obs, none of these parameters was uniquely specific to myelination. Due to additional sensitivity to iron stores, R1obs and R2* were more sensitive for depicting microstructural differences between cortical layers than F.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Self-generated brain-wide spiking cascades govern replay dynamics in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                During states of behavioral quiescence, neurons in the hippocampus replay sequences of spiking activity experienced in earlier behavioral episodes. While such replay sequences are hypothesized to serve learning and memory by facilitating synaptic consolidation, their generative mechanisms remain poorly understood. Increasing evidence suggests that they might be generated internally, or at least strongly constrained by internal circuit dynamics. Recent work demonstrated that, across the forebrain, approximately 70% of neurons participate in a pattern of sequential spiking cascades during rest. Like hippocampal replay sequences, these brain-wide spiking cascades occur together with high-frequency hippocampal ripples and therefore may share a common generative mechanism. Here we systematically investigated the relationship between replay activity and sequential spiking cascades by analyzing a database of intracortical electrocortical recordings in mice. For neuronal subpopulations in the hippocampus and visual cortex, we assessed spiking sequences elicited during video viewing as well as potential replay events during subsequent periods of rest. We found that replay events were unique to hippocampal time-sensitive neurons and occurred together with spiking cascades throughout the forebrain. Furthermore, forward and time-reversed replay sequences were associated with different types of spiking cascades. Overall, these findings indicate that hippocampal replay events are generated and structured according to resting state circuit dynamics manifest across a large portion of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estrogen signaling in the dorsal raphe regulates binge-like drinking in mice</a></h4>

              
                The ovarian hormone estrogens promote binge alcohol drinking and contribute to sex differences in alcohol use disorder. However, the mechanisms for estrogen-induced binge drinking are largely unknown. This study aims to test if estrogens act on 5-hydroxytryptamine neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (5-HTDRN) to promote binge drinking. We used the drinking in the dark (DID) behavioral test in mice to mimic binge drinking in humans. We found that female mice drank more alcohol than male mice in chronic DID tests. This sex difference was associated with distinct alterations in mRNA expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and 5-HT-related genes in the DRN, suggesting a potential role of estrogen/ERs/5-HT signaling in binge alcohol drinking. In supporting this view, 5-HTDRN neurons from naive male mice had lower baseline neuronal firing activity but higher sensitivity to alcohol-induced excitation compared to 5-HTDRN neurons from naive female mice. Notably, this higher sensitivity was blunted by 17bata-estradiol treatment in males, indicating an estrogen-dependent mechanism. We further showed that both ERalpha and ERbeta are expressed in 5-HTDRN neurons, whereas ERalpha agonist propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) depolarizes 5-HTDRN neurons and ERbeta agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) hyperpolarizes 5-HTDRN neurons. Notably, both PPT and DPN treatments blocked the stimulatory effects of alcohol on 5-HTDRN neurons in males, despite the fact that they have antagonistic effects on the activity dynamics of 5-HTDRN neurons. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of ERs on ethanol-induced burst firing of 5-HTDRN neurons may contribute to higher levels of binge drinking in females. Consistently, chemogenetic activation of ERalpha- or ERbeta-expressing neurons in the DRN reduced binge alcohol drinking. These results support a model in which estrogens act on ERalpha/beta to prevent alcohol-induced activation of 5-HTDRN neurons, which in return leads to higher binge alcohol drinking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RNA-deficient TDP-43 causes loss of free nuclear TDP-43 by sequestration</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction and aggregation of the RNA-binding protein, TDP-43, is the unifying hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mechanisms and relative contributions of concurrent TDP-43 nuclear depletion, cytoplasmic accumulation, and post-translational modification to neurodegeneration remain unresolved. We employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated fluorescent tagging to investigate how disease-associated stressors and pathological TDP-43 alter abundance, localisation, self-assembly, aggregation, solubility, and mobility dynamics of endogenous TDP-43 over time. Oxidative stress stimulated TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation into droplets or spherical shell-like 'anisosomes', which were not formed by over-expressed wild-type TDP-43. Further, nuclear RNA-binding-ablated or acetylation-mimicking TDP-43 rapidly formed anisosomes and inclusions that readily sequestered and depleted free normal nuclear TDP-43. The majority of total endogenous TDP-43 was sequestered into anisosomes, but retained high protein mobility and solubility. However, cytoplasmic RNA-deficient TDP-43 formed large phosphorylated inclusions that occasionally sequestered endogenous TDP-43, rendering it insoluble and immobile, indicating irreversible pathological transition. These findings suggest that post-translational modification and RNA-binding deficiency exacerbate TDP-43 aggregation and dysfunction by driving sequestration, mislocalisation, and depletion of normal nuclear TDP-43 in ALS and FTD.

                Motion is one of the fundamental qualities not only of vision, but also of touch. Manipulation and exploration of objects involves different forms of movement between the skin and object. A different form of tactile motion from remote sources is through substrate vibrations, and is present in arthropods such as insects and spiders, enabling them to localise approaching preys and predators. Here, we quantify the extent to humans perceive motion based on vibrations sensed at fingertips. We employed a novel stimulation paradigm in which a pair of vibrations (100 Hz) with sinusoidal envelopes (0.5 cycle/s) and various phase differences between the two vibrations were delivered to two fingertips. The phase difference generated the perception of a virtual motion across the fingertips. The findings suggest that human tactile system possesses the sensory channel for detection of motion through substrate vibrations, which is fundamentally different from active surface exploration mechanisms. We propose two potential neural computations underlying processing this form of motion; one based on phase difference detection, and the second based on temporal interval duration processing.

                Striatal dysfunction is a key characteristic of addictive disorders, but neuroimaging studies have reported conflicting findings. An integrative model of addiction points to the presence or absence of addiction-related cues as an explanation for striatal hypo- or hyperactivations, respectively, but has never been directly tested. Here, we developed a novel paradigm to investigate striatal activation during monetary reward anticipation in the presence versus absence of addiction-related pictures using functional MRI. Across two studies, we compared 46 alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients with 30 matched healthy controls; and 24 gambling disorder (GD) patients with 22 matched healthy controls. During monetary reward anticipation, hypoactivation of the reward system was seen in AUD individuals compared to HCs. Additionally, a behavioral interaction was seen where gambling cues made participants, across groups, respond faster for bigger, but slower for smaller rewards. However, no striatal differences were seen between the participants with AUD or GD and their matched controls. In sum, these findings suggest that striatal dysfunction is a key but heterogeneous mechanism within both AUD and GD and indicates an important but complex role for addiction-related cues in explaining striatal dysfunction in addiction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Tripod neuron: a minimal structural reduction of the dendritic tree</a></h4>

              
                Neuron models with explicit dendritic dynamics have shed light on mechanisms for coincidence detection, pathway selection, and temporal filtering. However, it is still unclear which morphological and physiological features are required to capture these phenomena. In this work, we introduce the Tripod neuron model and propose a minimal structural reduction of the dendritic tree that is able to reproduce these dendritic computations. The Tripod is a three-compartment model consisting of two segregated passive dendrites and a somatic compartment modeled as an adaptive, exponential integrate-and-fire neuron. It incorporates dendritic geometry, membrane physiology, and receptor dynamics as measured in human pyramidal cells. We characterize the response of the Tripod to glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs and identify parameters that support supra-linear integration, coincidence-detection, and pathway-specific gating through shunting inhibition. Following NMDA spikes, the Tripod neuron generates plateau potentials whose duration depends on the dendritic length and the strength of synaptic input. When fitted with distal compartments, the Tripod neuron encodes previous activity into a dendritic depolarized state. This dendritic memory allows the neuron to perform temporal binding and we show that the neuron solves transition and sequence detection tasks on which a single-compartment model fails. Thus, the Tripod neuron can account for dendritic computations previously explained only with more detailed neuron models or neural networks. Due to its simplicity, the Tripod model can be used efficiently in simulations of larger cortical circuits.

                In computational neuroscience, hypotheses are often formulated as bottom-up mechanistic models of the systems in question, consisting of differential equations that can be numerically integrated forward in time. Candidate models can then be validated by comparison against experimental data. The model outputs of neural network models depend on both neuron parameters, connectivity parameters and other model inputs. Successful model fitting requires sufficient exploration of the model parameter space, which can be computationally demanding. Additionally, identifying degeneracy in the parameters, i.e. different combinations of parameter values that produce similar outputs, is of interest, as they define the subset of models consistent with the data. In this computational study, we apply metamodels to a two-population recurrent spiking network of point-neurons, the so-called Brunel network. Metamodels are data-driven approximations to more complex models with more desirable computational properties, which can be run considerably faster than the original model. Specifically, we apply two different metamodelling techniques, Hierarchical Cluster-based Partial Least Squares regression and deep Gaussian process regression, to estimate the power spectra of the population spiking activities and the local field potential. We find that the metamodels are able to accurately model the power spectra in the asynchronous irregular regime. Using the Gaussian process metamodel, we invert the model, and estimate the probability distributions over parameters that can give rise to observed simulation outputs. We find that these distributions correctly identify parameter combinations that give similar model outputs, and that the parameters are constrained to different degrees by observing the two different signals.

                An interlude of dark exposure for about one week is known to shift the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance of the mammalian visual cortex, promoting cortical plasticity across species and accelerating visual recovery of those that have experienced cortical lesions during development. However, the translational impact of our understanding of dark exposure from animal studies on humans remains elusive. Here, we use magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a probe for E/I balance in the primary visual cortex (V1) to determine the effect of 60-min dark exposure, and measure binocular combination as a behavioral assay to assess visual plasticity in 18 normally sighted adults (13 females). To induce neuroplastic changes in the observers, 60-min monocular deprivation was performed, which is known to shift sensory eye balance in favor of the previously deprived eye. We report that dark exposure strengthens cortical excitability in V1 and boosts visually plasticity in normal adults. Our findings are surprising, given the fact that the interlude is at a very brief timescale. We present direct evidence that an environmental manipulation that reduces intracortical inhibition can as a metaplastic facilitator for visual plasticity in adult humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Erotic cue exposure increases physiological arousal, biases choices towards immediate rewards and attenuates model-based reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Computational psychiatry focuses on identifying core cognitive processes that appear altered across a broad range of psychiatric disorders. Temporal discounting of future rewards and model-based control during reinforcement learning have proven as two promising candidates. Despite its trait-like stability, temporal discounting has been suggested to be at least partly under contextual control. For example, highly arousing cues such as erotic pictures were shown to increase discounting, although overall evidence to date remains somewhat mixed. Whether model-based reinforcement learning is similarly affected by arousing cues is unclear. Here we tested cue-reactivity effects (erotic pictures) on subsequent temporal discounting and model-based reinforcement learning in a within-subjects design in n=39 healthy male participants. Self-reported and physiological arousal (cardiac activity and pupil dilation) were assessed before and during cue exposure. Arousal was increased during exposure of erotic vs. neutral cues both on the subjective and autonomic level. Erotic cue exposure nominally increased discounting as reflected by reduced choices of delayed options. Hierarchical drift diffusion modeling (DDM) linked increased discounting to a shift in the starting point bias of evidence accumulation towards immediate options. Model-based control during reinforcement learning was reduced following erotic cues according to model-agnostic analysis. Notably, DDM linked this effect to attenuated forgetting rates of unchosen options, leaving the model-based control parameter unchanged. Our findings replicate previous work on cue-reactivity effects in temporal discounting and for the first time show similar effects in model-based reinforcement learning. Our results highlight how environmental cues can impact core human decision processes and reveal that comprehensive drift diffusion modeling approaches can yield novel insights in reward-based decision processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Graded optogenetic activation of the auditory pathway for neural network analysis and hearing restoration</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetic control of neural activity enables causal investigation of neural circuits and new perspectives in sensory restoration. Optimal design of the experiment needs to match the optogenetic technology to the precise neural circuit and research question. This often precludes out-of-the-box solutions and require users to thorough characterize the neural response and to tailor the optogenetic tools. Here, we provide a framework to parametrize optogenetic control at the single and population levels and apply it, in mice, to the spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) that form the input stage of the auditory pathway. We employed the ultrafast targeting-optimized Chronos and characterized the light-evoked response by in vivo single-unit recordings in SGNs and neurons of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) that detect coincident SGN input. We demonstrate that spike probability can be gradually dialed by adjusting the width of light pulses like what can be achieved with acoustic clicks of different sound pressure levels. We identified an optimal pulse width of 1.6 ms for maximizing the amount of light intensity information in the spike trains. Further, we identified a spike failure induced during high rate optical stimulation that likely was due to depolarization block and required a few tens of milliseconds to recover. Finally, a semi-stochastic stimulus allowed us to rapidly (within minutes) establish the transfer function from light to SGNs firing and to generate firing of different statistics for approximating the time constant of neuronal integration in AVCN neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">4.1N and SAP97 regulate different phases of AMPA receptor intracellular transport</a></h4>

              
                Changes in the number of synaptic AMPA subtypes of glutamate receptors (AMPAR) underlie many forms of synaptic plasticity. These variations are controlled by a complex interplay between their intracellular transport (IT), export to the plasma membrane, stabilization at synaptic sites, and recycling. The differential molecular mechanisms involved in these various trafficking pathways and their regulation remains partly unknown. We have recently reported the visualization of AMPAR IT in cultured hippocampal neurons and demonstrated its regulation during synaptic plasticity inducing protocols (Hangen, Cordelieres et al., 2018), opening the path to the differential analysis of the mechanisms controlling AMPAR transport and exocytosis. The cytosolic C-terminal (C-ter.) domain of AMPAR GluA1 subunit is specifically associated with cytoplasmic proteins that could be implicated in the regulation of their IT such as 4.1N and SAP97. Here we analyze how interactions between GluA1 and 4.1N or SAP97 regulate IT and exocytosis at the plasma membrane in basal condition and after cLTP induction. We use sh-RNA against 4.1N and SAP97 and specific mutations and deletions of GluA1 C-ter. domain to characterize how these interactions are involved in coupling AMPAR to the transport machinery. The down-regulation of both 4.1N or SAP97 by shRNAs decrease GluA1 containing vesicle number, modify their transport properties and decrease GluA1 export to the PM, indicating their role in GluA1 IT. The total deletion of the C-ter. domain of GluA1 fully suppresses its IT. Disruption of GluA1 binding to 4.1N decreases the number of GluA1 containing transport vesicles, inhibits GluA1 externalization but does not affect the transport properties of the remaining GluA1 containing vesicles. This indicates a role of the 4.1N GluA1 interaction during exocytosis of the receptor in basal transmission. In contrast, disrupting the binding between SAP97 and GluA1 modifies the basal transport properties of GluA1 containing vesicles and decreases GluA1 export to the plasma membrane. Importantly, disrupting GluA1 interaction with either 4.1N or SAP97 prevents both the cLTP induced increase in the number of GluA1 containing vesicles observed in control and GluA1 externalization. Our results demonstrate that specific interactions between 4.1N or SAP97 with GluA1 have different roles in GluA1 IT and exocytosis. During basal transmission, the binding of 4.1N to GluA1 allows the fusion/fission membrane exocytosis whereas the interaction with SAP97 is essential for GluA1 IT. During cLTP the interaction of 4.1N with GluA1 allows both IT and exocytosis of the receptor in hippocampal cultured neurons. Altogether, our results identify the differential roles of 4.1N and SAP97 in the control of various phases of GluA1 IT.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping of Glutamate Metabolism using 1H FID-MRSI after oral Administration of Glc at 9.4 T</a></h4>

              
                Glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter in the brain and malfunction of the related metabolism is associated with various neurological diseases and disorders. The observation of labeling changes in the spectra after the administration of a 13C labelled tracer is a common tool to gain better insights into the function of the metabolic system. But so far, only a very few studies presenting the labelling effects in more than two voxels to show the spatial dependence of metabolism. In the present work, the labeling effects were measured in a transversal plane in the human brain using ultra-short TE and TR 1H FID-MRSI. The measurement set-up was most simple: The [1-13C]Glc was administered orally instead of intravenous and the spectra were measured with a pure 1H technique without the need of a 13C channel (as Boumezbeur et al. demonstrated in 2004). Thus, metabolic maps and enrichment curves could be obtained for more metabolites and in more voxels than ever before in human brain. Labeling changes could be observed in [4-13C]glutamate, [3-13C]glutamate+glutamine, [2-13C]glutamate+glutamine, [4-13C]glutamine, [2,3-13C]aspartate and [6-13C]N-acetyl aspartate with a high temporal (3.6 min) and spatial resolution (32x32 grid with nominal voxel size of 0.33 L) in five volunteers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the Influence of Anatomical Accuracy and Electrode Positions on EEG Forward Solutions</a></h4>

              
                Generating realistic volume conductor models for forward calculations in electroencephalography is not trivial and several factors contribute to the accuracy of such models, two of which are its anatomical accuracy and the accuracy with which electrode positions are known. Here, we investigate effects of anatomical accuracy by comparing forward solutions from SimNIBS, a tool which allows state-of-the-art anatomical modeling, with well-established pipelines in MNE-Python and FieldTrip. We also compare different ways of specifying electrode locations when digitized positions are not available such as transformation of measured positions from standard space and transformation of a manufacturer layout. Substantial effects of anatomical accuracy were seen throughout the entire brain both in terms of field topography and magnitude with SimNIBS generally being more accurate than the pipelines in MNE-Python and FieldTrip. Topographic and magnitude effects were particularly pronounced for MNE-Python which uses a three-layer boundary element model. We attribute these mainly to differences in skull and cerebrospinal fluid modeling. Effects of electrode specification method were evident in occipital and posterior areas when using a transformed manufacturer layout whereas transforming measured positions from standard space generally resulted in smaller errors. We suggest modeling the anatomy of the volume conductor as accurately possible and we hope to facilitate this by making it easy to export simulations from SimNIBS to MNE-Python and FieldTrip for further analysis. Likewise, if digitized electrode positions are not available, a set of measured positions on a standard head template may be preferable to those specified by the manufacturer.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scream's roughness confers a privileged access to the brain during sleep</a></h4>

              
                During sleep, recognizing threatening signals is crucial to know when to wake up and when to continue vital sleep functions. Screaming is perhaps the most salient and efficient signal for communicating danger at a distance or in conditions of limited visibility. Beyond the intensity or the pitch of the sound, rapid modulations of sound pressure in the so-called roughness range (i.e. 30-150 Hz) are particularly powerful in capturing attention and accelerating reactions. Roughness is an acoustic feature that characterizes alarm signals such as screams. However, whether rough sounds are also processed in a privileged manner during sleep is unknown. We tested this hypothesis by stimulating sleeping human participants with low-intensity screams and neutral calls. We found that screams trigger more reliable and better time-locked responses in wakefulness and NREM sleep. In addition, screams boosted sleep spindles, suggesting elevated stimulus salience. The increase in sleep spindle power was linearly proportional to the roughness of vocalizations, but not to their pitch. These findings demonstrate that, even at low sound intensity, scream's roughness conveys stimulus relevance and enhances processing in both the waking and sleeping states. Preserved differential neural responses based on stimulus salience may ensure adaptive reactions -and ultimately survival- in a state where the brain is mostly disconnected from external inputs.

	<p>Aging-related neurocognitive disorder (NCD) is a growing health concern. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite from dietary precursors, might emerge as a promising biomarker of cognitive dysfunction within the context of brain aging and NCD. TMAO may increase among older adults, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease patients, and individuals with cognitive sequelae of stroke. Higher circulating TMAO would make them more vulnerable to age- and NCD-related cognitive decline, via mechanisms such as promoting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and reducing synaptic plasticity and function. However, these observations are contrary to the cognitive benefit reported for TMAO through its positive effects on blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier integrity, as well as from the supplementation of TMAO precursors. Hence, current disputable evidence does not allow definite conclusions as to whether TMAO could serve as a critical target for cognitive health. This article provides a comprehensive overview of TMAO documented thus far on cognitive change due to aging and NCD.</p>

	<p>(1) Introduction: Tourette syndrome (TS) and chronic tic disorder (CTD) are common neurodevelopmental/-psychiatric disorders. The aetiological factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of TS/CTD are still poorly understood. The possible risk factors for TS/CTD are considered to be a combination of genetic, immunological, psychological and environmental factors. A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to assess the association between aetiological factors and TS/CTD. (2) Methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang data, and CNKI, were searched to identify the etiological factors of children and adolescents (&amp;amp;le; 18 years) with TS/CTD based on a case-control study. Quality assessments were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). (3) Results: According to sample sizes and NOS values, recent evidence may support that genetic factors (BTBD9 and AADAC), immunological factors (streptococcus and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections), environmental factors (conflict, history of perinatal diseases, and family history of neurological and psychiatric diseases and recurrent respiratory infections) and psychological factors (major life events) are associated with the pathogenesis of TS/CTD. (4) Conclusions: Some risk factors in different categories may be the etiological factors of TS/CTD, but there is a lack of studies on the interaction among the factors, which may require more attention in the future.</p>

	<p>Balanced time perspective refers to the ability to flexibly switch between different temporal foci in an adaptive manner according to the current context. Functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) has been suggested to support balanced time perspective. The coupling between the DMN and fronto-parietal network (FPN) may drive many important expressions of internally directed cognition. However, it remains unclear whether balanced time perspective is supported by the interaction between the FPN and DMN. To examine these issues, we recruited 91 participants (52 males with mean age of 19.6, and 39 females with mean age of 20.0) to undergo resting-state brain imaging scan and to complete a questionnaire measuring balanced time perspective. Seed-based voxel-wise functional connectivity analyses implicated midline DMN regions including the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) along with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), precuneus, and cerebellum in supporting a balanced time perspective. More importantly, functional connectivity between the right amPFC and right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the FPN was found to associate with balanced time perspective. Our findings suggest the importance of coordinated brain activity in supporting a balanced time perspective.</p>

	<p>Mutations of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are associated with pronounced sleep disorders or cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effects of LRRK2 deficiency on sleep rhythms and sleep deprivation-related cognitive changes, and the relevant underlying mechanism, remain unrevealed. In this study, Lrrk2-/- and Lrrk2+/+ mice were subjected to normal sleep (S) or sleep deprivation (SD). Sleep recording, behavioral testing, Golgi-cox staining, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR were employed to evaluate the impacts of LRRK2 deficiency on sleep behaviors and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that after SD, LRRK2-deficient mice displayed lengthened NREM and shortened REM, and reported decreased dendritic spines, increased microglial activation, and synaptic endocytosis in the prefrontal cortex. Meanwhile, after SD, LRRK2 deficiency aggravated cognitive impairments, especially in the recall memory cued by fear conditioning test. Our findings evidence that LRRK2 modulates REM/NREM sleep and its deficiency may exacerbate sleep deprivation-related cognitive disorders by perturbing synaptic plasticity and microglial synaptic pruning in mice.</p>

	<p>Driving fatigue refers to a phenomenon in which a driver&amp;amp;rsquo;s physiological and psychological functions become unbalanced after a long period of continuous driving, and their driving skills decline objectively. The hidden dangers of driving fatigue to traffic safety should not be underestimated. In this work, we propose a judgment excitation mode (JEM), which adds secondary cognitive tasks to driving behavior through dual-channel human&amp;amp;ndash;computer interaction, so as to delay the occurrence of driving fatigue. We used multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) to study the dynamic properties of subjects&amp;amp;rsquo; EEG, and analyzed the effect of JEM on fatigue retardation by Hurst exponent value and multifractal spectrum width value. The results show that the multifractal properties of the two driving modes (normal driving mode and JEM) are significantly different. The JEM we propose can effectively delay the occurrence of driving fatigue, and has good prospects for future practical applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with the intention of telehealth service utilization among Bangladeshi people: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Telehealth is comprised of telecommunications and electronic information systems to support and maintain long-distance healthcare services. Although it has not been thoroughly explored, the intention of using the service among the general public is critical to its success. We investigated the factors associated with the intention to utilize telehealth services among the general population of Bangladesh. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between May 22, 2021 and June 15, 2021 in Bangladesh, where the total number of participants was 1038. The Pearson chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis H tests were used to examine the unadjusted relationship between the explanatory variables and the intention to use telehealth services. A multinomial logistic regression model was fitted to determine the adjusted association. Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to check the normality of continuous data. Data were processed and analyzed by software STATA-16. Results: The probability of utilizing the service increased significantly with increasing knowledge, perceived benefit, and predisposition levels among respondents. However, when perceived concern increased, the likelihood of utilizing the service dropped significantly. Age, marital status, educational status, profession, residence, and perceived health status were significantly associated with the participants’ intention to utilize the telehealth service. Conclusions: The influencing aspects of telehealth service utilization should be recognized by the respective authorities. Possible activities to enhance usability among people are also recommended.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prediction of the effects of the top 10 synonymous mutations from 26645 SARS-CoV-2 genomes [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had led to a global pandemic since December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, which mutates at a higher rate. Multiple works had been done to study nonsynonymous mutations, which change protein sequences.  However, there is little study on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 synonymous mutations, which may affect viral fitness. This study aims to predict the effect of synonymous mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.   Methods: A total of 26645 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences retrieved from Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID) database were aligned using MAFFT. Then, the mutations and their respective frequency were identified.  Multiple RNA secondary structures prediction tools, namely RNAfold, IPknot++ and MXfold2 were applied to predict the effect of the mutations on RNA secondary structure and their base pair probabilities was estimated using MutaRNA. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis was also performed to measure the codon usage bias (CUB) of SARS-CoV-2.  Results: A total of 150 synonymous mutations were identified. The synonymous mutation identified with the highest frequency is C3037U mutation in the nsp3 of ORF1a.. Of these top 10 highest frequency synonymous mutations, C913U, C3037U, U16176C and C18877U mutants show pronounced changes between wild type and mutant in all 3 RNA secondary structure prediction tools, suggesting these mutations may have some biological impact on viral fitness. These four mutations show changes in base pair probabilities. All mutations except U16176C change the codon to a more preferred codon, which may result in higher translation efficiency. Conclusion:   Synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome may affect RNA secondary structure, changing base pair probabilities and possibly resulting in a higher translation rate. However, lab experiments are required to validate the results obtained from prediction analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A successful case of toxic epidermal necrolysis treated with plasmapheresis therapy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN) is rare and can be life-threatening for patients. Appropriate management of TEN patients could give optimal results and prevent complications. One treatment modality for TEN is plasmapheresis, which is rarely available in most cases with severe TEN. Here we reported a successful treatment of severe TEN with plasmapheresis. A 40-year-old woman under tuberculosis therapy complained of shortness of breath that began four days prior to hospital admission and worsened ever since. The patient's skin was peeling with red spots and rashes all over the body for a week. During the examination, the patient was compos mentis, and the SCORTEN score was 2 with 12.1% risk of mortality rate. Dermatological examination of the face, trunk and extremities found extensive erosions, loose bullae filled with clear fluid, brown crusts, and generalized distribution with more than 30% epidermolysis. The patient was diagnosed with toxic epidermal necrolysis caused by antituberculosis therapy. We treated the patient by discontinuing the suspected drugs and administering the corticosteroids, but no improvement was observed. The patient underwent two cycle plasmaphereses with 5% albumin, resulting in 1.2 liter of plasma exchange. Re-epithelialization was observed after three days, and the patient was discharged on day 8. This case-report highlights the important role of plasmapheresis in treating the TEN patients. However, a study with larger sample sizes is warranted to validate the efficacy of plasmapheresis in TEN.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor differentially controls mossy cell activity across the dentate gyrus longitudinal axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding the role of dentate gyrus (DG) mossy cells (MCs) in learning and memory has rapidly evolved due to increasingly precise methods for targeting MCs and for in vivo recording and activity manipulation in rodents. These studies have shown MCs are highly active in vivo, strongly remap to contextual manipulation, and that their inhibition or hyperactivation impairs pattern separation and location or context discrimination. Less well understood is how MC activity is modulated by neurohormonal mechanisms, which might differentially control the participation of MCs in cognitive functions during discrete states, such as hunger or satiety. In this study, we demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a neuropeptide produced in the gut and the brain that regulates food consumption and hippocampal-dependent mnemonic function, might regulate MC function through expression of its receptor, GLP-1R. RNA-seq demonstrated that most, though not all, <i>Glp1r</i> in hippocampal principal neurons is expressed in MCs, and in situ hybridization revealed strong expression of <i>Glp1r</i> in hilar neurons. <i>Glp1r-ires-Cre</i> mice crossed with Ai14D reporter mice followed by co-labeling for the MC marker GluR2/3 revealed that almost all MCs in the ventral DG expressed <i>Glp1r</i> and that almost all <i>Glp1r</i>-expressing hilar neurons were MCs. However, only ~60% of dorsal DG MCs expressed <i>Glp1r</i>, and <i>Glp1r</i> was also expressed in small hilar neurons that were not MCs. Consistent with this expression pattern, peripheral administration of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (5 μg/kg) increased cFos expression in ventral but not dorsal DG hilar neurons. Finally, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from ventral MCs showed that bath application of exendin-4 (200 nM) depolarized MCs and increased action potential firing. Taken together, this study adds to known MC activity modulators a neurohormonal mechanism that may preferentially affect ventral DG physiology and may potentially be targetable by several GLP-1R pharmacotherapies already in clinical use.</p>

<p>Responses to chronic social stress are highly sex-dependent, although central monoamine signalling is modified in both.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Psychosocial stress promotes and links mood and cardiovascular disorders in a sex-specific manner. However, findings in animal models are equivocal, in some cases opposing human dimorphisms. We examined central nervous system (CNS), behavioral, endocrine, cardiac, and hepatic outcomes in male or female C57Bl/6 mice subjected to chronic social stress (56 days of social isolation, with intermittent social confrontation encounters twice daily throughout the final 20 days). Females exhibited distinct physiological and behavioral changes, including relative weight loss, and increases in coronary resistance, hepatic inflammation, and thigmotaxic behavior in the open field. Males evidence reductions in coronary resistance and cardiac ischemic tolerance, with increased circulating and hippocampal monoamine levels and emerging anhedonia. Shared CNS gene responses include reduced hippocampal <i>Maoa</i> and increased <i>Htr1b</i> expression, while unique responses include repression of hypothalamic <i>Ntrk1</i> and upregulation of cortical <i>Nrf2</i> and <i>Htr1b</i> in females; and repression of hippocampal <i>Drd1</i> and hypothalamic <i>Gabra1</i> and <i>Oprm</i> in males. Declining cardiac stress resistance in males was associated with repression of cardiac leptin levels and metabolic, mitochondrial biogenesis, and anti-inflammatory gene expression. These integrated data reveal distinct biological responses to social stress in males and females, and collectively evidence greater biological disruption or allostatic load in females (consistent with propensities to stress-related mood and cardiovascular disorders in humans). Distinct stress biology, and molecular to organ responses, emphasize the importance of sex-specific mechanisms and potential approaches to stress-dependent disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">How the immune system shapes neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are a major cause of death and disability worldwide and are influenced by many factors including age, genetics, and injuries. While these diseases are often thought to result from the accumulation and spread of aberrant proteins, recent studies have demonstrated that they can be shaped by the innate and adaptive immune system. Resident myeloid cells typically mount a sustained response to the degenerating CNS, but peripheral leukocytes such as T and B cells can also alter disease trajectories.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular characteristics and laminar distribution of prefrontal neurons projecting to the mesolimbic system</a></h4>

              
                Prefrontal cortical influence over the mesolimbic system – including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) – is implicated in various cognitive processes and behavioral malfunctions. The functional versatility of this system could be explained by an underlying anatomical complexity; however, the detailed characterization of the medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) innervation of the NAc and VTA is still lacking. Therefore, combining classical retrograde and conditional viral tracing techniques with multiple fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we sought to deliver a precise, cell- and layer-specific anatomical description of the cortico-mesolimbic pathways in mice. We demonstrated that NAc- (mPFC<sub>NAc</sub>) and VTA-projecting mPFC (mPFC<sub>VTA</sub>) populations show different laminar distribution (layers 2/3–5a and 5b–6, respectively) and express different molecular markers. Specifically, calbindin and Ntsr1 are specific to mPFC<sub>NAc</sub> neurons, while mPFC<sub>VTA</sub> neurons express high levels of Ctip2 and FoxP2, indicating that these populations are mostly separated at the cellular level. We directly tested this with double retrograde tracing and <i>Canine adenovirus type 2</i>-mediated viral labeling and found that there is indeed minimal overlap between the two populations. Furthermore, whole-brain analysis revealed that the projection pattern of these populations is also different throughout the brain. Taken together, we demonstrated that the NAc and the VTA are innervated by two, mostly nonoverlapping mPFC populations with different laminar distribution and molecular profile. These results can contribute to the advancement in our understanding of mesocorticolimbic functions and its disorders in future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of Geobacter OmcZ filaments suggests extracellular cytochrome polymers evolved independently multiple times</a></h4>

              
                While early genetic and low-resolution structural observations suggested that extracellular conductive filaments on metal reducing organisms such as <i>Geobacter</i> were composed of Type IV pili, it has now been established that bacterial <i>c</i>-type cytochromes can polymerize to form extracellular filaments capable of long-range electron transport. Atomic structures exist for two such cytochrome filaments, formed from the hexaheme cytochrome OmcS and the tetraheme cytochrome OmcE. Due to the highly conserved heme packing within the central OmcS and OmcE cores, and shared pattern of heme coordination between subunits, it has been suggested that these polymers have a common origin. We have now used cryo-EM to determine the structure of a third extracellular filament, formed from the <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> octaheme cytochrome, OmcZ. In contrast to the linear heme chains in OmcS and OmcE from the same organism, the packing of hemes, heme:heme angles, and between-subunit heme coordination is quite different in OmcZ. A branched heme arrangement within OmcZ leads to a highly surface exposed heme in every subunit, which may account for the formation of conductive biofilm networks, and explain the higher measured conductivity of OmcZ filaments. This new structural evidence suggests that conductive cytochrome polymers arose independently on more than one occasion from different ancestral multiheme proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Amygdala-cortical collaboration in reward learning and decision making</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive reward-related decision making requires accurate prospective consideration of the specific outcome of each option and its current desirability. These mental simulations are informed by stored memories of the associative relationships that exist within an environment. In this review, I discuss recent investigations of the function of circuitry between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and lateral (lOFC) and medial (mOFC) orbitofrontal cortex in the learning and use of associative reward memories. I draw conclusions from data collected using sophisticated behavioral approaches to diagnose the content of appetitive memory in combination with modern circuit dissection tools. I propose that, via their direct bidirectional connections, the BLA and OFC collaborate to help us encode detailed, outcome-specific, state-dependent reward memories and to use those memories to enable the predictions and inferences that support adaptive decision making. Whereas lOFC→BLA projections mediate the encoding of outcome-specific reward memories, mOFC→BLA projections regulate the ability to use these memories to inform reward pursuit decisions. BLA projections to lOFC and mOFC both contribute to using reward memories to guide decision making. The BLA→lOFC pathway mediates the ability to represent the identity of a specific predicted reward and the BLA→mOFC pathway facilitates understanding of the value of predicted events. Thus, I outline a neuronal circuit architecture for reward learning and decision making and provide new testable hypotheses as well as implications for both adaptive and maladaptive decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiple ciliary localization signals control INPP5E ciliary targeting</a></h4>

              
                Primary cilia are sensory membrane protrusions whose dysfunction causes ciliopathies. INPP5E is a ciliary phosphoinositide phosphatase mutated in ciliopathies like Joubert syndrome. INPP5E regulates numerous ciliary functions, but how it accumulates in cilia remains poorly understood. Herein, we show INPP5E ciliary targeting requires its folded catalytic domain and is controlled by four conserved ciliary localization signals (CLSs): LLxPIR motif (CLS1), W383 (CLS2), FDRxLYL motif (CLS3) and CaaX box (CLS4). We answer two long-standing questions in the field. First, partial CLS1-CLS4 redundancy explains why CLS4 is dispensable for ciliary targeting. Second, the essential need for CLS2 clarifies why CLS3-CLS4 are together insufficient for ciliary accumulation. Furthermore, we reveal that some Joubert syndrome mutations perturb INPP5E ciliary targeting, and clarify how each CLS works: (i) CLS4 recruits PDE6D, RPGR and ARL13B, (ii) CLS2-CLS3 regulate association to TULP3, ARL13B, and CEP164, and (iii) CLS1 and CLS4 cooperate in ATG16L1 binding. Altogether, we shed light on the mechanisms of INPP5E ciliary targeting, revealing a complexity without known parallels among ciliary cargoes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep learning based feature extraction for prediction and interpretation of sharp-wave ripples in the rodent hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Local field potential (LFP) deflections and oscillations define hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWR), one of the most synchronous events of the brain. SWR reflect firing and synaptic current sequences emerging from cognitively relevant neuronal ensembles. While spectral analysis have permitted advances, the surge of ultra-dense recordings now call for new automatic detection strategies. Here, we show how one-dimensional convolutional networks operating over high-density LFP hippocampal recordings allowed for automatic identification of SWR from the rodent hippocampus. When applied without retraining to new datasets and ultra-dense hippocampus-wide recordings, we discovered physiologically relevant processes associated to the emergence of SWR, prompting for novel classification criteria. To gain interpretability, we developed a method to interrogate the operation of the artificial network. We found it relied in feature-based specialization, which permit identification of spatially segregated oscillations and deflections, as well as synchronous population firing typical of replay. Thus, using deep learning based approaches may change the current heuristic for a better mechanistic interpretation of these relevant neurophysiological events.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct architectural requirements for the parS centromeric sequence of the pSM19035 plasmid partition machinery</a></h4>

              
                Three-component ParABS partition systems ensure stable inheritance of many bacterial chromosomes and low-copy-number plasmids. ParA localizes to the nucleoid through its ATP-dependent non-specific DNA binding activity, whereas centromere-like <i>parS</i>-DNA and ParB form partition complexes that activate ParA-ATPase to drive the system dynamics. The essential <i>parS</i> sequence arrangements vary among ParABS systems, reflecting the architectural diversity of their partition complexes. Here, we focus on the pSM19035 plasmid partition system that uses a ParB<sub>pSM</sub> of the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) family. We show that <i>parS<sub>pSM</sub></i> with four or more contiguous ParB<sub>pSM</sub>-binding sequence repeats is required to assemble a stable ParA<sub>pSM</sub>-ParB<sub>pSM</sub> complex and efficiently activate the ParA<sub>pSM</sub>-ATPase, stimulating complex disassembly. Disruption of the contiguity of the <i>parS<sub>pSM</sub></i> sequence array destabilizes the ParA<sub>pSM</sub>-ParB<sub>pSM</sub> complex and prevents efficient ATPase activation. Our findings reveal the unique architecture of the pSM19035 partition complex and how it interacts with nucleoid-bound ParA<sub>pSM</sub>-ATP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NPAS4 supports drug-cue associations and relapse-like behavior through regulation of the cell type-specific activation balance in the nucleus accumbens</a></h4>

              
                Use of addictive substances creates powerful drug-cue associations that often trigger relapse. Drug seeking is gated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) by competing activation of D1 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) that promote, and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing neurons (D2-MSNs) that oppose, drug seeking. We show here that the ensemble of neurons in the NAc that induce the neuronal activity-regulated transcription factor, Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 4 (NPAS4), is required for cocaine-context associations. In addition, NPAS4 functions within NAc D2-MSNs to govern the activation balance of NAc D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs necessary for drug-context memories and cue-induced cocaine, but not sucrose, seeking. NPAS4 regulates drug-cue associations and preponderant D1-MSN activation by influencing a program of gene expression that blocks cocaine-induced potentiation of prefrontal cortical excitatory drive onto D2-MSNs. Together our findings reveal that NPAS4 is a key player governing NAc MSN cell-type activation balance and promoting drug-cue associations and relapse vulnerability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How inhibitory and excitatory inputs gate output of the inferior olive</a></h4>

              
                The inferior olive provides the climbing fibers to Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex, where they elicit all-or-none complex spikes and control major forms of plasticity. Given their important role in both short-term and long-term coordination of cerebellum-dependent behaviors, it is paramount to understand the factors that determine the output of olivary neurons. Here, we investigate how the inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the olivary neurons interact with each other, generating spiking patterns of olivary neurons that ride on their intrinsic oscillations. Using dual color optogenetic stimulation and whole cell recordings we demonstrate how intervals between the inhibitory input from the cerebellar nuclei and excitatory input from the mesodiencephalic junction affect phase and gain of the olivary output at both the sub- and suprathreshold level. When the excitatory input is activated approximately 50 ms after the inhibitory input, the phase of the intrinsic oscillations becomes remarkably unstable and the excitatory input can hardly generate any olivary spike. Instead, when the excitatory input is activated approximately 150 ms after the inhibitory input, the excitatory input can optimally drive olivary spiking, riding on top of the first cycle of the subthreshold oscillations that have been powerfully reset by the preceding inhibitory input. Simulations of a large-scale network model of the inferior olive highlight to what extent the synaptic interactions penetrate in the neuropil, generating quasi-oscillatory spiking patterns in large parts of the olivary subnuclei, the size of which also depends on the relative timing of the inhibitory and excitatory inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anxiety-like behaviors in mice unmasked: Revealing sex differences in anxiety using a novel light-heat conflict test</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety and chronic pain afflict hundreds of millions worldwide. Both anxiety and pain are more prevalent in females (vs. males). Unfortunately, robust sex differences in human anxiety are not recapitulated in rodent tests, and results from rodent pain studies frequently fail to translate clinically. Therefore, there is a need to develop tests that reflect the differential salience of anxiety or pain-related stimuli between the sexes. Accordingly, here we introduce the Thermal Increments Dark-Light (TIDAL) conflict test. The TIDAL test places an anxiety-relevant stimulus (dark vs. illuminated chamber) in conflict with a heat-related stimulus (incrementally heated vs. isothermic chamber); mice freely explore the dark-heating and illuminated-isothermic chambers. Here, we aim to determine whether the TIDAL conflict test reveals in mice underappreciated sex differences in anxiety and/or heat sensitivity. We establish in three distinct experiments that females on the TIDAL conflict test persist substantially longer on the dark-heated plate, suggesting that females (vs. males) exhibit elevated anxiety-like behavior. Mice more strongly prefer the dark plate on the TIDAL conflict test compared to control thermal place preference with both chambers illuminated. We also reveal that mice exposed to TIDAL for a second session exhibit signs of learning. Therefore, our new TIDAL conflict test reliably unmasks the relative salience of anxiety (vs. heat sensitivity): mice that are female exhibit robust anxiety-like behaviors not consistently observed in classical tests. Future studies should incorporate TIDAL and other conflict tests to better understand rodent behavior and to identify mechanisms underlying anxiety and pain.

                We investigated how resting EEG measures are associated with risk factors for late-life cognitive impairment and dementia, including age, Apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE-e4) carriage and cardiometabolic burden. Resting EEG was recorded from 86 adults (50-80 years of age). Participants additionally completed the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination (ACE) III and had blood drawn to assess APOE-e4 carriage status and cardiometabolic burden. EEG power spectra were decomposed into sources of periodic and aperiodic activity to derive measures of aperiodic component slope and alpha (7-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) peak power and peak frequency. The aperiodic component slope was correlated with ACE-III scores but not age. Alpha peak frequency decreased with age. Individuals with higher cardiometabolic burden had lower alpha peak frequencies and lower beta peak power. APOE-e4 carriers had lower beta peak frequencies. Our findings suggest that the slope of the aperiodic component of resting EEG power spectra is more closely associated with cognitive performance (which generally declines with age) rather than chronological age, where these have been conflated in previous work.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prefrontal representation of affective stimuli: importance of stress, sex, and context</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder diminishes health-related quality-of-life and disproportionality impacts females. Negative life events predict the onset of depressive symptoms including negative mood, anhedonia, and social withdrawal. While the neurobiology of affective illness is not completely understood, structural and functional changes in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) associate with mood and anxiety disorders. Rodent studies have investigated the prefrontal impact of chronic stress, a preclinical model of mood disruption. However, ex vivo slice and postmortem histological studies have focused largely on males and yielded mixed results. Although genetically-defined recordings in behaving animals of both sexes have not been reported. Here, we hypothesized that chronic variable stress (CVS) would reduce the neural processing of affective stimuli in the infralimbic region of rodent vmPFC region. To test this hypothesis, we targeted expression of a fluorescent calcium indicator, GCaMP6s, to infralimbic pyramidal cells. In males, CVS reduced infralimbic responses to social interaction and restraint stress but increased responses to novel objects and food reward. In contrast, females did not have CVS-induced changes in infralimbic activity, which was partially dependent on ovarian status. Collectively, these results indicate that both male and female vmPFC pyramidal cells encode social, stress, and reward stimuli. However, chronic stress effects are sex-dependent and behavior-specific. Ultimately, these findings extend the understanding of chronic stress-induced prefrontal dysfunction and indicate that sex is a critical factor for cortical processing of affective stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pyfiber: an open source python library that facilitates the merge of operant behavior and fiber photometry- focus on intravenous self-administration</a></h4>

              
                Background- Advances in in vivo fluorescent imaging have exploded with the recent developments of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and fluorescent biosensors. Their use with a bulk imaging technique such as fiber photometry (FP) can be highly beneficial in identifying neuronal signatures in behavioral neuroscience experiments. Popularity of FP has grown rapidly. Initially applied to classical conditioning, its integration into operant behavior paradigms is progressing. However, in operant behavior, protocols can be complex including numerous scheduled events, while behavioral responses can occur in diverse and non-predictable manners. To optimize data processing and analysis, there is a need for a flexible tool to extract and relate behavioral and fiber photometry data occurring over operant sessions. New Method- Applied to cocaine intravenous self-administration (using ImetronicR polymodal apparati) and FP recordings in the prelimbic cortex (using Doric Lenses photometry system) in the rat, we established Pyfiber, an outline and open source data analysis python library that facilitates the merge of fiber photometry (using Doric Lenses) with operant behavior (using ImetronicR). It allows relating activity changes within a neuronal population to the various behavioral responses and events occurring during operant behavior. Results- We show some of the possibilities and benefits of the analytical tool Pyfiber, which helps to: 1. Extract the different types of events that occur in an operant session, 2. Extract and process the fiber photometry signals, 3. Select events of interest and align them to the corresponding fiber photometry signals, 4. Apply the most appropriate type of FP signal normalization and signal analysis according to the studied type of event or behavioral response, 5. Run data extraction and analysis on multiple individuals and sessions at the same time, 6. Collect results in an easily readable format for statistical analysis. From our data and through the use of Pyfiber, we show that we can successfully record and easily analyze calcium transients surrounding events occurring during a cocaine self-administration paradigm in the rat. Comparison with Existing Method(s)- While other analytical tools can be used for streamlined fiber photometry analysis, they are either too rigid and specific or too flexible, requiring extensive coding to properly fit the data sets. Additionally, current tools do not permit easy exploration of multiple types of events in parallel- something that is possible with Pyfiber. Conclusions- This work established an open source resource that facilitates the pairing of fiber photometry recordings (using Doric Lenses photometry system) with operant behavior (using ImetronicR polymodal apparati), setting a solid foundation in analyzing the relationship between different dimensions of operant behavior with fluorescent signals from brain regions of interest.

                We acquire perceptual skills through training to adapt ourself to the changing environment. Accomplishing an effective skill acquisition is a main purpose of perceptual learning research. However, different perceptual trainings may interfere with each other, and thus limit the application of perceptual learning outside of laboratories. Here, we trained human participants on an orientation discrimination task. We observed a proactive interference effect that the first training blocked the second training at its untrained location. This was a more pronounced effect than the well-known location specificity in perceptual learning. We introduced a short reactivation of the first training before the second training and successfully eliminated the proactive interference when the second training was inside the reconsolidation time window of the reactivated first training. Interestingly, we found that practicing an irrelevant task at the location of the second training immediately after the reactivation of the first training could also restore the effect of the second training but in a smaller magnitude, even if the second training was conducted outside of the reconsolidation window. These results demonstrated that reactivation could facilitate the integration of multiple perceptual trainings at two levels, depending on the activated representations during the reconsolidation process. It can integrate previously trained and untrained locations to release the training-induced attentional suppression or the different trainings at these locations to facilitate the generalization of training effects between them. The findings provide us with new insight into the roles of long-term memory mechanisms in perceptual learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disentangled multi-subject and social behavioral representations through a constrained subspace variational autoencoder (CS-VAE)</a></h4>

              
                Effectively modeling and quantifying behavior is essential for our understanding of the brain. Modeling behavior in naturalistic settings in social and multi-subject tasks in a unified manner remains a significant challenge. Modeling the behavior of different subjects performing the same task requires partitioning the behavioral data into features that are common across subjects, and others that are distinct to each subject. Modeling social interactions between multiple individuals in a freely-moving setting requires disentangling effects due to the individual as compared to social investigations. To achieve flexible disentanglement of behavior into interpretable latent variables with individual and across-subject or social components, we build on a semi-supervised approach to partition the behavioral subspace, and propose a novel regularization based on the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence to the model. Our model, known as the constrained subspace variational autoencoder (CS-VAE), successfully models distinct features of the behavioral videos across subjects, as well as continuously varying differences in social behavior. Our approach vastly facilitates the analysis of the resulting latent variables in downstream tasks such as uncovering disentangled behavioral motifs and the efficient decoding of a novel subject's behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An automated BIDS-App for brain segmentation of human fetal functional MRI data</a></h4>

              
                Fetal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers critical insight into the developing brain and could aid in predicting developmental outcomes. As the fetal brain is surrounded by heterogeneous tissue, it is not possible to use adult- or child-based segmentation toolboxes. Manually-segmented masks can be used to extract the fetal brain; however, this comes at significant time costs. Here, we present a new BIDS App for masking fetal fMRI, funcmasker-flex, that overcomes these issues with a robust 3D convolutional neural network (U-net) architecture implemented in an extensible and transparent Snakemake workflow. Open-access fetal fMRI data with manual brain masks from 159 fetuses (1103 total volumes) were used for training and testing the U-net model. We also tested generalizability of the model using 82 locally acquired functional scans from 19 fetuses, which included over 2300 manually segmented volumes. Dice metrics were used to compare performance of funcmasker-flex to the ground truth manually segmented volumes, and segmentations were consistently robust (all Dice metrics [&ge;]0.74). The tool is freely available and can be applied to any BIDS dataset containing fetal bold sequences. Funcmasker-flex reduces the need for manual segmentation, even when applied to novel fetal functional datasets, resulting in significant time-cost savings for performing fetal fMRI analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal assessment of water-reaching reveals altered cortical activity and fine motor coordination defects in a Huntington Disease model</a></h4>

              
                Huntington Disease (HD), caused by dominantly inherited expansions of a CAG repeat results in characteristic motor dysfunction. Although gross motor and balance defects have been extensively characterized in multiple HD mouse models using tasks such as rotarod, beam walking and gait analysis, little is known about forelimb deficits. Here we use a high-throughput alternating reward/non-reward water-reaching task conducted daily over ~2 months to simultaneously monitor forelimb impairment and mesoscale cortical changes in GCaMP activity, comparing female zQ175 (HD) and wildtype (WT) littermate mice, starting at ~5.5 months of age. Behavioral analysis of the water-reaching task reveals that HD mice, despite learning the water-reaching task as proficiently as WT mice, take longer to learn the alternating event sequence. Although WT mice displayed no significant changes in cortical activity and reaching trajectory throughout the testing period, HD mice exhibited an increase in cortical activity - especially in the secondary motor and retrosplenial cortices - over time, as well as longer and more variable reaching trajectories by ~7 months of age. HD mice also experienced a progressive reduction in successful performance rates. Tapered beam and rotarod tests before and/or after water-reaching assessment confirmed these early and manifest stages of HD characterized by the absence and presence of failed water-reaching trials, respectively. Reduced DARPP-32 (marker for striatal medium spiny neurons) expression in HD mice further confirmed disease pathology. The water-reaching task can be used to inform HD and potentially other movement disorder onset, therapeutic intervention windows and test drug efficacy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Canonical and Replicable Multi-Scale Intrinsic Connectivity Networks in 100k+ Resting-State fMRI Datasets</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has shown considerable promise for improving our understanding of brain function and characterizing various mental and cognitive states in the healthy and disordered brain. However, the lack of accurate and precise estimations of comparable functional patterns across datasets, individuals, and ever-changing brain states in a way that captures both individual variation and inter-subject correspondence limits the clinical utility of rsfMRI and its application to single-subject analyses. We posit that using reliable network templates and advanced group-informed network estimation approaches to accurately and precisely obtain individualized (dynamic) networks that retain cross-subject correspondence while maintaining subject-specific information is one potential solution to overcome the aforementioned barrier when considering cross-study comparability, independence of subject-level estimates, the limited data available in single studies, and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of rsfMRI. Toward this goal, we first obtained a reliable and replicable network template. We combined rsfMRI data of over 100k individuals across private and public datasets and selected around 58k that meet quality control (QC) criteria. We then applied multi-model-order independent component analysis (ICA) and subsampling to obtain reliable canonical intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) across multiple spatial scales. The selected ICNs (i.e., network templates) were also successfully replicated by independently analyzing the data that did not pass the QC criteria, highlighting the robustness of our adaptive template to data quality. We next studied the feasibility of estimating the corresponding subject-specific ICNs using a multivariate-spatially constrained ICA as an example of group-informed network estimation approaches. The results highlight that several factors, including ICNs themselves, data length, and spatial resolution, play key roles in successfully estimating the ICNs at the subject level. Large-scale ICNs, in general, require less data to achieve a specific level of spatial similarity with their templates (as well as within- and between-subject spatial similarity). Moreover, increasing data length can reduce an ICN's subject-level specificity, suggesting longer scans might not always be desirable. We also show spatial smoothing can alter results, and the positive linear relationship we observed between data length and spatial smoothness (we posit that it is at least partially due to averaging over intrinsic dynamics or individual variation) indicates the importance of considering this factor in studies such as those focused on optimizing data length. Finally, the consistency in the spatial similarity between ICNs estimated using the full-length of data and subset of it across different data lengths may suggest that the lower within-subject spatial similarity in shorter data lengths is not necessarily only defined by lower reliability in ICN estimates; rather, it can also be an indication of brain dynamics (i.e., different subsets of data may reflect different ICN dynamics), and as we increase the data length, the result approaches the average (also known as static) ICN pattern, and therefore loses its distinctiveness.

                The lateralisation of 8-12 Hz alpha activity is a canonical signature of human spatial cognition that is typically studied under strict fixation requirements. Yet, even during attempted fixation, the brain produces small involuntary eye movements known as microsaccades. Here we report how spontaneous microsaccades -- made in the absence of incentives to look elsewhere -- can themselves drive transient lateralisation of EEG alpha power according to microsaccade direction. This transient lateralisation of posterior alpha power occurs similarly following start and return microsaccades and is driven by increased alpha power ipsilateral to microsaccade direction. This reveals new links between spontaneous microsaccades and human electrophysiological brain activity, and highlights how microsaccades are an important factor to consider in studies relating alpha activity to spatial cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic tools that target mechanoreceptors produce reliable labeling of bladder afferents</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensitive bladder sensory neurons are critical for sensing bladder distention, but their role in bladder pain and bladder pathology is poorly understood, due in part, to the challenges of identifying mechanoreceptors in tissue sections. A lot of what is known about how disease alters sensory innervation of the bladder comes from studies that traditionally focus on nociceptive nerve terminals. In seeking tools to characterize the role of non-nociceptive afferents in the bladder, we first examined neurofilament heavy (NFH), a marker for medium to large-diameter myelinated A fibers, in combination with the common marker for peptidergic nociceptors, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). While there was partial overlap between NFH and CGRP, 87% of NFH fibers were CGRP-negative, underscoring the abundance of non-nociceptive A fibers nerve terminals in the bladder. Two mouse lines that have been used for genetic labeling of mechanoreceptors of the skin were tested for their ability to label bladder afferents. Once crossed to Cre-dependent reporter lines, tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) TrkBCreER2 mice can be used to label A-delta mechanoreceptors while receptor tyrosine kinase ret protooncogene (Ret) RetCreER2 mice can label a combination of A-beta mechanoreceptors and non-peptidergic nociceptors in adult mice (late Ret). Both mouse lines produced successful labeling of bladder nerve terminals demonstrating partial overlap with NFH and minimal overlap with CGRP. Thus, we have identified new genetic strategies to investigate CGRP-negative subpopulations of bladder afferents that remain largely uncharacterized in studies that target peptidergic nociceptors. These tools can help elucidate the role of mechanosensitive afferents in bladder pathophysiology and urologic chronic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multichannel neural spike sorting with spike reduction and positional feature</a></h4>

              
                Sorting neural voltages measured from a multichannel neural probe to extract the single unit activities of neuronal firing, especially in real-time, remains a significant technical challenge, largely due to the large amount of acquired data and the technical difficulties involved in processing and classifying these neural spikes promptly. Most neural spike sorting algorithms focus on sorting neural spikes post hoc for high sorting accuracy, and reducing the processing time generally is not the chief concern. Here we report on two signal processing modifications to our previously developed single-channel real-time spike sorting (Enhanced Growing Neural Gas) algorithm, which is largely based on graph network. Duplicated neural spikes were eliminated and represented by the neural spike with the strongest signal profile, significantly reducing the amount of neural data to be processed. In addition, the channel from which the representing neural spike was recorded was used as an additional feature to differentiate between neural spikes recorded from different neurons having similar temporal features. With these two modifications, the Graph nEtwork Multichannel (GEMsort) neural spike sorting algorithm can rapidly sort neural spikes without requiring significant computer processing power and system memory storage. The parallel processing architecture of GEMsort is particularly suitable for digital hardware implementation to improve processing speed and recording channel scalability. Multichannel synthetic neural spikes and actual neural recordings with Neuropixels probes were used to evaluate the sorting accuracies of the GEMsort algorithm.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ultrafast (>400 Hz) network oscillations induced in thalamorecipient cortical layers by optogenetic activation of thalamocortical axons</a></h4>

              
                Oscillations of extracellular voltage, reflecting synchronous rhythmic activity in large populations of neurons, are a ubiquitous feature in the mammalian brain and are thought to subserve critical, if not fully understood cognitive functions. Oscillations at different frequency bands are hallmarks of specific brain or behavioral states. At the higher end of the scale, ultrafast (400-600 Hz) oscillations in the somatosensory cortex, in response to peripheral stimulation, were observed in human and a handful of animal studies; however, their synaptic basis and functional significance remain largely unexplored. Here we report that brief optogenetic activation of thalamocortical axons ex-vivo elicited precisely reproducible, ~410 Hz local field potential wavelets ("ripplets") in middle layers of mouse somatosensory (barrel) cortex. Fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons were exquisitely synchronized with each other and fired spike bursts in anti-phase with ripplets, while excitatory neurons fired only 1-2 spikes per stimulus. Both subtypes received shared excitatory inputs at ripplet frequency, and bursts in layer 5 FS cells required intact connection with layer 4, suggesting that layer 4 excitatory cells were driving FS bursts in both layers. Ripplets may be a ubiquitous cortical response to exceptionally salient sensory stimuli, and could provide increased bandwidth for encoding and transmitting sensory information. Lastly, optogenetically-induced ripplets are a uniquely accessible model system for studying synaptic mechanisms of fast and ultrafast oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Random Tactile Noise Stimulation Reveals Beta-Rhythmic Impulse Response Function of the Somatosensory System</a></h4>

              
                Both passive tactile stimulation and motor actions result in dynamic changes in beta-band (15-30 Hz Hz) oscillations over somatosensory cortex. Similar to alpha-band (8-12 Hz) power decrease in the visual system, beta-band power also decreases following stimulation of the somatosensory system. This relative suppression of alpha and beta oscillations is generally interpreted as an increase in cortical excitability. Here, next to traditional single-pulse stimuli, we employed a random intensity continuous right index finger tactile stimulation (white noise), which enabled us to uncover an impulse response function (IRF) of the somatosensory system. Contrary to previous findings, we demonstrate a burst-like initial increase rather than decrease of beta activity following white noise stimulation (human participants, N = 18, 8 female). These beta bursts, on average, lasted for 3 cycles and their frequency was correlated with resonant frequency of somatosensory cortex, as measured by a multi-frequency steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) paradigm. Furthermore, beta-band bursts shared spectro-temporal characteristics with evoked and resting-state beta oscillations. Taken together, our findings not only reveal a novel oscillatory signature of somatosensory processing that mimics the previously reported visual IRFs, but also point to a common oscillatory generator underlying spontaneous beta bursts in the absence of tactile stimulation and phase-locked beta bursts following stimulation, the frequency of which is determined by the resonance properties of the somatosensory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ApoE4 causes severe COVID-19 outcomes via downregulation of ACE2</a></h4>

              
                The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); host cell entry by this virus relies on the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on cell membranes. In addition to serving as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 was originally discovered as a protective factor in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that catalyses the degradation of angiotensin II (Ang II) to Ang 1-7, which is involved in multiple organ pathology. Recent genetic and clinical studies reported that ApoE4 expression is associated with increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of severe COVID-19, but the underlying mechanism is currently unclear. In the present study, by using immunofluorescence staining, molecular dynamics simulations, proximity ligation assay (PLA) and coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) combined with a biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay, we found that ApoE interacts with both the spike protein and ACE2 but does not show obvious isoform-dependent binding effects. These data suggest that ApoE4 increases SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in a manner that may not depend on differential interactions with the spike protein or ACE2. Importantly, further immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining results showed that ApoE4 significantly downregulates ACE2 protein expression in vitro and in vivo and subsequently decreases the conversion of Ang II to Ang 1-7, which could worsen tissue lesions; these findings provide a possible explain by which ApoE4 exacerbates COVID-19 disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A matter of availability: Neural representations of task-relevant stimulus features are sharper when stimuli are memorized rather than perceived.</a></h4>

              
                Our visual environment is relatively stable over time and an optimized visual system ought to capitalize on this by not devoting any representational resources to objects that are still present. Subjective experience, however, suggests that externally available (i.e., perceived) information is more strongly represented in neural signals than memorized information. To distinguish between these possibilities, we use EEG multivariate pattern analysis to quantify the strength of representation of task-relevant features (color or spatial frequency) in anticipation of a change-detection task. Perceptual availability was manipulated between experimental blocks by either keeping the stimulus on the screen during a two second delay period (perception) or removing it shortly after its initial presentation for the same time period (memory). We find that task-relevant (i.e., attended) memorized features are more strongly represented than irrelevant features. More importantly, we find significantly weaker representations for available (perceived and attended) features than for unavailable (memorized and attended) features. Contrary to what subjective experience suggests, our findings demonstrate that vividly perceived and attended stimuli elicit weaker neural representations (in terms of detectable multivariate information) than stimuli maintained in visual working memory. We hypothesize that an efficient visual system spends little of its limited resources on the internal representation of information that is externally available anyway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictive neural representations of naturalistic dynamic input</a></h4>

              
                Our capacity to interact with our dynamic world in a timely manner (e.g., catch a ball) suggests that our brain generates predictions of unfolding external dynamics. While theories assume such neural predictions, empirical evidence typically only captures a snapshot or indirect consequence of prediction, and uses simple static stimuli of which predictability is manipulated. However, the rich dynamics of predictive representations remain largely unexplored. We present a novel dynamic extension to representational similarity analysis (RSA) that uses temporally variable models to capture naturalistic dynamic stimuli, and demonstrate both lagged and predictive neural representations in source-reconstructed MEG data. Interestingly, the predictive representations show a hierarchical pattern, such that higher-level stimulus features are predicted earlier in time, while lower-level features are predicted closer in time to the actual sensory input. This promising new approach opens the door for addressing important outstanding questions on how our brain represents and predicts our dynamic world.

	<p>Temporal interference transcranial alternating current stimulation (TI-tACS) is a new technique of noninvasive brain stimulation. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of TI-tACS in stimulating brain areas in a selective manner. However, its safety in modulating human brain neurons is still untested. In this study, 38 healthy adults were recruited to undergo a series of neurological and neuropsychological measurements regarding safety concerns before and after active (2 mA, 20/70 Hz, 30 min) or sham (0 mA, 0 Hz, 30 min) TI-tACS. The neurological and neuropsychological measurements included electroencephalography (EEG), serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT), an abbreviated version of the California Computerized Assessment Package (A-CalCAP), a revised version of the Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS-R), a self-assessment scale (SAS), and a questionnaire about adverse effects (AEs). We found no significant difference between the measurements of the active and sham TI-tACS groups. Meanwhile, no serious or intolerable adverse effects were reported or observed in the active stimulation group of 19 participants. These results support that TI-tACS is safe and tolerable in terms of neurological and neuropsychological functions and adverse effects for use in human brain stimulation studies under typical transcranial electric stimulation (TES) conditions (2 mA, 20/70 Hz, 30 min).</p>

	<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a very common disorder in children and adults. A connection with sleep disorders, and above all, disorders of the circadian rhythm are the subject of research and debate. The circadian system can be represented on different levels. There have been a variety of studies examining 24-h rhythms at the behavioral and endocrine level. At the molecular level, these rhythms are based on a series of feedback loops of core clock genes and proteins. In this paper, we compared the circadian rhythms at the behavioral, endocrine, and molecular levels between children with ADHD and age- and BMI-matched controls, complementing the previous data in adults. In a minimally invasive setting, sleep was assessed via a questionnaire, actigraphy was used to determine the motor activity and light exposure, saliva samples were taken to assess the 24-h profiles of cortisol and melatonin, and buccal mucosa swaps were taken to assess the expression of the clock genes BMAL1 and PER2. We found significant group differences in sleep onset and sleep duration, cortisol secretion profiles, and in the expression of both clock genes. Our data suggest that the analysis of circadian molecular rhythms may provide a new approach for diagnosing ADHD in children and adults.</p>

	<p>Background: Epilepsy (Ep) is a chronic neural disease. The diagnosis of epilepsy depends on detailed seizure history and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) examinations. The automatic recognition of epileptic EEG is an artificial intelligence application developed from machine learning (ML). Purpose: This study compares the classification effects of two kinds of classifiers by controlling the EEG data source and characteristic values. Method: All EEG data were collected by GSN HydroCel 256 leads and high-density EEG from Xiangya Third Hospital. This study used time-domain features (mean, kurtosis and skewness processed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and three IMFs), a frequency-domain feature (power spectrum density, PSD) and a non-linear feature (Shannon entropy). Support vector machine (SVM) and gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT) classifiers were used to recognize epileptic EEG. Result: The result of the SVM classifier showed an accuracy of 72.00%, precision of 73.98%, and an F1_score of 82.28%. Meanwhile, the result of the GBDT classifier showed a sensitivity of 98.57%, precision of 89.13%, F1_score of 93.40%, and an AUC of 0.9119. Conclusion: The comparison of GBDT and SVM by controlling the variables of the feature values and parameters of a classifier is presented. GBDT obtained the better classification accuracy (90.00%) and F1_score (93.40%).</p>

	<p>Microglia, the major immune cells in the brain, mediate neuroinflammation, increased oxidative stress, and impaired neurotransmission in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), in which most AD risk genes are highly expressed. In microglia, due to the limitations of current single-omics data analysis, risk genes, the regulatory mechanisms, the mechanisms of action of immune responses and the exploration of drug targets for AD immunotherapy are still unclear. Therefore, we proposed a method to integrate multi-omics data based on the construction of gene regulatory networks (GRN), by combining weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) with single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC). This enables snRNA-seq data and bulkRNA-seq data to obtain data on the deeper intermolecular regulatory relationships, related genes, and the molecular mechanisms of immune-cell action. In our approach, not only were central transcription factors (TF) STAT3, CEBPB, SPI1, and regulatory mechanisms identified more accurately than with single-omics but also immunotherapy targeting central TFs to drugs was found to be significantly different between patients. Thus, in addition to providing new insights into the potential regulatory mechanisms and pathogenic genes of AD microglia, this approach can assist clinicians in making the most rational treatment plans for patients with different risks; it also has significant implications for identifying AD immunotherapy targets and targeting microglia-associated immune drugs.</p>

	<p>Background: Emergence delirium (ED) usually occurs in children after surgery with an incidence of 10&amp;amp;minus;80%. Though ED is mostly self-limited, its potential injuries cannot be ignored. Whether electroencephalography (EEG)-parameter-guided anesthesia could reduce the incidence of ED in pediatric surgery has not been fully discussed to date. Methods: Fifty-four boys aged 2&amp;amp;ndash;12 years undergoing elective hypospadias surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia were selected. In the EEG-parameter-guided group (E group), sevoflurane was used for anesthesia induction and was maintained by titrating the spectral edge frequency (SEF) to 10&amp;amp;ndash;15 and combining the monitoring of density spectral array (DSA) power spectra and raw EEG. While in the control group (C group), anesthesiologists were blinded to the SedLine screen (including SEF, DSA, and raw EEG) and adjusted the intraoperative drug usage according to their experience. Patients with a Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score &amp;amp;gt; 10 were diagnosed with ED, while patients with a PAED score &amp;amp;gt; 2 were diagnosed with emergence agitation (EA). Results: Finally, a total of 37 patients were included in this trial. The incidence of ED in the E group was lower than in the C group (5.6% vs. 36.8%; p = 0.04), while the incidence of EA was similar in the two groups (61% vs. 78.9%; p = 0.48). Intraoperative parameters including remifentanil dosage and the decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were not different between the two groups (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05), but the mean end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (EtSevo) was lower in the E group than in the C group (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Moreover, during PACU stay, the extubation time and discharge time of the groups were similar, while the PAED scores within 5 min from extubation and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scores within 30 min from extubation were lower in the E group than in the C group. Conclusion: EEG-parameter-guided anesthesia management reduced the incidence of ED in children. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to obtain more convincing results.</p>

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in an established risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. In this report, we used the Closed Head Injury Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) to study the effects of a single moderate-severe TBI in rTg4510 mice, a mouse model of tauopathy. Fifteen male rTg4510 mice were impacted at 4.0J at 4-mo of age using interfaced CHIMERA and compared to sham controls. Immediately after injury, moderate-severe TBI induced significant mortality (7/15; 47%), and a prolonged duration of loss of righting reflex. At 2-mo post-injury, surviving mice displayed significant histological evidence of microgliosis (Iba1) and axonal injury (Neurosilver). Western blotting showed that TBI mice had a reduced p-GSK-3{beta} (S9):GSK-3{beta} ratio, suggesting greater tau kinase activity. However, tauopathy in surviving TBI mice showed a divergent response, with 3/8 mice having a very low level of tau protein in brain lysates (i.e. lower than sham), and were thus analyzed separately from the other 5/8 TBI mice that maintained the expected level of total tau. Compared to sham controls, TBI mice with normal tau levels had increased p-tau (PHF1 and AT8), increased autophagolysosome accumulation (p62 and Cathepsin D) and decreased hippocampal size. These findings were not observed in TBI mice with low total tau levels. These observations suggest that TBI leads to chronic white matter injury and altered GSK-3{beta} activity. However, post-injury tauopathy and autophagolysosome accumulation diverged in surviving mice through mechanisms that remain to be defined.

                Behavioral flexibility refers to the ability to adjust behavioral strategies in response to changing environmental contingencies. A major hypothesis in the field posits that the activity of neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) plays an important role in mediating behavioral flexibility. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel context-dependent bilateral tactile detection task where mice responded to left and right whisker deflections in a rule-dependent manner and exhibited varying degrees of flexible switching behavior. Recording from optogenetically-tagged neurons in the LC during task performance revealed a prominent graded correlation between baseline LC activity and behavioral flexibility, where higher baseline activity following a rule change was associated with faster behavioral switching to the new rule. Increasing baseline LC activity with optogenetic activation improved task performance and accelerated task switching. Overall, our study provides strong evidence to demonstrate that LC activity mediates behavioral flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of the alpha rhythm is linked to visual white matter pathways and visual detection performance</a></h4>

              
                Alpha is the strongest electrophysiological rhythm in awake humans at rest. Despite its predominance in the EEG signal, strong variations can be observed in alpha properties during development, with an increase of alpha frequency over childhood and adulthood. Here we tested the hypothesis that these changes of alpha rhythm are related to the maturation of visual white matter pathways. We capitalized on a large dMRI-EEG dataset (dMRI n=2,747, EEG n=2,561) of children and adolescents (age range: 5-21 years old) and showed that maturation of the optic radiation specifically accounts for developmental changes of alpha frequency. Behavioral analyses also confirmed that variations of alpha frequency are related to maturational changes in visual perception. The present findings demonstrate the close link between developmental variations in white matter tissue properties, electrophysiological responses, and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of stimulus rate and periodicity on auditory cortical entrainment to continuous sounds</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms underlying the exogenous coding and neural entrainment to rapid auditory stimuli have seen a recent surge of interest. However, few studies have characterized how parametric changes in stimulus presentation alter entrained responses. Applying inter-trial phase-locking (ITPL) and phase-locking value (PLV) analyses applied to high-density human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, we investigated the degree to which the brain entrains to speech vs. non-speech (i.e., click) sounds within and across tokens. Passive cortico-acoustic tracking was investigated in N=24 normal young adults utilizing EEG time-frequency and source analyses that isolated neural activity stemming from both auditory temporal cortices. We parametrically manipulated the rate and periodicity of repetitive, continuous speech and click stimuli to investigate how speed and jitter in ongoing sounds stream affect oscillatory entrainment. Both stimulus domains showed rightward hemisphere asymmetry in phase-locking strength with stronger and earlier responses to speech vs. clicks. Neuronal synchronization to speech was enhanced at 4.5 Hz (the putative universal rate of speech) and showed a differential pattern to that of clicks, particularly at higher rates. Phase-locking to speech decreased with increasing jitter but entrainment to speech remained superior to clicks. Surprisingly, click were invariant to periodicity manipulations. Our findings provide evidence that the brain's neural entrainment to complex sounds is enhanced and more sensitized when processing speech relative to non-speech sounds. That this specialization is apparent even under passive listening suggests a priority of the auditory system for synchronizing to behaviorally-relevant signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell type-specific basal forebrain GABAergic neuronal activity with olfactory task performance, learning, and decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Sensory perception relies on the flexible detection and interpretation of stimuli across variable contexts, conditions, and behavioral states. The basal forebrain is a hub for behavioral state regulation, supplying dense cholinergic and GABAergic projections to various brain regions involved in sensory processing. Of GABAergic neurons in the basal forebrain, parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) subtypes serve opposing roles regulating behavioral states. To elucidate the role of basal forebrain circuits in sensory-guided behavior, we investigated GABAergic signaling dynamics during odor-guided decision-making. We used fiber photometry to record cell type-specific basal forebrain activity during an odor discrimination task and correlate temporal patterns of PV and SST neuronal activity with olfactory task performance. We found that PV-expressing GABAergic neurons are activated by odors and are selectively suppressed by reward. However, SST-expressing GABAergic neurons are activated during both odor and reward delivery. Notably, odor and reward responses of PV and SST neurons are uniquely correlated with behavioral measures of odor discrimination and decision bias. Additionally, as mice undergo discrimination learning, the magnitude of reward-related excitation decreases in SST neurons, while reward-related suppression increases in PV neurons. Finally, we show that chemogenetic inhibition of SST neurons alters decision bias to favor reward-seeking. These results suggest that subtypes of GABAergic basal forebrain neurons are differentially involved in decision-making, and that their bidirectional activity impacts decision making during olfactory guided behavior.

                Brain tissue microstructure is characterized by heterogeneous diffusivity and transversal relaxation rates. Standard diffusion MRI (dMRI) is acquired using a single echo time (TE) and only provides information about heterogeneous diffusivity in the underlying tissue. Combined relaxation diffusion MRI (rdMR) integrates dMRI with multiple TEs to probe the coupling between relaxation rate and diffusivity. This work introduces a method to model rdMRI data signals by characterizing the apparent relaxation rate related to dMRI with different b-values. The proposed approach can extrapolate dMRI signals to ultra-long or ultra-short TEs to increase or reduce signals from intra-neurite water to improve the characterization of neurite microstructure without solving multi-compartment models. The performance of the proposed method was examined using an in vivo dataset acquired from a clinical scanner to estimate neurite sizes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural responses to movie naturalistic stimuli are related to listening demand in cochlear implant users</a></h4>

              
                There is a weak relationship between clinical and self-reported speech perception outcomes in cochlear implant (CI) listeners. Such poor correspondence may be due to differences in clinical and "real-world" listening environments and stimuli. Speech sounds in the real world are often accompanied by visual cues, background environmental noise and is generally in the context of a connected conversation. The aims of this study were to determine if brain responses to naturalistic speech could index speech perception and listening demand in CI users. Accordingly, we recorded high density EEG while CI users listened/watched a naturalistic stimulus (i.e., the television show, "The Office"). We used continuous EEG to quantify "speech neural tracking" (i.e., TRFs, temporal response functions) to the television show audio track and additionally 8-12 Hz (alpha) brain rhythms commonly related to listening effort. Background noise at three different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), +5, +10, and +15 dB were presented to vary the difficulty of following the television show mimicking a natural noisy environment. The task included an additional condition of audio-only (no video). After each condition, participants subjectively rated listening demand and the degree of words and conversations they felt they could understand. Fifteen CI users reported progressively higher degrees of listening demand and less words and conversation with increasing background noise. Listening demand and conversation understanding in the audio-only condition was comparable to that of the highest noise condition (+5 dB). The addition of the background noise reduced the degree of speech neural tracking. Mixed effect modeling showed that listening demand and conversation understanding were correlated to cortical speech tracking such that high demand and low conversation understanding lower associated with lower amplitude TRFs. In the high noise condition, greater listening demand was negatively correlated to parietal alpha power such that higher demand was related to lower alpha power. No significant correlations were observed between TRF/alpha and clinical speech perception scores. These results are similar to previous findings showing little relationship between speech perception and quality of life in CI users. However, the physiological responses to complex natural speech may anticipate aspects of quality-of-life measures such as self-perceived listening demand.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of neuropathic pain by microglial Orai1 channels</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are important mediators of neuroinflammation that underlies neuropathic pain. However, the molecular checkpoints controlling microglial reactivity are not well-understood. We investigated the role of Orai1 channels for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation following nerve injury and find that deletion of Orai1 in microglia attenuates Ca2+ signaling and the production of inflammatory cytokines by proalgesic agonists. Conditional deletion of Orai1 attenuated microglia proliferation in the dorsal horn, spinal cytokines levels, and potentiation of excitatory neurotransmission following peripheral nerve injury. These cellular effects were accompanied by mitigation of pain hyperalgesia in Orai1 knockout mice. A small-molecule Orai1 inhibitor, CM4620, similarly mitigated allodynia in male mice. Surprisingly, these protective effects were not seen in female mice, revealing striking sexual dimorphism in Orai1 regulation of microglial reactivity and hyperalgesia. These findings indicate that Orai1 channels are key regulators of the sexually dimorphic role of microglia for the neuroinflammation that underlies neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Arc ubiquitination regulates endoplasmic reticulum-mediated Ca2+ release and CaMKII signaling</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity relies on rapid, yet spatially precise signaling to alter synaptic strength. Arc is a brain enriched protein that is rapidly expressed during learning-related behaviors and is essential for regulating metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD). We previously showed that disrupting the ubiquitination capacity of Arc enhances mGluR-LTD; however, the mechanism by which this occurs and its consequences on other mGluR-mediated signaling events is unknown. Here we show that disrupting Arc ubiquitination on key amino acid residues leads to derangements in Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during pharmacological activation of Group I mGluRs. These alterations were observed in all neuronal subregions except secondary branchpoints. Deficits in Arc ubiquitination increased Arc self-association and enhanced its interaction with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIb (CaMKIIb) and constitutively active forms of CaMKII. Notably, these interactions were also excluded at secondary branchpoints. Finally, disruptions in Arc ubiquitination were found to increase Arc interaction with the integral ER protein Calnexin. These results suggest a previously unknown role for Arc ubiquitination in the fine tuning of ER-mediated Ca2+ signaling that is needed for mGluR-LTD, which, in turn, regulates CaMKII-dependent regulation of Arc.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assembly of neuron- and radial glial cell-derived extracellular matrix molecules promotes radial migration of developing cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Radial neuronal migration is a key neurodevelopmental event for proper cortical laminar organization. Newly born neurons migrate in a complex three-dimensional environment generated by the extracellular matrix (ECM), secreted factors, and neighboring cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the ECM controls radial migration remain largely unknown. We herein identified neurocan (NCAN), a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, as a major chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan produced by developing cortical neurons. NCAN binds to both radial glial cell-derived tenascin-C (TNC) and hyaluronan (HA), a large linear polysaccharide, forming a ternary complex of NCAN, TNC, and HA. Developing cortical neurons make contact with the ternary complex during migration. The enzymatic or genetic disruption of the ternary complex impairs radial migration by suppressing the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Furthermore, TNC in the ternary complex promotes neuronal morphological maturation. The present results provide evidence for the cooperative role of neuron- and radial glial cell-derived ECM molecules in cortical development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptome and chromatin accessibility landscapes across 25 distinct human brain regions expand the susceptibility gene set for neuropsychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                Brain region- and cell-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic molecular features are associated with heritability for neuropsychiatric traits, but a systematic view, considering cortical and subcortical regions, is lacking. Here, we provide an atlas of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei across 25 distinct human cortical and subcortical brain regions from 6 neurotypical controls. We identified extensive gene expression and chromatin accessibility differences across brain regions, including variation in alternative promoter-isoform usage and enhancer-promoter interactions. Genes with distinct promoter-isoform usage across brain regions are strongly enriched for neuropsychiatric disease risk variants. Using an integrative approach, we characterized the function of the brain region-specific chromatin co-accessibility and gene-coexpression modules that are robustly associated with genetic risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, we identified a novel set of genes that is enriched for disease risk variants but is independent of cell-type specific gene expression and known susceptibility pathways. Our results provide a valuable resource for studying molecular regulation across multiple regions of the human brain and suggest a unique contribution of epigenetic modifications from subcortical areas to neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Role of the Posterior Medial Network in Language Comprehension: Dissociating Construction of Episodic versus Semantic Representations</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension involves the construction of complex mental representations, i.e., event representations, reflecting current events or situation models. The construction of these representations requires manipulation of both semantic and episodic content and has been widely associated with the functioning of the posterior medial network, a subsystem of the default network. However, it is still unknown the extent to which activity in posterior medial network reflects construction of the variable episodic versus semantic content of event representations. In this fMRI study, we establish the unique neural correlates of (1) episodic richness and (2) semantic coherence measured during a narrative reading task. Interestingly, we observed a functional fractionation within the posterior medial network in terms of brain regions whose activity was modulated by semantic or episodic content. Specifically, the number of episodic details in the narratives modulated the activity in the left angular gyrus and the retrosplenial cortex/ventral posterior cingulate cortex. Semantic coherence, in contrast, modulated neural responses in the right anterior temporal lobe/middle temporal gyrus, but also in brain regions within the posterior medial network, such as the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex. These results provide the first demonstration of functional dissociations within the posterior medial network in terms of brain regions involved in the construction of semantic versus episodic representational content during a language comprehension task.

	<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary fatty acid (FA) saturation and carbon chain length on brain bile acid (BA) metabolism and neuronal number in a pig model of pediatric NAFLD. Thirty 20-day-old Iberian pigs, pair-housed in pens, were randomly assigned to receive one of three hypercaloric diets for 10 weeks: (1) lard-enriched (LAR; n = 5 pens), (2) olive-oil-enriched (OLI, n = 5), and (3) coconut-oil-enriched (COC; n = 5). Pig behavior and activity were analyzed throughout the study. All animals were euthanized on week 10 and frontal cortex (FC) samples were collected for immunohistochemistry, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses. Data were analyzed by multivariate and univariate statistics. No differences were observed in relative brain weight, neuronal number, or cognitive functioning between diets. Pig activity and FC levels of neuroprotective secondary BAs and betaine decreased in the COC and OLI groups compared with LAR, and paralleled the severity of NAFLD. In addition, OLI-fed pigs showed downregulation of genes involved in neurotransmission, synaptic transmission, and nervous tissue development. Similarly, COC-fed pigs showed upregulation of neurogenesis and myelin repair genes, which caused the accumulation of medium-chain acylcarnitines in brain tissue. In conclusion, our results indicate that secondary BA levels in the FCs of NAFLD pigs are affected by dietary FA composition and are associated with metabolic and transcriptomic markers of brain injury. Dietary interventions that aim to replace saturated FAs by medium-chain or monounsaturated FAs in high-fat hypercaloric diets may have a negative effect on brain health in NAFLD patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association of presynaptic loss with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Increased presynaptic dysfunction measured by CSF growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43) may be observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how CSF GAP43 increases relate to AD-core pathologies, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline in AD remains further investigation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 731 elderly adults with baseline β-amyloid (Aβ) PET, CSF GAP43, CSF phosphorylated tau181 (p-Tau<sub>181</sub>) and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and longitudinal residual hippocampal volume (rHCV) and cognitive assessments. Among them, 377 individuals had longitudinal FDG PET, and 326 individuals had simultaneous longitudinal CSF GAP43, Aβ PET, and CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> data. We compared baseline and slopes of CSF GAP43 among different stages of AD as well as their associations with Aβ PET, CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>, rHCV, FDG PET, and cognition cross-sectionally and longitudinally.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Regardless of Aβ positivity and clinical diagnosis, CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>-positive individuals showed higher CSF GAP43 concentrations (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and faster rates of CSF GAP43 increases (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) compared to the CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>-negative individuals. Moreover, higher CSF GAP43 concentrations and faster rates of CSF GAP43 increases were strongly related to CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> independent of Aβ PET. They were related to more rapid hippocampal atrophy, hypometabolism, and cognitive decline (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and predicted the progression from MCI to dementia (area under the curve (AUC) for baseline, 0.704; AUC for slope, 0.717) over a median four years of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tau aggregations rather than Aβ plaques primarily drive presynaptic dysfunction measured by CSF GAP43, which may lead to sequential neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AD or neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep problems are prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), can be observed before diagnosis, and are associated with increased restricted and repetitive behaviors. Therefore, sleep abnormalities may be a core feature of the disorder, but the developmental trajectory remains unknown. Animal models provide a unique opportunity to understand sleep ontogenesis in ASD. Previously we showed that adult mice with a truncation in the high-confidence ASD gene <i>Shank3</i> (Shank3<sup>∆C</sup>) recapitulate the clinical sleep phenotype. In this study we used longitudinal electro-encephalographic (EEG) recordings to define, for the first time, changes in sleep from weaning to young adulthood in an ASD mouse model. We show that Shank3<sup>∆C</sup> male mice sleep less overall throughout their lifespan, have increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep early in life despite significantly reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and have abnormal responses to increased sleep pressure that emerge during a specific developmental period. We demonstrate that the ability to fall asleep quickly in response to sleep loss develops normally between 24 and 30 days in mice. However, mutants are unable to reduce sleep latency after periods of prolonged waking and maintain the same response to sleep loss regardless of age. This phenomenon seems independent of homeostatic NREM sleep slow-wave dynamics. Overall, our study recapitulates both preclinical models and clinical studies showing that reduced sleep is consistently associated with ASD and suggests that problems falling asleep may reflect abnormal development of sleep and arousal mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha oscillations reflect similar mapping mechanisms for localizing touch on hands and tools</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have suggested that tools become incorporated into a representation of our body. A prominent hypothesis suggests that our brain re-uses body-based computations when we use tools. However, little is known about how this is implemented at the neural level. Here we used the ability to localize touch on both tools and body parts as a case study to fill this gap. Neural oscillations in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) frequency bands are involved in mapping touch on the body in distinct reference frames. Alpha activity reflects the mapping of touch in external coordinates, whereas beta activity reflects the mapping of touch in skin-centered coordinates. Here, we aimed at pinpointing the role of these oscillations during tool-extended sensing. We recorded participants' oscillatory activity while tactile stimuli were applied to either hands or the tips of hand-held rods. The posture of the hands/tool-tips was uncrossed or crossed at participants' body midline in order for us to disentangle brain responses related to different coordinate systems. We found that alpha-band activity was modulated similarly across postures when localizing touch on hands and on tools, reflecting the position of touch in external space. Source reconstruction also indicated a similar network of cortical regions involved for tools and hands. Our findings strongly suggest that the brain uses similar oscillatory mechanisms for mapping touch on the body and tools, supporting the idea of neural processes being repurposed for tool-use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Adaptation and Fractional Dynamics as a Window to Underlying Neural Excitability</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between macroscale electrophysiological recordings and the dynamics of underlying neural activity remains unclear. We have previously shown that low frequency EEG activity (<1 Hz) is decreased at the seizure onset zone (SOZ), while higher frequency activity (1-50 Hz) is increased. These changes result in power spectral densities (PSDs) with flattened slopes near the SOZ, which are assumed to be areas of increased excitability. We wanted to understand possible mechanisms underlying PSD changes in brain regions of increased excitability. We hypothesize that these observations are consistent with changes in adaptation within the neural circuit. We developed a theoretical framework and tested the effect of adaptation mechanisms, such as spike frequency adaptation and synaptic depression, on excitability and PSDs using filter-based neural mass models and conductance-based models. We compared the contribution of single timescale adaptation and multiple timescale adaptation. We found that adaptation with multiple timescales alters the PSDs. Multiple timescales of adaptation can approximate fractional dynamics, a form of calculus related to power laws, history dependence, and non-integer order derivatives. Coupled with input changes, these dynamics changed circuit responses in unexpected ways. Increased input without synaptic depression increases broadband power. However, increased input with synaptic depression may decrease power. The effects of adaptation were most pronounced for low frequency activity (< 1Hz). Increased input combined with a loss of adaptation yielded reduced low frequency activity and increased higher frequency activity, consistent with clinical EEG observations from SOZs. Spike frequency adaptation and synaptic depression, two forms of multiple timescale adaptation, affect low frequency EEG and the slope of PSDs. These neural mechanisms may underlie changes in EEG activity near the SOZ and relate to neural hyperexcitability. Neural adaptation may be evident in macroscale electrophysiological recordings and provide a window to understanding neural circuit excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociated amplitude and phase effects of alpha oscillation in a nested structure of rhythm- and sequence-based temporal expectation</a></h4>

              
                The human brain can utilize various information to form temporal expectation and optimize perceptual performance. Here we show dissociated amplitude and phase effects of pre-stimulus alpha oscillation in a nested structure of rhythm- and sequence-based expectation. A visual stream of rhythmic stimuli was presented in a fixed sequence such that their temporal positions could be predicted by either the low-frequency rhythm, the sequence, or the combination. The behavioral modelling indicated that rhythmic and sequence information additively led to increased accumulation of sensory evidence and alleviated threshold for the perceptual discrimination of the expected stimulus. The electroencephalographical (EEG) results showed that the alpha amplitude was dominated by rhythmic information, with the amplitude fluctuating in the same frequency of the oscillation entrained by the rhythmic information (i.e., phase-amplitude coupling). The alpha phase, however, was affected by both rhythmic and sequence information. Importantly, rhythm-based expectation improved the perceptual performance by decreasing the alpha amplitude, whereas sequence-based expectation did not further decrease the amplitude on top of rhythm-based expectation. Moreover, rhythm-based and sequence-based expectation collaboratively improved the perceptual performance by biasing the alpha oscillation toward the optimal phase. Our findings suggested flexible coordination of multiscale brain oscillations in dealing with a complex environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Balancing true and false detection of intermittent sensory targets by adjusting the inputs to the evidence accumulation process</a></h4>

              
                Decisions about noisy stimuli are widely understood to be made by accumulating evidence up to a decision bound that can be adjusted according to task demands. However, relatively little is known about how such mechanisms operate in continuous monitoring contexts requiring intermittent target detection. Here, we examined neural decision processes underlying detection of 1-second coherence-targets within continuous random dot motion, and how they are adjusted across contexts with Weak, Strong, or randomly Mixed weak/strong targets. Our prediction was that decision bounds would be set lower when weak targets are more prevalent. Behavioural hit and false alarm rate patterns were consistent with this, and were well-captured by a bound-adjustable leaky accumulator model. However, beta-band EEG signatures of motor preparation contradicted this, instead indicating lower bounds in the Strong-target context. We thus tested two alternative models in which decision bound dynamics were constrained directly by Beta measurements, respectively featuring leaky accumulation with adjustable leak, and non-leaky accumulation of evidence referenced to an adjustable sensory-level criterion. We found that the latter model best explained both behaviour and neural dynamics, highlighting novel means of decision policy regulation and the importance of neurally-informed modelling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perception as a hierarchical competition: a model that differentiates imagined, veridical, and hallucinated percepts</a></h4>

              
                Mental imagery can be understood as the process by which a thought becomes experienced with sensory characteristics. Yet, it's not clear why mental images have diminished sensory features compared to veridical percepts, nor if and how mental images are phenomenologically distinct from hallucinations, another type of non-veridical sensory experience. Current evidence suggests that externally- and internally-generated percepts both depend on similar neural systems. If so, it's plausible that imagined and veridical stimuli should interfere with one another. Here we propose that considering how externally-generated stimuli (i.e. sensory input) and internally-generated stimuli (i.e. thoughts) might compete could be sufficient to differentiate veridical, imagined, and hallucinated percepts. To predict the perceptual consequences of competition, we constructed a computational model of a serially-connected, hierarchical system with bidirectional information flow, emulating the primate visual system. We simulated mental imagery as top-down generative feedback in our model, both with and without competition from bottom-up sensory input. Without competition, imagined stimuli formed the dominant representation at each level of the hierarchy. Yet, when competing sensory input was present, imagined stimuli were outcompeted at lower levels while remaining dominant at higher levels, with an equilibrium point in between. We interpret our findings under a framework whereby low-level, high-dimensional stimulus information (e.g. in the early visual cortex) contributes most to the sensory aspects of perceptual experience, while high-level, low-dimensional stimulus information (e.g. towards temporal regions) contributes most to the abstract, amodal aspects of perceptual experience. Our findings suggest that ongoing bottom-up sensory input during waking life may prevent imagined stimuli from outcompeting and overriding our sensory experience of veridical stimuli. In contrast, dampening or eradicating sensory input could cause internally-generated stimuli to dominate sensory experience. We further discuss how our model can explain individual differences in mental imagery quality, account for phenomena such as daydreaming and hallucinations, and model mental imagery in multiple sensory modalities.

                All drugs of abuse induce long-lasting changes in synaptic transmission and neural circuit function that underlie substance use disorders. Here, we demonstrate that dopaminergic neuronal activity-regulated myelin plasticity is a key modulator of dopaminergic circuit function and opioid reward. Oligodendroglial lineage cells respond to dopaminergic neuronal activity evoked by either optogenetic stimulation or by morphine administration specifically within the reward center ventral tegmental area (VTA), but not along the axonal projections in the medial forebrain bundle nor within the target nucleus accumbens (NAc). Genetic blockade of oligodendrogenesis dampens NAc dopamine release dynamics, which is critical for reward learning, and impairs behavioral conditioning to morphine. Our findings identify dopaminergic neuronal activity-regulated myelin plasticity as an important circuit modification that is required for opioid reward.

                Mapping molecular structure to odor perception is a key challenge in olfaction. Here, we use graph neural networks (GNN) to generate a Principal Odor Map (POM) that preserves perceptual relationships and enables odor quality prediction for novel odorants. The model is as reliable as a human in describing odor quality: on a prospective validation set of 400 novel odorants, the model-generated odor profile more closely matched the trained panel mean (n=15) than did the median panelist. Applying simple, interpretable, theoretically-rooted transformations, the POM outperformed chemoinformatic models on several other odor prediction tasks, indicating that the POM successfully encoded a generalized map of structure-odor relationships. This approach broadly enables odor prediction and paves the way toward digitizing odors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging through Windansee electrode arrays reveals a small fraction of local neurons following surface MUA</a></h4>

              
                Prior studies have shown that neuronal spikes can be recorded with microelectrode arrays placed on the cortical surface. However, the etiology of these spikes remains unclear. Because the top cortical layer (layer 1) contains very few neuronal cell bodies, it has been proposed that these spikes originate from neurons with cell bodies in layer 2. To address this question, we combined two-photon calcium imaging with electrophysiological recordings from the cortical surface in awake mice using chronically implanted PEDOT:PSS electrode arrays on transparent parylene C substrate. Our electrode arrays (termed Windansee) were integrated with cortical windows offering see-through optical access while also providing measurements of local field potentials (LFP) and multiunit activity (MUA) from the cortical surface. To enable longitudinal data acquisition, we have developed a mechanical solution for installation, connectorization, and protection of Windansee devices aiming for an unhindered access for high numerical aperture microscope objectives and a lifetime of several months while worn by a mouse. Contrary to the common notion, our measurements revealed that only a small fraction of layer 2 neurons from the sampled pool (~13%) faithfully followed MUA recorded from the surface above the imaging field-of-view. Surprised by this result, we turned to computational modeling for an alternative explanation of the MUA signal. Using realistic modeling of neurons with back-propagating dendritic properties, we computed the extracellular action potential at the cortical surface due to firing of local cortical neurons and compared the result to that due to axonal inputs to layer 1. Assuming the literature values for the cell/axon density and firing rates, our modeling results show that surface MUA due to axonal inputs is over an order of magnitude larger than that due to firing of layer 2 pyramidal neurons. Thus, a combination of surface MUA recordings with two-photon calcium imaging can provide complementary information about the input to a cortical column and the local circuit response. Cortical layer I plays an important role in integration of a broad range of cortico-cortical, thalamocortical and neuromodulatory inputs. Therefore, detecting their activity as MUA while combining electrode recording with two-photon imaging using optically transparent surface electrode arrays would facilitate studies of the input/output relationship in cortical circuits, inform computational circuit models, and improve the accuracy of the next generation brain-machine interfaces.

                Although the botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are among the most toxic compounds found in nature, their molecular mechanism of action is far from being elucidated. A key event is the conformational transition due to the acidification of the interior of synaptic vesicles, and leading to the translocation of the BoNT catalytic domain into the neuronal cytosol. To investigate these conformational variations, homology modelling and atomistic simulations are combined to explore the internal dynamics of the subtypes BoNT/A1, the most-used in medical applications, and BoNT/E1, the most kinetically efficient. This first simulation study of di-chain BoNTs in closed and open states includes the effects of neutral and acidic pH. The conformational mobility is driven by domains displacements; the ganglioside binding site in the receptor binding domain, the translocation domain (HCNT) switch and the belt  helix visit multiple conformations depending on the primary sequence and on the pH. Fluctuations of the belt  helix are observed for closed conformations of the toxins and at acidic pH, and patches of more accessible residues appear in the same conditions in the core translocation domain HCNT. These findings suggest that during translocation, the larger mobility of belt could be transmitted to HCNT, leading to a favorable interaction of HCNT residues with the non-polar membrane environment.

                Discriminating between temporal features in sensory stimuli is critical to complex behavior and decision making. However, how sensory cortical circuit mechanisms contribute to discrimination between subsecond temporal components in sensory events is unclear. To elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of timing in primary visual cortex (V1), we recorded from V1 using 2-photon calcium imaging in awake-behaving mice performing a go/no-go discrimination timing task, which was composed of patterns of subsecond audio-visual stimuli. In both conditions, activity during the early stimulus period was temporally coordinated with the preferred stimulus. However, while network activity increased in the preferred condition, network activity was increasingly suppressed in the nonpreferred condition over the stimulus period. Our results demonstrate that discrimination between subsecond intervals that are contained in rhythmic patterns can be accomplished by local networks and suggest the contribution of neural resonance as a mechanism.

                Background: Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most frequent cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). The incomplete penetrance of LRRK2 mutations suggest that additional hits are required for disease onset. We hypothesized that chronic low-grade inflammation interacts with LRRK2 G2019S, the most frequent PD-associated mutation, to activate peripheral and central immune reactions and drive age-dependent neurodegeneration. Methods and Results: We exposed wild-type and LRRK2 G2019S mice to a low chronic dose of lipopolysaccharide, and we performed a longitudinal analysis of central and peripheral immune reactions and neurodegeneration. Low-dose inflammation triggered nigrostriatal degeneration, macrophage/monocyte brain infiltration, and astro-/microgliosis. LRRK2 G2019S mice showed an early dysregulation of peripheral cytokines, increased CD4+ T-cell infiltration and -synuclein aggregation in the colon. Interestingly, peripheral immune activation and colonic -synuclein aggregation precede astro-/microgliosis and neurodegeneration. Conclusions: Our study suggests an early role of the peripheral immune system and the gut in LRRK2 PD and provides a novel model to study early therapeutic immune targets and biomarkers.

                TRPA1 expressed in peripheral sensory neurons is important for nociception. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of TRPA1 profoundly reduces normal behavioural sensitivity to noxious cold and mechanical stimulation, as well as sensory neuron responses to mechanical stimulation. TRPA1 inhibition also reverses cold and mechanical hypersensitivities in chronic pain models in vivo. Here we demonstrate that these striking effects of TRPA1 inactivation result from an increased constitutive activity of kappa opioid receptors (KOR) co-expressed with TRPA1 in sensory neurons. Inhibition of KOR in Trpa1-/- mice restores nociception and neuronal activity to the levels observed in wild-type mice and reverses the analgesic effects of TRPA1 antagonism in naive mice and in neuropathic and inflammatory pain conditions. TRPA1 regulation of KOR activity in sensory neurons provides a novel mechanism to produce peripherally mediated analgesia. Our findings suggest that TRP channel regulation of constitutive GPCR activity, may be a process of general physiological importance.

                Membrane cholesterol binds to and modulates the function of the specific SLC6 transporters. Here we investigate how cholesterol binds to and modulates the rate of glycine transport by the SLC6 glycine transporter GlyT2, and how this impacts lipid inhibition of GlyT2. Bioactive lipid inhibitors of GlyT2 are analgesics that bind to the lipid allosteric site of the outward facing GlyT2 conformation that is accessible from the extracellular solution. Using molecular dynamics simulations, mutagenesis and cholesterol depletion experiments, we show that bioactive lipid inhibition of glycine transport is modulated by the recruitment of membrane cholesterol to a cholesterol binding site formed by transmembrane helices 1, 5 and 7. Recruitment involves cholesterol flipping from its membrane orientation, and insertion of the 3' hydroxyl group into the cholesterol binding cavity to interact with the base of the lipid allosteric site and the bound inhibitor. The recruitment of membrane cholesterol by allosteric GlyT2 inhibitors is a potential avenue for the development of high-potency, specific pain analgesics and could provide alternative therapeutics that target GlyT2 and other SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters.

                Neurotransmitter release at presynaptic active zones (AZs) requires concerted protein interactions within a dense 3D nano-hemisphere. Among the complex protein mesh- work the (M)unc-13 family member Unc-13 of Drosophila melanogaster is essential for docking of synaptic vesicles and transmitter release. We employ MiMIC-based gene editing using GFSTF (EGFP-FlAsH-StrepII-TEV- 3xFlag) to endogenously tag all annotated Drosophila Unc-13 isoforms enabling visualization of endogenous Unc-13 expression within the central and peripheral nervous system. Electrophysiological characterization using two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) reveals that evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmission remain unaffected in unc-13 GFSTF 3 rd instar larvae and acute presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP) can be induced at control levels. Furthermore, multi-color structured-illumination shows precise co-localization of Unc-13 GFSTF , Bruchpilot and GluRIIA-receptor subunits within the synaptic mesoscale. Localization microscopy in combination with HDBSCAN algorithms detect Unc-13 GFSTF nanoclusters that move towards the AZ center during PHP with unaltered Unc-13 GFSTF protein levels.

                Converging, cross-species evidence indicates that memory for time is supported by hippocampal area CA1 and entorhinal cortex. However, limited evidence characterizes how these regions preserve temporal memories over long timescales (e.g., months). At long timescales, memoranda may be encountered in multiple temporal contexts, potentially creating interference. Here, using 7T fMRI, we measured CA1 and entorhinal activity patterns as human participants viewed thousands of natural scene images distributed, and repeated, across many months. We show that memory for an image's original temporal context was predicted by the degree to which CA1/entorhinal activity patterns from the first encounter with an image were re-expressed during re-encounters occurring minutes to months later. Critically, temporal memory signals were dissociable from predictors of recognition confidence, which were carried by distinct medial temporal lobe expressions. These findings suggest that CA1 and entorhinal cortex preserve temporal memories across long timescales by coding for and reinstating temporal context information.

For this approach, one neural network was trained and validated using a published simulated and in vivo MEGA-PRESS MRS dataset with a wide-range of artificial frequency (0-20 Hz) and phase (0-90{degrees}) offsets applied. The proposed CNN-SR approach was subsequently tested and compared to the sequential FPC deep learning approaches and demonstrated more effective and accurate performance. Furthermore, a large random Gaussian signal-to-noise ratio (SNR 20 and SNR 2.5) and line broadening (0-20 ms) was introduced to the original simulated dataset to investigate our model performance compared to the other deep learning models. The testing showed that CNN-SR was a more accurate quantification tool and resulted in a lower SNR when compared with the other deep learning methods, due to having smaller mean absolute errors in both frequency and phase offset predictions. For Off spectra, the CNN-SR model was capable of correcting frequency offsets with 0.014 {+/-} 0.010 Hz and phase offsets with 0.104 {+/-} 0.076{degrees} absolute errors on average for unseen simulated data with SNR 20 and correcting frequency offsets with 0.678 {+/-} 0.883 Hz and phase offsets with 2.367 {+/-} 2.616{degrees} absolute errors on average at very low SNR (2.5) and line broadening (0-20 ms) introduced. In addition, we tested the simulated dataset with additional SNR and line broadening on a more refined model (CNN-SR+) where the pre-trained CNN-SR was further optimized by minimizing the difference between individual spectra and a common template with unsupervised learning. The performance on Off spectra was improved to 0.058 {+/-} 0.050 Hz for correcting frequency offsets and to 0.416 {+/-} 0.317{degrees} for correcting phase offsets. We further evaluated the ability of our model to process the published Big GABA in vivo dataset and CNN-SR+ achieved the best performance. Moreover, additional frequency and phase offsets (i.e., small, moderate, large) were applied to the in vivo dataset, and CNN-SR+ also demonstrated better performance for FPC when compared to the other deep learning models. These results indicate the utility of using deep learning for spectral registration and demonstrate the application of unsupervised learning in further improving the model to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Associations between thinner retinal neuronal layers and suboptimal brain structural integrity: Are the eyes a window to the brain?</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the extent to which measures of retinal neuronal thickness capture variability in the structural integrity of the brain in a large population-based cohort followed from birth to midlife. Using data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (n=1037; analytic n=828, aged 45 years), we specifically tested for associations between optical coherence tomography-measured retinal neuronal layers and MRI-measured structural brain integrity. We found that Study members who had thinner retinal neuronal layers had thinner average cortex, smaller total cortical surface area, smaller subcortical grey matter volumes, larger volume of white matter hyperintensities as well as older looking brains. This suggests that retinal neuronal thickness reflects differences in midlife structural brain integrity consistent with accelerated cognitive decline and increased risk for later dementia, further supporting the proposition that the retina may be a biomarker of brain aging as early as midlife.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CRF Neurons Establish Resilience via Stress-History-Dependent BNST Modulation</a></h4>

              
                Cumulative stress is a major risk factor for developing major depressive disorder (MDD), yet not everyone experiencing chronic stress develops MDD. In those who do not, it is unclear at what point, or by what mechanism, a trajectory of stable resiliency emerges. Utilizing a 10-day repeated social defeat stress model (RSDS) for MDD, we observed that a critical period between 7 and 10 daily defeats marks the phenotypical divergence of resilient from susceptible mice. In response to ongoing stress, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons of the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov) display a sustained increased firing rate in resilient, but not susceptible mice. This neurophysiological adaptation was self-sustaining, but only after 7 critical stress exposures, indicating that the process of developing resilience is dependent on stress history. Our study reveals a novel process by which individuals might persist in the face of adversity by way of stress-provoked activation, not inhibition of a key CRF limbic region that establishes a pathway to resilience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lifespan differences in visual short-term memory load-modulated functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is critical to higher-order executive processes and declines throughout the adult lifespan. However, our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying this decline is limited. Recent work suggests that functional connectivity between frontal control and posterior visual regions may be critical, but examinations of age differences therein have been limited to a small set of brain regions and extreme group designs (i.e., comparing young and older adults). In this study, we build on previous research by using a lifespan cohort and a whole-brain approach to investigate working memory load-modulated functional connectivity in relation to age and performance. The article reports on analysis of the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) data. Participants from a population-based lifespan cohort (N=111, age 23-86) performed a visual short-term memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Visual short-term memory was measured with a delayed recall task for visual motion with three different loads. Whole-brain load-modulated connectivity was estimated using psychophysiological interactions in a hundred regions of interest, sorted into seven networks (Schaefer et al., 2018, Yeo et al., 2011). Results showed that load-modulated functional connectivity was strongest within the dorsal attention network followed by the visual network during encoding and maintenance. With increasing age, load-modulated functional connectivity strength decreased throughout the cortex. Within the dorsal attention network, increased load-modulated connectivity strength was related to better task performance in an age-invariant way. Our results demonstrate the widespread negative impact of age on the modulation of functional connectivity by working memory load. Older adults might already be close to ceiling in terms of their resources at the lowest load and therefore less able to further increase connectivity with increasing task demands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Toward a generalizable deep CNN for neural drive estimation across muscles and participants</a></h4>

              
                High-density electromyography (HD-EMG) decomposition algorithms are used to identify individual motor unit spike trains. Numerous studies have used this neural code of movements to predict motor intent. It has advanced from offline to online decomposition, from isometric to dynamic contractions, leading to a wide range of neural-machine interface applications. However, current online methods need offline retraining when applied to the same muscle on a different day or to a different person, which limits their applications in a real-time neural-machine interface. We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for neural drive estimation, which captures general spatiotemporal properties of motor unit action potentials to generalize its application without retraining to HD-EMG data recorded in separate sessions, muscles, and participants. We recorded HD-EMG signals from the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscles while participants performed isometric contractions during two separate sessions. We identified motor unit spike trains (MUSTs) from HD-EMG signals using a blind source separation (BSS) method, and then used the cumulative spike train (CST) of these motor units and the HD-EMG signals to train and validate the deep CNN. On average, the correlation coefficients between CST from BSS and that from deep CNN were 0.977{+/-}0.007 for leave-one-out across-sessions-and-muscles validation and 0.985{+/-}0.005 for leave-one-out across-participants validation. When trained with more than four datasets, the performance of deep CNN saturated at 0.979{+/-}0.001 for cross-validations across muscles, sessions, and participants. Therefore, we can conclude that the deep CNN is generalizable across the aforementioned conditions without retraining. We could potentially generate a robust deep CNN to estimate neural drive to muscles for a neural-machine interface.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Excitation creates a distributed pattern of cortical suppression due to varied recurrent input</a></h4>

              
                To support perception, visual cortex transforms sensory-related input, creating neural activity patterns that represent features of the sensory world. These cortical input-output transformations can potentially be strongly influenced by local, recurrent connections between neurons, yet how recurrent connections affect transformations has been unclear. Here we study recurrent influences in mouse V1 by stimulating excitatory neurons and using simulations to determine which features of connectivity can explain the observations. We find that strong visual stimuli suppress many neurons, resulting in a salt-and-pepper pattern of neurons with suppressed and elevated firing. Stimulating excitatory cells optogenetically produces a similar salt-and-pepper pattern of suppression. Cells with suppressed firing are distributed across the cortex, though there is a surround region a few hundred microns from the stimulation center where suppressed neurons outnumber excited neurons. A balanced-state cortical model, with strong heterogeneous recurrent coupling and variability in neurons' inputs, replicates the observed firing rate distributions and dynamics, and also explains prior reports of suppression from single-cell stimulation. Together, the results show this cortical suppression arises via a recurrent network mechanism: excitatory input produces a diverse pattern of neural responses that is substantially different than the pattern of inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biologic that disrupts PDE11A4 homodimerization in hippocampus CA1 reverses age-related proteinopathies in PDE11A4 and cognitive decline of social memories</a></h4>

              
                Age-related proteinopathies in phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A), an enzyme that degrades 3,5-cAMP/cGMP and is enriched in the ventral hippocampal formation (VHIPP), drive age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) of social memories. In the VHIPP, age-related increases in PDE11A4 occur specifically within the membrane compartment and ectopically accumulate in filamentous structures termed ghost axons. Previous in vitro studies show that disrupting PDE11 homodimerization by expressing an isolated PDE11A-GAFB domain, which acts as a negative sink for monomers, selectively degrades membrane-associated PDE11A4 and prevents the punctate accumulation of PDE11A4. Therefore, we determined if disrupting PDE11A4 homodimerization in vivo via the expression of an isolated PDE11A4-GAFB domain would be sufficient to reverse 1) age-related accumulations of PDE11A4 in VHIPP ghost axons and 2) ARCD of social memories. Indeed, in vivo lentiviral expression of the isolated PDE11A4-GAFB domain in hippocampal CA1 reversed the age-related accumulation of PDE11A4 in ghost axons, reversed ACRD of social transmission of food preference memory (STFP), and improved remote long-term memory for social odor recognition (SOR) without affecting memory for non-social odor recognition. In vitro studies suggest that disrupting homodimerization of PDE11A4 does not directly alter the catalytic activity of the enzyme but may reverse age-related decreases in cGMP by dispersing the accumulation of the enzyme independently of other intramolecular mechanisms previously established to disperse PDE11A4 (e.g., phosphorylation of PDE11A4 at serine 162). Altogether, these data suggest that a biologic designed to disrupt PDE11A4 homodimerization may serve to ameliorate age-related deficits in hippocampal cyclic nucleotide signaling and subsequent ARCD of remote social memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age and musical training effects on auditory short-term, long-term, and working memory</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive aging is characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive functioning. One of the most worrying deficits for older adults is a decreased capacity to memorize and remember new information. In this study, we assessed auditory short-term memory (STM), long-term memory (LTM), and working memory (WM) abilities of young and older adults using musical and numerical tasks. Additionally, we measured musical training and tested whether this capacity influences memory performance. Regarding STM, young adults scored higher than older adults when making same/different judgements of rhythmic sequences, but their performance was alike for melodic sequences. Higher levels of musical training were associated with enhanced STM capacity for melodic sequences. In relation to LTM, young adults outperformed older adults in identifying new musical sequences. Moreover, younger and older individuals with high musical training outperformed those with low musical training. No group differences were found in the recognition of previously memorized musical sequences. Finally, we found no group differences in WM capacity, although there was a non-significant tendency for young adults to outperform older adults. Overall, we found that aging differently affects several types of auditory memory and that, for certain musical memory tasks, a higher level of musical training provides significant advantages.

                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Although classically considered a demyelinating disease, neuroaxonal injury occurs in both the acute and chronic phases and represents a pathologic substrate of disability not targeted by current therapies. Nitric oxide (NO) generated by CNS macrophages and microglia contributes to neuroaxonal injury in all phases of MS, but candidate therapies that prevent NO-mediated injury have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that the multifunctional protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is robustly nitrosylated in the CNS in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. GAPDH nitrosylation is blocked in vivo with daily administration of CGP3466b, a CNS-penetrant compound with an established safety profile in humans. Consistent with the known role of nitrosylated GAPDH (SNO-GAPDH) in neuronal cell death, blockade of SNO-GAPDH with CGP3466b attenuates neurologic disability and reduces axonal injury in EAE independent of effects on the immune system. Our findings suggest that SNO-GAPDH contributes to neuroaxonal injury during neuroinflammation and identify CGP3466b as a candidate neuroprotective therapy in MS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pten regulates endocytic trafficking of cell adhesion and signaling molecules to pattern the retina</a></h4>

              
                The retina is an exquisitely patterned tissue, with neuronal somata positioned at regular intervals to completely sample the visual field. Cholinergic amacrine cells are spectacular exemplars of precision, distributing in two radial layers and tangentially, forming regular mosaics. Here, we investigated how the intracellular phosphatase Pten and the cell adhesion molecule Dscam cooperate to regulate amacrine cell patterning. Using double mutants to test epistasis, we found that Pten and Dscam function in parallel pathways to regulate amacrine cell positioning. Mechanistically, Pten regulates endocytic remodeling of cell adhesion molecules (Dscam, Megf10, Fat3), which are aberrantly redistributed in Pten conditional-knock-out (cKO) amacrine cells. Furthermore, extracellular vesicles derived from multivesicular endosomes have altered proteomes in PtencKO retinas. Consequently, Wnt signaling is elevated in PtencKO retinal amacrine cells, the pharmacological disruption of which phenocopies PtencKO patterning defects. Pten thus controls endocytic trafficking of critical cell adhesion/signaling molecules to control amacrine cell spacing.

                Brains are not engineered solutions to a well-defined problem but arose through selective pressure acting on random variation. It is therefore unclear how well a model chosen by an experimenter can relate neural activity to experimental conditions. Here we developed "Model-free identification of neural encoding (MINE)" using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to relate aspects of tasks to neural activity. Although flexible, CNNs are difficult to interpret. We use Taylor decomposition approaches and explainable machine learning techniques to understand the mapping from task features to activity. We apply MINE to a published cortical dataset as well as experiments designed to probe thermoregulatory circuits in zebrafish. MINE allowed us to characterize neurons according to their receptive field and computational complexity, features which anatomically segregated in the brain. We also identified a new class of neurons that integrate thermosensory and behavioral information which eluded us previously when using traditional clustering and regression-based approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Entorhinal-DG/CA3 Pathway in the Medial Temporal Lobe Retains Visual Working Memory of a Simple Surface Feature</a></h4>

              
                Classic models consider working memory (WM) and long-term memory as distinct mental faculties that are supported by different neural mechanisms. Yet, there are significant parallels in the computation that both types of memory require. For instance, the representation of precise item-specific memory requires the separation of overlapping neural representations of similar information. This computation has been referred to as pattern separation, which can be mediated by the entorhinal-DG/CA3 pathway of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in service of long-term episodic memory. However, although recent evidence has suggested that the MTL is involved in WM, the extent to which the entorhinal-DG/CA3 pathway supports precise items-pecific WM has remained elusive. Here, we combine an established orientation WM task with high-resolution fMRI to test the hypothesis that the entorhinal-DG/CA3 pathway retains visual WM of a simple surface feature. Participants were retrospectively cued to retain one of the two studied orientation gratings during a brief delay period and then tried to reproduce the cued orientation as precisely as possible. By modeling the delay-period activity to reconstruct the retained WM content, we found that the anterior-lateral entorhinal cortex (aLEC) and the hippocampal DG/CA3 subfield both contain item-specific WM information that is associated with subsequent recall fidelity. Together, these results highlight the contribution of MTL circuitry to item-specific WM representation.

	<p>Previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies investigating tinnitus have reported structural differences in a variety of spatially distinct gray matter regions. However, the results have been highly inconsistent and sometimes contradictory. In the current study, we conducted a combined image- and coordinate-based meta-analysis of VBM studies investigating tinnitus to identify robust gray matter differences associated with tinnitus, as well as examine the possible effects of hearing loss on the outcome of the meta-analysis. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for studies published up to August 2021. Additional manual searches were conducted for studies published up to December 2021. A whole-brain meta-analysis was performed using Seed-Based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI). Fifteen studies comprising 423 individuals with tinnitus and either normal hearing or hearing loss (mean age 50.94 years; 173 females) and 508 individuals without tinnitus and either normal hearing or hearing loss (mean age 51.59 years; 234 females) met the inclusion criteria. We found a small but significant reduction in gray matter in the left inferior temporal gyrus for groups of normal hearing individuals with tinnitus compared to groups of hearing-matched individuals without tinnitus. In sharp contrast, in groups with hearing loss, tinnitus was associated with increased gray matter levels in the bilateral lingual gyrus and the bilateral precuneus. Those results were dependent upon matching the hearing levels between the groups with or without tinnitus. The current investigation suggests that hearing loss is the driving force of changes in cortical gray matter across individuals with and without tinnitus. Future studies should carefully account for confounders, including hearing loss, hyperacusis, anxiety, and depression, to identify gray matter changes specifically related to tinnitus. Ultimately, the aggregation of standardized individual datasets with both anatomical and useful phenotypical information will permit a better understanding of tinnitus-related gray matter differences, the effects of potential comorbidities, and their interactions with tinnitus.</p>

	<p>Some neural models achieve outstanding results in image recognition, semantic segmentation and natural language processing. However, their classification performance on structured and small-scale datasets that do not involve feature extraction is worse than that of traditional algorithms, although they require more time to train. In this paper, we propose a brain-like neural model with interactive stimulation (NMIS) that focuses on data classification. It consists of a primary neural field and a senior neural field that play different cognitive roles. The former is used to correspond to real instances in the feature space, and the latter stores the category pattern. Neurons in the primary field exchange information through interactive stimulation and their activation is transmitted to the senior field via inter-field interaction, simulating the mechanisms of neuronal interaction and synaptic plasticity, respectively. The proposed NMIS is biologically plausible and does not involve complex optimization processes. Therefore, it exhibits better learning ability on small-scale and structured datasets than traditional BP neural networks. For large-scale data classification, a nearest neighbor NMIS (NN_NMIS), an optimized version of NMIS, is proposed to improve computational efficiency. Numerical experiments performed on some UCI datasets show that the proposed NMIS and NN_NMIS are significantly superior to some classification algorithms that are widely used in machine learning.</p>

	<p>Genetic influences on acute responses to psychoactive drugs may contribute to individual variability in addiction risk. ABCB1 is a human gene that encodes P-glycoprotein, an ATP-dependent efflux pump that may influence the pharmacokinetics of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. Using data from 48 young adults (aged 19&amp;amp;ndash;25 years) reporting 1&amp;amp;ndash;4 days of cannabis use per week who completed a placebo-controlled human laboratory experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the rs2235048 polymorphism of ABCB1 would influence acute responses to smoked cannabis. C-allele carriers reported on average greater frequency of weekly cannabis use compared to the TT genotype carriers (TC/CC mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SEM = 2.74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.14, TT = 1.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.24, p = 0.004). After smoking a single cannabis cigarette to their desired high, C-allele carriers had higher area-under-the-curve (AUC) of both THC metabolites (11-OH-THC TC/CC = 7.18 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.64, TT = 3.28 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.40, p = 0.05; THC-COOH TC/CC = 95.21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 116.12, TT = 45.92 &amp;amp;plusmn; 42.38, p = 0.043), and these results were impact by self-reported ethnicity. There were no significant differences in self-reported subjective drug effects except for a greater AUC of visual analogue scale rating of drug liking (TC/CC = 35,398.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 37,233.72, TT = 15,895.56 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13,200.68, p = 0.017). Our preliminary findings suggest that further work in a larger sample should investigate whether human ABCB1 influences cannabis-related phenotypes and plays a role in the risk of developing a cannabis use disorder.</p>

	<p>Bone cancer pain (BCP) is one of the typical and distressing symptoms in cancer patients. Morphine is a widely used analgesic drug for BCP; however, long-term morphine administration will lead to analgesic tolerance. Our previous study indicated that spinal glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) exerts analgesic effects in rats with BCP. In this study, BCP was established by inoculated Walker 256 carcinoma cells into rat tibias, while morphine tolerance (MT) was induced by intrathecally injecting morphine twice daily from the 9th to 15th postoperative day (POD) in BCP rats. The BCP rats developed mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia on POD 5 and it lasted to POD 15. The analgesic effect of morphine was decreased after repeat administration. Western blots and immunochemistry tests showed that GDNF was gradually decreased in the spinal cord after the development of MT in rats with BCP, and GDNF was colocalized with the &amp;amp;mu; opioid receptor (MOR) in the superficial laminate of the spinal cords. The overexpression of GDNF by lentivirus significantly attenuated MT, and restored the expression of MOR in the spinal cord. In summary, our results suggest that the reduction of GDNF expression participated in the development of MT in rats with BCP and could be a promising therapeutic option for BCP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A training curriculum for retrieving, structuring, and aggregating information derived from the biomedical literature and large-scale data repositories. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Biomedical research over the past two decades has become data and information rich. This trend has been in large part driven by the development of systems-scale molecular profiling capabilities and by the increasingly large volume of publications contributed by the biomedical research community. It has therefore become important for early career researchers to learn to leverage this wealth of information in their own research. Methods: Here we describe in detail a training curriculum focusing on the development of foundational skills necessary to retrieve, structure, and aggregate information available from vast stores of publicly available information. It is provided along with supporting material and an illustrative use case. The stepwise workflow encompasses; 1) Selecting a candidate gene; 2) Retrieving background information about the gene; 3) Profiling its literature; 4) Identifying in the literature instances where its transcript abundance changes in blood of patients; 5) Retrieving transcriptional profiling data from public blood transcriptome and reference datasets; and 6) Drafting a manuscript, submitting it for peer-review, and publication. Results: This resource may be leveraged by instructors who wish to organize hands-on workshops. It can also be used by independent trainees as a self-study toolkit. The workflow presented as proof-of-concept was designed to establish a resource for assessing a candidate gene’s potential utility as a blood transcriptional biomarker. Trainees will learn to retrieve literature and public transcriptional profiling data associated with a specific gene of interest. They will also learn to extract, structure, and aggregate this information to support downstream interpretation efforts as well as the preparation of a manuscript. Conclusions: This resource should support early career researchers in their efforts to acquire skills that will permit them to leverage the vast amounts of publicly available large-scale profiling data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Facilitating bias in cost-effectiveness analysis: CHEERS 2022 and the creation of assumption-driven imaginary value claims in health technology assessment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The current standards for health technology cost-effectiveness assessment rest on the creation of lifetime assumption-driven modeled simulations for imaginary pricing and consequent patient access recommendations. A recent BMJ paper reports a detailed assessment of 8,192 cost-effectiveness analyses, concluding that industry-sponsored modeled claims were more likely to publish incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below a USD 50,000 threshold than non-industry sponsored studies, supporting the claim that the product was cost-effective. This is unsurprising; indeed, the opposite can occur with a modeled claim deliberately resulting in ICER is excess of USD 50,000. This methodology is well entrenched with the recently published Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 guidance for creating imaginary cost-effectiveness modeled claims ensuring the opportunity for deliberately manipulated cost-effectiveness claims. This overlooks limitations imposed by fundamental measurement, rendering assumption-driven simulations redundant analytical exercises. Manipulation of ICERs and claims for cost-effectiveness are mathematically impossible; including cost-utility thresholds, because the preference or utilities supporting creation of quality-of-life years (QALYs) are ordinal scores. Nevertheless, with the promotion of CHEERS 2022, the belief in imaginary modeled value claims is both facilitated and reinforced. With CHEERS 2022, there is a concerted effort, largely in self-interest, to perpetuate the current belief system. This is a self-defeating strategy. Rather than admitting to the deficiencies of assumption-driven simulated imaginary claims, leaders are maintaining that health system decision makers can ignore standards of normal science and fundamental measurement in value claims for pharmaceutical products. This disregard of standards that are commonplace in the sciences and mainstream social sciences perpetuates the opportunity for self-serving modeled claims; where models are a marketing vehicle leading to sponsored systematic bias in formulary submissions. This supports the need for a NEW START paradigm for health technology assessment, focusing on evaluable single-attribute value claims, meeting the required standards for normal science and fundamental measurement.

                Bruxism is increasingly common in today's stressful world and affects mainly young patients. It is a combined disease that involves dentition and its supporting structures, muscles, ligaments and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Here we present a complete combined analog and digital clinical protocol in a patient with parafunction. A young patient sought help due to impaired aesthetics, as a result of abraded tooth surfaces and severe symptoms of TMJ. We implemented a therapeutic protocol of six stages: deprogramming of the muscles and determination of treatment position and digital optimization; realization of the morphological plan for the upper dentition; non-invasive repositioning of the lower jaw by splint therapy; splint placement and follow-up; morphological planning of the lower dentition and replacement of the splint with fixed prosthesis with follow-up; and completion of the case with ceramic restorations. The digitally modeled temporary constructions for the upper jaw were made of PMMA and placed in the patient's mouth together with the splint on the lower jaw, made of Ceramill Splintec. After an adaptation period, all restorations were replaced by permanent zirconia. We achieved restoration of the defects of the dental arches and hard dental tissues and recovery to normal height of the lower third of the face (vertical dimension occlusion), fixed a stable and balanced position of the lower jaw, and repaired the normal physiological position of the TMJ for the patient. Аfter a multi-stage treatment we received a result satisfying the patient, the dentist and the dental technician. Aesthetics and function were restored, and clinical symptoms were removed from the TMJ.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An observational cross-sectional study on breast cancer patients’ knowledge of their disease: A likely cause of depression and anxiety [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aimed to assess breast cancer awareness among patients undergoing active treatment for breast cancer at Day Hospital, assess their quality of life (QoL), and explore the association between minor knowledge of the disease and higher levels of anxiety. Methods: This prospective observational study included patients with breast cancer undergoing active treatment at the Instituto Português de Oncologia Coimbra. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, QLQ-INFO25, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were completed, and demographic and clinical data were collected and processed using SPSSÒ. Results: In total, 188 patients with breast cancer were included. A vast majority had a positive perception of their QoL, with a higher average value compared to “cognitive functioning” (c=77.22±22.53), “social functioning” (76.86±25.41), and “physical functioning” (75.67±17.24). Regarding the information received, an overall “score” below the “cut-off line” (47.96±14.40) was observed. When evaluating “satisfaction” in isolation, the average value for “satisfaction with the information received” was 53.55±23.99, and patients perceived that the information received was beneficial to them (67.38±23.87) and did not wish to have received less information (99.47±7.29). With decreased functionality, higher levels of depression and anxiety were observed (p<0.0001). Regarding “information related to illness and anxiety/depression”, it was noted that as satisfaction with information decreased, patients tended to have higher levels of anxiety/depression (p<0.013). Conclusions: It is necessary to create dedicated spaces for information and clinical clarification, with regular assessments of patients’ perceptions. The information provided must be reinforced through written or digital support, or brochures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterization of a novel variant in the HR1 domain of MFN2 in a patient with ataxia, optic atrophy and sensorineural hearing loss [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pathogenic variants in MFN2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 2A (CMT2A) and are the leading cause of the axonal subtypes of CMT. CMT2A is characterized by predominantly distal motor weakness and muscle atrophy, with highly variable severity and onset age. Notably, some MFN2 variants can also lead to other phenotypes such as optic atrophy, hearing loss and lipodystrophy. Despite the clear link between MFN2 and CMT2A, our mechanistic understanding of how dysfunction of the MFN2 protein causes human disease pathologies remains incomplete. This lack of understanding is due in part to the multiple cellular roles of MFN2. Though initially characterized for its role in mediating mitochondrial fusion, MFN2 also plays important roles in mediating interactions between mitochondria and other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets. Additionally, MFN2 is also important for mitochondrial transport, mitochondrial autophagy, and has even been implicated in lipid transfer. Though over 100 pathogenic MFN2 variants have been described to date, only a few have been characterized functionally, and even then, often only for one or two functions. Method: Several MFN2-mediated functions were characterized in fibroblast cells from a patient presenting with cerebellar ataxia, deafness, blindness, and diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, who harbours a novel homozygous MFN2 variant, D414V, which is found in a region of the HR1 domain of MFN2 where few pathogenic variants occur. Results: We found evidence for impairment of several MFN2-mediated functions. Consistent with reduced mitochondrial fusion, patient fibroblasts exhibited more fragmented mitochondrial networks and had reduced mtDNA copy number. Additionally, patient fibroblasts had reduced oxygen consumption, fewer mitochondrial-ER contacts, and altered lipid droplets that displayed an unusual perinuclear distribution. Conclusion: Overall, this work characterizes D414V as a novel variant in MFN2 and expands the phenotypic presentation of MFN2 variants to include cerebellar ataxia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The state of the art of the electronic bill of lading [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The shipping industry is widely regarded as a slow adapting industry, for any innovation to be made there needs to be a real demand. One of these innovations is the electronic Bill of Lading. The need for an alternative to the expensive and slow traditional Bill of Lading has been rising since the beginning of the century. Now the digital revolution naturally introduced the electronic Bill of Lading, but its unclear legal status and different regulations in different countries make it hard to establish a worldwide solution. Nevertheless, there has been progress and the current focus on standardization along with the many advantages of blockchain technology may take it a step closer to a worldwide adoption. Methods: This paper aims to provide information about the most relevant providers of electronic bills of lading, with a clear focus on the underlying technology, in order to make a grounded analysis about each technological solution individually and in general. Results and Conclusions: The information presented was gathered by searching existing literature and public information from the technology providers, focusing on the technology and avoiding law matters.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Women’s access to health care for non-communicable diseases in South Africa: A scoping review. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, hypertension (HPT), and type II diabetes (T2D) are of increasing concern in South Africa (SA), with women being more at risk. Authors conducted a scoping review to identify and map the evidence available about the barriers of access to obesity, HPT, and T2D care among women in SA. Methods: Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping review was used. The search of the literature was completed in the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases between April and May 2022. Only studies conducted among women in SA were eligible for inclusion. Identified barriers were mapped onto Levesque’s framework of access to health care to determine which points along the chain of accessing NCD health care among women are mostly impacted. Results: Seven articles were included in the review: qualitative (n=2), quantitative (n=2), mixed methods (n=2), and grey literature (n=1). The included studies reported barriers of access to HPT and T2D care only, and no study reported barriers to obesity care. Supply-side barriers included lack of knowledge about available services, physician heavy workloads, medicine stock-outs, limited availability of testing equipment, unaffordable transport costs, travelling longer distances, inefficiently longer waiting times, and delayed referral. Demand-side barriers included women having low self-awareness of NCD status, concerns about confidentiality, perceived discrimination, and poverty. Conclusions: Access to HPT and T2D services is impacted from perception of need to benefitting from care. Articles included identified barriers affecting the availability and accommodation dimension of access to care, suggesting that HPT and T2D care is often unavailable or that women are unable to reach health facilities or service providers. There is need for more and better-quality research about access to NCD health care in SA, especially among women having a disproportionately high burden of obesity, T2D, and HPT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Differences in the length of postoperative care of endoscopic endonasal surgery in simple and complex surgical procedure groups [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The rapid development of endoscopic endonasal surgery has made the procedure widely used in nasal and sinus surgery. Endoscopic endonasal surgery is a minimally invasive procedure, but the possibility of postoperative damage to the sinonasal mucosa cannot be ruled out. The aim of this study was to analyze the difference in the length of postoperative care between complex and simple endoscopic endonasal surgeries which can be used as a reference in planning postoperative care.   Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional observational study. The participants were divided into two groups, i.e., simple, and complex surgical procedures groups. The simple procedure group consisted of middle meatal anstrostomy, uncinectomy, endoscopic septoplasty, and endoscopic turbinoplasty. The complex procedure group included frontal sinusotomy, sphenoidectomy, as well as anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy. The length of postoperative care between the two groups were measured and analyzed using the Chi-square test.   Results: The median length of care in the complex procedure group was significantly longer than that in the simple procedure group (p = 0.028), 12 weeks and 9 weeks, respectively. The number of postoperative outpatient visits was significantly less in the simple procedure group compared with the complex procedure group (Median 4 vs. 5; p=0.015). There was a significant correlation between length of care and the endonasal endoscopic surgical procedure group (p = 0.023).   Conclusions: The complex endoscopic endonasal surgery group required a longer length of care and more postoperative outpatient visit than the simple procedure group.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal anti-amyloid-beta therapy for Alzheimer’s disease via a personalized mathematical model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wenrui Hao, Suzanne Lenhart, Jeffrey R. Petrella</p>

With the recent approval by the FDA of the first disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), personalized medicine will be increasingly important for appropriate management and counseling of patients with AD and those at risk. The growing availability of clinical biomarker data and data-driven computational modeling techniques provide an opportunity for new approaches to individualized AD therapeutic planning. In this paper, we develop a new mathematical model, based on AD cognitive, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MRI biomarkers, to provide a personalized optimal treatment plan for individuals. This model is parameterized by biomarker data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, a large multi-institutional database monitoring the natural history of subjects with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Optimal control theory is used to incorporate time-varying treatment controls and side-effects into the model, based on recent clinical trial data, to provide a personalized treatment regimen with anti-amyloid-beta therapy. In-silico treatment studies were conducted on the approved treatment, aducanumab, as well as on another promising anti-amyloid-beta therapy under evaluation, donanemab. Clinical trial simulations were conducted over both short-term (78 weeks) and long-term (10 years) periods with low-dose (6 mg/kg) and high-dose (10 mg/kg) regimens for aducanumab, and a single-dose regimen (1400 mg) for donanemab. Results confirm those of actual clinical trials showing a large and sustained effect of both aducanumab and donanemab on amyloid beta clearance. The effect on slowing cognitive decline was modest for both treatments, but greater for donanemab. This optimal treatment computational modeling framework can be applied to other single and combination treatments for both prediction and optimization, as well as incorporate new clinical trial data as it becomes available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamical modeling of the H3K27 epigenetic landscape in mouse embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kapil Newar, Amith Zafal Abdulla, Hossein Salari, Eric Fanchon, Daniel Jost</p>

The Polycomb system via the methylation of the lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) plays central roles in the silencing of many lineage-specific genes during development. Recent experimental evidence suggested that the recruitment of histone modifying enzymes like the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) at specific sites and their spreading capacities from these sites are key to the establishment and maintenance of a proper epigenomic landscape around Polycomb-target genes. Here, to test whether such mechanisms, as a minimal set of qualitative rules, are quantitatively compatible with data, we developed a mathematical model that can predict the locus-specific distributions of H3K27 modifications based on previous biochemical knowledge. Within the biological context of mouse embryonic stem cells, our model showed quantitative agreement with experimental profiles of H3K27 acetylation and methylation around Polycomb-target genes in wild-type and mutants. In particular, we demonstrated the key role of the reader-writer module of PRC2 and of the competition between the binding of activating and repressing enzymes in shaping the H3K27 landscape around transcriptional start sites. The predicted dynamics of establishment and maintenance of the repressive trimethylated H3K27 state suggest a slow accumulation, in perfect agreement with experiments. Our approach represents a first step towards a quantitative description of PcG regulation in various cellular contexts and provides a generic framework to better characterize epigenetic regulation in normal or disease situations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High-order functional redundancy in ageing explained via alterations in the connectome in a whole-brain model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marilyn Gatica, Fernando E. Rosas, Pedro A. M. Mediano, Ibai Diez, Stephan P. Swinnen, Patricio Orio, Rodrigo Cofré, Jesus M. Cortes</p>

The human brain generates a rich repertoire of spatio-temporal activity patterns, which support a wide variety of motor and cognitive functions. These patterns of activity change with age in a multi-factorial manner. One of these factors is the variations in the brain’s connectomics that occurs along the lifespan. However, the precise relationship between high-order functional interactions and connnectomics, as well as their variations with age are largely unknown, in part due to the absence of mechanistic models that can efficiently map brain connnectomics to functional connectivity in aging. To investigate this issue, we have built a neurobiologically-realistic whole-brain computational model using both anatomical and functional MRI data from 161 participants ranging from 10 to 80 years old. We show that the differences in high-order functional interactions between age groups can be largely explained by variations in the connectome. Based on this finding, we propose a simple neurodegeneration model that is representative of normal physiological aging. As such, when applied to connectomes of young participant it reproduces the age-variations that occur in the high-order structure of the functional data. Overall, these results begin to disentangle the mechanisms by which structural changes in the connectome lead to functional differences in the ageing brain. Our model can also serve as a starting point for modeling more complex forms of pathological ageing or cognitive deficits.
