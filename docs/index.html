<p>In neuroimaging, MRI tissue properties characterize underlying neurobiology,
provide quantitative biomarkers for neurological disease detection and
analysis, and can be used to synthesize arbitrary MRI contrasts. Estimating
tissue properties from a single scan session using a protocol available on all
clinical scanners promises to reduce scan time and cost, enable quantitative
analysis in routine clinical scans and provide scan-independent biomarkers of
disease. However, existing tissue properties estimation methods - most often
$\mathbf{T_1}$ relaxation, $\mathbf{T_2^*}$ relaxation, and proton density
($\mathbf{PD}$) - require data from multiple scan sessions and cannot estimate
all properties from a single clinically available MRI protocol such as the
multiecho MRI scan. In addition, the widespread use of non-standard acquisition
parameters across clinical imaging sites require estimation methods that can
generalize across varying scanner parameters. However, existing learning
methods are acquisition protocol specific and cannot estimate from heterogenous
clinical data from different imaging sites. In this work we propose an
unsupervised deep-learning strategy that employs MRI physics to estimate all
three tissue properties from a single multiecho MRI scan session, and
generalizes across varying acquisition parameters. The proposed strategy
optimizes accurate synthesis of new MRI contrasts from estimated latent tissue
properties, enabling unsupervised training, we also employ random acquisition
parameters during training to achieve acquisition generalization. We provide
the first demonstration of estimating all tissue properties from a single
multiecho scan session. We demonstrate improved accuracy and generalizability
for tissue property estimation and MRI synthesis.

<p>Spike-timing-dependent plasticity(STDP) is a biological process in which the
precise order and timing of neuronal spikes affect the degree of synaptic
modification. While there have been numerous research focusing on the role of
STDP in neural coding, the functional implications of STDP at the macroscopic
level in the brain have not been fully explored yet. In this work, we propose a
neurodynamical model based on STDP that renders storage and retrieval of a
group of associative memories. We showed that the function of STDP at the
macroscopic level is to form a "memory plane" in the neural state space which
dynamically encodes high dimensional data. We derived the analytic relation
between the input, the memory plane, and the induced macroscopic neural
oscillations around the memory plane. Such plane produces a limit cycle in
reaction to a similar memory cue, which can be used for retrieval of the
original input.

<p>We explore relations between the hyper-parameters of a recurrent neural
network (RNN) and the complexity of string sequences it is able to memorize. We
compare long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). We find that an increase of RNN depth does not necessarily result in
better memorization capability when the training time is constrained. Our
results also indicate that the learning rate and the number of units per layer
are among the most important hyper-parameters to be tuned. Generally, GRUs
outperform LSTM networks on low complexity sequences while on high complexity
sequences LSTMs perform better.

<p>Neuromorphic computing systems overcome the limitations of traditional von
Neumann computing architectures. These computing systems can be further
improved upon by using emerging technologies that are more efficient than CMOS
for neural computation. Recent research has demonstrated memristors and
spintronic devices in various neural network designs boost efficiency and
speed. This paper presents a biologically inspired fully spintronic neuron used
in a fully spintronic Hopfield RNN. The network is used to solve tasks, and the
results are compared against those of current Hopfield neuromorphic
architectures which use emerging technologies.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02202">An Evolutionary Algorithm for Task Scheduling in Crowdsourced Software Development. (arXiv:2107.02202v1 [cs.SE])</a></h4>

<p>The complexity of software tasks and the uncertainty of crowd developer
behaviors make it challenging to plan crowdsourced software development (CSD)
projects. In a competitive crowdsourcing marketplace, competition for shared
worker resources from multiple simultaneously open tasks adds another layer of
uncertainty to the potential outcomes of software crowdsourcing. These factors
lead to the need for supporting CSD managers with automated scheduling to
improve the visibility and predictability of crowdsourcing processes and
outcomes. To that end, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm-based task
scheduling method for crowdsourced software development. The proposed
evolutionary scheduling method uses a multiobjective genetic algorithm to
recommend an optimal task start date. The method uses three fitness functions,
based on project duration, task similarity, and task failure prediction,
respectively. The task failure fitness function uses a neural network to
predict the probability of task failure with respect to a specific task start
date. The proposed method then recommends the best tasks start dates for the
project as a whole and each individual task so as to achieve the lowest project
failure ratio. Experimental results on 4 projects demonstrate that the proposed
method has the potential to reduce project duration by a factor of 33-78%.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09460">Bayesian Algorithm Execution: Estimating Computable Properties of Black-box Functions Using Mutual Information. (arXiv:2104.09460v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>In many real-world problems, we want to infer some property of an expensive
black-box function $f$, given a budget of $T$ function evaluations. One example
is budget constrained global optimization of $f$, for which Bayesian
optimization is a popular method. Other properties of interest include local
optima, level sets, integrals, or graph-structured information induced by $f$.
Often, we can find an algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ to compute the desired property,
but it may require far more than $T$ queries to execute. Given such an
$\mathcal{A}$, and a prior distribution over $f$, we refer to the problem of
inferring the output of $\mathcal{A}$ using $T$ evaluations as Bayesian
Algorithm Execution (BAX). To tackle this problem, we present a procedure,
InfoBAX, that sequentially chooses queries that maximize mutual information
with respect to the algorithm's output. Applying this to Dijkstra's algorithm,
for instance, we infer shortest paths in synthetic and real-world graphs with
black-box edge costs. Using evolution strategies, we yield variants of Bayesian
optimization that target local, rather than global, optima. On these problems,
InfoBAX uses up to 500 times fewer queries to $f$ than required by the original
algorithm. Our method is closely connected to other Bayesian optimal
experimental design procedures such as entropy search methods and optimal
sensor placement using Gaussian processes.

<p>Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease without known disease modification therapy to slow down disease progression. This disease has pathological features of Lewy bodies with α-synuclein aggregation being the major component and selective dopaminergic neuronal loss over the substantia nigra. Although the exact etiology is still unknown, mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be central in PD pathophysiology. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has recently been connected to PD, and anti-diabetic drugs, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), have been shown to possess neuroprotective effects in PD animal models. The GLP-1RA liraglutide is currently under a phase 2 clinical trial to measure its effect on motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients. In this study, we used an acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD to test the possible mechanism of the GLP-1RA liraglutide in the pathogenesis of PD. We show that the neurobehavioral and motor dysfunction caused by the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, MPTP, can be partially reversed by liraglutide. The GLP-1RA can protect mice from apoptosis of substantia nigra neurons induced by MPTP. MPTP treatment led to imbalanced mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics, altered mitochondrial morphology, impeded autophagy flux, increased α-synuclein accumulation, and elevated oxidative stress. Specifically, the normalizing of mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamic-related proteins and enhancement of autophagy flux after administration of liraglutide is associated with improving neuronal survival. This suggests that GLP-1RAs may provide potential beneficial effects for PD caused by mitochondrial dysfunction through improvement of mitochondrial morphology balance and enhancing damaged organelle degradation.</p>

<p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed single-stranded RNA molecules. After derived from precursor mRNA back-splicing, circRNAs play important roles in many biological processes. Recently, it was shown that several circRNAs were enriched in the mammalian brain with unclear functions. The expression of circRtn4 in the mouse brain was increased with the differentiation of primary neurons. In our study, knockdown of circRtn4 inhibited neurite growth, while overexpression of circRtn4 significantly increased neurite length. By dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA antisense purification assay, circRtn4 was identified as a miRNA sponge for miR-24-3p. Moreover, knockdown of miR-24-3p increased neurite length, while overexpression of miR-24-3p significantly inhibited neurite growth. Furthermore, CHD5 was confirmed to be a downstream target gene of miR-24-3p. And CHD5 silence counteracted the positive effect of circRtn4 overexpression on neurite growth. In conclusion, circRtn4 may act as the sponge for miR-24-3p to promote neurite growth by regulating CHD5.</p>

<p>Pathogenic variants in SPG11 are the most frequent cause of autosomal recessive complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). In addition to spastic paraplegia caused by corticospinal degeneration, most patients are significantly affected by progressive weakness and muscle wasting due to alpha motor neuron (MN) degeneration. Mitochondria play a crucial role in neuronal health, and mitochondrial deficits were reported in other types of HSPs. To investigate whether mitochondrial pathology is present in SPG11, we differentiated MNs from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from SPG11 patients and controls. MN derived from human embryonic stem cells and an isogenic SPG11 knockout line were also included in the study. Morphological analysis of mitochondria in the MN soma versus neurites revealed specific alterations of mitochondrial morphology within SPG11 neurites, but not within the soma. In addition, impaired mitochondrial membrane potential was indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, we reveal neuritic aggregates further supporting neurite pathology in SPG11. Correspondingly, using a microfluidic-based MN culture system, we demonstrate that axonal mitochondrial transport was significantly impaired in SPG11. Overall, our data demonstrate that alterations in morphology, function, and transport of mitochondria are an important feature of axonal dysfunction in SPG11 MNs.</p>

<p>There has been increasing interest in performing psychiatric brain imaging studies using deep learning. However, most studies in this field disregard three-dimensional (3D) spatial information and targeted disease discrimination, without considering the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of psychiatric disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a 3D convolutional autoencoder (3D-CAE) for extracting features related to psychiatric disorders without diagnostic labels. The network was trained using a Kyoto University dataset including 82 patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and 90 healthy subjects (HS) and was evaluated using Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) datasets, including 71 SZ patients and 71 HS. We created 16 3D-CAE models with different channels and convolutions to explore the effective range of hyperparameters for psychiatric brain imaging. The number of blocks containing two convolutional layers and one pooling layer was set, ranging from 1 block to 4 blocks. The number of channels in the extraction layer varied from 1, 4, 16, and 32 channels. The proposed 3D-CAEs were successfully reproduced into 3D structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with sufficiently low errors. In addition, the features extracted using 3D-CAE retained the relation to clinical information. We explored the appropriate hyperparameter range of 3D-CAE, and it was suggested that a model with 3 blocks may be related to extracting features for predicting the dose of medication and symptom severity in schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Empathy is often split into an affective facet for embodied simulation or sometimes sensorial processing, and a cognitive facet for mentalizing and perspective-taking. However, a recent neurophenomenological framework proposes a graded view on empathy (i.e., “Graded Empathy”) that extends this dichotomy and considers multiple levels while integrating complex neural patterns and representations of subjective experience. In the current magnetoencephalography study, we conducted a multidimensional investigation of neural oscillatory modulations and their cortical sources in 44 subjects while observing stimuli that convey vicarious pain (vs no-pain) in a broad time window and frequency range to explore rich neural representations of pain empathy. Furthermore, we collected participants’ subjective-experience of sensitivity to vicarious pain, as well as their self-reported trait levels of affective and cognitive empathy to examine the possible associations between neural mechanisms and subjective experiences and reports. While extending previous electrophysiological studies that mainly focused on alpha suppression, we found here four significant power modulation patterns corresponding to multiple facets of empathy: an early central (peaking in the paracentral sulcus) alpha (6–11 Hz) suppression pattern plausibly reflecting sensory processing, two early beta (15–23 Hz) suppression patterns in the mid-cingulate cortex (plausibly reflecting the affective component) and in the precuneus (plausibly reflecting the cognitive component), and a late anterior (peaking in the orbitofrontal cortex) alpha-beta (11–19 Hz) enhancement pattern (plausibly reflecting cognitive-control inhibitory response). Interestingly, the latter measure was negatively correlated with the subjective sensitivity to vicarious pain, thereby possibly revealing a novel inhibitory neural mechanism determining the subjective sensitivity to vicarious pain. Altogether, these multilevel findings cannot be accommodated by the dichotomous model of empathy (i.e., affective-cognitive), and provide empirical support to the Graded Empathy neurophenomenological framework. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the importance of examining multiple neural rhythms, their cortical generators, and reports of subjective-experience in the aim of elucidating the complex nature of empathy.</p>

<p>The experience of owning a body is built upon the integration of exteroceptive, interoceptive, and proprioceptive signals. Recently, it has been suggested that motor signals could be particularly important in producing the feeling of body part ownership. One thus may hypothesize that the strength of this feeling may not be spatially uniform; rather, it could vary as a function of the degree by which different body parts are involved in motor behavior. Given that our dominant hand plays a leading role in our motor behavior, we hypothesized that it could be more strongly associated with one’s self compared to its non-dominant counterpart. To explore whether this possible asymmetry manifests as a stronger implicit association of the right hand (vs left hand) with the self, we administered the Implicit Association Test to a group of 70 healthy individuals. To control whether this asymmetric association is human-body specific, we further tested whether a similar asymmetry characterizes the association between a right (vs left) animal body part with the concept of self, in an independent sample of subjects (N = 70, 140 subjects total). Our results revealed a linear relationship between the magnitude of the implicit association between the right hand with the self and the subject’s handedness. In detail, the strength of this association increased as a function of hand preference. Critically, the handedness score did not predict the association of the right-animal body part with the self. These findings suggest that, in healthy individuals, the dominant and non-dominant hands are differently perceived at an implicit level as belonging to the self. We argue that such asymmetry may stem from the different roles that the two hands play in our adaptive motor behavior.</p>

<p>Our sensory systems such as the olfactory and visual systems are the target of neuromodulatory regulation. This neuromodulation starts at the level of sensory receptors and extends into cortical processing. A relatively new group of neuromodulators includes cannabinoids. These form a group of chemical substances that are found in the cannabis plant. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the main cannabinoids. THC acts in the brain and nervous system like the chemical substances that our body produces, the endogenous cannabinoids or endocannabinoids, also nicknamed the brain’s own cannabis. While the function of the endocannabinoid system is understood fairly well in limbic structures such as the hippocampus and the amygdala, this signaling system is less well understood in the olfactory pathway and the visual system. Here, we describe and compare endocannabinoids as signaling molecules in the early processing centers of the olfactory and visual system, the olfactory bulb, and the retina, and the relevance of the endocannabinoid system for synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, comprise a family of disorders characterized by progressive loss of nervous system function. Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized to be associated with many neurodegenerative diseases but whether it is a cause or consequence of the disease process is unclear. Of growing interest is the role of microbial infections in inciting degenerative neuroinflammatory responses and genetic factors that may regulate those responses. Microbial infections cause inflammation within the central nervous system through activation of brain-resident immune cells and infiltration of peripheral immune cells. These responses are necessary to protect the brain from lethal infections but may also induce neuropathological changes that lead to neurodegeneration. This review discusses the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which microbial infections may increase susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases. Elucidating these mechanisms is critical for developing targeted therapeutic approaches that prevent the onset and slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Gliomas are the most common and lethal malignant tumor in the central nervous system. The tumor oncogene sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) was previously found to be upregulated in glioma tissues and enhance glioma cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through the AKT/β-catenin pathway. Nevertheless, ubiquitination of SphK2 protein has yet to be well elucidated. In this study, mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify proteins that interacted with SphK2 protein. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and immunoblotting (IB) were used to prove the specific interaction between SphK2 protein and the neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (NEDD4L) protein. Fluorescence microscopy was used for detecting the distribution of related proteins. Ubiquitylation assay was utilized to characterize that SphK2 was ubiquitylated by NEDD4L. Cell viability assay, flow cytometry assay, and transwell invasion assay were performed to illustrate the roles of NEDD4L-mediated SphK2 ubiquitination in glioma viability, apoptosis, and invasion, respectively. We found that NEDD4L directly interacted with SphK2 and ubiquinated it for degradation. Ubiquitination of SphK2 mediated by NEDD4L overexpression suppressed glioma cell viability and invasion but promoted glioma apoptosis. Knockdown of NEDD4L presented opposite results. Moreover, further results suggested that ubiquitination of SphK2 regulated glioma malignancy via the AKT/β-catenin pathway. in vivo assay also supported the above findings. This study reveals that NEDD4L mediates SphK2 ubiquitination to regulate glioma malignancy and may provide some meaningful suggestions for glioma treatment.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell mediated demyelination in central nervous system (CNS). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used in vivo disease model of MS. Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (dex) function as immunosuppressants and are commonly used to treat acute exacerbations of MS. Dex is also often used as a positive control in EAE studies, as it has been shown to promote motor behavior, inhibit immune cell infiltration into the CNS and regulate the activation of glial cell in EAE. This study further validated the effects of intravenously administrated dex by time-dependent fashion in EAE. Dex postponed clinical signs and motor defects in early stages of EAE. Histological analysis revealed that the degeneration of myelin and axons, as well as the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the white matter of spinal cord was inhibited by dex in early stages of EAE. Additionally, dex-treatment delayed the neuroinflammatory activation of microglia and astrocytes. Furthermore, this study analyzed the expression of the neurotrophic factor mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) in EAE, and the effect of treatment with dex on MANF-expression. We show that in dex-treated EAE mice expression MANF increased within myelinated areas of spinal cord white matter. We also show that intravenous administration with hMANF in EAE mice improved clinical signs and motor behavior in the early stage of EAE. Our report gives insight to the progression of EAE by providing a time-dependent analysis. Moreover, this study investigates the link between MANF and the EAE model, and shows that MANF is a potential drug candidate for MS.</p>

<p>The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) participates in synaptic functions in the brain. In the dentate gyrus, post-synaptic TRPV1 in the granule cell (GC) dendritic spines mediates a type of long-term depression (LTD) of the excitatory medial perforant path (MPP) synapses independent of pre-synaptic cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors. As CB<sub>1</sub> receptors also mediate LTD at these synapses, both CB<sub>1</sub> and TRPV1 might be influencing the activity of each other acting from opposite synaptic sites. We tested this hypothesis in the MPP–GC synapses of mice lacking TRPV1 (TRPV1-/-). Unlike wild-type (WT) mice, low-frequency stimulation (10 min at 10 Hz) of TRPV1-/- MPP fibers elicited a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that was dependent on (1) CB<sub>1</sub> receptors, (2) the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), (3) rearrangement of actin filaments, and (4) nitric oxide signaling. These functional changes were associated with an increase in the maximum binding efficacy of guanosine-5′-O-(3-[<sup>35</sup>S]thiotriphosphate) ([<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS) stimulated by the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist CP 55,940, and a significant decrease in receptor basal activation in the TRPV1-/- hippocampus. Finally, TRPV1-/- hippocampal synaptosomes showed an augmented level of the guanine nucleotide-binding (G) Gα<sub>i1</sub>, Gα<sub>i2</sub>, and Gα<sub>i3</sub> protein alpha subunits. Altogether, the lack of TRPV1 modifies CB<sub>1</sub> receptor signaling in the dentate gyrus and causes the shift from CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated LTD to LTP at the MPP–GC synapses.</p>

<p>Waste clearance (WC) is an essential process for brain homeostasis, which is required for the proper and healthy functioning of all cerebrovascular and parenchymal brain cells. This review features our current understanding of brain WC, both within and external to the brain parenchyma. We describe the interplay of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), interstitial fluid (ISF), and perivascular spaces within the brain parenchyma for brain WC directly into the blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also discuss the relevant role of the CSF and its exit routes in mediating WC. Recent discoveries of the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatic vessels, and their relevance to brain WC are highlighted. Controversies related to brain WC research and potential future directions are presented.</p>

<p>Background: Increasing evidence demonstrates that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is beneficial for improving cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanism of its therapeutic effect remains unclear.</p><p>Objectives/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on functional connectivity along with treatment response in AD patients with different severity of cognitive impairment.</p><p>Methods: We conducted a 2-week treatment course of 10-Hz rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in 23 patients with AD who were split into the mild or moderate cognitive impairment subgroup. Resting state electroencephalography and general cognition was assessed before and after rTMS. Power envelope connectivity was used to calculate functional connectivity at the source level. The functional connectivity of AD patients and 11 cognitively normal individuals was compared.</p><p>Results: Power envelope connectivity was higher in the delta and theta bands but lower in the beta band in the moderate cognitive impairment group, compared to the cognitively normal controls, at baseline (p &lt; 0.05). The mild cognitive impairment group had no significant abnormities. Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores improved after rTMS in the moderate and mild cognitive impairment groups. Power envelope connectivity in the beta band post-rTMS was increased in the moderate group (p &lt; 0.05) but not in the mild group. No significant changes in the delta and theta band were found after rTMS in both the moderate and mild group.</p><p>Conclusion: High-frequency rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex modulates electroencephalographic functional connectivity while improving cognitive function in patients with AD. Increased beta connectivity may have an important mechanistic role in rTMS therapeutic effects.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61595">Increased influence of prior choices on perceptual decisions in autism</a></h4>

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifests sensory and perceptual atypicalities. Recent theories suggest that these may reflect a reduced influence of prior information in ASD. Some studies have found reduced adaptation to recent sensory stimuli in ASD. However, the effects of prior stimuli and prior perceptual choices can counteract one-another. Here, we investigated this using two different tasks (in two different cohorts): (i) visual location discrimination, and (ii) multisensory (visual-vestibular) heading discrimination. We fit the data using a logistic regression model to dissociate the specific effects of prior stimuli and prior choices. In both tasks perceptual decisions were biased toward recent choices. Notably, the 'attractive' effect of prior choices was significantly larger in ASD (in both tasks and cohorts), while there was no difference in the influence of prior stimuli. These results challenge theories of reduced priors in ASD, and rather suggest an increased consistency bias for perceptual decisions in ASD.

The spatial architecture of the islets of Langerhans is hypothesized to facilitate synchronized insulin secretion among β cells yet testing this <i>in vivo</i> in the intact pancreas is challenging. Robo βKO mice, in which the genes <i>Robo1</i> and <i>Robo2</i> are deleted selectively in β cells, provide a unique model of altered islet spatial architecture without loss of β cell differentiation or islet damage from diabetes. Combining Robo βKO mice with intravital microscopy, we show here that Robo βKO islets have reduced synchronized intra-islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations among β cells <i>in vivo</i>. We provide evidence that this loss is not due to a β cell-intrinsic function of Robo, mis-expression or mis-localization of Cx36 gap junctions, or changes in islet vascularization or innervation, suggesting that the islet architecture itself is required for synchronized Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. These results have implications for understanding structure-function relationships in the islets during progression to diabetes as well as engineering islets from stem cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60233">Propelling and perturbing appendages together facilitate strenuous ground self-righting</a></h4>

Terrestrial animals must self-right when overturned on the ground, but this locomotor task is strenuous. To do so, the discoid cockroach often pushes its wings against the ground to begin a somersault which rarely succeeds. As it repeatedly attempts this, the animal probabilistically rolls to the side to self-right. During winged self-righting, the animal flails its legs vigorously. Here, we studied whether wing opening and leg flailing together facilitate strenuous ground self-righting. Adding mass to increase hind leg flailing kinetic energy increased the animal’s self-righting probability. We then developed a robot with similar strenuous self-righting behavior and used it as a physical model for systematic experiments. The robot’s self-righting probability increased with wing opening and leg flailing amplitudes. A potential energy landscape model revealed that, although wing opening did not generate sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the high pitch potential energy barrier to somersault, it reduced the barrier for rolling, facilitating the small kinetic energy from leg flailing to probabilistically overcome it to self-right. The model also revealed that the stereotyped body motion during self-righting emerged from physical interaction of the body and appendages with the ground. Our work demonstrated the usefulness of potential energy landscape for modeling self-righting transitions.

The evolutionary expansion of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has produced a rich diversity of transmembrane sensors for many physical and chemical signals. In humans alone, over 800 GPCRs detect stimuli such as light, hormones, and metabolites to guide cellular decision-making primarily using intracellular G protein signaling networks.

<p>by Alban Bornet, Adrien Doerig, Michael H. Herzog, Gregory Francis, Erik Van der Burg</p>

In crowding, perception of a target deteriorates in the presence of nearby flankers. Traditionally, it is thought that visual crowding obeys Bouma’s law, i.e., all elements within a certain distance interfere with the target, and that adding more elements always leads to stronger crowding. Crowding is predominantly studied using sparse displays (a target surrounded by a few flankers). However, many studies have shown that this approach leads to wrong conclusions about human vision. Van der Burg and colleagues proposed a paradigm to measure crowding in dense displays using genetic algorithms. Displays were selected and combined over several generations to maximize human performance. In contrast to Bouma’s law, only the target’s nearest neighbours affected performance. Here, we tested various models to explain these results. We used the same genetic algorithm, but instead of selecting displays based on human performance we selected displays based on the model’s outputs. We found that all models based on the traditional feedforward pooling framework of vision were unable to reproduce human behaviour. In contrast, all models involving a dedicated grouping stage explained the results successfully. We show how traditional models can be improved by adding a grouping stage.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bczjzCZuMmg" width="1" />

<p>by Shirlee Wohl, John R. Giles, Justin Lessler</p>

Sample size calculations are an essential component of the design and evaluation of scientific studies. However, there is a lack of clear guidance for determining the sample size needed for phylogenetic studies, which are becoming an essential part of studying pathogen transmission. We introduce a statistical framework for determining the number of true infector-infectee transmission pairs identified by a phylogenetic study, given the size and population coverage of that study. We then show how characteristics of the criteria used to determine linkage and aspects of the study design can influence our ability to correctly identify transmission links, in sometimes counterintuitive ways. We test the overall approach using outbreak simulations and provide guidance for calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the linkage criteria, the key inputs to our approach. The framework is freely available as the R package <i>phylosamp</i>, and is broadly applicable to designing and evaluating a wide array of pathogen phylogenetic studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1eSF4MY9g2M" width="1" />

<p>by Simon P. Orozco, Scott T. Albert, Reza Shadmehr</p>

As you read this text, your eyes make saccades that guide your fovea from one word to the next. Accuracy of these movements require the brain to monitor and learn from visual errors. A current model suggests that learning is supported by two different adaptive processes, one fast (high error sensitivity, low retention), and the other slow (low error sensitivity, high retention). Here, we searched for signatures of these hypothesized processes and found that following experience of a visual error, there was an adaptive change in the motor commands of the subsequent saccade. Surprisingly, this adaptation was not uniformly expressed throughout the movement. Rather, after experience of a single error, the adaptive response in the subsequent trial was limited to the deceleration period. After repeated exposure to the same error, the acceleration period commands also adapted, and exhibited resistance to forgetting during set-breaks. In contrast, the deceleration period commands adapted more rapidly, but suffered from poor retention during these same breaks. State-space models suggested that acceleration and deceleration periods were supported by a shared adaptive state which re-aimed the saccade, as well as two separate processes which resembled a two-state model: one that learned slowly and contributed primarily via acceleration period commands, and another that learned rapidly but contributed primarily via deceleration period commands.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3MUqSy0IJUA" width="1" />

Biomechanical forces intimately contribute to cardiac morphogenesis. However, volumetric imaging to investigate the cardiac mechanics with high temporal and spatial resolution remains an imaging challenge. We hereby integrated light-field microscopy (LFM) with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), coupled with a retrospective gating method, to simultaneously access myocardial contraction and intracardiac blood flow at 200 volumes per second. While LSFM allows for the reconstruction of the myocardial function, LFM enables instantaneous acquisition of the intracardiac blood cells traversing across the valves. We further adopted deformable image registration to quantify the ventricular wall displacement and particle tracking velocimetry to monitor intracardiac blood flow. The integration of LFM and LSFM enabled the time-dependent tracking of the individual blood cells and the differential rates of segmental wall displacement during a cardiac cycle. Taken together, we demonstrated a hybrid system, coupled with our image analysis pipeline, to simultaneously capture the myocardial wall motion with intracardiac blood flow during cardiac development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZyS_q2VJ4ow" width="1" />

<p>by Michael C. Holcomb, Guo-Jie Jason Gao, Mahsa Servati, Dylan Schneider, Presley K. McNeely, Jeffrey H. Thomas, Jerzy Blawzdziewicz</p>

Formation of the ventral furrow in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo relies on the apical constriction of cells in the ventral region to produce bending forces that drive tissue invagination. In our recent paper we observed that apical constrictions during the initial phase of ventral furrow formation produce elongated patterns of cellular constriction chains prior to invagination and argued that these are indicative of tensile stress feedback. Here, we quantitatively analyze the constriction patterns preceding ventral furrow formation and find that they are consistent with the predictions of our active-granular-fluid model of a monolayer of mechanically coupled stress-sensitive constricting particles. Our model shows that tensile feedback causes constriction chains to develop along underlying precursor tensile stress chains that gradually strengthen with subsequent cellular constrictions. As seen in both our model and available optogenetic experiments, this mechanism allows constriction chains to penetrate or circumvent zones of reduced cell contractility, thus increasing the robustness of ventral furrow formation to spatial variation of cell contractility by rescuing cellular constrictions in the disrupted regions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mzp9_Nfj5P8" width="1" />

<p>by Federico Mancinelli, Jonathan Roiser, Peter Dayan</p>

A critical facet of adjusting one’s behaviour after succeeding or failing at a task is assigning responsibility for the ultimate outcome. Humans have trait- and state-like tendencies to implicate aspects of their own behaviour (called ‘internal’ ascriptions) or facets of the particular task or Lady Luck (’chance’). However, how these tendencies interact with actual performance is unclear. We designed a novel task in which subjects had to learn the likelihood of achieving their goals, and the extent to which this depended on their efforts. High internality (Levenson I-score) was associated with decision making patterns that are less vulnerable to failure. Our computational analyses suggested that this depended heavily on the adjustment in the perceived achievability of riskier goals following failure. We found beliefs about chance not to be explanatory of choice behaviour in our task. Beliefs about powerful others were strong predictors of behaviour, but only when subjects lacked substantial influence over the outcome. Our results provide an evidentiary basis for heuristics and learning differences that underlie the formation and maintenance of control expectations by the self.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hAV-hMzko_0" width="1" />

<p>by Maciej Migdal, Dan Fu Ruan, William F. Forrest, Amir Horowitz, Christian Hammer</p>

Human immunogenetic variation in the form of HLA and KIR types has been shown to be strongly associated with a multitude of immune-related phenotypes. However, association studies involving immunogenetic loci most commonly involve simple analyses of classical HLA allelic diversity, resulting in limitations regarding the interpretability and reproducibility of results. We here present MiDAS, a comprehensive R package for immunogenetic data transformation and statistical analysis. MiDAS recodes input data in the form of HLA alleles and KIR types into biologically meaningful variables, allowing HLA amino acid fine mapping, analyses of HLA evolutionary divergence as well as experimentally validated HLA-KIR interactions. Further, MiDAS enables comprehensive statistical association analysis workflows with phenotypes of diverse measurement scales. MiDAS thus closes the gap between the inference of immunogenetic variation and its efficient utilization to make relevant discoveries related to immune and disease biology.

PCR amplification plays an integral role in the measurement of mixed microbial communities via high-throughput DNA sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Yet PCR is also known to introduce multiple forms of bias in 16S rRNA studies. Here we present a paired modeling and experimental approach to characterize and mitigate PCR NPM-bias (PCR bias from non-primer-mismatch sources) in microbiota surveys. We use experimental data from mock bacterial communities to validate our approach and human gut microbiota samples to characterize PCR NPM-bias under real-world conditions. Our results suggest that PCR NPM-bias can skew estimates of microbial relative abundances by a factor of 4 or more, but that this bias can be mitigated using log-ratio linear models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QO-Tb4sz7s8" width="1" />

<p>by Nicholas Menghi, Kemal Kacar, Will Penny</p>

This paper uses constructs from machine learning to define pairs of learning tasks that either shared or did not share a common subspace. Human subjects then learnt these tasks using a feedback-based approach and we hypothesised that learning would be boosted for shared subspaces. Our findings broadly supported this hypothesis with either better performance on the second task if it shared the same subspace as the first, or positive correlations over task performance for shared subspaces. These empirical findings were compared to the behaviour of a Neural Network model trained using sequential Bayesian learning and human performance was found to be consistent with a minimal capacity variant of this model. Networks with an increased representational capacity, and networks without Bayesian learning, did not show these transfer effects. We propose that the concept of shared subspaces provides a useful framework for the experimental study of human multitask and transfer learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZKm31SKqKBs" width="1" />

Drug-drug interactions account for up to 30% of adverse drug reactions. Increasing prevalence of electronic health records (EHRs) offers a unique opportunity to build machine learning algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions that drive adverse events. In this study, we investigated hospitalizations’ data to study drug interactions with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) that result in drug-induced liver injury (DILI). We propose a logistic regression based machine learning algorithm that unearths several known interactions from an EHR dataset of about 400,000 hospitalization. Our proposed modeling framework is successful in detecting 87.5% of the positive controls, which are defined by drugs known to interact with diclofenac causing an increased risk of DILI, and correctly ranks aggregate risk of DILI for eight commonly prescribed NSAIDs. We found that our modeling framework is particularly successful in inferring associations of drug-drug interactions from relatively small EHR datasets. Furthermore, we have identified a novel and potentially hepatotoxic interaction that might occur during concomitant use of meloxicam and esomeprazole, which are commonly prescribed together to allay NSAID-induced gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Empirically, we validate our approach against prior methods for signal detection on EHR datasets, in which our proposed approach outperforms all the compared methods across most metrics, such as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ayYxQAwESVc" width="1" />

<p>by Jennifer Crodelle, David W. McLaughlin</p>

Recent experiments in the developing mammalian visual cortex have revealed that gap junctions couple excitatory cells and potentially influence the formation of chemical synapses. In particular, cells that were coupled by a gap junction during development tend to share an orientation preference and are preferentially coupled by a chemical synapse in the adult cortex, a property that is diminished when gap junctions are blocked. In this work, we construct a simplified model of the developing mouse visual cortex including spike-timing-dependent plasticity of both the feedforward synaptic inputs and recurrent cortical synapses. We use this model to show that synchrony among gap-junction-coupled cells underlies their preference to form strong recurrent synapses and develop similar orientation preference; this effect decreases with an increase in coupling density. Additionally, we demonstrate that gap-junction coupling works, together with the relative timing of synaptic development of the feedforward and recurrent synapses, to determine the resulting cortical map of orientation preference.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F04sNpr35H0" width="1" />

<p>by Qiu-Wen Wang, Ying-Han Wang, Bing Wang, Yun Chen, Si-Yao Lu, Jun Yao</p>

Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) plays direct or redundant Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor roles in multiple forms of vesicle exocytosis in synapses. Here, we show that Syt7 is a redundant Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor with Syt1/Doc2 to drive spontaneous glutamate release, which functions uniquely to activate the postsynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs that significantly contribute to mental illness. In mouse hippocampal neurons lacking Syt1/Doc2, Syt7 inactivation largely diminishes spontaneous release. Using 2 approaches, including measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose response and substituting extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Sr<sup>2+</sup>, we detect that Syt7 directly triggers spontaneous release via its Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding motif to activate GluN2B-NMDARs. Furthermore, modifying the localization of Syt7 in the active zone still allows Syt7 to drive spontaneous release, but the GluN2B-NMDAR activity is abolished. Finally, Syt7 SNPs identified in bipolar disorder patients destroy the function of Syt7 in spontaneous release in patient iPSC-derived and mouse hippocampal neurons. Therefore, Syt7 could contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders through driving spontaneous glutamate release.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/a3Cz2WX3HSE" width="1" />

The horizontal transfer of mobile DNA is one of the signature moves of bacterial evolution, but the specific rules that govern this transfer remain elusive. In this PLOS Biology issue, Haudiquet and colleagues revealed that the interactions between mobile genetic elements and the bacterial capsule shape the horizontal flow of DNA in an important bacterial pathogen.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PIoFT57fjIw" width="1" />

<p>by Matthieu Haudiquet, Amandine Buffet, Olaya Rendueles, Eduardo P. C. Rocha</p>

Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) drive genetic transfers between bacteria using mechanisms that require a physical interaction with the cellular envelope. In the high-priority multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens (ESKAPE), the first point of contact between the cell and virions or conjugative pili is the capsule. While the capsule can be a barrier to MGEs, it also evolves rapidly by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Here, we aim at understanding this apparent contradiction by studying the covariation between the repertoire of capsule genes and MGEs in approximately 4,000 genomes of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (Kpn). We show that capsules drive phage-mediated gene flow between closely related serotypes. Such serotype-specific phage predation also explains the frequent inactivation of capsule genes, observed in more than 3% of the genomes. Inactivation is strongly epistatic, recapitulating the capsule biosynthetic pathway. We show that conjugative plasmids are acquired at higher rates in natural isolates lacking a functional capsular locus and confirmed experimentally this result in capsule mutants. This suggests that capsule inactivation by phage pressure facilitates its subsequent reacquisition by conjugation. Accordingly, capsule reacquisition leaves long recombination tracts around the capsular locus. The loss and regain process rewires gene flow toward other lineages whenever it leads to serotype swaps. Such changes happen preferentially between chemically related serotypes, hinting that the fitness of serotype-swapped strains depends on the host genetic background. These results enlighten the bases of trade-offs between the evolution of virulence and multidrug resistance and caution that some alternatives to antibiotics by selecting for capsule inactivation may facilitate the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wYh9n9mhdx8" width="1" />

Centromere protein A (CENP-A) is a histone H3 variant that defines centromeric chromatin and is essential for centromere function. In most eukaryotes, CENP-A-containing chromatin is epigenetically maintained, and centromere identity is inherited from one cell cycle to the next. In the germ line of the holocentric nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, this inheritance cycle is disrupted. CENP-A is removed at the mitosis-to-meiosis transition and is reestablished on chromatin during diplotene of meiosis I. Here, we show that the N-terminal tail of CENP-A is required for the de novo establishment of centromeres, but then its presence becomes dispensable for centromere maintenance during development. Worms homozygous for a CENP-A tail deletion maintain functional centromeres during development but give rise to inviable offspring because they fail to reestablish centromeres in the maternal germ line. We identify the N-terminal tail of CENP-A as a critical domain for the interaction with the conserved kinetochore protein KNL-2 and argue that this interaction plays an important role in setting centromere identity in the germ line. We conclude that centromere establishment and maintenance are functionally distinct in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OGRoMoHQ2kA" width="1" />

<p>In this paper, we propose methods for functional predictor selection and the
estimation of smooth functional coefficients simultaneously in a
scalar-on-function regression problem under high-dimensional multivariate
functional data setting. In particular, we develop two methods for functional
group-sparse regression under a generic Hilbert space of infinite dimension. We
show the convergence of algorithms and the consistency of the estimation and
the selection (oracle property) under infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
Simulation studies show the effectiveness of the methods in both the selection
and the estimation of functional coefficients. The applications to the
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveal the regions of the human
brain related to ADHD and IQ.

<p>A prominent technique for reducing the memory footprint of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) without decreasing the accuracy significantly is quantization.
However, the state-of-the-art only focus on employing the weight quantization
directly from a specific quantization scheme, i.e., either the post-training
quantization (PTQ) or the in-training quantization (ITQ), and do not consider
(1) quantizing other SNN parameters (e.g., neuron membrane potential), (2)
exploring different combinations of quantization approaches (i.e., quantization
schemes, precision levels, and rounding schemes), and (3) selecting the SNN
model with a good memory-accuracy trade-off at the end. Therefore, the memory
saving offered by these state-of-the-art to meet the targeted accuracy is
limited, thereby hindering processing SNNs on the resource-constrained systems
(e.g., the IoT-Edge devices). Towards this, we propose Q-SpiNN, a novel
quantization framework for memory-efficient SNNs. The key mechanisms of the
Q-SpiNN are: (1) employing quantization for different SNN parameters based on
their significance to the accuracy, (2) exploring different combinations of
quantization schemes, precision levels, and rounding schemes to find efficient
SNN model candidates, and (3) developing an algorithm that quantifies the
benefit of the memory-accuracy trade-off obtained by the candidates, and
selects the Pareto-optimal one. The experimental results show that, for the
unsupervised network, the Q-SpiNN reduces the memory footprint by ca. 4x, while
maintaining the accuracy within 1% from the baseline on the MNIST dataset. For
the supervised network, the Q-SpiNN reduces the memory by ca. 2x, while keeping
the accuracy within 2% from the baseline on the DVS-Gesture dataset.

<p>Deep learning networks generally use non-biological learning methods. By
contrast, networks based on more biologically plausible learning, such as
Hebbian learning, show comparatively poor performance and difficulties of
implementation. Here we show that hierarchical, convolutional Hebbian learning
can be implemented almost trivially with modern deep learning frameworks, by
using specific losses whose gradients produce exactly the desired Hebbian
updates. We provide expressions whose gradients exactly implement a plain
Hebbian rule (dw ~= xy), Grossberg's instar rule (dw ~= y(x-w)), and Oja's rule
(dw ~= y(x-yw)). As an application, we build Hebbian convolutional multi-layer
networks for object recognition. We observe that higher layers of such networks
tend to learn large, simple features (Gabor-like filters and blobs), explaining
the previously reported decrease in decoding performance over successive
layers. To combat this tendency, we introduce interventions (denser activations
with sparse plasticity, pruning of connections between layers) which result in
sparser learned features, massively increase performance, and allow information
to increase over successive layers. We hypothesize that more advanced
techniques (dynamic stimuli, trace learning, feedback connections, etc.),
together with the massive computational boost offered by modern deep learning
frameworks, could greatly improve the performance and biological relevance of
multi-layer Hebbian networks.

<p>Feedforward neural networks are widely used as universal predictive models to
fit data distribution. Common gradient-based learning, however, suffers from
many drawbacks making the training process ineffective and time-consuming.
Alternative randomized learning does not use gradients but selects hidden node
parameters randomly. This makes the training process extremely fast. However,
the problem in randomized learning is how to determine the random parameters. A
recently proposed method uses autoencoders for unsupervised parameter learning.
This method showed superior performance on classification tasks. In this work,
we apply this method to regression problems, and, finding that it has some
drawbacks, we show how to improve it. We propose a learning method of
autoencoders that controls the produced random weights. We also propose how to
determine the biases of hidden nodes. We empirically compare autoencoder based
learning with other randomized learning methods proposed recently for
regression and find that despite the proposed improvement of the autoencoder
based learning, it does not outperform its competitors in fitting accuracy.
Moreover, the method is much more complex than its competitors.

<p>This work contributes to the development of neural forecasting models with
novel randomization-based learning methods. These methods improve the fitting
abilities of the neural model, in comparison to the standard method, by
generating network parameters in accordance with the data and target function
features. A pattern-based representation of time series makes the proposed
approach useful for forecasting time series with multiple seasonality. In the
simulation study, we evaluate the performance of the proposed models and find
that they can compete in terms of forecasting accuracy with fully-trained
networks. Extremely fast and easy training, simple architecture, ease of
implementation, high accuracy as well as dealing with nonstationarity and
multiple seasonality in time series make the proposed model very attractive for
a wide range of complex time series forecasting problems.

<p>This work contributes to the development of a new data-driven method (D-DM)
of feedforward neural networks (FNNs) learning. This method was proposed
recently as a way of improving randomized learning of FNNs by adjusting the
network parameters to the target function fluctuations. The method employs
logistic sigmoid activation functions for hidden nodes. In this study, we
introduce other activation functions, such as bipolar sigmoid, sine function,
saturating linear functions, reLU, and softplus. We derive formulas for their
parameters, i.e. weights and biases. In the simulation study, we evaluate the
performance of FNN data-driven learning with different activation functions.
The results indicate that the sigmoid activation functions perform much better
than others in the approximation of complex, fluctuated target functions.

<p>Determining important vertices in large graphs (e.g., Google's PageRank in
the case of the graph of the World Wide Web) facilitated the construction of
excellent web search engines, returning the most important hits corresponding
to the submitted user queries. Interestingly, finding important edges --
instead of vertices -- in large graphs has received much less attention until
now. Here we examine the human structural braingraph (or connectome),
identified by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) methods, with edges
connecting cortical and subcortical gray matter areas and weighted by fiber
strengths, measured by the number of the discovered fiber tracts along the
edge. We identify several "single" important edges in these braingraphs, whose
high or low weights imply the sex or the age of the subject observed. We call
these edges implicator edges since solely from their weight, one can infer the
sex of the subject with more than 67 \% accuracy or their age group with more
than 62\% accuracy. We argue that these brain connections are the most
important ones characterizing the sex or the age of the subjects. Surprisingly,
the edges implying the male sex are mostly located in the anterior parts of the
brain, while those implying the female sex are mostly in the posterior regions.
Additionally, most of the inter-hemispheric implicator edges are male ones,
while the intra-hemispheric ones are predominantly female edges. Our pioneering
method for finding the sex- or age implicator edges can also be applied for
characterizing other biological and medical properties, including
neurodegenerative- and psychiatric diseases besides the sex or the age of the
subject, if large and high-quality neuroimaging datasets become available.

<p>In this paper, we propose a novel pooling layer for graph neural networks
based on maximizing the mutual information between the pooled graph and the
input graph. Since the maximum mutual information is difficult to compute, we
employ the Shannon capacity of a graph as an inductive bias to our pooling
method. More precisely, we show that the input graph to the pooling layer can
be viewed as a representation of a noisy communication channel. For such a
channel, sending the symbols belonging to an independent set of the graph
yields a reliable and error-free transmission of information. We show that
reaching the maximum mutual information is equivalent to finding a maximum
weight independent set of the graph where the weights convey entropy contents.
Through this communication theoretic standpoint, we provide a distinct
perspective for posing the problem of graph pooling as maximizing the
information transmission rate across a noisy communication channel, implemented
by a graph neural network. We evaluate our method, referred to as Maximum
Entropy Weighted Independent Set Pooling (MEWISPool), on graph classification
tasks and the combinatorial optimization problem of the maximum independent
set. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves the
state-of-the-art and competitive results on graph classification tasks and the
maximum independent set problem in several benchmark datasets.

<p>Quantization based model compression serves as high performing and fast
approach for inference that yields highly compressed models compared to their
full-precision floating point counterparts. The most extreme quantization is a
1-bit representation of parameters such that they have only two possible
values, typically -1(0) or +1. Models that constrain the weights to binary
values enable efficient implementation of the ubiquitous dot product by
additions only without requiring floating point multiplications which is
beneficial for resources constrained inference. The main contribution of this
work is the introduction of a method to smooth the combinatorial problem of
determining a binary vector of weights to minimize the expected loss for a
given objective by means of empirical risk minimization with backpropagation.
This is achieved by approximating a multivariate binary state over the weights
utilizing a deterministic and differentiable transformation of real-valued
continuous parameters. The proposed method adds little overhead in training,
can be readily applied without any substantial modifications to the original
architecture, does not introduce additional saturating non-linearities or
auxiliary losses, and does not prohibit applying other methods for binarizing
the activations. It is demonstrated that contrary to common assertions made in
the literature, binary weighted networks can train well with the same standard
optimization techniques and similar hyperparameters settings as their
full-precision counterparts, namely momentum SGD with large learning rates and
$L_2$ regularization. The source code is publicly available at

<p>CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models have been successfully used for
segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in cardiac MRI (Magnetic Resonance
Imaging), providing clinical measurements.In practice, two questions arise with
deployment of CNNs: 1) when is it better to use a shallow model instead of a
deeper one? 2) how the size of a dataset might change the network performance?
We propose a framework to answer them, by experimenting with deep and shallow
versions of three U-Net families, trained from scratch in six subsets varying
from 100 to 10,000 images, different network sizes, learning rates and
regularization values. 1620 models were evaluated using 5-foldcross-validation
by loss and DICE. The results indicate that: sample size affects performance
more than architecture or hyper-parameters; in small samples the performance is
more sensitive to hyper-parameters than architecture; the performance
difference between shallow and deeper networks is not the same across families.

<p>Loneliness (i.e., the distressing feeling that often accompanies the
subjective sense of social disconnection) is detrimental to mental and physical
health, and deficits in self-reported feelings of being understood by others is
a risk factor for loneliness. What contributes to these deficits in lonely
people? We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to unobtrusively
measure the relative alignment of various aspects of people's mental processing
of naturalistic stimuli (specifically, videos) as they unfold over time. We
thereby tested whether lonely people actually process the world in
idiosyncratic ways, rather than only exaggerating or misperceiving how
dissimilar others' views are to their own (which could lead them to feel
misunderstood, even if they actually see the world similarly to those around
them). We found evidence for such idiosyncrasy: lonely individuals' neural
responses during free viewing of the videos were dissimilar to peers in their
communities, particularly in brain regions (e.g., regions of the default-mode
network) in which similar responses have been associated with shared
psychological perspectives and subjective understanding. Our findings were
robust even after controlling for demographic similarities, participants'
overall levels of objective social isolation, and their friendships with each
other. These results suggest that being surrounded predominantly by people who
see the world differently from oneself may be a risk factor for loneliness,
even if one is friends with them.

<p>Functional connectomes derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging
have long been used to understand the functional organization of the brain.
Nevertheless, a connectome is intrinsically linked to the atlas used to create
it. In other words, a connectome generated from one atlas is different in scale
and resolution compared to a connectome generated from another atlas. Being
able to map connectomes and derived results between different atlases without
additional pre-processing is a crucial step in improving interpretation and
generalization between studies that use different atlases. Here, we use optimal
transport, a powerful mathematical technique, to find an optimum mapping
between two atlases. This mapping is then used to transform time series from
one atlas to another in order to reconstruct a connectome. We validate our
approach by comparing transformed connectomes against their "gold-standard"
counterparts (i.e., connectomes generated directly from an atlas) and
demonstrate the utility of transformed connectomes by applying these
connectomes to predictive models based on a different atlas. We show that these
transformed connectomes are significantly similar to their "gold-standard"
counterparts and maintain individual differences in brain-behavior
associations, demonstrating both the validity of our approach and its utility
in downstream analyses. Overall, our approach is a promising avenue to increase
the generalization of connectome-based results across different atlases.

<p>The objective of this work is to relate muscle effort distributions to the
trajectory and resistance settings of a robotic exercise and rehabilitation
machine. Muscular effort distribution, representing the participation of each
muscle in the training activity, was measured with electromyography sensors
(EMG) and defined as the individual activation divided by the total muscle
group activation. A four degrees-of-freedom robot and its impedance control
system are used to create advanced exercise protocols whereby the user is asked
to follow a path against the machine's neutral path and resistance. In this
work, the robot establishes a zero-effort circular path, and the subject is
asked to follow an elliptical trajectory. The control system produces a
user-defined stiffness between the deviations from the neutral path and the
torque applied by the subject. The trajectory and resistance settings used in
the experiments were the orientation of the ellipse and a stiffness parameter.
Multiple combinations of these parameters were used to measure their effects on
the muscle effort distribution. An artificial neural network (ANN) used part of
the data for training the model. Then, the accuracy of the model was evaluated
using the rest of the data. The results show how the precision of the model is
lost over time. These outcomes show the complexity of the muscle dynamics for
long-term estimations suggesting the existence of time-varying dynamics
possibly associated with fatigue.

<p>We formally study how ensemble of deep learning models can improve test
accuracy, and how the superior performance of ensemble can be distilled into a
single model using knowledge distillation. We consider the challenging case
where the ensemble is simply an average of the outputs of a few independently
trained neural networks with the SAME architecture, trained using the SAME
algorithm on the SAME data set, and they only differ by the random seeds used
in the initialization.
</p>
<p>We empirically show that ensemble/knowledge distillation in deep learning
works very differently from traditional learning theory, especially differently
from ensemble of random feature mappings or the neural-tangent-kernel feature
mappings, and is potentially out of the scope of existing theorems. Thus, to
properly understand ensemble and knowledge distillation in deep learning, we
develop a theory showing that when data has a structure we refer to as
"multi-view", then ensemble of independently trained neural networks can
provably improve test accuracy, and such superior test accuracy can also be
provably distilled into a single model by training a single model to match the
output of the ensemble instead of the true label. Our result sheds light on how
ensemble works in deep learning in a way that is completely different from
traditional theorems, and how the "dark knowledge" is hidden in the outputs of
the ensemble -- that can be used in knowledge distillation -- comparing to the
true data labels. In the end, we prove that self-distillation can also be
viewed as implicitly combining ensemble and knowledge distillation to improve
test accuracy.

<p>One hope when using non-elitism in evolutionary computation is that the
ability to abandon the current-best solution aids leaving local optima. To
improve our understanding of this mechanism, we perform a rigorous runtime
analysis of a basic non-elitist evolutionary algorithm (EA), the
$(\mu,\lambda)$ EA, on the most basic benchmark function with a local optimum,
the jump function. We prove that for all reasonable values of the parameters
and the problem, the expected runtime of the $(\mu,\lambda)$~EA is, apart from
lower order terms, at least as large as the expected runtime of its elitist
counterpart, the $(\mu+\lambda)$~EA (for which we conduct the first runtime
analysis on jump functions to allow this comparison). Consequently, the ability
of the $(\mu,\lambda)$~EA to leave local optima to inferior solutions does not
lead to a runtime advantage.
</p>
<p>We complement this lower bound with an upper bound that, for broad ranges of
the parameters, is identical to our lower bound apart from lower order terms.
This is the first runtime result for a non-elitist algorithm on a multi-modal
problem that is tight apart from lower order terms.

<p>Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Published online: 06 July 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00479-z">doi:10.1038/s41583-021-00479-z</a></p>The capacity to navigate to a previously encountered or predicted reward, such as food or safety, is crucial for survival. Here, Sosa and Giocomo examine the neural mechanisms that encode reward location and propose key roles for the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex in storing and retrieving reward-related information in the brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/8uZYpJZhqko" width="1" />

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Inherited ataxias are a heterogenous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterised by progressive impairment of balance and coordination, typically leading to permanent and progressive disability. Diagnosis and management of these disorders incurs a range of direct and indirect financial costs. The aim of this study was to collect individual ataxia-related healthcare resources in a large cohort of individuals with different subtypes of inherited ataxia and calculate the associated cost of illness in the Republic of Ireland. One hundred twenty-nine respondents completed a cross-sectional study on healthcare resource utilisation for progressive ataxia in Ireland. Costs were calculated using a prevalence-based approach and bottom-up methodology. The COI for inherited ataxia in 2016 was €59,993 per person per year. Results were similar between participants with Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA, <em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 56), non-FRDA (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 18) and those with undetermined ataxia (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 55). Indirect costs, based on productivity losses by participants or caregivers, accounted for 52% of the cost of illness. Inherited ataxia is associated with significant health and social care costs. Further funding for inherited ataxia to ease the financial burden on patients, caregivers and healthcare system and improve standards of care compliance is warranted.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Motion perception deficits in dyslexia show a large intersubjective variability, partly reflecting genetic factors influencing brain architecture development. In previous work, we have demonstrated that dyslexic carriers of a mutation of the <em class="a-plus-plus">DCDC2</em> gene have a very strong impairment in motion perception. In the present study, we investigated structural white matter alterations associated with the poor motion perception in a cohort of twenty dyslexics with a subgroup carrying the DCDC2 gene deletion (DCDC2d+) and a subgroup without the risk variant (DCDC2d–). We observed significant deficits in motion contrast sensitivity and in motion direction discrimination accuracy at high contrast, stronger in the DCDC2d+ group. Both motion perception impairments correlated significantly with the fractional anisotropy in posterior ventral and dorsal tracts, including early visual pathways both along the optic radiation and in proximity of occipital cortex, MT and VWFA. However, the DCDC2d+ group showed stronger correlations between FA and motion perception impairments than the DCDC2d– group in early visual white matter bundles, including the optic radiations, and in ventral pathways located in the left inferior temporal cortex. Our results suggest that the DCDC2d+ group experiences higher vulnerability in visual motion processing even at early stages of visual analysis, which might represent a specific feature associated with the genotype and provide further neurobiological support to the visual-motion deficit account of dyslexia in a specific subpopulation.</p>

<p>Most mental disorders originate in childhood, and once symptoms present, a variety of psychosocial and cognitive maladjustments may arise. Although early childhood problems are generally associated with later mental health impairments and psychopathology, pluripotent transdiagnostic trajectories may manifest. Possible predictors range from behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms, genetic predispositions, environmental and social factors, and psychopathological comorbidity. They may manifest in altered neurodevelopmental trajectories and need to be validated capitalizing on large-scale multi-modal epidemiological longitudinal cohorts. Moreover, clinical and etiological variability between patients with the same disorders represents a major obstacle to develop effective treatments. Hence, in order to achieve stratification of patient samples opening the avenue of adapting and optimizing treatment for the individual, there is a need to integrate data from multi-dimensionally phenotyped clinical cohorts and cross-validate them with epidemiological cohort data. In the present review, we discuss these aspects in the context of externalizing and internalizing disorders summarizing the current state of knowledge, obstacles, and pitfalls. Although a large number of studies have already increased our understanding on neuropsychobiological mechanisms of mental disorders, it became also clear that this knowledge might only be the tip of the Eisberg and that a large proportion still remains unknown. We discuss prediction strategies and how the integration of different factors and methods may provide useful contributions to research and at the same time may inform prevention and intervention.</p>

<p>Consciousness is considered a result of specific neuronal processes and mechanisms in the brain. Various suggested neuronal mechanisms, including the information integration theory (IIT), global neuronal workspace theory (GNWS), and neuronal construction of time and space as in the context of the temporospatial theory of consciousness (TTC), have been laid forth. However, despite their focus on different neuronal mechanisms, these theories neglect the energetic-metabolic basis of the neuronal mechanisms that are supposed to yield consciousness. Based on the findings of physiology-induced (sleep), pharmacology-induced (general anesthesia), and pathology-induced [vegetative state/unresponsive wakeful syndrome (VS/UWS)] loss of consciousness in both human subjects and animals, we, in this study, suggest that the energetic-metabolic processes focusing on ATP, glucose, and γ-aminobutyrate/glutamate are indispensable for functional connectivity (FC) of normal brain networks that renders consciousness possible. Therefore, we describe the energetic-metabolic predispositions of consciousness (EPC) that complement the current theories focused on the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC).</p>

<p>The amygdala plays a crucial role in attaching emotional significance to environmental cues. Its intercalated cell masses (ITC) are tight clusters of GABAergic neurons, which are distributed around the basolateral amygdala complex. Distinct ITC clusters are involved in the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses. Previously, we have shown that fear memory retrieval reduces the AMPA/NMDA ratio at thalamic afferents to ITC neurons within the dorsal medio-paracapsular cluster. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the fear-mediated reduction in the AMPA/NMDA ratio at these synapses and, in particular, whether specific changes in the synaptic density of AMPA receptors underlie the observed change. To this aim, we used a detergent-digested freeze-fracture replica immunolabeling technique (FRIL) approach that enables to visualize the spatial distribution of intrasynaptic AMPA receptors at high resolution. AMPA receptors were detected using an antibody raised against an epitope common to all AMPA subunits. To visualize thalamic inputs, we virally transduced the posterior thalamic complex with Channelrhodopsin 2-YFP, which is anterogradely transported along axons. Using face-matched replica, we confirmed that the postsynaptic elements were ITC neurons due to their prominent expression of μ-opioid receptors. With this approach, we show that, following auditory fear conditioning in mice, the formation and retrieval of fear memory is linked to a significant reduction in the density of AMPA receptors, particularly at spine synapses formed by inputs of the posterior intralaminar thalamic and medial geniculate nuclei onto identified ITC neurons. Our study is one of the few that has directly linked the regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking to memory processes in identified neuronal networks, by showing that fear-memory induced reduction in AMPA/NMDA ratio at thalamic-ITC synapses is associated with a reduced postsynaptic AMPA receptor density.</p>

<p>Six mutations in the salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1)-coding gene have been identified in patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE-30) accompanied by autistic symptoms. Two of the mutations are non-sense mutations that truncate the C-terminal region of SIK1. It has been shown that the C-terminal-truncated form of SIK1 protein affects the subcellular distribution of SIK1 protein, tempting to speculate the relevance to the pathophysiology of the disorders. We generated SIK1-mutant (SIK1-MT) mice recapitulating the C-terminal-truncated mutations using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. SIK1-MT protein was distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas the distribution of wild-type SIK1 was restricted to the nucleus. We found the disruption of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) synaptic balance due to an increase in excitatory synaptic transmission and enhancement of neural excitability in the pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the medial prefrontal cortex in SIK1-MT mice. We also found the increased repetitive behavior and social behavioral deficits in SIK1-MT mice. The risperidone administration attenuated the neural excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission, but the disrupted E/I synaptic balance was unchanged, because it also reduced the inhibitory synaptic transmission. Risperidone also eliminated the repetitive behavior but not social behavioral deficits. These results indicate that risperidone has a role in decreasing neuronal excitability and excitatory synapses, ameliorating repetitive behavior in the SIK1-truncated mice.</p>

<p>Trigeminal nerve injury is known to cause severe persistent pain in the orofacial region. This pain is difficult to diagnose and treat. Recently, many animal studies have reported that rewiring of the peripheral and central nervous systems, non-neuronal cell activation, and up- and down-regulation of various molecules in non-neuronal cells are involved in the development of this pain following trigeminal nerve injury. However, there are many unknown mechanisms underlying the persistent orofacial pain associated with trigeminal nerve injury. In this review, we address recent animal data regarding the involvement of various molecules in the communication of neuronal and non-neuronal cells and examine the possible involvement of ascending pathways in processing pathological orofacial pain. We also address the clinical observations of persistent orofacial pain associated with trigeminal nerve injury and clinical approaches to their diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>Chromatin remodeling proteins utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to mobilize nucleosomes often creating accessibility for transcription factors within gene regulatory elements. Aberrant chromatin remodeling has diverse effects on neuroprogenitor homeostasis altering progenitor competence, proliferation, survival, or cell fate. Previous work has shown that inactivation of the ISWI genes, Smarca5 (encoding Snf2h) and Smarca1 (encoding Snf2l) have dramatic effects on brain development. Smarca5 conditional knockout mice have reduced progenitor expansion and severe forebrain hypoplasia, with a similar effect on the postnatal growth of the cerebellum. In contrast, Smarca1 mutants exhibited enlarged forebrains with delayed progenitor differentiation and increased neuronal output. Here, we utilized cerebellar granule neuron precursor (GNP) cultures from Smarca1 mutant mice (Ex6DEL) to explore the requirement for Snf2l on progenitor homeostasis. The Ex6DEL GNPs showed delayed differentiation upon plating that was not attributed to changes in the Sonic Hedgehog pathway but was associated with overexpression of numerous positive effectors of proliferation, including targets of Wnt activation. Transcriptome analysis identified increased expression of Fosb and Fosl2 while ATACseq experiments identified a large increase in chromatin accessibility at promoters many enriched for Fos/Jun binding sites. Nonetheless, the elevated proliferation index was transient and the Ex6DEL cultures initiated differentiation with a high concordance in gene expression changes to the wild type cultures. Genes specific to Ex6DEL differentiation were associated with an increased activation of the ERK signaling pathway. Taken together, this data provides the first indication of how Smarca1 mutations alter progenitor cell homeostasis and contribute to changes in brain size.</p>

<p>Compared with the traditional neurofeedback paradigm, the cognition-guided neurofeedback brain–computer interface (BCI) is a novel paradigm with significant effect on nicotine addiction. However, the cognition-guided neurofeedback BCI dataset is extremely lacking at present. This paper provides a BCI dataset based on a novel cognition-guided neurofeedback on nicotine addiction. Twenty-eight participants are recruited and involved in two visits of neurofeedback training. This cognition-guided neurofeedback includes two phases: an offline classifier construction and a real-time neurofeedback training. The original electroencephalogram (EEG) raw data of two phases are provided and evaluated in this paper. The event-related potential (ERP) amplitude and channel waveform suggest that our BCI dataset is of good quality and consistency. During neurofeedback training, the participants’ smoking cue reactivity patterns have a significant reduction. The mean accuracy of the multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) classifier can reach approximately 70%. This novel cognition-guided neurofeedback BCI dataset can be used to develop comparisons with other neurofeedback systems and provide a reference for the development of other BCI algorithms and neurofeedback paradigms on addiction.</p>

<p>MIIND is a software platform for easily and efficiently simulating the behaviour of interacting populations of point neurons governed by any 1D or 2D dynamical system. The simulator is entirely agnostic to the underlying neuron model of each population and provides an intuitive method for controlling the amount of noise which can significantly affect the overall behaviour. A network of populations can be set up quickly and easily using MIIND's XML-style simulation file format describing simulation parameters such as how populations interact, transmission delays, post-synaptic potentials, and what output to record. During simulation, a visual display of each population's state is provided for immediate feedback of the behaviour and population activity can be output to a file or passed to a Python script for further processing. The Python support also means that MIIND can be integrated into other software such as The Virtual Brain. MIIND's population density technique is a geometric and visual method for describing the activity of each neuron population which encourages a deep consideration of the dynamics of the neuron model and provides insight into how the behaviour of each population is affected by the behaviour of its neighbours in the network. For 1D neuron models, MIIND performs far better than direct simulation solutions for large populations. For 2D models, performance comparison is more nuanced but the population density approach still confers certain advantages over direct simulation. MIIND can be used to build neural systems that bridge the scales between an individual neuron model and a population network. This allows researchers to maintain a plausible path back from mesoscopic to microscopic scales while minimising the complexity of managing large numbers of interconnected neurons. In this paper, we introduce the MIIND system, its usage, and provide implementation details where appropriate.</p>

<p>Objects which a human agent controls by efferent activities (such as real or virtual tools) can be perceived by the agent as belonging to his or her body. This suggests that what an agent counts as “body” is plastic, depending on what she or he controls. Yet there are possible limitations for such momentary plasticity. One of these limitations is that sensations stemming from the body (e.g., proprioception) and sensations stemming from objects outside the body (e.g., vision) are not integrated if they do not sufficiently “match”. What “matches” and what does not is conceivably determined by long–term experience with the perceptual changes that body movements typically produce. Children have accumulated less sensorimotor experience than adults have. Consequently, they express higher flexibility to integrate body-internal and body-external signals, independent of their “match” as suggested by rubber hand illusion studies. However, children’s motor performance in tool use is more affected by mismatching body-internal and body-external action effects than that of adults, possibly because of less developed means to overcome such mismatches. We review research on perception-action interactions, multisensory integration, and developmental psychology to build bridges between these research fields. By doing so, we account for the flexibility of the sense of body ownership for actively controlled events and its development through ontogeny. This gives us the opportunity to validate the suggested mechanisms for generating ownership by investigating their effects in still developing and incomplete stages in children. We suggest testable predictions for future studies investigating both body ownership and motor skills throughout the lifespan.</p>

<p>Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for major depressive disorder. Recently, there has been increasing attention to evaluate the effect of ECT on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). This study aims to compare rs-fMRI of depressive disorder (DEP) patients with healthy participants, investigate whether pre-ECT dynamic functional network connectivity network (dFNC) estimated from patients rs-fMRI is associated with an eventual ECT outcome, and explore the effect of ECT on brain network states.</p><p>Method: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 119 patients with depression or depressive disorder (DEP) (76 females), and 61 healthy (HC) participants (34 females), with an age mean of 52.25 (N = 180) years old. The pre-ECT and post-ECT Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were 25.59 ± 6.14 and 11.48 ± 9.07, respectively. Twenty-four independent components from default mode (DMN) and cognitive control network (CCN) were extracted, using group-independent component analysis from pre-ECT and post-ECT rs-fMRI. Then, the sliding window approach was used to estimate the pre-and post-ECT dFNC of each subject. Next, k-means clustering was separately applied to pre-ECT dFNC and post-ECT dFNC to assess three distinct states from each participant. We calculated the amount of time each subject spends in each state, which is called “occupancy rate” or OCR. Next, we compared OCR values between HC and DEP participants. We also calculated the partial correlation between pre-ECT OCRs and HDRS change while controlling for age, gender, and site. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of ECT by comparing pre- and post-ECT OCR of DEP and HC participants.</p><p>Results: The main findings include (1) depressive disorder (DEP) patients had significantly lower OCR values than the HC group in state 2, where connectivity between cognitive control network (CCN) and default mode network (DMN) was relatively higher than other states (corrected p = 0.015), (2) Pre-ECT OCR of state, with more negative connectivity between CCN and DMN components, is linked with the HDRS changes (R = 0.23 corrected p = 0.03). This means that those DEP patients who spent less time in this state showed more HDRS change, and (3) The post-ECT OCR analysis suggested that ECT increased the amount of time DEP patients spent in state 2 (corrected p = 0.03).</p><p>Conclusion: Our finding suggests that dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) features, estimated from CCN and DMN, show promise as a predictive biomarker of the ECT outcome of DEP patients. Also, this study identifies a possible underlying mechanism associated with the ECT effect on DEP patients.</p>

<p>White matter makes up about fifty percent of the human brain. Maturation of white matter accompanies biological development and undergoes the most dramatic changes during childhood and adolescence. Despite the advances in neuroimaging techniques, controversy concerning spatial, and temporal patterns of myelination, as well as the degree to which the microstructural characteristics of white matter can vary in a healthy brain as a function of age, gender and cognitive abilities still exists. In a selective review we describe methods of assessing myelination and evaluate effects of age and gender in nine major fiber tracts, highlighting their role in higher-order cognitive functions. Our findings suggests that myelination indices vary by age, fiber tract, and hemisphere. Effects of gender were also identified, although some attribute differences to methodological factors or social and learning opportunities. Findings point to further directions of research that will improve our understanding of the complex myelination-behavior relation across development that may have implications for educational and clinical practice.</p>

<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating and chronic fear-based disorder. Pavlovian fear conditioning protocols have long been utilised to manipulate and study these fear-based disorders. Contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is a particular Pavlovian conditioning procedure that pairs fear with a particular context. Studies on the neural mechanisms underlying the development of contextual fear memories have identified the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), or more specifically, the pre-limbic cortex (PL) of the mPFC as essential for the expression of contextual fear. Despite this, little research has explored the role of the PL in contextual fear memory maintenance or examined the role of neuronal mitogen-activated protein kinase (pMAPK; ERK 1/2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and IBA-1 in microglia in the PL as a function of Pavlovian fear conditioning. The current study was designed to evaluate how the maintenance of two different long-term contextual fear memories leads to changes in the number of immune-positive cells for two well-known markers of neural activity (phosphorylation of MAPK and BDNF) and microglia (IBA-1). Therefore, the current experiment is designed to assess the number of immune-positive pMAPK and BDNF cells, microglial number, and morphology in the PL following CFC. Specifically, 2 weeks following conditioning, pMAPK, BDNF, and microglia number and morphology were evaluated using well-validated antibodies and immunohistochemistry (n = 12 rats per group). A standard CFC protocol applied to rats led to increases in pMAPK, BDNF expression and microglia number as compared to control conditions. Rats in the unpaired fear conditioning (UFC) procedure, despite having equivalent levels of fear to context, did not have any change in pMAPK, BDNF expression and microglia number in the PL compared to the control conditions. These data suggest that alterations in the expression of pMAPK, BDNF, and microglia in the PL can occur for up to 2 weeks following CFC. Together the data suggest that MAPK, BDNF, and microglia within the PL of the mPFC may play a role in contextual fear memory maintenance.</p>

<p>The immune system is crucial for defending against various invaders, such as pathogens, cancer cells or misfolded proteins. With increasing age, the diminishing immune response, known as immunosenescence, becomes evident. Concomitantly, some diseases like infections, autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer, accumulate with age. Different cell types are part of the innate immunity response and produce soluble factors, cytokines, chemokines, and type I interferons. Improper maturation of innate immune cells or their dysfunction have been linked to numerous age-related diseases. In parallel to the occurrence of the many functional facets of the immune response, a symbiotic microbiota had been acquired. For the relevant and situation-dependent function of the immune system the microbiome plays an essential role because it fine-tunes the immune system and its responses during life. Nevertheless, how the age-related alterations in the microbiota are reflected in the innate immune system, is still poorly understood. With this review, we provide an up-to-date overview on our present understanding of the gut microbiota effects on innate immunity, with a particular emphasis on aging-associated changes in the gut microbiota and the implications for the brain innate immune response.</p>

<p>Alterations in the affective component of pain perception are related to the development of chronic pain and may contribute to the increased vulnerability to pain observed in aging. The present study analyzed age-related changes in resting-state brain activity and their possible relation to an increased pain perception in older adults. For this purpose, we compared EEG current source density and fMRI functional-connectivity at rest in older (n = 20, 66.21 ± 3.08 years) and younger adults (n = 21, 20.71 ± 2.30 years) and correlated those brain activity parameters with pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings elicited by painful stimulation. We found an age-related increase in beta2 and beta3 activity in temporal, frontal, and limbic areas, and a decrease in alpha activity in frontal areas. Moreover, older participants displayed increased functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insula with precentral and postcentral gyrus. Finally, ACC beta3 activity was positively correlated with pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings in older, and ACC-precentral/postcentral gyrus connectivity was positively correlated with unpleasantness ratings in older and younger participants. These results reveal that ACC resting-state hyperactivity is a stable trait of brain aging and may underlie their characteristic altered pain perception.</p>

<p>DNA methylation at the gene promoter region is reportedly involved in the development of intracranial aneurysm (IA). This study aims to investigate the methylation levels of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in IA, as well as its potential to predict IA. Forty-eight patients with IA and 48 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited into this study. Methylation levels of CpG sites were determined via bisulfite pyrosequencing. The PTBP1 levels in the blood were determined using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test. Significant differences were found between IAs and controls in CpG1 (p = 0.001), CpG2 (p &lt; 0.001), CpG3 (p = 0.037), CpG4 (p = 0.003), CpG5 (p = 0.006), CpG6 (p = 0.02), and mean methylation (p &lt; 0.001). The mRNA level of PTBP1 in the blood was much lower in IAs compared with controls (p = 0.002), and the PTBP1 expression was significantly associated with DNA methylation promoter levels in individuals (r = −0.73, p &lt; 0.0001). In addition, stratification analysis comparing smokers and non-smokers revealed that tobacco smokers had significantly higher levels of DNA methylation in PTBP1 than non-smokers (p = 0.002). However, no statistical difference in PTBP1 methylation was found between ruptured and unruptured IA groups (p &gt; 0.05). The ROC analyses of curves revealed that PTBP1 methylation may be a predictor of IA regardless of sex (both sexes, area under curve (AUC) = 0.78, p &lt; 0.0001; male, AUC = 0.76, p = 0.002; female, AUC = 0.79, p &lt; 0.0001). These findings suggest that long-term tobacco smoke exposure led to DNA methylation in the promoter region of the PTBP1 gene, which further decreased PTBP1 gene expression and participated in the pathogenesis of IA. The methylation of PTBP1 may be a potential predictive marker for the occurrence of IA.</p>

Introduction<p>In Alzheimer’s disease, the severity of symptoms is linked to a loss of synaptic density and the spread of pathologically hyperphosphorylated tau. The established cerebrospinal fluid markers Aβ, tau and phospho-tau reflect the histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease but do not indicate disease progression. Such markers are of special interest, especially for trials of disease modifying drugs. Microvesicles are produced by stressed cells and reflect part of the metabolism of their cells of origin. Therefore, we investigated microvesicles of neuronal origin in cerebrospinal fluid.</p>Materials and Methods<p>We used flow cytometry to analyze microvesicles carrying tau, phospho-tau-Thr181, phospho-tau-Ser202Thr205, synaptophysin, and SNAP-25 in the cerebrospinal fluid of 19 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and 15 non-inflammatory neurological disease controls.</p>Results<p>The percentages of synaptophysin-bearing microvesicles were significantly higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer’s disease than in the CSF of non-inflammatory neurological disease controls. Tau, phospho-tau-Thr181, phospho-tau-Ser202Thr205, and SNAP-25 did not differ between the groups. The percentages of synaptophysin-bearing vesicles distinguished patients with Alzheimer’s disease from the controls (AUC = 0.81).</p>Conclusion<p>The loss of synapses in Alzheimer’s disease may be reflected by synaptophysin-bearing microvesicles in the cerebrospinal fluid. Future studies are needed to investigate the possibility of using these MVs as a marker to determine the activity of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Introduction: The main driver for increased stroke prevalence is the aging of the population; however, the best evidenced-based strategies for stroke treatment and prevention are not always followed for older patients. Therefore, the aim was studying the association of age with clinical outcomes (mortality and functional disability) in stroke patients who underwent cerebral reperfusion therapy at hospital discharge and 90 days after ictus.</p><p>Methods: This was a retrospective (stroke databank analysis) cohort study of participants who had been diagnosed with ischemic stroke and undergone intravenous cerebral reperfusion therapy or mechanical thrombectomy. The variable of interest was patient age, which was categorized into four groups: (1) up to 59 years; (2) 60 to 69 years; (3) 70 to 79 years old; and (4) above 79 years. The primary outcome was mortality at hospital discharge and 90 days after stroke, and the secondary outcome was functional capacity at hospital discharge and 90 days after stroke.</p><p>Results: A total of 281 patients was included in the study (235 treated by thrombolysis alone, and 46 treated with mechanical thrombectomy). The mean age of the total sample was 67 ± 13.1 years. The oldest patients had the most unfavorable outcomes, except for mortality rate, at hospital discharge (mRS &gt; 2; OR: 1.028; 95% CI 1.005 to 1.051; p = 0.017; mRS &gt; 3; OR: 1.043, 95% CI 1.018 to 1.069; p = 0.001) and 90 days after stroke (mRS &gt; 2; OR: 1.028; 95% CI 1.005 to 1.051; p = 0.017; mRS &gt; 3; OR: 1.043, 95% CI 1.018 to 1.069; p = 0.001).</p><p>Conclusion: Cerebral reperfusion was a viable treatment for ischemic stroke in both elderly and very elderly patients, as it did not increase mortality. However, it was observed that older individuals had worse functional outcomes at hospital discharge and 90 days after stroke.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/70591">Distinct signatures of calcium activity in brain mural cells</a></h4>

Pericytes have been implicated in various neuropathologies, yet, little is known about their function and signaling pathways in health. Here, we characterized calcium dynamics of cortical mural cells in anesthetized or awake <i>Pdgfrb</i>-CreERT2;Rosa26 mice and in acute brain slices. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and ensheathing pericytes (EPs), also named as terminal vascular SMCs, revealed similar calcium dynamics <i>in vivo</i>. In contrast, calcium signals in capillary pericytes (CPs) were irregular, higher in frequency and occurred in cellular microdomains. In the absence of the vessel constricting agent U46619 in acute slices, SMCs and EPs revealed only sparse calcium signals whereas CPs retained their spontaneous calcium activity. Interestingly, chemogenetic activation of neurons <i>in vivo</i> and acute elevations of extracellular potassium in brain slices strongly decreased calcium activity in CPs. We propose that neuronal activation and an extracellular increase in potassium suppress calcium activity in CPs, likely mediated by Kir2.2 and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/69698">Improving statistical power in severe malaria genetic association studies by augmenting phenotypic precision</a></h4>

Severe falciparum malaria has substantially affected human evolution. Genetic association studies of patients with clinically defined severe malaria and matched population controls have helped characterise human genetic susceptibility to severe malaria, but phenotypic imprecision compromises discovered associations. In areas of high malaria transmission the diagnosis of severe malaria in young children and, in particular, the distinction from bacterial sepsis, is imprecise. We developed a probabilistic diagnostic model of severe malaria using platelet and white count data. Under this model we re-analysed clinical and genetic data from 2,220 Kenyan children with clinically defined severe malaria and 3,940 population controls, adjusting for phenotype mis-labelling. Our model, validated by the distribution of sickle trait, estimated that approximately one third of cases did not have severe malaria. We propose a data-tilting approach for case-control studies with phenotype mis-labelling and show that this reduces false discovery rates and improves statistical power in genome-wide association studies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68809">Novel neuroanatomical integration and scaling define avian brain shape evolution and development</a></h4>

How do large and unique brains evolve? Historically, comparative neuroanatomical studies have attributed the evolutionary genesis of highly encephalized brains to deviations along, as well as from, conserved scaling relationships among brain regions. However, the relative contributions of these concerted (integrated) and mosaic (modular) processes as drivers of brain evolution remain unclear, especially in non-mammalian groups. While proportional brain sizes have been the predominant metric used to characterize brain morphology to date, we perform a high-density geometric morphometric analysis on the encephalized brains of crown birds (Neornithes or Aves) compared to their stem taxa—the non-avialan coelurosaurian dinosaurs and <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. When analyzed together with developmental neuroanatomical data of model archosaurs (<i>Gallus</i>, <i>Alligator</i>), crown birds exhibit a distinct allometric relationship that dictates their brain evolution and development. Furthermore, analyses by neuroanatomical regions reveal that the acquisition of this derived shape-to-size scaling relationship occurred in a mosaic pattern, where the avian-grade optic lobe and cerebellum evolved first among non-avialan dinosaurs, followed by major changes to the evolutionary and developmental dynamics of cerebrum shape after the origin of Avialae. Notably, the brain of crown birds is a more integrated structure than non-avialan archosaurs, implying that diversification of brain morphologies within Neornithes proceeded in a more coordinated manner, perhaps due to spatial constraints and abbreviated growth period. Collectively, these patterns demonstrate a plurality in evolutionary processes that generate encephalized brains in archosaurs and across vertebrates.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66876">Method development and characterisation of the low-molecular-weight peptidome of human wound fluids</a></h4>

The normal wound healing process is characterised by proteolytic events, whereas infection results in dysfunctional activations by endogenous and bacterial proteases. Peptides, downstream reporters of these proteolytic actions, could therefore serve as a promising tool for diagnosis of wounds. Using mass-spectrometry analyses, we here for the first time characterise the peptidome of human wound fluids. Sterile post-surgical wound fluids were found to contain a high degree of peptides in comparison to human plasma. Analyses of the peptidome from uninfected healing wounds and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> -infected wounds identify unique peptide patterns of various proteins, including coagulation and complement factors, proteases, and antiproteinases. Together, the work defines a workflow for analysis of peptides derived from wound fluids and demonstrates a proof-of-concept that such fluids can be used for analysis of qualitative differences of peptide patterns from larger patient cohorts, providing potential biomarkers for wound healing and infection.

<b>Introduction:</b> In Europe, women can expect to live on average 82 years, and men 75 years. Forecasting how life expectancy will develop in the future is essential for society. Most forecasts rely on a mechanical extrapolation of past mortality trends, which leads to unreliable outcomes because of temporal fluctuations in the past trends due to lifestyle 'epidemics'.

Ornithischian dinosaurs were ecologically prominent herbivores of the Mesozoic Era that achieved a global distribution by the onset of the Cretaceous. The ornithischian body plan is aberrant relative to other ornithodiran clades, and crucial details of their early evolution remain obscure. We present a new, fully articulated skeleton of the early branching ornithischian <i>Heterodontosaurus tucki</i>. Phase-contrast enhanced synchrotron data of this new specimen reveal a suite of novel postcranial features unknown in any other ornithischian, with implications for the early evolution of the group. These features include a large, anteriorly projecting sternum; bizarre, paddle-shaped sternal ribs; and a full gastral basket – the first recovered in Ornithischia. These unusual anatomical traits provide key information on the evolution of the ornithischian body plan and suggest functional shifts in the ventilatory apparatus occurred close to the base of the clade. We complement these anatomical data with a quantitative analysis of ornithischian pelvic architecture, which allows us to make a specific, stepwise hypothesis for their ventilatory evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65930">Rapid mechanical stimulation of inner-ear hair cells by photonic pressure</a></h4>

Hair cells, the receptors of the inner ear, detect sounds by transducing mechanical vibrations into electrical signals. From the top surface of each hair cell protrudes a mechanical antenna, the hair bundle, which the cell uses to detect and amplify auditory stimuli, thus sharpening frequency selectivity and providing a broad dynamic range. Current methods for mechanically stimulating hair bundles are too slow to encompass the frequency range of mammalian hearing and are plagued by inconsistencies. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a method to move individual hair bundles with photonic force. This technique uses an optical fiber whose tip is tapered to a diameter of a few micrometers and endowed with a ball lens to minimize divergence of the light beam. Here we describe the fabrication, characterization, and application of this optical system and demonstrate the rapid application of photonic force to vestibular and cochlear hair cells.

Frequent nightly arousals typical for sleep disorders cause daytime fatigue and present health risks. As such arousals are often short, partial, or occur locally within the brain, reliable characterization in rodent models of sleep disorders and in human patients is challenging. We found that the EEG spectral composition of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) in healthy mice shows an infraslow (~50 s) interval over which microarousals appear preferentially. NREMS could hence be vulnerable to abnormal arousals on this time scale. Chronic pain is well-known to disrupt sleep. In the spared-nerve-injury (SNI) mouse model of chronic neuropathic pain, we found more numerous local cortical arousals accompanied by heart rate increases in hindlimb primary somatosensory, but not in prelimbic, cortices, although sleep macroarchitecture appeared unaltered. Closed-loop mechanovibrational stimulation further revealed higher sensory arousability. Chronic pain thus preserved conventional sleep measures but resulted in elevated spontaneous and evoked arousability. We develop a novel moment-to-moment probing of NREMS vulnerability and propose that chronic pain-induced sleep complaints arise from perturbed arousability.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64932">Castration delays epigenetic aging and feminizes DNA methylation at androgen-regulated loci</a></h4>

In mammals, females generally live longer than males. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underpinning sex-dependent longevity are currently unclear. Epigenetic clocks are powerful biological biomarkers capable of precisely estimating chronological age and identifying novel factors influencing the aging rate using only DNA methylation data. In this study, we developed the first epigenetic clock for domesticated sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>), which can predict chronological age with a median absolute error of 5.1 months. We have discovered that castrated male sheep have a decelerated aging rate compared to intact males, mediated at least in part by the removal of androgens. Furthermore, we identified several androgen-sensitive CpG dinucleotides that become progressively hypomethylated with age in intact males, but remain stable in castrated males and females. Comparable sex-specific methylation differences in <i>MKLN1</i> also exist in bat skin and a range of mouse tissues that have high androgen receptor expression, indicating that it may drive androgen-dependent hypomethylation in divergent mammalian species. In characterizing these sites, we identify biologically plausible mechanisms explaining how androgens drive male-accelerated aging.

Imbalances in bone formation and resorption cause osteoporosis. Mounting evidence supports that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) implicates in this process. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a plant-derived small molecular TrkB agonist, mimics the functions of BDNF. We show that both BDNF and 7,8-DHF promoted the proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. These effects might be attributed to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as the expression of cyclin D1, phosphorylated-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β), β-catenin, Runx2, Osterix and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were all significantly up-regulated. Knockdown of β-catenin restrained the up-regulation of Runx2 and Osterix stimulated by 7,8-DHF. In particular, blocking TrkB by its specific inhibitor K252a suppressed 7,8-DHF-induced osteoblastic proliferation, differentiation and expression of osteoblastogenic genes. Moreover, BDNF and 7,8-DHF repressed osteoclastic differentiation of RAW264.7 cells. The transcription factor c-fos and osteoclastic genes such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9), Adamts5 were inhibited by 7,8-DHF. More importantly, 7,8-DHF attenuated bone loss, improved trabecular microarchitecture, tibial biomechanical properties and bone biochemical indexes in an ovariectomy (OVX) rat model. The current work highlights the dual regulatory effects that 7,8-DHF exerts on bone remodeling.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64819">Dynamics of primitive streak regression controls the fate of neuromesodermal progenitors in the chicken embryo</a></h4>

In classical descriptions of vertebrate development, the segregation of the three embryonic germ layers completes by the end of gastrulation. Body formation then proceeds in a head to tail fashion by progressive deposition of lineage-committed progenitors during regression of the primitive streak (PS) and tail bud (TB). The identification by retrospective clonal analysis of a population of neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) contributing to both musculoskeletal precursors (paraxial mesoderm) and spinal cord during axis formation challenged these notions. However, classical fate mapping studies of the PS region in amniotes have so far failed to provide direct evidence for such bipotential cells at the single-cell level. Here, using lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing in the chicken embryo, we identify a resident cell population of the anterior PS epiblast, which contributes to neural and mesodermal lineages in trunk and tail. These cells initially behave as monopotent progenitors as classically described and only acquire a bipotential fate later, in more posterior regions. We show that NMPs exhibit a conserved transcriptomic signature during axis elongation but lose their epithelial characteristicsin the TB. Posterior to anterior gradients of convergence speed and ingression along the PS lead to asymmetric exhaustion of PS mesodermal precursor territories. Through limited ingression and increased proliferation, NMPs are maintained and amplified as a cell population which constitute the main progenitors in the TB. Together, our studies provide a novel understanding of the PS and TB contribution through the NMPs to the formation of the body of amniote embryos.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58144">Inversion of pheromone preference optimizes foraging in <i>C. elegans</i></a></h4>

Foraging animals have to locate food sources that are usually patchily distributed and subject to competition. Deciding when to leave a food patch is challenging and requires the animal to integrate information about food availability with cues signaling the presence of other individuals (e.g., pheromones). To study how social information transmitted via pheromones can aid foraging decisions, we investigated the behavioral responses of the model animal <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to food depletion and pheromone accumulation in food patches. We experimentally show that animals consuming a food patch leave it at different times and that the leaving time affects the animal preference for its pheromones. In particular, worms leaving early are attracted to their pheromones, while worms leaving later are repelled by them. We further demonstrate that the inversion from attraction to repulsion depends on associative learning and, by implementing a simple model, we highlight that it is an adaptive solution to optimize food intake during foraging.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.06.451323v1?rss=1">Social experience alters oxytocinergic modulation in the nucleus accumbens of female prairie voles</a></h4>

Social relationships are dynamic and evolve with shared and personal experiences. Whether the functional role of social neuromodulators also evolves with experience to shape the trajectory of relationships is unknown. We utilized pair bonding in the socially monogamous prairie voles as an example of socio-sexual experience that dramatically alters behaviors displayed toward other individuals. We investigated oxytocin-dependent modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens as a function of pair bonding status. We found that an oxytocin receptor agonist decreases the amplitude of spontaneous Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents (EPSCs) in sexually naive virgin, but not pair-bonded, female voles, while it increases the amplitude of electrically evoked EPSCs in paired voles, but not in virgins. This oxytocin-dependent potentiation of synaptic transmission relies on the de novo coupling between oxytocin receptor signaling and endocannabinoid CB1 receptor signaling in pair bonded voles. Blocking CB1 receptors after pair bond formation increases the occurrence of a specific form of social rejection - defensive upright response - that is displayed towards the partner but not towards a novel individual. Altogether, our results demonstrate that oxytocin's action in the nucleus accumbens is changed through social experience in a way that regulates the trajectory of social interactions as the relationship with the partner unfolds, potentially promoting the maintenance of a pair bond by inhibiting aggressive responses. These results provide a mechanism by which social experience and context shift oxytocinergic signaling to impact neural and behavioral responses to social cues.

Throughout development, the brain transits from early highly synchronous activity patterns to a mature state with sparse and decorrelated neural activity, yet the mechanisms underlying this process are unknown. The developmental transition has important functional consequences, as the latter state allows for more efficient storage, retrieval and processing of information. Here, we show that, in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), neural activity during the first two postnatal weeks decorrelates following specific spatial patterns. This process is accompanied by a concomitant tilting of excitation/inhibition (E-I) ratio towards inhibition. Using optogenetic manipulations and neural network modeling, we show that the two phenomena are mechanistically linked, and that a relative increase of inhibition drives the decorrelation of neural activity. Accordingly, in two mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, subtle alterations in E-I ratio are associated with specific impairments in the correlational structure of spike trains. Finally, capitalizing on EEG data from newborn babies, we show that an analogous developmental transition takes place also in the human brain. Thus, changes in E-I ratio control the (de)correlation of neural activity and, by these means, its developmental imbalance might contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Calcium dynamics into astrocytes influence the activity of nearby neuronal structures. However, because previous reports show that astrocytic calcium signals largely mirror neighboring neuronal activity, current information coding models neglect astrocytes. Using simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging of astrocytes and neurons in the hippocampus of mice navigating a virtual environment, we demonstrate that astrocytic calcium signals actively encode spatial information. Calcium events carrying spatial information occurred in topographically organized astrocytic subregions. Importantly, astrocytes encoded spatial information that was complementary and synergistic to that carried by neurons, improving spatial position decoding when astrocytic signals were considered alongside neuronal ones. These results suggest that the complementary place-dependence of localized astrocytic calcium signals regulates clusters of nearby synapses, enabling dynamic, context-dependent, variations in population coding within brain circuits.

Multidimensional MRI is an emerging approach that simultaneously encodes water relaxation (T1 and T2) and mobility (diffusion) and replaces voxel-averaged values with subvoxel distributions of those MR properties. While conventional (i.e., voxel-averaged) MRI methods cannot adequately quantify the microscopic heterogeneity of biological tissue, using subvoxel information allows to selectively map a specific T1-T2-diffusion spectral range that corresponds to a group of tissue elements. The major obstacle to the adoption of rich, multidimensional MRI protocols for diagnostic or monitoring purposes is the prolonged scan time. Our main goal in the present study is to evaluate the performance of a nonlocal estimation of multispectral magnitudes (NESMA) filter on reduced datasets to limit the total acquisition time required for reliable multidimensional MRI characterization of the brain. Here we focused and reprocessed results from a recent study that identified potential imaging biomarkers of axonal injury pathology from the joint analysis of multidimensional MRI, in particular voxelwise T1-T2 and diffusion-T2 spectra in human Corpus Callosum, and histopathological data. We tested the performance of NESMA and its effect on the accuracy of the injury biomarker maps, relative to the co-registered histological reference. Noise reduction improved the accuracy of the resulting injury biomarker maps, while permitting data reduction of 35.7% and 59.6% from the full dataset for T1-T2 and MD-T2 cases, respectively. As successful clinical proof-of-concept applications of multidimensional MRI are continuously being introduced, reliable and robust noise removal and consequent acquisition acceleration would advance the field towards clinically-feasible diagnostic multidimensional MRI protocols.

The olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay for odor processing, receives dense GABAergic and cholinergic long-range projections from basal forebrain (BF) nuclei that provide information about the internal state and behavioral context of the animal. However, the targets, impact and dynamics of these afferents are still unclear. I studied how BF synaptic inputs modulate activity in diverse subtypes of periglomerular (PG) interneurons using optogenetic stimulation and loose cell-attached or whole-cell patch-clamp recording in OB slices from adult mice. GABAergic BF inputs potently blocked PG cells firing except in a minority of calretinin-expressing cells in which GABA release elicited spiking. Parallel cholinergic projections excited a previously overlooked PG cell subtype via synaptic activation of M1 muscarinic receptors. Low frequency stimulation of the cholinergic axons drove persistent firing in these PG cells thereby increasing tonic inhibition in principal neurons. Taken together, these findings suggest that modality-specific BF inputs can orchestrate inhibition in OB glomeruli using multiple, potentially independent, inhibitory or excitatory target-specific pathways.

The ventricular zone (VZ) of the nervous system contains radial glia cells that were originally considered relatively homogenous in their gene expression. However, a detailed characterization of transcriptional diversity in these VZ cells has not been reported. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity of neural progenitors within the VZ and subventricular zone (SVZ) of the mouse embryonic cortex and ganglionic eminences (GEs). By using a transgenic mouse line to enrich for VZ cells, we detect significant transcriptional heterogeneity within VZ and SVZ progenitors, both between forebrain regions and within spatial subdomains of specific GEs. Additionally, we observe differential gene expression between E12.5 and E14.5 VZ cells, which could provide insights into temporal changes in cell fate. Together, our results reveal a previously unknown spatial and temporal genetic diversity of telencephalic VZ cells that will aid our understanding of initial fate decisions in the forebrain.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.05.451213v1?rss=1">Daily oscillation of the excitation/inhibition ratio is disrupted in two mouse models of autism</a></h4>

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder involving sensory processing abnormalities. Alterations to the balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I ratio) are postulated to underlie behavioral phenotypes in ASD patients and mouse models. However, in primary visual cortex (V1) of wild type mice, the E/I ratio is not a fixed value, but rather oscillates across the 24h day. Therefore, we hypothesized that the E/I oscillation, rather than the overall E/I ratio, may be disrupted in ASD mouse models. To this end, we measured the E/I ratio in Fmr1 KO and BTBR mice, models of syndromic and idiopathic ASD, respectively. We found that the E/I ratio is dysregulated in both models, but in different ways: the oscillation is flattened in Fmr1 KO and phase-shifted in BTBR mice. These phenotypes cannot be explained by altered sleep timing, which was largely normal in both lines. Furthermore, we found that E/I dysregulation occurs due to alterations in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in both models. These findings provide a crucial perspective on the E/I ratio in ASD, suggesting that ASD phenotypes may be produced by a mismatch of E/I to the appropriate behavioral state, rather than alterations to overall E/I levels per se.

D-amino acids are increasingly recognized as important signaling molecules in the mammalian central nervous system. However, the D-stereoisomer of the amino acid with the fastest in vitro spontaneous racemization rate, cysteine, has not been examined in mammals. Using chiral high- performance liquid chromatography and an stereospecific luciferase assay, we identify endogenous D- cysteine in the mammalian brain. We identify serine racemase (SR), which generates the NMDA glutamate receptor co-agonist D-serine, as a candidate biosynthetic enzyme for D-cysteine. Levels of D- cysteine are enriched over twentyfold in the embryonic mouse brain compared to the adult. D-cysteine reduces the proliferation of cultured mouse embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by approximately 50%, effects not shared with D-serine or L-cysteine. The antiproliferative effect of D-cysteine is mediated by the transcription factors FoxO1 and FoxO3a. The selective influence of D-cysteine on NPC proliferation is reflected in overgrowth and aberrant lamination of the cerebral cortex in neonatal SR knockout mice. Finally, we perform an unbiased screen for D-cysteine-binding proteins in NPCs by immunoprecipitation with a D-cysteine-specific antibody followed by mass spectrometry. This approach identifies myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) as a putative D-cysteine-binding protein. Together, these results establish endogenous mammalian D-cysteine and implicate it as a physiologic regulator of NPC homeostasis in the developing brain.

The voltage-gated potassium channel responsible for controlling photoreceptor signaling is a heteromeric complex of Kv2.1 subunits with a regulatory Kv8.2 subunit. Kv2.1/Kv8.2 channels are localized to the photoreceptor inner segment and carry IKx, largely responsible for setting the photoreceptor resting membrane potential. Mutations in Kv8.2 result in childhood-onset Cone Dystrophy with Supernormal Rod Response (CDSRR). We generated a Kv8.2 knockout (KO) mouse and examined retinal signaling and photoreceptor degeneration to gain deeper insight into the complex phenotypes of this disease. Using electroretinograms we show that there is a tradeoff between delayed or reduced signaling from rods depending on the intensity of the light stimulus, consistent with reduced capacity for light-evoked changes in membrane potential. The delayed response was not seen ex vivo where extracellular potassium levels are the same, so we conclude the in vivo alteration is influenced by ionic imbalance. We observed mild retinal degeneration. Signaling from cones was reduced but there was no loss of cone density. Loss of Kv8.2 altered responses to flickering light with responses attenuated at high frequencies and altered in shape at low frequencies. The Kv8.2 KO line on an all-cone retina background had reduced cone signaling associated with degeneration. We conclude that Kv8.2 is required by rods and cones for responding to dynamic changes in lighting. The timing and cell type affected by degeneration is different in the mouse and human but there is a window of time in both for therapeutic intervention.

The neuronal underpinning of learning cause-and-effect associations in the adolescent brain remains poorly understood. Two fundamental forms of associative learning are Pavlovian (classical) conditioning, where a stimulus is followed by an outcome, and operant (instrumental) conditioning, where outcome is contingent on action execution. Both forms of learning, when associated with a rewarding outcome, rely on midbrain dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN). We find that in adolescent male rats, reward-guided associative learning is encoded differently by midbrain dopamine neurons in each conditioning paradigm. Whereas simultaneously recorded VTA and SN adult neurons have a similar phasic response to reward delivery during both forms of conditioning, adolescent neurons display a muted reward response during operant but a profoundly larger reward response during Pavlovian conditioning suggesting that adolescent neurons assign a different value to reward when it is not gated by action. The learning rate of adolescents and adults during both forms of conditioning was similar further supporting the notion that differences in reward response in each paradigm are due to differences in motivation and independent of state versus action value learning. Static characteristics of dopamine neurons such as dopamine cell number and size were similar in the VTA and SN but there were age differences in baseline firing rate, stimulated release and correlated spike activity suggesting that differences in reward responsiveness by adolescent dopamine neurons are not due to differences in intrinsic properties of these neurons but engagement of different networks.

The last quarter century of cognitive neuroscience has revealed numerous cortical regions in humans with distinct, often highly specialized functions, from recognizing faces to understanding language to thinking about what other people are thinking. But it remains unclear why the cortex exhibits this high degree of functional specialization in the first place. Here, we consider the case of face perception, using artificial neural networks to test the hypothesis that functional segregation of face recognition in the brain reflects the computational requirements of the task. We find that networks trained on generic object recognition perform poorly on face recognition and vice versa, and further that networks optimized for both tasks spontaneously segregate themselves into separate systems for faces and objects. Thus, generic visual features that suffice for object recognition are apparently suboptimal for face recognition and vice versa. We then show functional segregation to varying degrees for other visual categories, revealing a widespread tendency for optimization (without built-in task-specific inductive biases) to lead to functional specialization in machines and, we conjecture, also brains.

The architecture of the cortical system underlying concept representation is a topic of intense debate. Much evidence supports the claim that concept retrieval selectively engages sensory, motor, and other neural systems involved in the acquisition of the retrieved concept, yet there is also strong evidence for involvement of high-level, supramodal cortical regions. A fundamental question about the organization of this system is whether modality-specific information originating from sensory and motor areas is integrated across multiple ''convergence zones'' or in a single centralized ''hub''. We used representational similarity analysis (RSA) of fMRI data to map brain regions where the similarity structure of neural patterns elicited by large sets of concepts matched the similarity structure predicted by a high-dimensional model of concept representation based on sensory, motor, affective, and other modal aspects of experience. Across two studies involving different sets of concepts, different participants, and different tasks, searchlight RSA revealed a distributed, bihemispheric network engaged in multimodal experiential representation, composed of high-level association cortex in anterior, lateral, and ventral temporal lobe; inferior parietal lobule; posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus; and medial, dorsal, ventrolateral, and orbital prefrontal cortex. These regions closely resemble networks previously implicated in general semantic and ''default mode'' processing and are known to be high-level hubs for convergence of multimodal processing streams. Supplemented by an exploratory cluster analysis, these results indicate that the concept representation system consists of multiple, hierarchically organized convergence zones supporting multimodal integration of experiential information.

Predictive modeling studies have started to reveal brain measures underlying cognition; however, most studies are based on cross-sectional data (static final brain measures acquired at one time point). Since brain development comprises of continuously ongoing events leading to cognitive development, predictive modeling studies need to consider dynamic as opposed to static final brain measures. Using longitudinal neuroimaging and cognitive data (global executive composite score, an index of executive function) from 82 individuals (aged 5-14 years, scanned 3 times), we built highly accurate prediction models (r=0.61, p=1.6e-09) of future cognition (assessed at visit 3) based on baseline developmental changes in cortical anatomy (from visit 1 to 2). More importantly, dynamic brain measures (change in cortical anatomy from visit 1 to 2) and not static brain measures (cortical anatomy at visit 1 and 2) were critical for predicting future cognition, suggesting the need for considering dynamic brain measures in predicting cognitive outcomes.

The vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) is a key mediator of synaptic plasticity. Depending on the brain region studied, distinct effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission have been reported. However, it remains unclear how atRA mediates brain region-specific effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we used intraperitoneal injections of atRA (10 mg/kg) in adult male C57BL/6J mice to study the effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the mouse fascia dentata. In contrast to what has been reported in other brain regions, no major changes in synaptic transmission were observed in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus 6 hours after atRA administration. Likewise, no evidence for changes in the intrinsic properties of hippocampal dentate granule cells was obtained in the atRA-treated group. Moreover, hippocampal transcriptome analysis revealed no essential changes upon atRA treatment. In light of these findings, we tested for the metaplastic effects of atRA, i.e., for its ability to modulate synaptic plasticity expression in the absence of major changes in baseline synaptic transmission. Indeed, in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments demonstrated that systemic atRA treatment improves the ability of dentate granule cells to express LTP. The plasticity-promoting effects of atRA were not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, thus extending our previous results on the relevance of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated synaptic strengthening in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our data show that atRA mediates synaptopodin-dependent metaplasticity in mouse dentate granule cells.

In this research we explore in detail how a phenomenon called sustained persistent activity is achieved by circuits of interconnected neurons. Persistent activity is a phenomenon that has been extensively studied (Papoutsi et al. 2013; Kaminski et. al. 2017; McCormick et al. 2003; Rahman, and Berger, 2011). Persistent activity consists in neuron circuits whose spiking activity remains even after the initial stimuli are removed. Persistent activity has been found in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and has been correlated to working memory and decision making (Clayton E. Curtis and Daeyeol Lee, 2010). We go beyond the explanation of how persistent activity happens and show how arrangements of those basic circuits encode and store data and are used to perform more elaborated tasks and computations. The purpose of the model we propose here is to describe the minimum number of neurons and their interconnections required to explain persistent activity and how this phenomenon is actually a fast storage mechanism required for implementing working memory, task processing and decision making.

Primary sensory Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) neurons are diverse, with distinct populations that respond to specific stimuli. Previously, we observed that functionally distinct populations of DRG neurons express mRNA transcript variants with different 3` untranslated regions (3`UTRs). 3`UTRs harbor binding sites for interaction with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) critical for targeting mRNAs to subcellular domains, modulating transcript stability and regulating the rate of translation. In the current study we sought to determine if 3`UTR-binding proteins are restricted to specific DRG neuron populations. Analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data generated from adult mice revealed that 17 3`UTR-binding RBPs were enriched in specific populations of DRG neurons. This included 4 members of the CUGBP Elav-Like Family (CELF). CELF2 and CELF4 were enriched in peptidergic, CELF6 in both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic and CELF3 in tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons. CELF4 is a known regulator of neural excitability, likely through modulation of protein synthesis via binding to interaction sites within the 3`UTRs of mRNAs. Immunofluorescence studies showed 60% of CELF4+ neurons are small diameter C fibers and 33% medium diameter myelinated (likely A{delta}) fibers. Co-expression analyses using transcriptomic data and quantitative immunofluorescence revealed that CELF4 is enriched in nociceptive neurons that express GFRA3, CGRP and the capsaicin receptor TRPV1. Finally, genes with CELF4 binding motifs expressed in CELF4+ neurons are significantly associated with gene ontology (GO) terms such as RNA-binding and translation. We propose that CELF4 may therefore control a novel regulon that coordinates the translation of mRNAs encoding components of the protein translation apparatus in nociceptors.

Anopheline mosquitoes rely on their highly sensitive chemosensory apparatus to detect diverse chemical stimuli that drive the host-seeking and blood-feeding behaviors required to vector pathogens for malaria and other diseases. This process incorporates a variety of chemosensory receptors and transduction pathways. We have used advanced in vivo gene-editing and -labelling approaches to localize and functionally characterize the ionotropic co-receptor AcIr76b in the malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii, where it impacts both olfactory and gustatory systems. AcIr76b has a broad expression pattern in female adult antennal grooved pegs, T1 and T2 sensilla on the labellum, stylets, and tarsi, as well as the larval sensory peg. AcIr76b is co-localized with the Orco odorant receptor (OR) co-receptor in a subset of cells across the female antennae and labella. In contrast to Orco and Ir8a, chemosensory co-receptors that appear essential for the activity of their respective sets of chemosensory neurons in mosquitoes, AcIr76b-/- mutants maintain wild-type peripheral responses to volatile amines on the adult palps, labellum, and the larval sensory cone. Interestingly, AcIr76b-/- mutants display significantly increased responses to amines in antennal grooved peg sensilla while coeloconic sensilla reveal significant deficits in responses to several acids and amines. Behaviorally, AcIr76b mutants manifest significantly female-specific insemination deficits and, although AcIr76b-/- mutant females are able to locate, alight, and probe artificial blood hosts, they are incapable of blood feeding successfully. Taken together, our study reveals a multi-dimensional functionality of Ir76b in Anopheline olfactory and gustatory pathways that directly impacts the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes.

Proper gene regulation is critical for both neuronal development and maintenance as the brain matures. We previously demonstrated that Akirin2, an essential nuclear protein that interacts with transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes, is required for the embryonic formation of the cerebral cortex. Here we show that Akirin2 plays a mechanistically distinct role in maintaining healthy neurons during cortical maturation. Restricting Akirin2 loss to excitatory cortical neurons resulted in progressive neurodegeneration via necroptosis and severe cortical atrophy with age. Comparing transcriptomes from Akirin2-null postnatal neurons and cortical progenitors revealed that targets of the tumor suppressor p53, a regulator of both proliferation and cell death encoded by Trp53, were consistently upregulated. Heterozygous deletion of Trp53 rescued neurodegeneration in Akirin2-null neurons. These data: 1) implicate Akirin2 as a critical neuronal maintenance protein; 2) identify p53 pathways as mediators of Akirin2 functions; and 3) suggest Akirin2 dysfunction may be relevant to neurodegenerative diseases.

Preparatory activity in the frontal cortex preceding movement onset is thought to represent a neuronal signature of motor planning. However, how excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to frontal neurons are integrated during movement preparation remains unclear. Here we address this question by performing in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the secondary motor cortex (MOs) of head-fixed mice moving on a treadmill. We find that both superficial and deep principal neurons show slowly increasing (~10 s) membrane potential and spike rate ramps preceding the onset of spontaneous, self-paced running periods. By contrast, in animals trained to perform a goal-directed task, both membrane potential and spike ramps are characterized by larger amplitudes and accelerated kinetics during preparation of goal-driven movement. To determine the role of local inhibitory neurons in shaping these task-dependent preparatory signals, we chemogenetically suppressed the activity of specific interneuron subpopulations in untrained animals. Inactivation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons leads to depolarized membrane potential ramps with increased amplitudes during preparation of movement, while inactivation of somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons abolishes membrane potential ramps. A computational model of the local MOs circuit shows that SOM+-mediated inhibition of PV+ interneurons in conjunction with recurrent connectivity among the principal neurons can reproduce slow ramping signals, while plasticity of excitatory synapses on SOM+ interneurons can explain the acceleration of these signals in trained animals. Together, our data reveal that local inhibitory neurons play distinct roles in controlling task-dependent preparatory ramping signals when MOs neurons integrate external inputs during motor planning.

Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) is a vesicular calcium sensor required for synchronous neurotransmitter release. It is composed of a single-pass transmembrane domain linked to two tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B) that bind calcium, acidic lipids, and SNARE proteins that drive fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. Despite its essential role, how Syt1 couples calcium entry to synchronous release is not well understood. Calcium binding to C2B, but not to C2A, is critical for synchronous release and C2B additionally binds the SNARE complex. The C2A domain is also required for Syt1 function, but it is not clear why. Here we asked what critical feature of C2A may be responsible for its functional role, and compared this to the analogous feature in C2B. We focused on highly conserved poly-lysine patches located on the sides of C2A (K189-192) and C2B (K324-327). We tested effects of charge-neutralization mutations in either region (Syt1K189-192A and Syt1K326-327A) side-by-side to determine their relative contributions to Syt1 function in cultured cortical mouse neurons and in single-molecule experiments. Combining electrophysiological recordings and optical tweezers measurements to probe dynamic single C2 domain-membrane interactions, we show that both C2A and C2B polybasic patches contribute to membrane binding, and both are required for evoked release. The readily releasable vesicle pool or spontaneous release were not affected, so both patches are specifically required for synchronization of release. We suggest these patches contribute to cooperative binding to membranes, increasing the overall affinity of Syt1 for negatively charged membranes and facilitating evoked release.

The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) can be divided into three distinctive regions, which project to the different cortical areas. Here we searched for subdivision‐specific molecular markers in developing mouse MD thalamus. We made an MD region‐specific Cre mouse line based on this search, which clearly shows specific projections to PrL/IL and AID in PFC. Further, we showed molecular organization in developing common marmoset, which showed dynamic expression differences compared to mouse MD, suggesting diverse MD function and connectivity in different species.







Abstract
The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is a higher‐order nucleus located within the central thalamus in many mammalian species. Emerging evidence from MD lesions and tracer injections suggests that the MD is reciprocally connected to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and plays an essential role in specific cognitive processes and tasks. MD subdivisions (medial, central, and lateral) are poorly segregated at the molecular level in rodents, leading to a lack of MD subdivision‐specific Cre driver mice. Moreover, this lack of molecular identifiers hinders MD subdivision‐ and cell‐type‐specific circuit formation and function analysis. Therefore, using publicly available databases, we explored molecules separately expressed in MD subdivisions. In addition to MD subdivision markers, we identified several genes expressed in a subdivision‐specific combination and classified them. Furthermore, after developing medial MD (MDm) or central MD (MDc) region‐specific Cre mouse lines, we identified diverse region‐ and layer‐specific PFC projection patterns. Comparison between classified MD marker genes in mice and common marmosets, a nonhuman primate model, revealed diverging gene expression patterns. These results highlight the species‐specific organization of cell types and their projections in the MD thalamus.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26158?af=R">Targeting inflammasomes to treat neurological diseases</a></h4>

Inflammasomes are multimeric protein complexes that can sense a plethora of microbe‐ and damage‐associated molecular signals. They play important roles in innate immunity and are key regulators of inflammation in health and disease. Inflammasome‐mediated processing and secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β (IL‐1β) and IL‐18 and induction of pyroptosis, a pro‐inflammatory form of cell death, has been associated with the development and progression of common immune‐mediated and degenerative central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A growing number of pharmacological compounds inhibiting inflammasome activation and signalling shows therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of the aforementioned disease conditions. Here, we illustrate regulatory mechanisms of inflammasome activation during CNS homeostasis and tissue injury. We highlight the evidence for inflammasome activation as a mechanistic underpinning in a wide range of CNS diseases and critically discuss the promise and potential limitations therapeutic strategies that aim to inhibit the inflammasome components in neurological disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26157?af=R">Human Brain Resilience: A Call to Action</a></h4>

At present, resilience refers to a highly heterogeneous concept with ill‐defined determinants, mechanisms and outcomes. This call for action argues for the need to define resilience as a person‐centered multi‐dimensional metric, informed by a dynamic lifespan perspective and combining observational and interventional experimental studies to identify specific neural markers and correlated behavioral measures. The COVID‐19 pandemic highlights the urgent need of such an effort with the ultimate goal of defining a new vital sign, an individual index of resilience, as a life‐long metric with the capacity to predict an individual's risk for disability in the face of a stressor, insult, injury or disease.

The avian dorsal telencephalon contains discrete areas receiving visual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections.

Abstract
The dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), which is the largest component of the avian pallium, contains discrete partitions receiving tectovisual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the tectovisual regions can be regarded as complexes composed of three highly interconnected layers: an internal senso‐recipient one, an intermediate afferent/efferent one, and a more external re‐entrant one. Cells located in homotopic positions in each of these layers are reciprocally linked by an interlaminar loop of axonal processes, forming columnar‐like local circuits. Whether this type of organization also extends to the trigemino‐recipient DVR is, at present, not known. This question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway, exceptional among amniotes, are not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin. We investigated this question by placing minute injections of neural tracers into selected locations of vital slices of the chicken telencephalon. We found that neurons of the trigemino‐recipient nucleus basorostralis pallii (Bas) establish reciprocal, columnar and homotopical projections with cells located in the overlying ventral mesopallium (MV). “Column‐forming” axons originated in B and MV terminate also in the intermediate strip, the fronto‐trigeminal nidopallium (NFT), in a restricted manner. We also found that the NFT and an internal partition of B originate substantial, coarse‐topographic projections to the underlying portion of the lateral striatum. We conclude that all sensory areas of the DVR are organized according to a common neuroarchitectonic motif, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the radial/laminar intrinsic circuits of the sensory cortices of mammals.

<p>Motor control is a fundamental process that underlies all voluntary
behavioral responses. Several different theories based on different principles
(task dynamics, equilibrium-point theory, passive-motion paradigm, active
inference, optimal control) account for specific aspects of how actions are
produced, but fail to provide a unified view on this problem. Here we propose a
concise theory of motor control based on three principles: optimal feedback
control, control with a receding time horizon, and task representation by a
series of via-points updated at fixed frequency. By construction, the theory
provides a suitable solution to the degrees-of-freedom problem, i.e. trajectory
formation in the presence of redundancies and noise. We show through computer
simulations that the theory also explains the production of discrete,
continuous, rhythmic and temporally-constrained movements, and their parametric
and statistical properties (scaling laws, power laws, speed/accuracy
tradeoffs). The theory has no free parameters and only limited variations in
its implementation details and in the nature of noise are necessary to
guarantee its explanatory power.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00731">Visualizing the geometry of labeled high-dimensional data with spheres. (arXiv:2107.00731v1 [stat.CO])</a></h4>

<p>Data visualizations summarize high-dimensional distributions in two or three
dimensions. Dimensionality reduction entails a loss of information, and what is
preserved differs between methods. Existing methods preserve the local or the
global geometry of the points, and most techniques do not consider labels. Here
we introduce "hypersphere2sphere" (H2S), a new method that aims to visualize
not the points, but the relationships between the labeled distributions. H2S
fits a hypersphere to each labeled set of points in a high-dimensional space
and visualizes each hypersphere as a sphere in 3D (or circle in 2D). H2S
perfectly captures the geometry of up to 4 hyperspheres in 3D (or 3 in 2D), and
approximates the geometry for larger numbers of distributions, matching the
sizes (radii), and the pairwise separations (between-center distances) and
overlaps (along the center-connection line). The resulting visualizations are
robust to sampling imbalances. Leveraging labels and the sphere as the simplest
geometrical primitive, H2S provides an important addition to the toolbox of
visualization techniques.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The process of ageing accompanies several metabolic diseases. With ageing, fats accumulate to increase the visceral and abdominal adiposity leading to hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, obesity and several other diseases. <em class="a-plus-plus">Drosophila melanogaster</em> is often used to study the ageing process and its related disorders. Therefore, in this study, we performed an in silico analysis to relate the process of ageing and insulin resistance. We analysed the data of insulin-resistant <em class="a-plus-plus">Drosophila</em> from the GEO database and compared it with the data from the literature survey. We observed that 98 genes were common in both the models, and they showed gene modulations related to metabolic pathways, fatty acid metabolism, insulin resistance and neural receptor–ligand binding pathways. Analysis of the REACTOME database against human data revealed that the TRKB signalling pathway is commonly affected. The TRKB-mediated BDNF pathway is a major regulator of memory loss. We further analysed the common genes in Alzheimer’s disease and compared the fly data with human data to identify the diseases related to these common genes. Then, we performed a literature survey to provide protective mechanisms for the TRKB signalling pathway activation, mediated through polyphenols. We treated the flies with sesamol-conjugated lipoic acid derivative (a phenolic compound) at hormetic doses to evaluate its effect on the memory of flies.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">X-linked intellectual disability can be diagnosed in about 10–12% of intellectually disabled males. In the past, mutations affecting the <em class="a-plus-plus">PAK3</em> gene (p21 protein-activated kinase 3, MIM#300142) have been associated with a non-syndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability, which has to date been identified in a limited number of families.</p>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Since this neurodevelopmental disorder mostly afflicts males, descriptions of symptomatic female carriers are quite rare.</p>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">We describe a female patient with neurodevelopmental delay and a novel <em class="a-plus-plus">PAK3</em> variant. Interestingly, she manifests craniofacial anomalies, including microcephaly, representing the second reported microcephalic female but the first for whom a detailed clinical description is available.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">A previous study reported that cystatin C was related to acute ischemic stroke. The association between cystatin C and the clinical outcome in acute ischaemic stroke patients with successful recanalization after endovascular thrombectomy has rarely been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the association between cystatin C and futile recanalization in AIS patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We carried out a retrospective study of acute ischaemic stroke patients with anterior circulation proximal arterial occlusion who achieved complete arterial recanalization after mechanical thrombectomy from May 2017 to April 2020. The patients with complete recanalization were divided into a useful recanalization group and a futile recanalization group according to their 3-month modified Rankin scale score. FR was defined as a modified mRS score of 3–6 at 3 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for FR. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the predictive value of cystatin C for FR.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Of 241 patients, 125 underwent futile recanalization and 116 underwent useful recanalization. Baseline serum cystatin C levels were higher in the futile recanalization group than in the useful recanalization group. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, multivariable adjusted regression models showed that cystatin C was an independent predictor of futile recanalization (odds ratio, 4.111 [95% CI 1.427–11.840], <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.009). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that the model combining cystatin C with other factors model effectively predicted unfavourable outcomes at 3 months (area under the curve = 0.782, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01).</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">To investigate the role of GluN2A and GluN2B in neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane preconditioning against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury (CIRI). Rats were randomly divided into five groups as follows: control, ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) 6 h, sevoflurane preconditioning (SP), SP + amantadine, SP + NMDA. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation were used to detect the tyrosine phosphorylation of GluN2A/GluN2B, the interaction of GluN2A/GluN2B-PSD-95-MLK3 and the expression of phosphorylation of MLK3, MKK7 and JNK3. Cresyl violet staining was employed to analyse neuronal injury in rat hippocampal CA1 subfields. Sevoflurane preconditioning inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of GluN2A/GluN2B, the interaction of GluN2A/GluN2B-PSD-95-MLK3 and the phosphorylation of MLK3, MKK7 and JNK3 in rat hippocampus. An <em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>-methyl-<span class="a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps">d</span>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist amantadine reversed the MLK3-MKK7- JNK3 signal events. Such reversion was also realized by NMDA (60 and 80 nmol) and low doses of NMDA (0–40 nmol) could not change the inhibitory effect of sevoflurane preconditioning on MLK3-MKK7-JNK3 signal events. Finally, Cresyl violet staining also confirmed that low dose of NMDA reduced neuronal loss in rat hippocampal CA1 subfields. Sevoflurane preconditioning provides neuroprotection against CIRI by inhibiting NMDAR over-activation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Working memory (WM)—the ability to keep information in mind for short periods of time—is linked to attention and inhibitory abilities, i.e., the capacity to ignore task-irrelevant information. These abilities have been associated with brain oscillations, especially parietal gamma and alpha bands, but it is yet unknown whether these oscillations also modulate attention and inhibitory abilities. To test this, we compared parietal gamma-transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to alpha-tACS and to a non-stimulation condition (Sham) in 51 young participants. Stimulation was coupled with a WM task probing memory-based attention and inhibitory abilities by means of probabilistic retrospective cues, including informative (valid), uninformative (invalid) and neutral. Our results show that relative to alpha and sham stimulation, parietal gamma-tACS significantly increased working memory recall precision. Additional post hoc analyses also revealed strong individual variability before and following stimulation; low-baseline performers showed no significant changes in performance following both gamma and alpha-tACS relative to sham. In contrast, in high-baseline performers gamma- (but not alpha) tACS selectively and significantly improved misbinding-feature errors as well as memory precision, particularly in uninformative (invalid) cues which rely more strongly on attentional abilities. We concluded that parietal gamma oscillations, therefore, modulate working memory recall processes, although baseline performance may further influence the effect of stimulation.</p>

<p>The human brain constitutes one of the most advanced networks produced by nature, consisting of billions of neurons communicating with each other. However, this communication is not in real-time, with different communication or time-delays occurring between neurons in different brain areas. Here, we investigate the impacts of these delays by modeling large interacting neural circuits as neural-field systems which model the bulk activity of populations of neurons. By using a Master Stability Function analysis combined with numerical simulations, we find that delays (1) may actually stabilize brain dynamics by temporarily preventing the onset to oscillatory and pathologically synchronized dynamics and (2) may enhance or diminish synchronization depending on the underlying eigenvalue spectrum of the connectivity matrix. Real eigenvalues with large magnitudes result in increased synchronizability while complex eigenvalues with large magnitudes and positive real parts yield a decrease in synchronizability in the delay vs. instantaneously coupled case. This result applies to networks with fixed, constant delays, and was robust to networks with heterogeneous delays. In the case of real brain networks, where the eigenvalues are predominantly real, owing to the nearly symmetric nature of these weight matrices, biologically plausible, small delays, are likely to increase synchronization, rather than decreasing it.</p>

<p>Hearing depends on glutamatergic synaptic transmission mediated by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). AMPARs are tetramers, where inclusion of the GluA2 subunit reduces overall channel conductance and Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability. Cochlear afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) contain the AMPAR subunits GluA2, 3, and 4. However, the tetrameric complement of cochlear AMPAR subunits is not known. It was recently shown in mice that chronic intracochlear delivery of IEM-1460, an antagonist selective for GluA2-lacking AMPARs [also known as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs)], before, during, and after acoustic overexposure prevented both the trauma to ANF synapses and the ensuing reduction of cochlear nerve activity in response to sound. Surprisingly, baseline measurements of cochlear function before exposure were unaffected by chronic intracochlear delivery of IEM-1460. This suggested that cochlear afferent synapses contain GluA2-lacking CP-AMPARs alongside GluA2-containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-impermeable AMPA receptors (CI-AMPARs), and that the former can be antagonized for protection while the latter remain conductive. Here, we investigated hearing function in the guinea pig during acute local or systemic delivery of CP-AMPAR antagonists. Acute intracochlear delivery of IEM-1460 or systemic delivery of IEM-1460 or IEM-1925 reduced the amplitude of the ANF compound action potential (CAP) significantly, for all tone levels and frequencies, by &gt; 50% without affecting CAP thresholds or distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Following systemic dosing, IEM-1460 levels in cochlear perilymph were ~ 30% of blood levels, on average, consistent with pharmacokinetic properties predicting permeation of the compounds into the brain and ear. Both compounds were metabolically stable with half-lives &gt;5 h in vitro, and elimination half-lives in vivo of 118 min (IEM-1460) and 68 min (IEM-1925). Heart rate monitoring and off-target binding assays suggest an enhanced safety profile for IEM-1925 over IEM-1460. Compound potency on CAP reduction (IC<sub>50</sub> ~ 73 μM IEM-1460) was consistent with a mixture of GluA2-lacking and GluA2-containing AMPARs. These data strongly imply that cochlear afferent synapses of the guinea pig contain GluA2-lacking CP-AMPARs. We propose these CP-AMPARs may be acutely antagonized with systemic dosing, to protect from glutamate excitotoxicity, while transmission at GluA2-containing AMPARs persists to mediate hearing during the protection.</p>

<p>Metal dyshomeostasis plays a significant role in various neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and many more. Like studies investigating the proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, microbiome, etc., for years, metallomics studies have focused on data from their domain, i.e., trace metal composition, only. Still, few have considered the links between other “omes,” which may together result in an individual’s specific pathologies. In particular, ASD have been reported to have multitudes of possible causal effects. Metallomics data focusing on metal deficiencies and dyshomeostasis can be linked to functions of metalloenzymes, metal transporters, and transcription factors, thus affecting the proteome and transcriptome. Furthermore, recent studies in ASD have emphasized the gut-brain axis, with alterations in the microbiome being linked to changes in the metabolome and inflammatory processes. However, the microbiome and other “omes” are heavily influenced by the metallome. Thus, here, we will summarize the known implications of a changed metallome for other “omes” in the body in the context of “omics” studies in ASD. We will highlight possible connections and propose a model that may explain the so far independently reported pathologies in ASD.</p>

<p>Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase (DHDDS) is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that catalyzes cis-prenyl chain elongation to produce the poly-prenyl backbone of dolichol. It appears in all tissues including the nervous system and it is a highly conserved enzyme that can be found in all animal species. Individuals who have biallelic missense mutations in the DHDDS gene are presented with non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa with unknown underlying mechanism. We have used the Drosophila model to compromise DHDDS ortholog gene (CG10778) in order to look for cellular and molecular mechanisms that, when defective, might be responsible for this retinal disease. The Gal4/UAS system was used to suppress the expression of CG10778 via RNAi-mediated-knockdown in various tissues. The resulting phenotypes were assessed using q-RT-PCR, transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM), electroretinogram, antibody staining and Western blot analysis. Targeted knockdown of CG10778-mRNA in the early embryo using the actin promoter or in the developing wings using the nub promoter resulted in lethality, or wings loss, respectively. Targeted expression of CG10778-RNAi using the glass multiple reporter (GMR)-Gal4 driver (GMR-DHDDS-RNAi) in the larva eye disc and pupal retina resulted in a complex phenotype: (a) TEM retinal sections revealed a unique pattern of retinal-degeneration, where photoreceptors R2 and R5 exhibited a nearly normal structure of their signaling-compartment (rhabdomere), but only at the region of the nucleus, while all other photoreceptors showed retinal degeneration at all regions. (b) Western blot analysis revealed a drastic reduction in rhodopsin levels in GMR-DHDDS-RNAi-flies and TEM sections showed an abnormal accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To conclude, compromising DHDDS in the developing retina, while allowing formation of the retina, resulted in a unique pattern of retinal degeneration, characterized by a dramatic reduction in rhodopsin protein level and an abnormal accumulation of ER membranes in the photoreceptors cells, thus indicating that DHDDS is essential for normal retinal formation.</p>

<p>A growing number of studies is using fMRI-based connectivity to guide transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) target identification in both normal and clinical populations. TMS has gained increasing attention as a potential therapeutic strategy also in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but an endorsed target localization strategy in this population is still lacking. In this proof of concept study, we prove the feasibility of a tailored TMS targeting approach for AD, which stems from a network-based perspective. Based on functional imaging, the procedure allows to extract individual optimal targets meanwhile accounting for functional variability. Single-subject resting-state fMRI was used to extract individual target coordinates of two networks primarily affected in AD, the default mode and the fronto-parietal network. The localization of these targets was compared to that of traditional group-level approaches and tested against varying degrees of TMS focality. The distance between individual fMRI-derived coordinates and traditionally defined targets was significant for a supposed TMS focality of 12 mm and in some cases up to 20 mm. Comparison with anatomical labels confirmed a lack of 1:1 correspondence between anatomical and functional targets. The proposed network-based fMRI-guided TMS approach, while accounting for inter-individual functional variability, allows to target core AD networks, and might thus represent a step toward tailored TMS interventions for AD.</p>

The goal of this study was to explore whether 3 T quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) could delineate the ANT from surrounding structures, which is important for the direct targeting of DBS surgery.</p><p>Methods: We obtained 3 T QSM, T1-weighted (T1w), and T2-weighted (T2w) images from 11 patients with Parkinson’s disease or dystonia who received subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi) DBS surgery in our center. The ANT and its surrounding white matter structures on QSM were compared with available atlases. The contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of ANT relative to the external medullary lamina (eml) were compared across the three imaging modalities. Additionally, the morphology and location of the ANT were depicted in the anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC)-based system.</p><p>Results: ANT can be clearly distinguished from the surrounding white matter laminas and appeared hyperintense on QSM. The CNRs of the ANT-eml on QSM, T1w, and T2w images were 10.20 ± 4.23, 1.71 ± 1.03, and 1.35 ± 0.70, respectively. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant differences in CNRs among QSM, T1w, and T2w imaging modalities [F(2) = 85.28, p &lt; 0.0001]. In addition, both the morphology and location of the ANT were highly variable between patients in the AC–PC-based system.</p><p>Conclusion: The potential utility of QSM for the visualization of ANTs in clinical imaging is promising and may be suitable for targeting the ANT for DBS to treat epilepsy.</p>

<p>Previous studies have identified altered brain changes in chronic pain patients, however, it remains unclear whether these changes are reversible. We summarized the neural and molecular changes in patients with chronic pain and employed a meta-analysis approach to quantify the changes. We included 75 studies and 11 of these 75 studies were included in the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis. In the 62 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, the primary somatosensory and motor cortex (SI and MI), thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed significantly decreased activity after the treatments compared to baseline. In the 13 positron emission tomography (PET) studies, the SI, MI, thalamus, and insula showed significantly increased glucose uptake, blood flow, and opioid-receptor binding potentials after the treatments compared to baseline. A meta-analysis of fMRI studies in patients with chronic pain, during pain-related tasks, showed a significant deactivation likelihood cluster in the left medial posterior thalamus. Further studies are warranted to understand brain reorganization in patients with chronic pain compared to the normal state, in terms of its relationship with symptom reduction and baseline conditions.</p>

<p>G-ratio weighted imaging is a non-invasive, in-vivo MRI-based technique that aims at estimating an aggregated measure of relative myelination of axons across the entire brain white matter. The MR g-ratio and its constituents (axonal and myelin volume fraction) are more specific to the tissue microstructure than conventional MRI metrics targeting either the myelin or axonal compartment. To calculate the MR g-ratio, an MRI-based myelin-mapping technique is combined with an axon-sensitive MR technique (such as diffusion MRI). Correction for radio-frequency transmit (B1+) field inhomogeneities is crucial for myelin mapping techniques such as magnetization transfer saturation. Here we assessed the effect of B1+ correction on g-ratio weighted imaging. To this end, the B1+ field was measured and the B1+ corrected MR g-ratio was used as the reference in a Bland-Altman analysis. We found a substantial bias (≈-89%) and error (≈37%) relative to the dynamic range of g-ratio values in the white matter if the B1+ correction was not applied. Moreover, we tested the efficiency of a data-driven B1+ correction approach that was applied retrospectively without additional reference measurements. We found that it reduced the bias and error in the MR g-ratio by a factor of three. The data-driven correction is readily available in the open-source hMRI toolbox (www.hmri.info) which is embedded in the statistical parameter mapping (SPM) framework.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.665319">Functional Brain Connectivity During Narrative Processing Relates to Transportation and Story Influence</a></h4>

<p>Engaging with narratives involves a complex array of cognitive and affective processes. These processes make stories persuasive in ways that standard arguments are not, though the underlying reasons for this remain unclear. Transportation theory proposes a potential explanation for this: narratives are processed in a way which makes individuals feel immersed in the world of a story, which in turn leads people to resonate emotionally with the events of the story. Recent fMRI studies have shown that the posterior medial cortex (PMC) and anterior insula (AI) play important roles in understanding the meaning of stories and experiencing the feelings they produce. In this study, we aimed to explore the AI’s and PMC’s role in narrative processing by measuring their functional connectivity with the rest of the brain during story listening, and how connectivity changes as a function of narrative transportation and the persuasiveness of the story. We analyzed data from 36 right-handed subjects who listened to two stories, obtained from podcasts, inside the fMRI scanner. After the scan, subjects were asked a series of questions, including a measure of how transported into the story they felt, how likely they would be to donate to causes related to the messages of the stories. We used searchlight multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to classify functional connectivity maps using seeds in both the AI and PMC and to compare these maps between participants who differed in transportation and prosocial intention. We found that connectivity to various regions successfully distinguished between high and low ratings on each of these behavioral measures with accuracies over 75%. However, only one pattern of connectivity was consistent across both stories: PMC-inferior frontal gyrus connectivity successfully distinguished high and low ratings of narrative transportation in both stories. All other findings were not consistent across stories. Instead, we found that patterns of connectivity may relate more to the specific content of the story rather than to a universal way in which narratives are processed.</p>

<p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small, membrane-bound vesicles released by cells as a means of intercellular communication. EVs transfer proteins, nucleic acids, and other biologically relevant molecules from one cell to another. In the context of viral infections, EVs can also contain viruses, viral proteins, and viral nucleic acids. While there is some evidence that the inclusion of viral components within EVs may be part of the host defense, much of the research in this field supports a pro-viral role for EVs. Packaging of viruses within EVs has repeatedly been shown to protect viruses from antibody neutralization while also allowing for their integration into cells otherwise impervious to the virus. EVs also bidirectionally cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), providing a potential route for peripheral viruses to enter the brain while exiting EVs may serve as valuable biomarkers of neurological disease burden. Within the brain, EVs can alter glial activity, increase neuroinflammation, and induce neurotoxicity. The purpose of this mini-review is to summarize research related to viral manipulation of EV-mediated intercellular communication and how such manipulation may lead to infection of the central nervous system, chronic neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Human cerebral organoid (CO) is a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system that recapitulates the developing human brain. While CO has proved an invaluable tool for studying neurological disorders in a more clinically relevant matter, there have still been several shortcomings including CO variability and reproducibility as well as lack of or underrepresentation of certain cell types typically found in the brain. As the technology to generate COs has continued to improve, more efficient and streamlined protocols have addressed some of these issues. Here we present a novel scalable and simplified system to generate microglia-containing CO (MCO). We characterize the cell types and dynamic development of MCOs and validate that these MCOs harbor microglia, astrocytes, neurons, and neural stem/progenitor cells, maturing in a manner that reflects human brain development. We introduce a novel technique for the generation of embryoid bodies (EBs) directly from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that involves simplified steps of transitioning directly from 3D cultures as well as orbital shaking culture in a standard 6-well culture plate. This allows for the generation of MCOs with an easy-to-use system that is affordable and accessible by any general lab.</p>

<p>Previous studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may gain access to the brain by using a route along the olfactory nerve. However, there is a general consensus that the obligatory virus entry receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is not expressed in olfactory receptor neurons, and the timing of arrival of the virus in brain targets is inconsistent with a neuronal transfer along olfactory projections. We determined whether nervus terminalis neurons and their peripheral and central projections should be considered as a potential alternative route from the nose to the brain. Nervus terminalis neurons in postnatal mice were double-labeled with antibodies against ACE2 and two nervus terminalis markers, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and choline acetyltransferase (CHAT). We show that a small fraction of CHAT-labeled nervus terminalis neurons, and the large majority of GnRH-labeled nervus terminalis neurons with cell bodies in the region between the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb express ACE2 and cathepsins B and L. Nervus terminalis neurons therefore may provide a direct route for the virus from the nasal epithelium, possibly via innervation of Bowman’s glands, to brain targets, including the telencephalon and diencephalon. This possibility needs to be examined in suitable animal models and in human tissues.</p>

<p>Neurons utilize plasticity of dendritic arbors as part of a larger suite of adaptive plasticity mechanisms. This explicitly manifests with motoneurons in the Drosophila embryo and larva, where dendritic arbors are exclusively postsynaptic and are used as homeostatic devices, compensating for changes in synaptic input through adapting their growth and connectivity. We recently identified reactive oxygen species (ROS) as novel plasticity signals instrumental in this form of dendritic adjustment. ROS correlate with levels of neuronal activity and negatively regulate dendritic arbor size. Here, we investigated NADPH oxidases as potential sources of such activity-regulated ROS and implicate Dual Oxidase (but not Nox), which generates hydrogen peroxide extracellularly. We further show that the aquaporins Bib and Drip, but not Prip, are required for activity-regulated ROS-mediated adjustments of dendritic arbor size in motoneurons. These results suggest a model whereby neuronal activity leads to activation of the NADPH oxidase Dual Oxidase, which generates hydrogen peroxide at the extracellular face; aquaporins might then act as conduits that are necessary for these extracellular ROS to be channeled back into the cell where they negatively regulate dendritic arbor size.</p>

<p>Although cognitive decline has previously been associated with mobility limitations and frailty, the relationship between sustained attention and gait speed is incompletely characterized. To better quantify the specificity of the sustained attention and gait speed association, we examined the extent to which this relationship is unique rather than accounted for by executive functioning and physical health characteristics. 58 middle-to-older-aged community-dwelling adults without overt evidence of cognitive impairment (45–90 years old; 21 females) participated in the study. Each participant completed a 4-meter gait speed assessment and validated neuropsychological tests to examine various domains of executive functioning including working memory (i.e., Digit Span), inhibitory control (i.e., D-KEFS Color-Word Interference), and task switching (i.e., D-KEFS Number/Letter Switching). Multiple physical and vascular risk factors were also evaluated. Sustained attention was assessed using the gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT), a well-validated go/no-go sustained attention task. A series of linear regression models were used to examine how different aspects of cognition, including sustained attention and traditional measures of executive functioning, related to gait speed while controlling for a variety of physical and vascular risk factors. Among all predictors, gradCPT accuracy explained the most variance in gait speed (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.19, p &lt; 0.001) and was the only significant predictor (β = 0.35, p = 0.01) when accounting for executive functioning and other physical and vascular risk factors. The present results indicate that sustained attention may be uniquely sensitive and mechanistically linked to mobility limitations in middle-to-older adults.</p>

<p>Many older adults have difficulty understanding speech in noisy backgrounds. In this study, we examined peripheral auditory, higher-level auditory, and cognitive factors that may contribute to such difficulties. A convenience sample of 137 volunteer older adults, 90 women, and 47 men, ranging in age from 47 to 94 years (M = 69.2 and SD = 10.1 years) completed a large battery of tests. Auditory tests included measures of pure-tone threshold, clinical and psychophysical, as well as two measures of gap-detection threshold and four measures of temporal-order identification. The latter included two monaural and two dichotic listening conditions. In addition, cognition was assessed using the complete Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd Edition (WAIS-III). Two monaural measures of speech-recognition threshold (SRT) in noise, the QuickSIN, and the WIN, were obtained from each ear at relatively high presentation levels of 93 or 103 dB SPL to minimize audibility concerns. Group data, both aggregate and by age decade, were evaluated initially to allow comparison to data in the literature. Next, following the application of principal-components factor analysis for data reduction, individual differences in speech-recognition-in-noise performance were examined using multiple-linear-regression analyses. Excellent fits were obtained, accounting for 60–77% of the total variance, with most accounted for by the audibility of the speech and noise stimuli and the severity of hearing loss with the balance primarily associated with cognitive function.</p>

<p>Background: Postural control and cognition are affected by aging. We investigated whether cognitive distraction influenced neural activity differently in young and older adults during a game-like mediolateral weight-shifting task with a personalized task load.</p><p>Methods: Seventeen healthy young and 17 older adults performed a balance game, involving hitting virtual wasps, serial subtractions and a combination of both (dual-task). A motion analysis system estimated each subject's center of mass position. Cortical activity in five regions was assessed by measuring oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO<sub>2</sub>) with a functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy system.</p><p>Results: When adding cognitive load to the game, weight-shifting speed decreased irrespective of age, but older adults reduced the wasp-hits more than young adults. Accompanying these changes, older adults decreased HbO<sub>2</sub> in the left pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and frontal eye fields (FEF) compared to single-tasking, a finding not seen in young adults. Additionally, lower HbO<sub>2</sub> levels were found during dual-tasking compared to the summed activation of the two single tasks in all regions except for the right PFC. These relative reductions were specific for the older age group in the left premotor cortex (PMC), the right supplementary motor area (SMA), and the left FEF.</p><p>Conclusion: Older adults showed more compromised neural activity than young adults when adding a distraction to a challenging balance game. We interpret these changes as competitive downgrading of neural activity underpinning the age-related deterioration of game performance during dual-tasking. Future work needs to ascertain if older adults can train their neural flexibility to withstand balance challenges during daily life activities.</p>

<p>Neural compensatory mechanisms associated with broad cognitive abilities have been studied. However, those associated with specific cognitive subdomains (e.g., verbal fluency) remain to be investigated in healthy aging. Here, we delineate: (a) neural substrates of verbal (phonemic) fluency, and (b) compensatory mechanisms mediating the association between these neural substrates and phonemic fluency. We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from 133 right-handed, cognitively normal individuals who underwent the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) to record their phonemic fluency. We evaluated functional connectivity in an established and extended language network comprising Wernicke, Broca, thalamic and anti-correlated modules. (a) We conducted voxel-wise multiple linear regression to identify the brain areas associated with phonemic fluency. (b) We used mediation effects of cognitive reserve, measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Information subtest, upon the association between functional connectivity and phonemic fluency tested to investigate compensation. We found that: (a) Greater functional connectivity between the Wernicke module and brain areas within the anti-correlated module was associated with better performance in phonemic fluency, (b) Cognitive reserve was an unlikely mediator in younger adults. In contrast, cognitive reserve was a partial mediator of the association between functional connectivity and phonemic fluency in older adults, likely representing compensation to counter the effect of aging. We conclude that in healthy aging, higher performance in phonemic fluency at older ages could be attributed to greater functional connectivity partially facilitated by higher cognitive reserve, presumably reflecting compensatory mechanisms to minimize the effect of aging.</p>

Objective<p>Severe carotid artery stenosis (CAS) can lead to atrophy of gray matter (GM) and memory impairment; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Thus, we aimed to identify memory impairment and GM atrophy and explore the possible correlation between them in patients with asymptomatic severe CAS.</p>Methods<p>Twenty-four patients with asymptomatic severe CAS and 10 healthy controls completed the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and clinical memory scale (CMS) and underwent 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Field intensity inhomogeneities were corrected. Images were processed using VBM8, and GM images were flipped. First, 11 flipped and 10 non-flipped images of patients with unilateral CAS and 5 flipped and 5 non-flipped images of controls were pre-processed using DARTEL algorithm and analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Second, flipped and non-flipped images of unilateral patients were similarly pre-processed and analyzed using the paired t-test. Third, pre-processed non-flipped GM images and CMS scores of 24 patients were analyzed by multiple regression analysis. Nuisance variables were corrected accordingly.</p>Results<p>Basic information was well matched between patients and controls. MMSE scores of patients were in the normal range; however, memory function was significantly reduced (all P &lt; 0.05). GM volumes of patients were significantly reduced in the anterior circulation regions. The stenosis-side hemispheres showed greater atrophy. GM volumes of the left pars opercularis, pars triangularis, and middle frontal gyrus were strongly positively correlated with the total scores of CMS (all r &gt; 0.7, P = 0.001). Additionally, the left middle frontal gyrus was strongly positively correlated with associative memory (r = 0.853, P = 0.001). The left pars opercularis was moderately positively correlated with semantic memory (r = 0.695, P = 0.001).</p>Conclusion<p>Patients with asymptomatic CAS suffer from memory impairment. Bilateral anterior circulation regions showed extensive atrophy. The hemisphere with stenosis showed severer atrophy. Memory impairment in patients may be related to atrophy of the left frontal gyrus and atrophy of different regions may result in different memory impairments.</p>

<p>Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) represent macrostructural brain damage associated with various etiologies. However, the relative contributions of various etiologies to WMH volume, as assessed via different neuroimaging measures, is not well-understood. Here, we explored associations between three potential early markers of white matter hyperintensity volume. Specifically, the unique variance in total and regional WMH volumes accounted for by white matter microstructure, brain iron concentration and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed. Regional volumes explored were periventricular and deep regions. Eighty healthy older adults (ages 60–86) were scanned at 3 Tesla MRI using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), multi-echo gradient-recalled echo and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling sequences. In a stepwise regression model, DTI-based radial diffusivity accounted for significant variance in total WMH volume (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> change = 0.136). In contrast, iron concentration (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> change = 0.043) and CBF (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> change = 0.027) made more modest improvements to the variance accounted for in total WMH volume. However, there was an interaction between iron concentration and location on WMH volume such that iron concentration predicted deep (p = 0.034) but not periventricular (p = 0.414) WMH volume. Our results suggest that WM microstructure may be a better predictor of WMH volume than either brain iron or CBF but also draws attention to the possibility that some early WMH markers may be location-specific.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68447">Acid-base transporters and pH dynamics in human breast carcinomas predict proliferative activity, metastasis, and survival</a></h4>

Breast cancer heterogeneity in histology and molecular subtype influences metabolic and proliferative activity and hence the acid load on cancer cells. We hypothesized that acid-base transporters and intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) dynamics contribute inter-individual variability in breast cancer aggressiveness and prognosis. We show that Na<sup>+</sup>,HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-cotransport and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchange dominate cellular net acid extrusion in human breast carcinomas. Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchange elevates pH<sub>i</sub> preferentially in estrogen receptor-negative breast carcinomas, whereas Na<sup>+</sup>,HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-cotransport raises pH<sub>i</sub> more in invasive lobular than ductal breast carcinomas and in higher malignancy grade breast cancer. HER2-positive breast carcinomas have elevated protein expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchanger NHE1/SLC9A1 and Na<sup>+</sup>,HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-cotransporter NBCn1/SLC4A7. Increased dependency on Na<sup>+</sup>,HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-cotransport associates with severe breast cancer: enlarged CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-dependent rises in pH<sub>i</sub> predict accelerated cell proliferation; whereas enhanced CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-dependent net acid extrusion, elevated NBCn1 protein expression, and reduced NHE1 protein expression predict lymph node metastasis. Accordingly, we observe reduced survival for patients suffering from Luminal A or Basal-like/triple-negative breast cancer with high <i>SLC4A7</i> and/or low <i>SLC9A1</i> mRNA expression. We conclude that the molecular mechanisms of acid-base regulation depend on clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer patients. NBCn1 expression and dependency on Na<sup>+</sup>,HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-cotransport for pH<sub>i</sub> regulation, measured in biopsies of human primary breast carcinomas, independently predict proliferative activity, lymph node metastasis, and patient survival.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66686">Insula to mPFC reciprocal connectivity differentially underlies novel taste neophobic response and learning</a></h4>

To survive in an ever-changing environment, animals must detect and learn salient information. The anterior insular cortex (aIC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are heavily implicated in salience and novelty processing, and specifically, the processing of taste sensory information. Here, we examined the role of aIC-mPFC reciprocal connectivity in novel taste neophobia and memory formation, in mice. Using pERK and neuronal intrinsic properties as markers for neuronal activation, and retrograde AAV (rAAV) constructs for connectivity, we demonstrate a correlation between aIC-mPFC activity and novel taste experience. Furthermore, by expressing inhibitory chemogenetic receptors in these projections, we show that aIC-to-mPFC activity is necessary for both taste neophobia and its attenuation. However, activity within mPFC-to-aIC projections is essential only for the neophobic reaction but not for the learning process. These results provide an insight into the cortical circuitry needed to detect, react to- and learn salient stimuli, a process critically involved in psychiatric disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66481">Dynamic persistence of UPEC intracellular bacterial communities in a human bladder-chip model of urinary tract infection</a></h4>

Uropathogenic <i>Escherichia</i><i> coli</i> (UPEC) proliferate within superficial bladder umbrella cells to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) during early stages of urinary tract infections. However, the dynamic responses of IBCs to host stresses and antibiotic therapy are difficult to assess <i>in situ</i>. We develop a human bladder-chip model wherein umbrella cells and bladder microvascular endothelial cells are co-cultured under flow in urine and nutritive media respectively, and bladder filling and voiding mimicked mechanically by application and release of linear strain. Using time-lapse microscopy, we show that rapid recruitment of neutrophils from the vascular channel to sites of infection leads to swarm and neutrophil extracellular trap formation but does not prevent IBC formation. Subsequently, we tracked bacterial growth dynamics in individual IBCs through two cycles of antibiotic administration interspersed with recovery periods which revealed that the elimination of bacteria within IBCs by the antibiotic was delayed, and in some instances, did not occur at all. During the recovery period, rapid proliferation in a significant fraction of IBCs reseeded new foci of infection through bacterial shedding and host cell exfoliation. These insights reinforce a dynamic role for IBCs as harbours of bacterial persistence, with significant consequences for non-compliance with antibiotic regimens.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65152">GluA4 facilitates cerebellar expansion coding and enables associative memory formation</a></h4>

AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS and their subunit composition determines synaptic efficacy. Whereas AMPAR subunits GluA1–GluA3 have been linked to particular forms of synaptic plasticity and learning, the functional role of GluA4 remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a crucial function of GluA4 for synaptic excitation and associative memory formation in the cerebellum. Notably, GluA4-knockout mice had ~80% reduced mossy fiber to granule cell synaptic transmission. The fidelity of granule cell spike output was markedly decreased despite attenuated tonic inhibition and increased NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. Computational network modeling incorporating these changes revealed that deletion of GluA4 impairs granule cell expansion coding, which is important for pattern separation and associative learning. On a behavioral level, while locomotor coordination was generally spared, GluA4-knockout mice failed to form associative memories during delay eyeblink conditioning. These results demonstrate an essential role for GluA4-containing AMPARs in cerebellar information processing and associative learning.

Early events in retrovirus transmission are determined by interactions between incoming viruses and frontline cells near entry sites. Despite their importance for retroviral pathogenesis, very little is known about these events. We developed a bioluminescence imaging (BLI)-guided multiscale imaging approach to study these events <i>in vivo</i>. Engineered murine leukemia reporter viruses allowed us to monitor individual stages of retrovirus life cycle including virus particle flow, virus entry into cells, infection and spread for retroorbital, subcutaneous and oral routes. BLI permitted temporal tracking of orally administered retroviruses along the gastrointestinal tract as they traversed the lumen through Peyer's Patches to reach the draining mesenteric sac. Importantly, capture and acquisition of lymph-, blood- and milk-borne retroviruses spanning three routes, was promoted by a common host factor, the I-type lectin CD169, expressed on sentinel macrophages. These results highlight how retroviruses co-opt the immune surveillance function of tissue resident sentinel macrophages for establishing infection.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60833">Novel LOTUS-domain proteins are organizational hubs that recruit <i>C. elegans</i> Vasa to germ granules</a></h4>

We describe MIP-1 and MIP-2, novel paralogous <i>C. elegans </i>germ granule components that interact with the intrinsically disordered MEG-3 protein. These proteins promote P granule condensation, form granules independently of MEG-3 in the postembryonic germ line, and balance each other in regulating P granule growth and localization. MIP-1 and MIP-2 each contain two LOTUS domains and intrinsically disordered regions and form homo- and heterodimers. They bind and anchor the Vasa homolog GLH-1 within P granules and are jointly required for coalescence of MEG-3, GLH-1, and PGL proteins. Animals lacking MIP-1 and MIP-2 show temperature-sensitive embryonic lethality, sterility, and mortal germ lines. Germline phenotypes include defects in stem cell self-renewal, meiotic progression, and gamete differentiation. We propose that these proteins serve as scaffolds and organizing centers for ribonucleoprotein networks within P granules that help recruit and balance essential RNA processing machinery to regulate key developmental transitions in the germ line.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57376">ReporterSeq reveals genome-wide dynamic modulators of the heat shock response across diverse stressors</a></h4>

Understanding cellular stress response pathways is challenging because of the complexity of regulatory mechanisms and response dynamics, which can vary with both time and the type of stress. We developed a reverse genetic method called ReporterSeq to comprehensively identify genes regulating a stress-induced transcription factor under multiple conditions in a time-resolved manner. ReporterSeq links RNA-encoded barcode levels to pathway-specific output under genetic perturbations, allowing pooled pathway activity measurements via DNA sequencing alone and without cell enrichment or single-cell isolation. We used ReporterSeq to identify regulators of the heat shock response (HSR), a conserved, poorly understood transcriptional program that protects cells from proteotoxicity and is misregulated in disease. Genome-wide HSR regulation in budding yeast was assessed across 15 stress conditions, uncovering novel stress-specific, time-specific, and constitutive regulators. ReporterSeq can assess the genetic regulators of any transcriptional pathway with the scale of pooled genetic screens and the precision of pathway-specific readouts.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48840">Soluble Fas ligand drives autoantibody-induced arthritis by binding to DR5/TRAIL-R2</a></h4>

To date, no study has demonstrated that soluble Fas ligand (sFasL)-mediated inflammation is regulated via interaction with Fas in vivo. We found that FasL interacts specifically with tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF)10B, also known as death receptor (DR)5. Autoantibody-induced arthritis (AIA) was attenuated in FasL (<i>Fasl<sup>gld/gld</sup></i>)- and soluble FasL (<i>Fasl<sup>Δs/Δs</sup></i>)-deficient mice, but not in Fas (<i>Fas<sup>lpr/lpr</sup></i> and <i>Fas<sup>–/–</sup></i>)- or membrane FasL (<i>Fasl<sup>Δm/Δm</sup></i>)-deficient mice, suggesting sFasL promotes inflammation by binding to a Fas-independent receptor. Affinity purification mass spectrometry analysis using human (h) fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLSCs) identified DR5 as one of several proteins that could be the elusive Fas-independent FasL receptor. Subsequent cellular and biochemical analyses revealed that DR5 interacted specifically with recombinant FasL–Fc protein, although the strength of this interaction was approximately 60-fold lower than the affinity between TRAIL and DR5. A microarray assay using joint tissues from mice with arthritis implied that the chemokine CX3CL1 may play an important downstream role of the interaction. The interaction enhanced <i>Cx3cl1</i> transcription and increased sCX3CL1 production in FLSCs, possibly in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Moreover, the sFasL–DR5 interaction-mediated CX3CL1–CX3CR1 axis initiated and amplified inflammation by enhancing inflammatory cell influx and aggravating inflammation via secondary chemokine production. Blockade of FasL or CX3CR1 attenuated AIA. Therefore, the sFasL–DR5 interaction promotes inflammation and is a potential therapeutic target.

Speech comprehension entails the neural mapping of the acoustic speech signal onto learned linguistic units. This acousto-linguistic transformation is bi-directional, whereby higher-level linguistic processes (e.g., semantics) modulate the acoustic analysis of individual linguistic units. Here, we investigated the cortical topography and linguistic modulation of the most fundamental linguistic unit, the phoneme. We presented natural speech and 'phoneme quilts' (pseudo-randomly shuffled phonemes) in either a familiar (English) or unfamiliar (Korean) language to native English speakers while recording fMRI. This design dissociates the contribution of acoustic and linguistic processes towards phoneme analysis. We show that (1) the four main phoneme classes (vowels, nasals, plosives, fricatives) are differentially and topographically encoded in human auditory cortex, and that (2) their acoustic analysis is modulated by linguistic analysis. These results suggest that the linguistic modulation of cortical sensitivity to phoneme classes minimizes prediction error during natural speech perception, thereby aiding speech comprehension in challenging listening situations.

Vertebrate vestibular circuits use sensory signals derived from the inner ear to guide both corrective and volitional movements. A major challenge in the neuroscience of balance is to link the synaptic and cellular substrates that encode body tilts to specific behaviors that stabilize posture and enable efficient locomotion. Here we address this problem by measuring the development, synaptic architecture, and behavioral contributions of vestibulospinal neurons in the larval zebrafish. First, we find that vestibulospinal neurons are born and are functionally mature before larvae swim freely, allowing them to act as a substrate for postural regulation. Next, we map the synaptic inputs to vestibulospinal neurons that allow them to encode posture. Further, we find that this synaptic architecture allows them to respond to linear acceleration in a directionally-tuned and utricle-dependent manner; they are thus poised to guide corrective movements. After loss of vestibulospinal neurons, larvae adopted eccentric postures with disrupted movement timing and weaker corrective kinematics. We used a generative model of swimming to demonstrate that together these disruptions can account for the increased postural variability. Finally, we observed that lesions disrupt vestibular-dependent coordination between the fins and trunk during vertical swimming, linking vestibulospinal neurons to navigation. We conclude that vestibulospinal neurons turn synaptic representations of body tilt into defined corrective behaviors and coordinated movements. As the need for stable locomotion is common and the vestibulospinal circuit is highly conserved our findings reveal general mechanisms for neuronal control of balance.

To survive in an ever-changing environment, animals must detect and learn salient information. The anterior insular cortex (aIC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are heavily implicated in salience and novelty processing, and specifically, the processing of taste sensory information. Here, we examined the role of aIC-mPFC reciprocal connectivity in novel taste neophobia and memory formation, in mice. Using pERK and neuronal intrinsic properties as markers for neuronal activation, and retrograde AAV (rAAV) constructs for connectivity, we demonstrate a correlation between aIC-mPFC activity and novel taste experience. Furthermore, by expressing inhibitory chemogenetic receptors in these projections, we show that aIC-to-mPFC activity is necessary for both taste neophobia and its attenuation. However, activity within mPFC-to-aIC projections is essential only for the neophobic reaction but not for the learning process. These results provide an insight into the cortical circuitry needed to detect, react to- and learn salient stimuli, a process critically involved in psychiatric disorders.

The present experiment aimed at investigating the decision-making and the associated event-related potentials (ERPs) of subordinates under hierarchical pressure. Participants (N = 33) acted as UAV operators and had to decide to crash their defective drone either on a civilian site killing all civilians present on the site or on a military site destroying military material but preventing any human losses. While in the no-command condition, participants decided according to their own preferences, in the command condition they were ordered to protect the military material at the expense of civilians for undisclosed strategic reasons. The results revealed that in the no-command condition participants almost always crashed the drone on the military site (96%), whereas in the command condition they chose to obey orders and sacrifice civilians to protect the military material 33% of the time. In the command condition, participants were longer to make their decisions, mobilizing greater attentional and cognitive resources (i.e., greater P300 responses) to resolve the conflict between their internal moral values and the orders they were given (i.e., greater N200 responses) than in the no-command condition, where they automatically applied the you shall not kill rule. Participants also showed a greater negative affective response (i.e., greater P260 amplitudes) after choosing to disobey than to obey orders. This result suggests that disobeying authority could be perceived as a greater moral violation than obeying and sacrificing civilians, suggesting that individuals may sometimes choose to obey malevolent authority to avoid the negative affective reaction triggered by disobedience.

Cortical remapping after hand loss in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is thought to be predominantly dictated by cortical proximity, with adjacent body parts remapping into the deprived area. Traditionally, this remapping has been characterised by changes in the lip representation, which is assumed to be the immediate neighbour of the hand based on electrophysiological research in non-human primates. However, the orientation of facial somatotopy in humans is debated, with contrasting work reporting both an inverted and upright topography. We aimed to fill this gap in the S1 homunculus by investigating the topographic organisation of the face. Using both univariate and multivariate approaches we examined the extent of face-to-hand remapping in individuals with a congenital and acquired missing hand (hereafter one-handers and amputees, respectively), relative to two-handed controls. Participants were asked to move different facial parts (forehead, nose, lips, tongue) during fMRI scanning. We first report evidence for an upright facial organisation in all three groups, with the upper face and not the lips bordering the hand area. We further found little evidence for remapping of all tested facial parts in amputees, with no significant relationship to the chronicity of their PLP. In contrast, we found converging evidence for a complex pattern of face remapping in congenital one-handers across all facial parts, where the location of the cortical neighbour - the forehead - is shown to shift away from the deprived hand area, which is subsequently activated by the lips and the tongue. Together, our findings demonstrate that the face representation in humans is highly plastic, but that this plasticity is restricted by the developmental stage of input deprivation, rather than cortical proximity.

Temporal identity factors are sufficient to reprogram developmental competence of neural progenitors, but whether they could also reprogram the identity of fully differentiated cells is unknown. To address this question, we designed a conditional gene expression system combined with genetic lineage tracing that allows rapid screening of potential reprogramming factors in the mouse retina. Using this assay, we report that co-expression of the early temporal identity transcription factor Ikzf1, together with Ikzf4, another Ikaros family member, is sufficient to directly convert adult Muller glial cells into neuron-like cells in vivo, without inducing a proliferative progenitor state. scRNA-seq analysis shows that the reprogrammed cells share some transcriptional signatures with both cone photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Furthermore, we show that co-expression of Ikzf1 and Ikzf4 can reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neurons by remodeling chromatin and promoting a neuronal gene expression program. This work uncovers general neuronal reprogramming properties for temporal identity factors in differentiated cells, opening new opportunities for cell therapy development.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorder (ALS/FTD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease; up to 10% of cases are familial, usually arising from single dominant mutations in &gt;30 causative genes. Transgenic mouse models that overexpress human ALS/FTD causative genes have been the preferred organism for in vivo modelling. However, while conferring human protein biochemistry, these overexpression models are not ideal for dosage-sensitive proteins such as TDP-43 or FUS. We have created three next-generation genomically humanised knock-in mouse models for ALS/FTD research, by replacing the entire mouse coding region of Sod1, Tardbp (TDP-43) and Fus, with their human orthologues to preserve human protein biochemistry, with exons and introns intact to enable future modelling of coding or non-coding mutations and variants and to preserve human splice variants. In generating these mice, we have established a new-standard of quality control: we demonstrate the utility of indirect capture for enrichment of a region of interest followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing for robustly characterising large knock-in alleles. This approach confirmed that targeting occurred at the correct locus and to map homologous recombination events. Furthermore, extensive expression data from the three lines shows that homozygous humanised animals only express human protein, at endogenous levels. Characterisation of humanised FUS animals showed that they are phenotypically normal compared to wildtype littermates throughout their lifespan. These humanised mouse strains are critically needed for preclinical assessment of interventions, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), to modulate expression levels in patients, and will serve as templates for the addition of human ALS/FTD mutations to dissect disease pathomechanisms.

Before hearing onset (postnatal day 12 in mice), inner hair cells (IHC) spontaneously fire action potentials thereby driving pre-sensory activity in the ascending auditory pathway. The rate of IHC action potential bursts is modulated by inner supporting cells (ISC) of Kolliker's organ through the activity of the Ca2+ activated Cl- channel TMEM16A. Here we show that conditional deletion of Tmem16a in mice disrupts the generation of Ca2+ waves within Kollike's organ, reduces the burst firing activity and the frequency-selectivity of auditory brainstem neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), and also impairs the refinement of MNTB projections to the lateral superior olive (LSO). These results reveal the importance of the activity of Kollike's organ for the refinement of central auditory connectivity. In addition, our study suggests a mechanism for the generation of Ca2+ waves, which may also apply to other tissues expressing TMEM16A.

The oculomotor system can initiate remarkably accurate saccades towards moving targets (interceptive saccades) the processing of which is still under debate. The generation of these saccades requires the oculomotor centers to have information about the motion parameters of the target that then must be extrapolated to bridge the inherent processing delays. We investigated to what degree the information about motion of a saccade target is available in the lateral intra-parietal area (area LIP) of macaque monkeys for generation of accurate interceptive saccades. When a multi-layer neural network was trained based on neural discharges from area LIP around the time of saccades towards stationary targets it was also able to predict the end points of saccades directed towards moving targets. This prediction, however, lagged behind the actual post-saccadic position of the moving target by ~80 ms when the whole neuronal sample of 105 neurons was used. We further found that single neurons differentially code for the motion of the target. Selecting neurons with the strongest representation of target motion reduced this lag to ~30 ms which represents the position of the moving target approximately at the onset of the interceptive saccade. We conclude that - similarly to recent findings from the Superior Colliculus (Goffart et al., 2017) - there is a continuum of contributions of individual LIP neurons to the accuracy of interceptive saccades. A contribution of other gaze control centers (like the cerebellum or the frontal eye field) that further increase the saccadic accuracy is, however, likely.

Psychopathy and autism are both associated with aberrant social interaction and communication, yet only psychopaths are markedly antisocial and violent. Here we compared the functional neural alterations underlying these two different phenotypes with distinct patterns of socioemotional difficulties. We studied 19 incarcerated male offenders with high psychopathic traits, 20 males with high-functioning autism and 19 age-matched healthy controls. All groups underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed dynamic happy, angry and disgust facial expressions or listened to laughter and crying sounds. Psychopathy was associated with reduced somatomotor responses to almost all expressions, while subjects with autism demonstrated less marked and emotion-specific alterations in the somatomotor area. These data suggest that psychopathy and autism involve both common and distinct functional alterations in the brain networks involved in socioemotional processing.

AII amacrine cells in the mammalian retina display an axon initial segment (AIS)‐like process that expresses voltage‐gated Na+ channels and generates spikes. Immunolabeling for the cytoskeletal linker protein ankyrin‐G enables detection of the AIS‐like processes in wholemounts and analysis of its distribution and spatial orientation. The AIS‐like processes display no preferred orientation in the horizontal plane and randomly ascend or descend from the site of origin in the vertical plane of the retina, suggesting that this unique process is unlikely to take part in conventional synaptic connections. Instead, it may be adapted to respond to volume transmission by means of extrasynaptic receptors.






Abstract
Signal processing within the retina is generally mediated by graded potentials, whereas output is conveyed by action potentials transmitted along optic nerve axons. Among retinal neurons, amacrine cells seem to be an exception to this general rule, as several types generate voltage‐gated Na+ (Nav) channel‐dependent action potentials. The AII, a narrow‐field, bistratified axon‐less amacrine cell found in mammalian retinas, displays a unique process that resembles an axon initial segment (AIS), with expression of Nav channels colocalized with the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin‐G, and generates action potentials. As the role of spiking in AIIs is uncertain, we hypothesized that the morphological properties of the AIS‐like process could provide information relevant for its functional importance, including potential pre‐ and/or postsynaptic connectivity. For morphological analysis, we injected AII amacrine cells in slices with fluorescent dye and immunolabeled the slices for ankyrin‐G. Subsequently, this enabled us to reliably identify AII‐type processes among ankyrin‐G labeled processes in wholemount retina. We systematically analyzed the laminar localization, spatial orientation, and distribution of the AIS‐like processes as a function of retinal eccentricity. In the horizontal plane, the processes displayed no preferred orientation and terminal endings were randomly distributed. In the vertical plane, the processes displayed a horizontal preference, but also ascended and descended into the inner nuclear layer and proximal inner plexiform layer, respectively. These results suggest that the AII amacrine AIS‐like process is unlikely to take part in conventional synaptic connections, but may instead be adapted to respond to volume neurotransmission by means of extrasynaptic receptors.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Progressive myoclonic epilepsy is a group of neurodegenerative diseases with complex clinical and genetic heterogeneity, which is associated with spontaneous or action-induced myoclonus and progressive neurodegeneration. Since 2020, 4 families with progressive myoclonic epilepsy-11 [OMIM#618876] have been reported with a very limited spectrum of SEMA6B pathogenic variants. In our study, whole-exome sequencing was used in a proband from a nonconsanguineous Chinese family presenting with growth retardation and recurrent atonic seizures. A deletion mutation (c.1960_1978del, p.Leu654Argfs*25) in the last exon of SEMA6B was detected, which is a de novo variant and pathogenic. The new genetic evidence we reported here strengthened the gene-disease relationship, and the gene curation level between SEMA6B and progressive myoclonic epilepsy-11 became “strong” following the ClinGen SOP. Therefore, the results of this study broaden the mutation spectrum of SEMA6B in different ethnic groups and strengthen the gene-disease relationship between SEMA6B and progressive myoclonic epilepsy-11.</p>

A total of 4312 radiomic features from each image sequence were captured and used in six ML models to estimate stroke onset time for binary classification (≤ 4.5 h). Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) and other parameters were calculated to evaluate the performance of the models in both training and test cohorts.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">When humans visually explore an image, they typically tend to start exploring its left side. This phenomenon, so-called pseudoneglect, is well known, but its time-course has only sparsely been studied. Furthermore, it is unclear whether age influences pseudoneglect, and the relationship between visuo-spatial attentional asymmetries in a free visual exploration task and a classical line bisection task has not been established. To address these questions, 60 healthy participants, aged between 22 and 86, were assessed by means of a free visual exploration task with a series of naturalistic, colour photographs of everyday scenes, while their gaze was recorded by means of a contact-free eye-tracking system. Furthermore, a classical line bisection task was administered, and information concerning handedness and subjective alertness during the experiment was obtained. The results revealed a time-sensitive window during visual exploration, between 260 and 960 ms, in which age was a significant predictor of the leftward bias in gaze position, i.e., of pseudoneglect. Moreover, pseudoneglect as assessed by the line bisection task correlated with the average gaze position throughout a time-window of 300–1490 ms during the visual exploration task. These results suggest that age influences visual exploration and pseudoneglect in a time-sensitive fashion, and that the degree of pseudoneglect in the line bisection task correlates with the average gaze position during visual exploration in a time-sensitive manner.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Successful propagation throughout the step cycle is contingent on adequate regulation of whole-limb stiffness by proprioceptive feedback. Following spinal cord injury (SCI), there are changes in the strength and organization of proprioceptive feedback that can result in altered joint stiffness. In this study, we measured changes in autogenic feedback of five hindlimb extensor muscles following chronic low thoracic lateral hemisection (LSH) in decerebrate cats. We present three features of the autogenic stretch reflex obtained using a mechanographic method. Stiffness was a measure of the resistance to stretch during the length change. The dynamic index documented the extent of adaptation or increase of the force response during the hold phase, and the impulse measured the integral of the response from initiation of a stretch to the return to the initial length. The changes took the form of variable and transient increases in the stiffness of vastus (VASTI) group, soleus (SOL), and flexor hallucis longus (FHL), and either increased (VASTI) or decreased adaptation (GAS and PLANT). The stiffness of the gastrocnemius group (GAS) was also variable over time but remained elevated at the final time point. An unexpected finding was that these effects were observed bilaterally. Potential reasons for this finding and possible sources of increased excitability to this muscle group are discussed.</p>

Objective
Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is not recommended for acute stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and a large volume of irreversibly injured tissue (“core”). Perfusion imaging may identify a subset of patients with large core who benefit from MT.


Methods
We compared two cohorts of LVO‐related patients with large core (&gt;50 ml on diffusion‐weighted‐imaging or CT‐perfusion using RAPID), available perfusion imaging, and treated within 6 hrs from onset by either MT + Best Medical Management (BMM) in one prospective study, or BMM alone in the pre‐MT era from a prospective registry. Primary outcome was 90‐day modified Rankin Scale≤2. We searched for an interaction between treatment group and amount of penumbra as estimated by the mismatch ratio (MMRatio = critical hypoperfusion/core volume).


Results
Overall, 107 patients were included (56 MT + BMM + 51 BMM): Mean age was 68 ± 15 yrs, median core volume 99 ml (IQR: 72–131) and MMRatio 1.4 (IQR: 1.0–1.9). Baseline clinical and radiological variables were similar between the 2 groups, except for a higher intravenous thrombolysis rate in the BMM group. The MMRatio strongly modified the clinical outcome following MT (Pinteraction &lt; 0.001 for continuous MMRatio); MT was associated with a higher rate of good outcome in patients with, but not in those without, MMRatio&gt;1.2 (adjusted OR [95%CI] = 6.8 [1.7–27.0] vs. 0.7 [0.1–6.2], respectively). Similar findings were present for MMRatio≥1.8 in the subgroup with core≥70 ml. Parenchymal hemorrhage on follow‐up imaging was more frequent in the MT + BMM group regardless of the MMRatio.


Interpretation
Perfusion imaging may help select which patients with large core should be considered for MT. Randomized studies are warranted.

Objective
In vivo measures of myeloid activity are promising biomarkers in Multiple Sclerosis. We previously demonstrated that CSF myeloid microvesicles are markers of microglial/macrophage activity and neuroinflammation in Multiple Sclerosis. Here we aimed at investigating diagnostic and prognostic value of myeloid microvesicles in clinical setting.


Methods
Six‐hundred‐one patients discharged with a diagnosis of neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative or no neurological disease were enrolled. Myeloid microvesicles were measured with flow‐cytometry as Ib4+ events in fresh CSF. Clinical, demographical and MRI data were collected at diagnosis (all patients) and during follow‐up (n=176).


Results
CSF myeloid microvesicles were elevated in neuroinflammatory patients as compared to neurodegenerative and control group. In multiple sclerosis, microvesicles were higher in patients with MRI disease activity and their concentration increased along with the enhancing lesions number (p&lt;0.0001, Jonckheere‐Terpstra). CSF myeloid microvesicles were also higher in patients with higher disease activity in the month and year preceding diagnosis.
Microvesicles excellently discriminated between relapsing‐remitting and control group (ROC curve, AUC=0.939, p&lt;0.0001) and between radiologically isolated syndrome and unspecific brain lesions (0.942, p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, microvesicles were independent predictors of prognosis both for relapsing‐remitting and progressive groups. Microvesicles independently predict future disease activity in relapsing‐remitting patients (HR=1.967, CI95% 1.147‐3.372), once correcting for prognostic factors of standard clinical use. In the progressive group, microvesicles were independent predictors of disability accrual (HR=10.767, CI95% 1.335‐86.812).


Interpretation
Our results confirm that CSF myeloid microvesicles are a clinically meaningful biomarker of neuroinflammation and microglial/macrophage activity in vivo. These findings may support a possible use in clinical practice during diagnostic work‐up and prognostic assessment.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25209?af=R">Organization and neural connections of the lateral complex in the brain of the desert locust</a></h4>

Single cell tracer injections suggest that the lateral complex in the brain of the desert locust integrates sensory signals with internal compass information to drive descending and premotor neurons that are likely involved in steering of the animal during locomotion. Overlap of inputs and outputs of the central complex in the gall and ovoid body of the lateral complex suggest feedback loops in the sky compass system.






Abstract
The lateral complexes (LXs) are bilaterally paired neuropils in the insect brain that mediate communication between the central complex (CX), a brain center controlling spatial orientation, various sensory processing areas, and thoracic motor centers that execute locomotion. The LX of the desert locust consists of the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), and the medial and lateral bulb. We have analyzed the anatomical organization and the neuronal connections of the LX in the locust, to provide a basis for future functional studies. Reanalyzing the morphology of neurons connecting the CX and the LX revealed likely feedback loops in the sky compass network of the CX via connections in the gall of the LAL and a newly identified neuropil termed ovoid body. In addition, we characterized sixteen different types of neuron that connect the LAL with other areas in the brain. Eight types of neuron provide information flow between both LALs, five types are LAL input neurons, and three types are LAL output neurons. Among these are neurons providing input from sensory brain areas such as the lobula and antennal neuropils. Brain regions most often targeted by LAL neurons are the posterior slope, the wedge, and the crepine. Two descending neurons with dendrites in the LAL were identified. Our data support and complement existing knowledge about how the LAL is embedded in the neuronal network involved in processing of sensory information and generation of appropriate behavioral output for goal‐directed locomotion.

Abstract

Objective
Among older adults, the ability to stand or walk while performing cognitive tasks (i.e., dual‐tasking) requires coordinated activation of several brain networks. In this multi‐center, double‐blinded, randomized, and sham‐controlled study, we examined the effects of modulating the excitability of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L‐DLPFC) and the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) on dual‐task performance ‘costs’ to standing and walking.


Methods
Fifty‐seven older adults without overt illness or disease completed four separate study visits during which they received 20‐minutes of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) optimized to facilitate the excitability of the L‐DLPFC and SM1 simultaneously, each region separately, or neither region (sham). Before and immediately after stimulation, participants completed a dual‐task paradigm in which they were asked to stand and walk with and without concurrent performance of a serial‐subtraction task.


Results
tDCS simultaneously targeting the L‐DLPFC and SM1, as well as tDCS targeting the L‐DLPFC alone, mitigated dual‐task costs to standing and walking to a greater extent than tDCS targeting SM1 alone or sham (p&lt;0.02). Blinding efficacy was excellent and participant subjective belief in the type of stimulation received (real or sham) did not contribute to the observed functional benefits of tDCS.


Interpretation
These results demonstrate that in older adults, dual‐task decrements may be amenable to change and implicate L‐DPFC excitability as a modifiable component of the control system that enables dual‐task standing and walking. tDCS may be used to improve resilience and the ability of older results to walk and stand under challenging conditions, potentially enhancing everyday functioning.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is divided into three prototypical subtypes that are all characterized by their single core symptom of aphasia. Although later in their course, other cognitive, behavioral, and motor domains may become involved, little is known about the progression profile of each subtype relative to the other subtypes.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">In this longitudinal retrospective cohort study, based on the recent biomarker-supported diagnostic criteria, 24 subjects diagnosed with semantic variant (svPPA), 22 with non-fluent variant (nfvPPA), and 18 with logopenic variant (lvPPA) were collected and followed up for 1–6 years.

                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Over time, lvPPA progressed with broader language problems (PPA-extended) and nfvPPA progressed to mutism, whereas semantic impairment remained the major problem in svPPA. Apart from linguistic problems, svPPA developed pronounced behavioral disturbances, whereas lvPPA exhibited a greater cognitive decline. By contrast, in nfvPPA motor deficits were more common. Furthermore, within 5 years (IQR = 2.5) after clinical onset, 65.6% of the patients additionally fulfilled the clinical criteria for another neurodegenerative syndrome (PPA-plus). Fourteen out of 24 (58%) svPPA patients additionally met the diagnostic criteria of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (5.1 years, IQR = 1.1), whereas the clinical features of 15/18 (83%) lvPPA patients were consistent with Alzheimer disease dementia (4.5 years IQR = 3.4). Furthermore, 12/22 (54%) of the subjects with the nfvPPA progressed to meet the diagnostic criteria of corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, or motor neuron disease (5.1 years IQR = 3.4).</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Despite aphasia being the initial and unique hallmark of the syndrome, our longitudinal results showed that PPA is not a language limited disorder and progression differs widely for each subtype, both with respect to the nature of symptoms and disease duration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Visual transients can interrupt overt orienting by abolishing the execution of a planned eye movement due about 90 ms later, a phenomenon known as saccadic inhibition (SI). It is not known if the same inhibitory process might influence covert orienting in the absence of saccades, and consequently alter visual perception. In Experiment 1 (<em class="a-plus-plus">n </em>= 14), we measured orientation discrimination during a covert orienting task in which an uninformative exogenous visual cue preceded the onset of an oriented probe by 140–290 ms. In half of the trials, the onset of the probe was accompanied by a brief irrelevant flash, a visual transient that would normally induce SI. We report a time-dependent inhibition of covert orienting in which the irrelevant flash impaired orientation discrimination accuracy when the probe followed the cue by 190 and 240 ms. The interference was more pronounced when the cue was incongruent with the probe location, suggesting an impact on the reorienting component of the attentional shift. In Experiment 2 (<em class="a-plus-plus">n </em>= 12), we tested whether the inhibitory effect of the flash could occur within an earlier time range, or only within the later, reorienting range. We presented probes at congruent cue locations in a time window between 50 and 200 ms. Similar to Experiment 1, discrimination performance was altered at 200 ms after the cue. We suggest that covert attention may be susceptible to similar inhibitory mechanisms that generate SI, especially in later stages of attentional shifting (&gt; 200 ms after a cue), typically associated with reorienting.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Cybersickness is an enduring problem for users of virtual environments. While it is generally assumed that cybersickness is caused by discrepancies in perceived self-motion between the visual and vestibular systems, little is known about the relative contribution of active motion parallax and binocular disparity to the occurrence of cybersickness. We investigated the role of these two depth cues in cybersickness by simulating a roller-coaster ride using a head-mounted display. Participants could see the tracks via a virtual frame placed at the front of the roller-coaster cart. We manipulated the state of the frame, so it behaved like: (1) a window into the virtual scene, (2) a 2D screen, (3) and (4) a window for one of the two depth cues, and a 2D screen for the other. Participants completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire before and after the experiment, and verbally reported their level of discomfort at repeated intervals during the ride. Additionally, participants’ electrodermal activity (EDA) was recorded. The results of the questionnaire and the continuous ratings revealed the largest increase in cybersickness when the frame behaved like a window, and least increase when the frame behaved like a 2D screen. Cybersickness scores were at an intermediate level for the conditions where the frame simulated only one depth cue. This suggests that neither active motion parallax nor binocular disparity had a more prominent effect on the severity of cybersickness. The EDA responses increased at about the same rate in all conditions, suggesting that EDA is not necessarily coupled with subjectively experienced cybersickness.</p>

Broad scale remote sensing promises to build forest inventories at unprecedented scales. A crucial step in this process is to associate sensor data into individual crowns. While dozens of crown detection algorithms have been proposed, their performance is typically not compared based on standard data or evaluation metrics. There is a need for a benchmark dataset to minimize differences in reported results as well as support evaluation of algorithms across a broad range of forest types. Combining RGB, LiDAR and hyperspectral sensor data from the USA National Ecological Observatory Network’s Airborne Observation Platform with multiple types of evaluation data, we created a benchmark dataset to assess crown detection and delineation methods for canopy trees covering dominant forest types in the United States. This benchmark dataset includes an R package to standardize evaluation metrics and simplify comparisons between methods. The benchmark dataset contains over 6,000 image-annotated crowns, 400 field-annotated crowns, and 3,000 canopy stem points from a wide range of forest types. In addition, we include over 10,000 training crowns for optional use. We discuss the different evaluation data sources and assess the accuracy of the image-annotated crowns by comparing annotations among multiple annotators as well as overlapping field-annotated crowns. We provide an example submission and score for an open-source algorithm that can serve as a baseline for future methods.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6pTTI418wOk" width="1" />

Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) were recently introduced into the Americas resulting in significant disease burdens. Understanding their spatial and temporal dynamics at the subnational level is key to informing surveillance and preparedness for future epidemics. We analyzed anonymized line list data on approximately 105,000 Zika virus disease and 412,000 chikungunya fever suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases during the 2014–2017 epidemics. We first determined the week of invasion in each city. Out of 1,122, 288 cities met criteria for epidemic invasion by ZIKA and 338 cities by CHIKV. We analyzed risk factors for invasion using linear and logistic regression models. We also estimated that the geographic origin of both epidemics was located in Barranquilla, north Colombia. We assessed the spatial and temporal invasion dynamics of both viruses to analyze transmission between cities using a suite of (i) gravity models, (ii) Stouffer’s rank models, and (iii) radiation models with two types of distance metrics, geographic distance and travel time between cities. Invasion risk was best captured by a gravity model when accounting for geographic distance and intermediate levels of density dependence; Stouffer’s rank model with geographic distance performed similarly well. Although a few long-distance invasion events occurred at the beginning of the epidemics, an estimated distance power of 1.7 (95% CrI: 1.5–2.0) from the gravity models suggests that spatial spread was primarily driven by short-distance transmission. Similarities between the epidemics were highlighted by jointly fitted models, which were preferred over individual models when the transmission intensity was allowed to vary across arboviruses. However, ZIKV spread considerably faster than CHIKV.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N60hMmsOwUU" width="1" />

There are currently 85,000 chemicals registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, but only a small fraction have measured toxicological data. To address this gap, high-throughput screening (HTS) and computational methods are vital. As part of one such HTS effort, embryonic zebrafish were used to examine a suite of morphological and mortality endpoints at six concentrations from over 1,000 unique chemicals found in the ToxCast library (phase 1 and 2). We hypothesized that by using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) or deep neural networks (DNN), and leveraging this large set of toxicity data we could efficiently predict toxic outcomes of untested chemicals. Utilizing a novel method in this space, we converted the 3D structural information into a weighted set of points while retaining all information about the structure. <i>In vivo</i> toxicity and chemical data were used to train two neural network generators. The first was a DNN (Go-ZT) while the second utilized cGAN architecture (GAN-ZT) to train generators to produce toxicity data. Our results showed that Go-ZT significantly outperformed the cGAN, support vector machine, random forest and multilayer perceptron models in cross-validation, and when tested against an external test dataset. By combining both Go-ZT and GAN-ZT, our consensus model improved the SE, SP, PPV, and Kappa, to 71.4%, 95.9%, 71.4% and 0.673, respectively, resulting in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.837. Considering their potential use as prescreening tools, these models could provide <i>in vivo</i> toxicity predictions and insight into the hundreds of thousands of untested chemicals to prioritize compounds for HT testing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4ofsmWSkuFw" width="1" />

While advancements in genome sequencing have identified millions of somatic mutations in cancer, their functional impact is poorly understood. We previously developed the expression-based variant impact phenotyping (eVIP) method to use gene expression data to characterize the function of gene variants. The eVIP method uses a decision tree-based algorithm to predict the functional impact of somatic variants by comparing gene expression signatures induced by introduction of wild-type (WT) versus mutant cDNAs in cell lines. The method distinguishes between variants that are gain-of-function, loss-of-function, change-of-function, or neutral. We present eVIP2, software that allows for pathway analysis (eVIP Pathways) and usage with RNA-seq data. To demonstrate the eVIP2 software and approach, we characterized two recurrent frameshift variants in RNF43, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, frequently mutated in colorectal, gastric, and endometrial cancer. RNF43 WT, RNF43 R117fs, RNF43 G659fs, or GFP control cDNA were overexpressed in HEK293T cells. Analysis with eVIP2 predicted that the frameshift at position 117 was a loss-of-function mutation, as expected. The second frameshift at position 659 has been previously described as a passenger mutation that maintains the RNF43 WT function as a negative regulator of Wnt. Surprisingly, eVIP2 predicted G659fs to be a change-of-function mutation. Additional eVIP Pathways analysis of RNF43 G659fs predicted 10 pathways to be significantly altered, including TNF-α via NFκB signaling, KRAS signaling, and hypoxia, highlighting the benefit of a more comprehensive approach when determining the impact of gene variant function. To validate these predictions, we performed reporter assays and found that each pathway activated by expression of RNF43 G659fs, but not expression of RNF43 WT, was identified as impacted by eVIP2, supporting that RNF43 G659fs is a change-of-function mutation and its effect on the identified pathways. Pathway activation was further validated by Western blot analysis. Lastly, we show primary colon adenocarcinoma patient samples with R117fs and G659fs variants have transcriptional profiles similar to BRAF missense mutations with activated RAS/MAPK signaling, consistent with KRAS signaling pathways being GOF in both variants. The eVIP2 method is an important step towards overcoming the current challenge of variant interpretation in the implementation of precision medicine. eVIP2 is available at https://github.com/BrooksLabUCSC/eVIP2.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AwH86XwVOsY" width="1" />

Although SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines are very safe, we report 4 cases of the bifacial weakness with paresthesias variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) occurring within 3 weeks of vaccination with the Oxford–AstraZeneca SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine. This rare neurological syndrome has previously been reported in association with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection itself. Our cases were given either intravenous immunoglobulin, oral steroids, or no treatment. We suggest vigilance for cases of bifacial weakness with paresthesias variant GBS following vaccination for SARS‐CoV‐2 and that postvaccination surveillance programs ensure robust data capture of this outcome, to assess for causality.

Using transgenic mice, where the Synapsincre allele conditionally deleted the homeodomain transcription factors SIX homeobox 3 (Six3) or ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) in maturing neurons, here referred to as Six3syn and Vax1syn mice, we show that Six3 and Vax1 are required for female, but not male fertility. Specifically, Six3syn and Vax1syn females have weakened suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian output, causing weakened circadian wheel‐running activity patterns. The weakened SCN output was associated with impairment of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge driving ovulation, providing a mechanism linking weakened SCN function with the LH surge and female subfertility.

Abstract
The homeodomain transcription factors sine oculis homeobox 3 (Six3) and ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) are required for brain development. Their expression in specific brain areas is maintained in adulthood, where their functions are poorly understood. To identify the roles of Six3 and Vax1 in neurons, we conditionally deleted each gene using Synapsincre, a promoter targeting maturing neurons, and generated Six3syn and Vax1syn mice. Six3syn and Vax1syn females, but not males, had reduced fertility, due to impairment of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge driving ovulation. In nocturnal rodents, the LH surge requires a precise timing signal from the brain's circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), near the time of activity onset. Indeed, both Six3syn and Vax1syn females had impaired rhythmic SCN output, which was associated with weakened Period 2 molecular clock function in both Six3syn and Vax1syn mice. These impairments were associated with a reduction of the SCN neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide in Vax1syn mice and a modest weakening of SCN timekeeping function in both Six3syn and Vax1syn mice. Changes in SCN function were associated with mistimed peak PER2::LUC expression in the SCN and pituitary in both Six3syn and Vax1syn females. Interestingly, Six3syn ovaries presented reduced sensitivity to LH, causing reduced ovulation during superovulation. In conclusion, we have identified novel roles of the homeodomain transcription factors SIX3 and VAX1 in neurons, where they are required for proper molecular circadian clock function, SCN rhythmic output, and female fertility.

We investigated the role of ErbB4 in PV neurons during Alzheimer’s disease. Results revealed that ErbB4 in PV neurons might mediate Aβ‐induced neurotoxicity and reduce c‐Fos by activating the JNK/tau pathway, ultimately resulting in cognitive deficits. Moreover, JNK was activated by Aβ treatment rather than NRG1β1 treatment, suggesting that NRG1β1 and Aβ have different effects on ErbB4 downstream signaling pathways, probably providing a mechanism for NRG1 anti‐Aβ‐induced neurotoxicity.






Abstract
Accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We previously showed that ErbB4 in parvalbumin‐positive (PV) interneurons was associated with Aβ‐induced cognitive deficits; however, the underlying mechanism remains undetermined. Here we found that specific deletion of ErbB4 in PV neurons significantly attenuated oligomeric Aβ‐induced neuronal toxicity and inhibited Aβ‐induced decreases of PSD95 and synaptophysin. Moreover, specific ablation of ErbB4 in PV neurons altered activity‐related protein c‐Fos and decreased hippocampal PV neurons, especially in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hAPP‐J20 mice. Furthermore, c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK), a protein downstream of ErbB4, was activated by Aβ but not ErbB4’s ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1) β1, suggesting different downstream pathways for Aβ and NRG1β1. JNK phosphorylation was inhibited by the ErbB4 inhibitor AG1478 and by pretreatment with NRG1β1. More importantly, siRNA knockdown of ErbB4 decreased JNK phosphorylation and expression, tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and Thr 205, and Bax expression. Therefore, ErbB4 might mediate Aβ‐induced neuropathology through the JNK/tau pathway and represent a potential therapeutic target in patients with AD.

<p>The hippocampal formation is thought to learn spatial maps of environments,
and in many models this learning process consists of forming a sensory
association for each location in the environment. This is inefficient, akin to
learning a large lookup table for each environment. Spatial maps can be learned
much more efficiently if the maps instead consist of arrangements of sparse
environment parts. In this work, I approach spatial mapping as a problem of
learning graphs of environment parts. Each node in the learned graph,
represented by hippocampal engram cells, is associated with feature information
in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and location information in medial
entorhinal cortex (MEC) using empirically observed neuron types. Each edge in
the graph represents the relation between two parts, and it is associated with
coarse displacement information. This core idea of associating arbitrary
information with nodes and edges is not inherently spatial, so this proposed
fast-relation-graph-learning algorithm can expand to incorporate many spatial
and non-spatial tasks.

<p>Autonomous Driving (AD) related features provide new forms of mobility that
are also beneficial for other kind of intelligent and autonomous systems like
robots, smart transportation, and smart industries. For these applications, the
decisions need to be made fast and in real-time. Moreover, in the quest for
electric mobility, this task must follow low power policy, without affecting
much the autonomy of the mean of transport or the robot. These two challenges
can be tackled using the emerging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). When deployed
on a specialized neuromorphic hardware, SNNs can achieve high performance with
low latency and low power consumption. In this paper, we use an SNN connected
to an event-based camera for facing one of the key problems for AD, i.e., the
classification between cars and other objects. To consume less power than
traditional frame-based cameras, we use a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). The
experiments are made following an offline supervised learning rule, followed by
mapping the learnt SNN model on the Intel Loihi Neuromorphic Research Chip. Our
best experiment achieves an accuracy on offline implementation of 86%, that
drops to 83% when it is ported onto the Loihi Chip. The Neuromorphic Hardware
implementation has maximum 0.72 ms of latency for every sample, and consumes
only 310 mW. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
implementation of an event-based car classifier on a Neuromorphic Chip.

<p>Authoring an appealing animation for a virtual character is a challenging
task. In computer-aided keyframe animation artists define the key poses of a
character by manipulating its underlying skeletons. To look plausible, a
character pose must respect many ill-defined constraints, and so the resulting
realism greatly depends on the animator's skill and knowledge. Animation
software provide tools to help in this matter, relying on various algorithms to
automatically enforce some of these constraints. The increasing availability of
motion capture data has raised interest in data-driven approaches to pose
design, with the potential of shifting more of the task of assessing realism
from the artist to the computer, and to provide easier access to nonexperts. In
this article, we propose such a method, relying on neural networks to
automatically learn the constraints from the data. We describe an efficient
tool for pose design, allowing na{\"i}ve users to intuitively manipulate a pose
to create character animations.

<p>Machine learning techniques have been increasingly used in astronomical
applications and have proven to successfully classify objects in image data
with high accuracy. The current work uses archival data from the Faint Images
of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) to classify radio galaxies into
four classes: Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FRI), Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FRII),
Bent-Tailed (BENT), and Compact (COMPT). The model presented in this work is
based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed architecture
comprises three parallel blocks of convolutional layers combined and processed
for final classification by two feed-forward layers. Our model classified
selected classes of radio galaxy sources on an independent testing subset with
an average of 96\% for precision, recall, and F1 score. The best selected
augmentation techniques were rotations, horizontal or vertical flips, and
increase of brightness. Shifts, zoom and decrease of brightness worsened the
performance of the model. The current results show that model developed in this
work is able to identify different morphological classes of radio galaxies with
a high efficiency and performance

\wedge y_i$, respectively. We employ a threshold circuit or a discretized
circuit (such as a sigmoid circuit or a ReLU circuit with discretization) as
our models of neural networks, and consider the following four computational
resources: [i] the number of neurons (size), [ii] the number of levels (depth),
[iii] the number of active neurons outputting non-zero values (energy), and
[iv] synaptic weight resolution (weight).
</p>
<p>We first prove that any threshold circuit $C$ of size $s$, depth $d$, energy
$e$ and weight $w$ satisfies $\log rk(M_C) \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$,
where $rk(M_C)$ is the rank of the communication matrix $M_C$ of a
$2n$-variable Boolean function that $C$ computes. Since ${\rm CONJ}_n$ has rank
$2^n$, we have $n \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$. Thus, an exponential
lower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth threshold circuits exists if
the energy and weight are sufficiently small. Since ${\rm FTR}_n$ is computable
independently of $n$, our result suggests that computational capacity for the
feature and conjunction search are different. We also show that the inequality
is tight up to a constant factor if $ed = o(n/ \log n)$. We next show that a
similar inequality holds for any discretized circuit. Thus, if we regard the
number of gates outputting non-zero values as a measure for sparse activity,
our results suggest that larger depth helps neural networks to acquire sparse
activity.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02728">Auto-encoding brain networks with applications to analyzing large-scale brain imaging datasets. (arXiv:1911.02728v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>There has been huge interest in studying human brain connectomes inferred
from different imaging modalities and exploring their relationship with human
traits, such as cognition. Brain connectomes are usually represented as
networks, with nodes corresponding to different regions of interest (ROIs) and
edges to connection strengths between ROIs. Due to the high-dimensionality and
non-Euclidean nature of networks, it is challenging to depict their population
distribution and relate them to human traits. Current approaches focus on
summarizing the network using either pre-specified topological features or
principal components analysis (PCA). In this paper, building on recent advances
in deep learning, we develop a nonlinear latent factor model to characterize
the population distribution of brain graphs and infer the relationships between
brain structural connectomes and human traits. We refer to our method as Graph
AuTo-Encoding (GATE). We applied GATE to two large-scale brain imaging
datasets, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human
Connectome Project (HCP) for adults, to understand the structural brain
connectome and its relationship with cognition. Numerical results demonstrate
huge advantages of GATE over competitors in terms of prediction accuracy,
statistical inference and computing efficiency. We found that structural
connectomes have a stronger association with a wide range of human cognitive
traits than was apparent using previous approaches.

There were no differences in the clinical phenotype of NMOSD seen in Indigenous compared to European ancestry populations. Per 100,000, the prevalence estimate for NMOSD in people with Māori ancestry was 1.50 (95% CI 0.52–2.49) which was similar to those with Asian ancestry 1.57 (95% CI 1.15–1.98). NMOSD prevalence in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations was 0.38 (95% CI 0.00–0.80) per 100,000.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The spectral properties of surface electromyographic (EMG) signal in the rectus femoris (RF) and the coactivation in the medial hamstrings (MH) were investigated in 45 stroke subjects (22 ± 12 days post-onset) and 30 age-matched healthy controls who performed unilateral knee extensions at maximum effort (100% MVC) and during 5-s force-matching tasks (10, 30, 50% MVC). The spectral properties were obtained through a power spectrum analysis based on Fast Fourier Transform. The coactivation was measured as the MH amplitude (%max) and MH/RF amplitude ratio. Force variability was expressed as the coefficient of variation. Both knee extensors and flexors were weaker in the paretic leg than the non-paretic and control legs (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). A significantly higher relative power in the 5–13 and 13–30 Hz bands was found in the paretic than the non-paretic leg across all force levels (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> ≤ 0.001) without changes in the 30–60 and 60–100 Hz bands or the mean and median frequencies. Regarding the antagonist coactivation, MH amplitude in the paretic leg was higher than in the non-paretic leg (submaximal levels, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.0001) and the control leg (all force levels, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0005) with no differences between legs in the MH/RF ratio. The steadiness of the knee extension force was not related to the spectral properties of the agonist EMG or antagonistic coactivation. Greater coactivation was associated with weaker paretic knee flexors (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> ≤ 0.0002). The overall results suggest variably altered agonist activation and antagonistic coactivation over the range of isometric knee extension contractions in subacute stroke.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Increased use of epidural Spinal Cord Stimulation (eSCS) for the rehabilitation of spinal cord injury (SCI) has highlighted the need for a greater understanding of the properties of reflex circuits in the isolated spinal cord, particularly in response to repetitive stimulation. Here, we investigate the frequency-dependence of modulation of short- and long-latency EMG responses of lower limb muscles in patients with SCI at rest. Single stimuli could evoke short-latency responses as well as long-latency (likely polysynaptic) responses. The short-latency component was enhanced at low frequencies and declined at higher rates. In all muscles, the effects of eSCS were more complex if polysynaptic activity was elicited, making the motor output become an active process expressed either as suppression, tonic or rhythmical activity. The polysynaptic activity threshold is not constant and might vary with different stimulation frequencies, which speaks for its temporal dependency. Polysynaptic components can be observed as direct responses, neuromodulation of monosynaptic responses or driving the muscle activity by themselves, depending on the frequency level. We suggest that the presence of polysynaptic activity could be a potential predictor for appropriate stimulation conditions. This work studies the complex behaviour of spinal circuits deprived of voluntary motor control from the brain and in the absence of any other inputs. This is done by describing the monosynaptic responses, polysynaptic activity, and its interaction through its input–output interaction with sustain stimulation that, unlike single stimuli used to study the reflex pathway, can strongly influence the interneuron circuitry and reveal a broader spectrum of connectivity.

<p>Sampling the live brain is difficult and dangerous, and withdrawing cerebrospinal fluid is uncomfortable and frightening to the subject, so new sources of real-time analysis are constantly sought. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) derived from glia and neurons offers the potential for wide-ranging neurological disease diagnosis and monitoring. However, new laboratory and bioinformatic strategies are needed. DNA methylation patterns on individual cfDNA fragments can be used to ascribe their cell-of-origin. Here we describe bisulfite sequencing assays and bioinformatic processing methods to identify cfDNA derived from glia and neurons. In proof-of-concept experiments, we describe the presence of both glia- and neuron-cfDNA in the blood plasma of human subjects following mild trauma. This detection of glia- and neuron-cfDNA represents a significant step forward in the translation of liquid biopsies for neurological diseases.</p>

<p>The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson’s disease (PD), and GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with clinical improvements in human PD patients. GLP-1 is produced and secreted by intestinal L-cells in response to consumption of a meal. Specifically, intestinal microbiota produce short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which, in turn, promote secretion of GLP-1 into the systemic circulation, from which it can enter the brain. Our group and others have reported that PD patients have an altered intestinal microbial community that produces less SCFA compared to age-matched controls. In this report, we demonstrate that PD patients have diminished GLP-1 secretion in response to a meal compared to their household controls. Peak postprandial GLP-1 levels did not correlate with PD disease severity, motor function, or disease duration. These data provide the scientific rationale for future studies designed to elucidate the role of GLP-1 in the pathogenesis of PD and test the potential utility of GLP-1-directed therapies.</p>

<p>Recent evidence suggests that being physically active can mitigate age-related white matter (WM) changes. In a randomized clinical trial, the effect of 6-month aerobic exercise (AE) or stretching/toning interventions on measures of WM microstructure (WMM) was assessed in a sample of 74 adults aged 20–67 years. Major WM pathways were reconstructed. No significant group-level change in WM tract microstructure following an AE training was observed. Without adjustment for multiple comparisons, an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) and a decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) of the uncinate fasciculus were observed post-intervention in the AE group in comparison with the stretching group. In the AE group, a significant increase in cardiorespiratory fitness was measured but did not correlate with FA and MD change. The present results of this study are in accordance with similar studies in healthy adults that did not show significant benefit on WMM after participating in an AE program.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:Clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT01179958.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is caused by abnormal electrical discharges (clinically identified by electrophysiological recording) in a specific part of the brain [originating in only one part of the brain, namely, the epileptogenic zone (EZ)]. Epilepsy is now defined as an archetypical hyperexcited neural network disorder. It can be investigated through the network analysis of interictal discharges, ictal discharges, and resting-state functional connectivity. Currently, there is an increasing interest in embedding resting-state connectivity analysis into the preoperative evaluation of epilepsy. Among the various neuroimaging technologies employed to achieve brain functional networks, magnetoencephalography (MEG) with the excellent temporal resolution is an ideal tool for estimating the resting-state connectivity between brain regions, which can reveal network abnormalities in epilepsy. What value does MEG resting-state functional connectivity offer for epileptic presurgical evaluation? Regarding this topic, this paper introduced the origin of MEG and the workflow of constructing source–space functional connectivity based on MEG signals. Resting-state functional connectivity abnormalities correlate with epileptogenic networks, which are defined by the brain regions involved in the production and propagation of epileptic activities. This paper reviewed the evidence of altered epileptic connectivity based on low- or high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and the evidence of the advantage of using simultaneous MEG and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. More importantly, this review highlighted that MEG-based resting-state functional connectivity has the potential to predict postsurgical outcomes. In conclusion, resting-state MEG functional connectivity has made a substantial progress toward serving as a candidate biomarker included in epileptic presurgical evaluations.</p>

<p>The neuroinflammatory basis of depression encompasses the detrimental role of otherwise supportive non-neuronal cells and neuroinflammation in hampering neuronal function, leading to depressive behavior. Animals subjected to different stress paradigms show glial cell activation and a surge in proinflammatory cytokines in various brain regions. The concept of sterile inflammation observed in animal models of depression has intrigued many researchers to determine the possible triggers of central immune cell activation. Notably, microglial activation and subsequent phenotypic polarization in depression have been strongly advocated by the wealth of recent preclinical studies; however, findings from human studies have shown contradictory results. Despite intensive investigation, many research gaps still exist to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammatory cascades underlying the pathophysiology of depression. In this mini-review, recent progress in understanding neuroinflammatory mechanisms in light of experimental models of depression will be thoroughly discussed. The challenges of mirroring depression in animal and in vitro models will also be highlighted. Furthermore, prospects of targeting neuroinflammation to treat depressive disorder will be covered.</p>

Background and Purpose<p>The effect of antiplatelet therapy (APT) on early postoperative rehemorrhage and outcomes of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is still unclear. This study is to evaluate the effect of preoperative APT on early postoperative rehemorrhage and outcomes in ICH patients.</p>Methods<p>This was a multicenter cohort study. ICH patients undergoing surgery were divided into APT group and no antiplatelet therapy (nAPT) group according to whether patients received APT or not. Chi-square test, t-test, and Mann–Whitney U test were used to compare the differences in variables, postoperative rehematoma, and outcomes between groups. Multivariate logistics regression analysis was used to correct for confounding variables, which were different in group comparison.</p>Results<p>One hundred fifty ICH patients undergoing surgical treatment were consecutively included in this study. Thirty five (23.33%) people were included in the APT group, while 115 (76.67%) people were included in the nAPT group. The incidence of early postoperative rehemorrhage in the APT group was significantly higher than that in the nAPT group (25.7% VS 10.4%, p = 0.047 &lt; 0.05). After adjustment for age, ischemic stroke history, and ventricular hematoma, preoperative APT had no significant effect on early postoperative rehemorrhage (p = 0.067). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in early poorer outcomes (p = 0.222) at 14 days after surgery. After adjustment for age, ischemic stroke history, and ventricular hematoma, preoperative APT also had no significant effect on early poorer modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (p = 0.072).</p>Conclusion<p>In conclusion, preoperative APT appears to be safe and have no significant effect on early postoperative rehematoma and outcomes in ICH patients.</p>

<p>A classical hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis is the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (αSyn) within Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, although its role in microglial dysfunction and resultant dopaminergic (DAergic) neurotoxicity is still elusive. Previously, we identified that protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) is activated in post mortem PD brains and experimental Parkinsonism and that it participates in reactive microgliosis; however, the relationship between PKCδ activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and the reactive microglial activation state in the context of α-synucleinopathy is largely unknown. Herein, we show that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, and PKCδ activation increased concomitantly with ERS markers, including the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4), serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (p-IRE1α), p-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) as well as increased generation of neurotoxic cytokines, including IL-1β in aggregated αSyn<sub>agg</sub>-stimulated primary microglia. Importantly, in mouse primary microglia-treated with αSyn<sub>agg</sub> we observed increased expression of Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an endogenous inhibitor of the thioredoxin (Trx) pathway, a major antioxidant protein system. Additionally, αSyn<sub>agg</sub> promoted interaction between NLRP3 and TXNIP in these cells. In vitro knockdown of PKCδ using siRNA reduced ERS and led to reduced expression of TXNIP and the NLRP3 activation response in αSyn<sub>agg</sub>-stimulated mouse microglial cells (MMCs). Additionally, attenuation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) via mito-apocynin and amelioration of ERS via the eIF2α inhibitor salubrinal (SAL) reduced the induction of the ERS/TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling axis, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction and ERS may act in concert to promote the αSyn<sub>agg</sub>-induced microglial activation response. Likewise, knockdown of TXNIP by siRNA attenuated the αSyn<sub>agg</sub>-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation response. Finally, unilateral injection of αSyn preformed fibrils (αSyn<sub>PFF</sub>) into the striatum of wild-type mice induced a significant increase in the expression of nigral p-PKCδ, ERS markers, and upregulation of the TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling axis prior to delayed loss of TH<sup>+</sup> neurons. Together, our results suggest that inhibition of ERS and its downstream signaling mediators TXNIP and NLRP3 might represent novel therapeutic avenues for ameliorating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD and other synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. AD is characterized by the production and aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and subsequent neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, autophagy and oxidative stress. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be used as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers due to their vital regulatory roles in multiple biological processes involved in disease development. The involvement of ncRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD has been increasingly recognized. Here, we review the ncRNAs implicated in AD and elaborate on their main regulatory pathways, which might have contributions for discovering novel therapeutic targets and drugs for AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68335">A deep learning algorithm to translate and classify cardiac electrophysiology</a></h4>

The development of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) has been a critical in vitro advance in the study of patient-specific physiology, pathophysiology and pharmacology. We designed a new deep learning multitask network approach intended to address the low throughput, high variability and immature phenotype of the iPSC-CM platform. The rationale for combining translation and classification tasks is because the most likely application of the deep learning technology we describe here is to translate iPSC-CMs following application of a perturbation. The deep learning network was trained using simulated action potential (AP) data and applied to classify cells into the drug-free and drugged categories and to predict the impact of electrophysiological perturbation across the continuum of aging from the immature iPSC-CMs to the adult ventricular myocytes. The phase of the AP extremely sensitive to perturbation due to a steep rise of the membrane resistance was found to contain the key information required for successful network multitasking. We also demonstrated successful translation of both experimental and simulated iPSC-CM AP data validating our network by prediction of experimental drug-induced effects on adult cardiomyocyte APs by the latter.

The <i>Drosophila</i> polarity protein Crumbs is essential for the establishment and growth of the apical domain in epithelial cells. The protein Yurt limits the ability of Crumbs to promote apical membrane growth, thereby defining proper apical/lateral membrane ratio that is crucial for forming and maintaining complex epithelial structures such as tubes or acini. Here, we show that Yurt also increases Myosin-dependent cortical tension downstream of Crumbs. Yurt overexpression thus induces apical constriction in epithelial cells. The kinase aPKC phosphorylates Yurt, thereby dislodging the latter from the apical domain and releasing apical tension. In contrast, the kinase Pak1 promotes Yurt dephosphorylation through activation of the phosphatase PP2A. The Pak1-PP2A module thus opposes aPKC function and supports Yurt-induced apical constriction. Hence, the complex interplay between Yurt, aPKC, Pak1 and PP2A contributes to the functional plasticity of Crumbs. Overall, our data increase our understanding of how proteins sustaining epithelial cell polarization and Myosin-dependent cell contractility interact with one another to control epithelial tissue architecture.

The inferior parietal lobule (IPL) is one of the most expanded cortical regions in humans relative to other primates. It is also among the most structurally and functionally asymmetric regions in the human cerebral cortex. Whether the structural and connectional asymmetries of IPL subdivisions differ across primate species and how this relates to functional asymmetries remain unclear. We identified IPL subregions that exhibited positive allometric in both hemispheres, scaling across rhesus macaque monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans. The patterns of IPL subregions asymmetry were similar in chimpanzees and humans, but no IPL asymmetries were evident in macaques. Among the comparative sample of primates, humans showed the most widespread asymmetric connections in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, constituting leftward asymmetric networks that may provide an anatomical basis for language and tool use. Unique human asymmetric connectivity between the IPL and primary motor cortex might be related to handedness. These findings suggest that structural and connectional asymmetries may underlie hemispheric specialization of the human brain.

Metabolomics and proteomics, like other omics domains, usually face a data mining challenge in providing an understandable output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Often, statistical analysis is one of the most difficult challenges and it is critical in the subsequent biological interpretation of the results. Because of this, combined with the computational programming skills needed for this type of analysis, several bioinformatic tools aimed at simplifying metabolomics and proteomics data analysis have emerged. However, sometimes the analysis is still limited to a few hidebound statistical methods and to data sets with limited flexibility. POMAShiny is a web-based tool that provides a structured, flexible and user-friendly workflow for the visualization, exploration and statistical analysis of metabolomics and proteomics data. This tool integrates several statistical methods, some of them widely used in other types of omics, and it is based on the POMA R/Bioconductor package, which increases the reproducibility and flexibility of analyses outside the web environment. POMAShiny and POMA are both freely available at https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMAShiny and https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMA, respectively.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w8oDgONs5wU" width="1" />

<p>by Liyu Xia, Sarah L. Master, Maria K. Eckstein, Beth Baribault, Ronald E. Dahl, Linda Wilbrecht, Anne Gabrielle Eva Collins</p>

In the real world, many relationships between events are uncertain and probabilistic. Uncertainty is also likely to be a more common feature of daily experience for youth because they have less experience to draw from than adults. Some studies suggest probabilistic learning may be inefficient in youths compared to adults, while others suggest it may be more efficient in youths in mid adolescence. Here we used a probabilistic reinforcement learning task to test how youth age 8-17 (N = 187) and adults age 18-30 (N = 110) learn about stable probabilistic contingencies. Performance increased with age through early-twenties, then stabilized. Using hierarchical Bayesian methods to fit computational reinforcement learning models, we show that all participants’ performance was better explained by models in which negative outcomes had minimal to no impact on learning. The performance increase over age was driven by 1) an increase in learning rate (i.e. decrease in integration time scale); 2) a decrease in noisy/exploratory choices. In mid-adolescence age 13-15, salivary testosterone and learning rate were positively related. We discuss our findings in the context of other studies and hypotheses about adolescent brain development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YWuy92-1tZE" width="1" />

It has been widely accepted that dopamine (DA) plays a major role in motivation, yet the specific contribution of DA signaling at D<sub>1</sub>-like receptor (D<sub>1</sub>R) and D<sub>2</sub>-like receptor (D<sub>2</sub>R) to cost–benefit trade-off remains unclear. Here, by combining pharmacological manipulation of DA receptors (DARs) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we assessed the relationship between the degree of D<sub>1</sub>R/D<sub>2</sub>R blockade and changes in benefit- and cost-based motivation for goal-directed behavior of macaque monkeys. We found that the degree of blockade of either D<sub>1</sub>R or D<sub>2</sub>R was associated with a reduction of the positive impact of reward amount and increasing delay discounting. Workload discounting was selectively increased by D<sub>2</sub>R antagonism. In addition, blocking both D<sub>1</sub>R and D<sub>2</sub>R had a synergistic effect on delay discounting but an antagonist effect on workload discounting. These results provide fundamental insight into the distinct mechanisms of DA action in the regulation of the benefit- and cost-based motivation, which have important implications for motivational alterations in both neurological and psychiatric disorders.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AbZP7xw0cCU" width="1" />

This study investigates microstructural changes in the Normal Appearing White Matter (NAWM) in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) before and after specific treatment. Indeed, CPAP‐treatment significantly increased DTI parameters such as Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in NAWM of the brainstem, corpus callosum and bilateral internal capsule of OSA patients at follow‐up compared to baseline. The recovery of NAWM alterations correlated to the improvement in the neurocognitive profile.

Abstract
Visually appreciable white matter (WM) changes have been described in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, few data exist on the involvement of silent WM abnormalities. This prospective study investigated the microstructural integrity of normal‐appearing white matter (NAWM) in male OSA patients before and after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, using a neuroimaging approach. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired from 32 participants (16 severe never‐treated OSA and 16 controls). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and Tract‐Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) were used to assess the microstructural NAWM changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). In order to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy, OSA patients underwent MRI evaluations at baseline and after 3 months of treatment (follow‐up). CPAP treatment significantly increased the FA in NAWM of the brain stem, corpus callosum and bilateral internal capsule of OSA patients at follow‐up compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.05, TFCE‐corrected). OSA patients also showed increases in AD in the corpus callosum, superior corona radiata, and internal capsule of the right hemisphere (p &lt; 0.05, TFCE‐corrected) after CPAP treatment. A significant negative correlation was found between the FA of the corona radiata, corpus callosum, internal capsule, limbic structures, and neuropsychological scores at follow‐up evaluation. No significant differences were found in MD and RD of NAWM in our patients after treatment. Our results demonstrate that FA and AD of NAWM in major tracts such as the corpus callosum and the internal capsule increased significantly after CPAP treatment, as a potential beneficial effect of ventilatory therapy. The recovery of NAWM alterations might also be related to the improvement in the neurocognitive profile, suggesting that nonclearly visible WM alterations may contribute to the physiopathology of OSA‐related cognitive impairment.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24859?af=R">AMPA induced cognitive impairment in rats: Establishing the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, 4‐PBA</a></h4>

The effect of AMPA induced excitotoxicity was studied on the rat hippocampus. AMPA apprehended the expression of GLUR receptors which afflict ER environment, thus inducing UPR and other cognitive impairments. Inhibiting ER stress with its specific inhibitor 4‐PBA apprehended cognitive impairment and maintained neurotransmitters levels in addition to detaining UPR induced neuronal damage.

Abstract
Glutamate excitotoxicity and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) recently have been found to be instrumental in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the paucity of literature deciphering the inter‐linkage among glutamate receptors, behavioral alterations, and ER demands thorough exploration. Reckoning the aforesaid concerns, a prospective study was outlined to delineate the influence of ER stress inhibition via 4‐phenylbutyric acid (PBA) on α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) excitotoxicity‐induced behavioral aspects and possible ER stress‐glutamate linkage. Male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups namely sham (surgical control+vehicle, group 1), AMPA‐induced excitotoxic group 2 receive a single intra‐hippocampal injection of 10 mM AMPA, group 3 received AMPA along with PBA (i.p, 100 mg/kg body weight) for 15 days, and group 4 received PBA alone. Behavioral analyses were performed prior to the sacrifice of animals and hippocampus was extracted thereafter for further analysis. AMPA‐induced excitotoxicity exhibited significant impairment of locomotion as well as cognitive functions. The levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, homo vanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine, and serotonin were reduced accompanied by reduced expression of GLUR1 and GLUR4 (glutamate receptor) as well as loss of neurons in different layers of hippocampus. ER stress markers were upregulated upon AMPA excitotoxicity. However, chemical chaperone PBA supplementation remarkably mitigated the behavioral alterations along with expression of glutamate and ER stress intermediates/markers in AMPA excitotoxic animals. Therefore, the present exploration convincingly emphasizes the significance of ER stress and its inhibition via PBA in combating cognitive impairment as well as improving locomotion in excitotoxic animals.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25202?af=R">The distribution, number, and certain neurochemical identities of infracortical white matter neurons in a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) brain</a></h4>

Immunohistochemical staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) reveals the subcortical white matter neurons, or white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), deep to the gray matter of the temporal neocortex in the brain of a chimpanzee. GM—gray matter, WM—white matter, dashed line indicates the approximate GM/WM border.







Abstract
We examined the number, distribution, and immunoreactivity of the infracortical white matter neuronal population, also termed white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), throughout the telencephalic white matter of an adult female chimpanzee. Staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed WMICs throughout the infracortical white matter, these cells being most numerous and dense close to the inner border of cortical layer VI, decreasing significantly in density with depth in the white matter. Stereological analysis of NeuN‐immunopositive cells revealed an estimate of approximately 137.2 million WMICs within the infracortical white matter of the chimpanzee brain studied. Immunostaining revealed subpopulations of WMICs containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, approximately 14.4 million in number), calretinin (CR, approximately 16.7 million), very few WMICs containing parvalbumin (PV), and no calbindin‐immunopositive neurons. The nNOS, CR, and PV immunopositive WMICs, possibly all inhibitory neurons, represent approximately 22.6% of the total WMIC population. As the white matter is affected in many cognitive conditions, such as schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, and also in neurodegenerative diseases, understanding these neurons across species is important for the translation of findings of neural dysfunction in animal models to humans. Furthermore, studies of WMICs in species such as apes provide a crucial phylogenetic context for understanding the evolution of these cell types in the human brain.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling has been reported to affect neurodevelopment, thus participating in the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have measured expression amounts of <em class="a-plus-plus">VDR</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">CYP27B1</em>, and two related long non-coding RNAs, namely <em class="a-plus-plus">SNHG6</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">LINC00511</em>, in the circulation of ASD patients compared with normal controls. Expression of <em class="a-plus-plus">CYP27B1</em> was remarkably higher in ASD cases compared with controls (posterior beta = 2.38, SE = 0.46, adjusted <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> value &lt; 0.0001, 95% credible interval (CrI) for beta = [1.49, 3.27]). Level of <em class="a-plus-plus">SNHG6</em> was lower in ASD cases compared with controls (posterior beta = − 0.791, SE = 0.24, adjusted <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> value = 0.029, 95% CrI for beta = [− 1.27, − 0.33]). Expression levels of <em class="a-plus-plus">VDR</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">LINC00511</em> were similar between ASD cases and controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> values = 0.97 and 0.46, respectively). Expressions of <em class="a-plus-plus">VDR</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">CYP27B1</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">SNHG6</em>, and <em class="a-plus-plus">LINC00511</em> were not correlated with age of children. However, significant correlations were perceived between expressions of <em class="a-plus-plus">CYP27B1</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">LINC00511</em> (r = 0.47, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.0001), <em class="a-plus-plus">VDR</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">CYP27B1</em> (r = 0.42, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.0001), and <em class="a-plus-plus">VDR</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">SNHG6</em> (r = 0.32, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.0001). Therefore, these results imply dysregulation of a number of VDR-related genes in ASD patients.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Data from preclinical studies propose nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>) as a neuroprotective and bioenergetics stimulant agent to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, there seems to be inconsistency between behavioral and molecular outcomes. We performed this systematic review to provide a better understanding of the effects of NAD<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> in rodent AD models and to summarize the literature.</p>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the reference lists of relevant review articles published through December 2020. The search strategy was restricted to articles about NAD<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>, its derivatives, and their association with cognitive function in AD rodent models. The initial search yielded 320 articles, of which 11 publications were included in our systematic review.</p>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Based on the primary outcomes, it was revealed that NAD<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> improves learning and memory. The secondary endpoints also showed neuroprotective effects of NAD<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> on different AD models. The proposed neuroprotective mechanisms included, but were not limited to, the attenuation of the oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, while enhancing the mitochondrial function.</p>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The current systematic review summarizes the preclinical studies on NAD<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> precursors and provides evidence favoring the pro-cognitive effects of such components in rodent models of AD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its pathogenesis is not fully known. Although there are several hypotheses, such as neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and oxidative stress, none of them completely explain the origin and progression of AD. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and epigenetics can directly influence the pathogenesis of AD via their effects on multiple pathways, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid protein. Various gut microbes such as <em class="a-plus-plus">Actinobacteria</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">Bacteroidetes</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">E. coli</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">Firmicutes</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">Proteobacteria</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">Tenericutes</em>, and <em class="a-plus-plus">Verrucomicrobia</em> are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. These microbes and their metabolites modulate various physiological processes that contribute to AD pathogenesis, such as neuroinflammation and other inflammatory processes, amyloid deposition, cytokine storm syndrome, altered BDNF and NMDA signaling, impairing neurodevelopmental processes. Likewise, epigenetic markers associated with AD mainly include histone modifications and DNA methylation, which are under the direct control of a variety of enzymes, such as acetylases and methylases. The activity of these enzymes is dependent upon the metabolites generated by the host’s gut microbiome, suggesting the significance of epigenetics in AD pathogenesis. It is interesting to know that both gut microbiota and epigenetics are dynamic processes and show a high degree of variation according to diet, stressors, and environmental factors. The bidirectional relation between the gut microbiota and epigenetics suggests that they might work in synchrony to modulate AD representation, its pathogenesis, and progression. They both also provide numerous targets for early diagnostic biomarkers and for the development of AD therapeutics. This review discusses the gut microbiota and epigenetics connection in the pathogenesis of AD and aims to highlight vast opportunities for diagnosis and therapeutics of AD.</p>

<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Although the etiology and pathophysiology of MDD remain poorly understood, aberrant neuroplasticity mediated by the epigenetic dysregulation of gene expression within the brain, which may occur due to genetic and environmental factors, may increase the risk of this disorder. Evidence has also been reported for sex-related differences in the pathophysiology of MDD, with female patients showing a greater severity of symptoms, higher degree of functional impairment, and more atypical depressive symptoms. Males and females also differ in their responsiveness to antidepressants. These clinical findings suggest that sex-dependent molecular and neural mechanisms may underlie the development of depression and the actions of antidepressant medications. This review discusses recent advances regarding the role of epigenetics in stress and depression. The first section presents a brief introduction of the basic mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs. The second section reviews their contributions to neural plasticity, the risk of depression, and resilience against depression, with a particular focus on epigenetic modulators that have causal relationships with stress and depression in both clinical and animal studies. The third section highlights studies exploring sex-dependent epigenetic alterations associated with susceptibility to stress and depression. Finally, we discuss future directions to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of MDD, which would contribute to optimized and personalized therapy.</p>

<p>Infectious proteins or prions are a remarkable class of pathogens, where pathogenicity and infectious state correspond to conformational transition of a protein fold. The conformational change translates into the formation by the protein of insoluble amyloid aggregates, associated in humans with various neurodegenerative disorders and systemic protein-deposition diseases. The prion principle, however, is not limited to pathogenicity. While pathological amyloids (and prions) emerge from protein misfolding, a class of functional amyloids has been defined, consisting of amyloid-forming domains under natural selection and with diverse biological roles. Although of great importance, prion amyloid structures remain challenging for conventional structural biology techniques. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) has been preferentially used to investigate these insoluble, morphologically heterogeneous aggregates with poor crystallinity. SSNMR methods have yielded a wealth of knowledge regarding the fundamentals of prion biology and have helped to solve the structures of several prion and prion-like fibrils. Here, we will review pathological and functional amyloid structures and will discuss some of the obtained structural models. We will finish the review with a perspective on integrative approaches combining solid-state NMR, electron paramagnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy, which can complement and extend our toolkit to structurally explore various facets of prion biology.</p>

Drugs for anxiety disorders are typically prescribed but the side effects include weight gain, nausea, and sleepiness. Exercise is an effective treatment for anxiety. Exercise induces the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the circulation, which transmit signals between organs. However, the effects of exercise-induced EVs on anxiety remain poorly understood. Here, we isolated EVs from the sera of mice that were sedentary or that voluntarily exercised. We characterized the changes in the miRNA profile of serum EVs after 4 weeks of voluntary exercise. miRNA sequencing showed that 82 miRNAs (46 of which were positive and 36 negative regulators) changed after exercise. We selected genes affected by at least two miRNAs. Of these, 27.27% were associated with neurotrophin signaling (9.09% with each of central nervous system neuronal development, cerebral cortical cell migration, and peripheral neuronal development). We also analyzed behavioral changes in mice with 3 weeks of restraint stress-induced anxiety after injection of 20 μg amounts of EVs from exercised or sedentary mice into the left cerebral ventricle. We found that exercise-derived EVs reduced anxiety (compared to a control group) in a nest-building test but found no between-group differences in the rotarod or open field tests. Exercise-derived EVs enhanced the expression of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction genes. Thus, exercise-derived EVs may exhibit anti-anxiety effects and may be of therapeutic utility.</p>

<p>Compared with APOE3, APOE4 is associated with greater age-related cognitive decline and higher risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, development of supplements that target APOE genotype-modulated processes could provide a great benefit for the aging population. Evidence suggests a link between APOE genotype and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); however, clinical studies with current DHA supplements have produced negative results in dementia. The lack of beneficial effects with current DHA supplements may be related to limited bioavailability, as the optimal form of DHA for brain uptake is lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-DHA. We previously developed a method to enrich the LPC-DHA content of krill oil through lipase treatment (LT-krill oil), which resulted in fivefold higher enrichment in brain DHA levels in wild-type mice compared with untreated krill oil. Here, we evaluated the effect of a control diet, diet containing krill oil, or a diet containing LT-krill oil in APOE3- and APOE4-targeted replacement mice (APOE-TR mice; treated from 4 to 12 months of age). We found that DHA levels in the plasma and hippocampus are lower in APOE4-TR mice and that LT-krill oil increased DHA levels in the plasma and hippocampus of both APOE3- and APOE4-TR mice. In APOE4-TR mice, LT-krill oil treatment resulted in higher levels of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A and improved performance on the novel object recognition test. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that LPC-DHA/EPA-enriched krill oil can increase brain DHA and improve memory-relevant behavior in mice that express APOE4. Therefore, long-term use of LT-krill oil supplements may on some level protect against age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Pain from Parkinson's disease (PD) is a non-motor symptom affecting the quality of life and has prevalence of 20–80%. However, it is unclear whether subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN–DBS), a well-established treatment for PD, is effective forPD-related pain. Thus, the objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of STN-DBS on PD-related pain and explore how its duration affects the efficacy of STN-DBS. A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Nine studies included numerical rating scale (NRS), visual analog scale (VAS), or non-motor symptom scale (NMSS) scores at baseline and at the last follow-up visit and therefore met the inclusion criteria of the authors. These studies exhibited moderate- to high-quality evidence. Two reviewers conducted assessments for study eligibility, risk of bias, data extraction, and quality of evidence rating. Random effect meta-analysis revealed a significant change in PD-related pain as assessed by NMSS, NRS, and VAS (P &lt;0.01). Analysis of the short and long follow-up subgroups indicated delayed improvement in PD-related pain. These findings (a) show the efficacy of STN-DBS on PD-related pain and provide higher-level evidence, and (b) implicate delayed improvement in PD-related pain, which may help programming doctors with supplement selecting target and programming.</p><p>Systematic Review Registration: This study is registered in Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/DNM6K).</p>

<p>Brain lesions caused by cerebral ischemia lead to network disturbances in both hemispheres, causing a subsequent reorganization of functional connectivity both locally and remotely with respect to the injury. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) methods have long been used for exploring brain electrical activity and functional connectivity modifications after stroke. However, results obtained so far are not univocal. Here, we used basic and advanced EEG methods to characterize how brain activity and functional connectivity change after stroke. Thirty-three unilateral post stroke patients in the sub-acute phase and ten neurologically intact age-matched right-handed subjects were enrolled. Patients were subdivided into two groups based on lesion location: cortico-subcortical (CS, n = 18) and subcortical (S, n = 15), respectively. Stroke patients were evaluated in the period ranging from 45 days since the acute event (T0) up to 3 months after stroke (T1) with both neurophysiological (resting state EEG) and clinical assessment (Barthel Index, BI) measures, while healthy subjects were evaluated once. Brain power at T0 was similar between the two groups of patients in all frequency bands considered (δ, θ, α, and β). However, evolution of θ-band power over time was different, with a normalization only in the CS group. Instead, average connectivity and specific network measures (Integration, Segregation, and Small-worldness) in the β-band at T0 were significantly different between the two groups. The connectivity and network measures at T0 also appear to have a predictive role in functional recovery (BI T1-T0), again group-dependent. The results obtained in this study showed that connectivity measures and correlations between EEG features and recovery depend on lesion location. These data, if confirmed in further studies, on the one hand could explain the heterogeneity of results so far observed in previous studies, on the other hand they could be used by researchers as biomarkers predicting spontaneous recovery, to select homogenous groups of patients for the inclusion in clinical trials.</p>

<p>The Trail Making Test (TMT) is widely used to probe brain function and is performed with pen and paper, involving Parts A (linking numbers) and B (alternating between linking numbers and letters). The relationship between TMT performance and the underlying brain activity remains to be characterized in detail. Accordingly, sixteen healthy young adults performed the TMT using a touch-sensitive tablet to capture enhanced performance metrics, such as the speed of linking movements, during simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). Linking and non-linking periods were derived as estimates of the time spent executing and preparing movements, respectively. The seconds per link (SPL) was also used to quantify TMT performance. A strong effect of TMT Part A and B was observed on the SPL value as expected (Part B showing increased SPL value); whereas the EEG results indicated robust effects of linking and non-linking periods in multiple frequency bands, and effects consistent with the underlying cognitive demands of the test.</p>

<p>It is difficult to answer important questions in neuroscience, such as: “how do neural circuits generate behaviour?,” because research is limited by the complexity and inaccessibility of the mammalian nervous system. Invertebrate model organisms offer simpler networks that are easier to manipulate. As a result, much of what we know about the development of neural circuits is derived from work in crustaceans, nematode worms and arguably most of all, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This review aims to demonstrate the utility of the Drosophila larval locomotor network as a model circuit, to those who do not usually use the fly in their work. This utility is explored first by discussion of the relatively complete connectome associated with one identified interneuron of the locomotor circuit, A27h, and relating it to similar circuits in mammals. Next, it is developed by examining its application to study two important areas of neuroscience research: critical periods of development and interindividual variability in neural circuits. In summary, this article highlights the potential to use the larval locomotor network as a “generic” model circuit, to provide insight into mammalian circuit development and function.</p>

<p>The meninges are the fibrous covering of the central nervous system (CNS) which contain vastly heterogeneous cell types within its three layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia). The dural compartment of the meninges, closest to the skull, is predominantly composed of fibroblasts, but also includes fenestrated blood vasculature, an elaborate lymphatic system, as well as immune cells which are distinct from the CNS. Segregating the outer and inner meningeal compartments is the epithelial-like arachnoid barrier cells, connected by tight and adherens junctions, which regulate the movement of pathogens, molecules, and cells into and out of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and brain parenchyma. Most proximate to the brain is the collagen and basement membrane-rich pia matter that abuts the glial limitans and has recently be shown to have regional heterogeneity within the developing mouse brain. While the meninges were historically seen as a purely structural support for the CNS and protection from trauma, the emerging view of the meninges is as an essential interface between the CNS and the periphery, critical to brain development, required for brain homeostasis, and involved in a variety of diseases. In this review, we will summarize what is known regarding the development, specification, and maturation of the meninges during homeostatic conditions and discuss the rapidly emerging evidence that specific meningeal cell compartments play differential and important roles in the pathophysiology of a myriad of diseases including: multiple sclerosis, dementia, stroke, viral/bacterial meningitis, traumatic brain injury, and cancer. We will conclude with a list of major questions and mechanisms that remain unknown, the study of which represent new, future directions for the field of meninges biology.</p>

<p>Microglial phagocytosis benefits neurological recovery after stroke. Large-conductance Ca2<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents are expressed in activated microglia, and BK channel knockout aggravates cerebral ischemic injury. However, the effect of BK channels on microglial phagocytosis after ischemic stroke remains unknown. Here, we explored whether BK channel activation is beneficial for neurological outcomes through microglial phagocytosis after ischemic stroke. ICR mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), BK channel activator NS19504, and inhibitor Paxilline. The results showed a decrease in BK channel expression after tMCAO. BK channel activator NS19504 alleviates neurological deficit after experimental modeling of tMCAO in mice compared to the control. Furthermore, we treated primary microglia with DMSO, NS19504, and Paxilline after oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). NS19504 promoted primary microglial phagocytosing fluorescent beads and neuronal debris, which reduced neuronal apoptosis after stroke. These effects could be reversed by BK channel inhibitor Paxilline. Finally, NS19504 increased relative phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 expression compared to the Paxilline group at the third day after stroke. Our findings indicate that microglial BK channels are a potential target for acute stage of ischemic stroke therapy.</p>

Objective<p>Cognitive impairment occurs frequently in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and negatively impacts the patient’s quality of life. However, its pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear, hindering the development of new therapies. Changes in brain connectivity are related to cognitive impairment in patients with PD, with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) being considered the essential region related to PD cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the global connectivity responsible for communication with the DLPFC node, the posterior division of the middle frontal gyrus (PMFG) in patients with PD; this was the focus of this study.</p>Methods<p>We applied resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and calculated a reliable functional connectivity measurement, the debiased weighted phase lag index (dWPLI), to examine inter-regional functional connectivity in 68 patients with PD who were classified into two groups according to their cognitive condition.</p>Results<p>We observed that altered left and right PMFG-based functional connectivity associated with cognitive impairment in patients with PD in the theta frequency bands under the eyes closed condition (r = −0.426, p &lt; 0.001 and r = −0.437, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Exploratory results based on the MoCA subdomains indicated that poorer visuospatial function was associated with higher right PMFG-based functional connectivity (r = −0.335, p = 0.005), and poorer attention function was associated with higher left and right PMFG-based functional connectivity (r = −0.380, p = 0.001 and r = −0.256, p = 0.035, respectively). Further analysis using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves found that this abnormal functional connectivity was an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment [odds ratio (OR): 2.949, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.294–6.725, p = 0.01 for left PMFG; OR: 11.278, 95% CI: 2.578–49.335, p = 0.001 for right PMFG, per 0.1 U], and provided moderate classification power to discriminate between cognitive abilities in patients with PD [area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.770 for left PMFG; AUC = 0.809 for right PMFG].</p>Conclusion<p>These preliminary findings indicate that abnormal PMFG-based functional connectivity patterns associated with cognitive impairment in the theta frequency bands under the eyes closed condition and altered functional connectivity patterns have the potential to act as reliable biomarkers for identifying cognitive impairment in patients with PD.</p>

<p>Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to trisomy for all or part of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). It is also associated with other phenotypes including distinctive facial features, cardiac defects, growth delay, intellectual disability, immune system abnormalities, and hearing loss. All adults with DS demonstrate AD-like brain pathology, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, by age 40 and dementia typically by age 60. There is compelling evidence that increased APP gene dose is necessary for AD in DS, and the mechanism for this effect has begun to emerge, implicating the C-terminal APP fragment of 99 amino acid (β-CTF). The products of other triplicated genes on Hsa21 might act to modify the impact of APP triplication by altering the overall rate of biological aging. Another important age-related DS phenotype is hearing loss, and while its mechanism is unknown, we describe its characteristics here. Moreover, immune system abnormalities in DS, involving interferon pathway genes and aging, predispose to diverse infections and might modify the severity of COVID-19. All these considerations suggest human trisomy 21 impacts several diseases in an age-dependent manner. Thus, understanding the possible aging-related mechanisms associated with these clinical manifestations of DS will facilitate therapeutic interventions in mid-to-late adulthood, while at the same time shedding light on basic mechanisms of aging.</p>

<p>Introduction: The study aims to quantify changes in the number, size, and distribution of arachnoid granulations during the human lifespan to elucidate their role in cerebrospinal fluid physiology.</p><p>Material and Methods: 3T magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed in 120 subjects of different ages (neonate, 2 years, 10 years, 20 years, 40 years, 60 years, and 80 years) all with the normal findings of the cerebrospinal fluid system (CSF). At each age, 10 male and 10 female subjects were analyzed. Group scanned at neonatal age was re-scanned at the age of two, while all other groups were scanned once. Arachnoid granulations were analyzed on T2 coronal and axial sections. Each arachnoid granulation was described concerning size and position relative to the superior sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses and surrounding cranial bones.</p><p>Results: Our study shows that 85% of neonates and 2-year-old children do not have visible arachnoid granulations in the dural sinuses and cranial bones on magnetic resonance imaging. With age, the percentage of patients with arachnoid granulations in the superior sagittal sinus increases significantly, but there is no increase in the sigmoid and transverse sinuses. However, numerous individuals in different age groups do not have arachnoid granulations in dural sinuses. Arachnoid granulations in the cranial bones are found only around the superior sagittal sinus, for the first time at the age of 10, and over time their number increases significantly. From the age of 60 onwards, arachnoid granulations were more numerous in the cranial bones than in the dural sinuses.</p><p>Conclusion: The results show that the number, size, and distribution of arachnoid granulations in the superior sagittal sinus and surrounding cranial bones change significantly over a lifetime. However, numerous individuals with a completely normal CSF system do not have arachnoid granulations in the dural sinuses, which calls into question their role in CSF physiology. It can be assumed that arachnoid granulations do not play an essential role in CSF absorption as it is generally accepted. Therefore, the lack of arachnoid granulations does not appear to cause problems in intracranial fluid homeostasis.</p>

Background<p>Attempts have been made to explore the biological basis of neurodegeneration in the amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, subdivided by memory performance. However, few studies have evaluated the differential impact of functional connectivity (FC) on memory performances in early- and late-MCI patients.</p>Objective<p>This study aims to explore the difference in FC of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) among healthy controls (HC) (n = 37), early-MCI patients (n = 30), and late-MCI patients (n = 35) and to evaluate a group-memory performance interaction against the FC of PCC.</p>Methods<p>The subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI scanning and a battery of neuropsychological tests.</p>Results<p>A significant difference among the three groups was found in FC between the PCC (seed region) and bilateral crus cerebellum, right superior medial frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and left middle cingulate gyrus (Monte Carlo simulation-corrected p &lt; 0.01; cluster p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the early-MCI patients displayed higher FC values than the HC and late-MCI patients in the right superior medial frontal gyrus, cerebellum crus 1, and left cerebellum crus 2 (Bonferroni-corrected p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, there was a significant group-memory performance interaction (HC vs. early MCI vs. late MCI) for the FC between PCC and bilateral crus cerebellum, right superior medial frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and left middle cingulate gyrus (Bonferroni-corrected p &lt; 0.05).</p>Conclusion<p>These findings contribute to the biological implications of early- and late-MCI stages, categorized by evaluating the impairment of memory performance.

Introduction<p>The structural and functional damages of the striatum were evident in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). With the research on iRBD deepens, cognitive impairment in iRBD is getting increasing attention. However, the mechanism of cognitive impairment in iRBD was poorly understood.</p>Methods<p>Neuropsychological assessment was carried out in 21 polysomnographies (PSGs) confirmed iRBD patients and 22 normal controls. Both regional homogeneity (ReHo) and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) rs-fMRI analyses were applied to explore the FC abnormalities and its association with cognition in iRBD patients. Positive ReHo clusters were set as seeds for further FC analysis.</p>Results<p>Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder patients presented cognitive deficits in attention/working memory, executive function, immediate memory, and visuo-spatial ability. ReHo analysis revealed abnormal spontaneous brain activities in the striatum (right caudate, left pallidum and bilateral putamen) in iRBD. FC analysis showed decreased striatum-related FCs in the frontal, temporal, occipital lobes, thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus, as well as decreased intrinsic FCs between bilateral putamen and between caudate and pallidum. Deficits in attention/working memory, executive function, and immediate memory were associated with abnormal striatal-cortical FCs including frontal, temporal, and anterior cingulate cortices.</p>Conclusion<p>Functional changes of striatum and cognitive impairment in iRBD were reconfirmed in the present study. Abnormal striatal-cortical networks, especially the striatal-frontal network, contribute to the working memory/executive function deficits in iRBDs. These findings supported the role of striatum not only in motor but also in cognition impairment in iRBD.</p>

<p>Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulties while performing dual-task activities, a condition present in everyday life. It is possible that strategies such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) can be associated with motor training enriched with dual-task training to improve the performance of two concurrent tasks. Currently, it is unclear whether specific tasks and clinical conditions of PD patients have different results after the intervention. Therefore, the proposed randomized controlled trial will examine task-dependency in enhancing the effects of tDCS-linked rehabilitation training on PD and the relationships between baseline outcomes in responders and non-responders to therapy. Fifty-six patients with Parkinson's disease will be recruited to participate in this controlled, double-blind randomized multicentric clinical trial. Patients in modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage 1.5–3, age between 40 and 70 years will be included. Subjects will be randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). The EG will perform treadmill gait training associated with dual task exercises+tDCS, while the CG will only engage in treadmill gait training+tDCS. Blinded testers will assess patients before and after 12 intervention sessions and after a 4-week follow-up period. All patients will undergo a screening and an initial visit before being assessed for primary and secondary outcomes. The primary outcome measure is functional mobility measured by Timed Up and Go Test. Secondary outcomes include cognitive function, participation, motor function and body function and structure. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention protocol with tDCS, dual-task training and gait training in patients with PD. The study will also highlight the clinical factors and variability between individuals that could interfere in the training of a specific task and influence the therapeutic effect.</p><p>Clinical Trial registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04581590.</p>

<p>Background: Several pharmacological treatments have been used to treat patients with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH), although little is known about the comparative effectiveness of different classes of medication. We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare and rank the efficacy and safety of five drug regimens to determine the best treatment for this group of patients.</p><p>Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, clinicaltrials.gov, the Cochrane database, and Embase to identify relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing drug treatments in adult patients with CSDH. A network meta-analysis was conducted using a Bayesian framework. Random- and fixed-effects models were used to pool the network results, and the preferred model was selected by comparing the deviance information criteria (DIC). Efficacy outcomes included recurrence requiring surgery, changes in hematoma volume, and a good recovery. The safety outcomes were treatment-related adverse events and all-cause mortality.</p><p>Results: In this Bayesian network meta-analysis, available data were obtained from 12 eligible trials, including 2,098 patients and 5 techniques. Compared to placebo, atorvastatin (RR: 0.45, 95% CrI: 0.24–0.81) and dexamethasone (RR: 0.38, 95% CrI: 0.22–0.63) were similarly effective in reducing recurrence requiring surgery by 55% and 62%, respectively. Dexamethasone (RR: 0.46, 95% CrI: 0.23–0.91) was more effective in reducing recurrence requiring surgery than goreisan. Additionally, atorvastatin reduced the hematoma volume to a greater extent than placebo (MD: −7.44, 95% CrI: −9.49 to −5.43) or goreisan (MD: −14.09, 95% CrI: −23.35 to −4.82). Moreover, tranexamic acid (MD: −12.07, 95% CrI: −21.68 to −2.29) reduced the hematoma volume to a greater extent than goreisan. No significant differences were detected between drugs and placebo with regard to a good recovery. In terms of safety, dexamethasone (RR: 1.96, 95% CrI: 1.20–3.28) increased the risk of mortality compared to placebo.</p><p>Conclusion: These findings suggest that dexamethasone is the best treatment to reduce recurrence and atorvastatin is the best treatment to reduce hematoma volume in patients with CSDH. However, clinicians should pay close attention to the elevated risk of all-cause mortality and potential adverse events caused by dexamethasone. Future well-designed RCTs with more participants are needed to verify these findings.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:http://osf.io/u9hqp.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Degenerative neuropathy can occur in patients with PD even before typical clinical symptoms appear in the preclinical stage. Therefore, if the early diagnosis of degenerative diseases can be timely and the correlation with the disease progression can be explored, the disease progression will be slowed down and the quality of life of patients will be improved. In this study, the circRNA microarray was employed to screen the dysregulated circRNA in plasma samples of PD. Four circRNAs (circ_0085869, circ_0004381, circ_0017204, and circ_0090668) were obtained with increased levels in PD patients by cross comparison and preliminary verification in PD comparing with healthy controls. Further validation found the circRNA panel was consistent with the training set. The ROC curve also revealed a high diagnostic ability of circ_0004381 and circ_0017204 in predicting the early stage of PD from healthy controls. circ_0085869, circ_0004381, circ_0017204, and circ_0090668 also presented a high ability to distinguish the late stage of PD from early stage. In conclusion, circulating circRNA panel might be a potential fingerprint for predicting the early diagnosis of PD and may act as a biomarker for disease progression.</p>

<p>Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of the combination of acupuncture-related therapies with conventional medication compared with conventional medication in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</p><p>Methods: A literature search within eight databases [including Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), VIP, and Wanfang Database] was performed covering a time frame from their inception to August 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture-related therapies combined with conventional medication vs. conventional medication in patients with PD were eligible. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias. Assessments were performed with the total and subscales scores of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), the dosage of Madopar, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Data were analyzed by adopting the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.4 (Review Man, Copenhagen, Denmark); and mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Tests for heterogeneity were used to assess differences in treatment effects across different types of acupuncture used.</p><p>Results: Sixty-six trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 61 trials provided data for the meta-analysis. We defined high-quality articles as those with a low risk of bias in four or more domains; and only 10 (15.15%) articles were of high quality. Compared with the controls, acupuncture-related therapies with conventional medication achieved a benefit in the primary outcomes of UPDRS (motor subscore: −3.90, −4.33 to −3.49, P &lt; 0.01; total score: −7.37 points, −8.91 to −5.82, P &lt; 0.001; activities of daily living subscore: −3.96, −4.96 to −2.95, P &lt; 0.01). For the subgroup difference test among the effects of different acupuncture methods, significant differences existed in outcomes with the UPDRS-III, UPDRS-I, UPDRS-IV, and PDQ-39 scores and Madopar dosage, while non-significant differences existed with the UPDRS-total, UPDRS-II, HAMD, and MMSE scores.</p><p>Conclusions: Acupuncture-related therapies combined with conventional medication may benefit individuals with PD. Our review findings should be considered with caution because of the methodological weaknesses in the included trials. Future, large randomized trials of acupuncture-related therapies for PD with high methodological quality are warranted.</p><p>Systematic Review Registration: Identifier CRD42021228110.</p>

<p>In mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), normobaric intermittent hypoxia training (IHT) can preserve neurobehavioral function when applied before deficits develop, but IHT's effectiveness after onset of amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation is unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that IHT improves learning-memory behavior, diminishes Aβ accumulation in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and enhances cerebrocortical contents of the neuroprotective trophic factors erythropoietin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice manifesting AD traits. Twelve-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice were assigned to untreated 3xTg-AD (n = 6), AD+IHT (n = 6), and AD+sham-IHT (n = 6) groups; 8 untreated wild-type (WT) mice also were studied. AD+IHT mice alternately breathed 10% O<sub>2</sub> for 6 min and room air for 4 min, 10 cycles/day for 21 days; AD+sham-IHT mice breathed room air. Spatial learning-memory was assessed by Morris water maze. Cerebrocortical and hippocampal Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> contents were determined by ELISA, and cerebrocortical erythropoietin and BDNF were analyzed by immunoblotting and ELISA. The significance of time (12 vs. 12 months + 21 days) and treatment (IHT vs. sham-IHT) was evaluated by two-factor ANOVA. The change in swimming distance to find the water maze platform after 21 d IHT (−1.6 ± 1.8 m) differed from that after sham-IHT (+5.8 ± 2.6 m). Cerebrocortical and hippocampal Aβ<sub>42</sub> contents were greater in 3xTg-AD than WT mice, but neither time nor treatment significantly affected Aβ<sub>40</sub> or Aβ<sub>42</sub> contents in the 3xTg-AD mice. Cerebrocortical erythropoietin and BDNF contents increased appreciably after IHT as compared to untreated 3xTg-AD and AD+sham-IHT mice. In conclusion, moderate, normobaric IHT prevented spatial learning-memory decline and restored cerebrocortical erythropoietin and BDNF contents despite ongoing Aβ accumulation in 3xTg-AD mice.</p>

The pig is commonly used as an experimental model of human heart disease, including for the study of mechanisms of arrhythmia. However, there exist differences between human and porcine cellular electrophysiology: The pig action potential (AP) has a deeper phase-1 notch, a longer duration at 50% repolarization, and higher plateau potentials than human. Ionic differences underlying the AP include larger rapid delayed-rectifier and smaller inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup>-currents (I<sub>Kr</sub> and I<sub>K1</sub> respectively) in humans. AP steady-state rate-dependence and restitution is steeper in pigs. Porcine Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients can have two components, unlike human. Although a reliable computational model for human ventricular myocytes exists, one for pigs is lacking. This hampers translation from results obtained in pigs to human myocardium. Here, we developed a computational model of the pig ventricular cardiomyocyte AP using experimental datasets of the relevant ionic currents, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling, AP shape, AP duration restitution, and inducibility of triggered activity and alternans. To properly capture porcine Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, we introduced a two-step process with a faster release in the t-tubular region, followed by a slower diffusion-induced release from a non t-tubular subcellular region. The pig model behavior was compared with that of a human ventricular cardiomyocyte (O’Hara-Rudy) model. The pig, but not the human model, developed early afterdepolarizations (EADs) under block of I<sub>K1</sub>, while I<sub>Kr</sub> block led to EADs in the human but not in the pig model. At fast rates (pacing cycle length = 400 ms), the human cell model was more susceptible to spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-mediated delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity than pig. Fast pacing led to alternans in human but not pig. Developing species-specific models incorporating electrophysiology and Ca<sup>2+-</sup>handling provides a tool to aid translating antiarrhythmic and arrhythmogenic assessment from the bench to the clinic.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BVP46t33U0E" width="1" />

<p>by Cemal Erdem, Adrian V. Lee, D. Lansing Taylor, Timothy R. Lezon</p>

Aberrant signaling through insulin (Ins) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) receptors contribute to the risk and advancement of many cancer types by activating cell survival cascades. Similarities between these pathways have thus far prevented the development of pharmacological interventions that specifically target either Ins or IGF1 signaling. To identify differences in early Ins and IGF1 signaling mechanisms, we developed a dual receptor (IGF1R &amp; InsR) computational response model. The model suggested that ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6K) plays a critical role in regulating MAPK and Akt activation levels in response to Ins and IGF1 stimulation. As predicted, perturbing RPS6K kinase activity led to an increased Akt activation with Ins stimulation compared to IGF1 stimulation. Being able to discern differential downstream signaling, we can explore improved anti-IGF1R cancer therapies by eliminating the emergence of compensation mechanisms without disrupting InsR signaling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZVEt7PIuwF8" width="1" />

<p>by Andreas Kopf, Vincent Fortuin, Vignesh Ram Somnath, Manfred Claassen</p>

Clustering high-dimensional data, such as images or biological measurements, is a long-standing problem and has been studied extensively. Recently, Deep Clustering has gained popularity due to its flexibility in fitting the specific peculiarities of complex data. Here we introduce the Mixture-of-Experts Similarity Variational Autoencoder (MoE-Sim-VAE), a novel generative clustering model. The model can learn multi-modal distributions of high-dimensional data and use these to generate realistic data with high efficacy and efficiency. MoE-Sim-VAE is based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), where the decoder consists of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This specific architecture allows for various modes of the data to be automatically learned by means of the experts. Additionally, we encourage the lower dimensional latent representation of our model to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution and to accurately represent the similarities between the data points. We assess the performance of our model on the MNIST benchmark data set and challenging real-world tasks of clustering mouse organs from single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements and defining cell subpopulations from mass cytometry (CyTOF) measurements on hundreds of different datasets. MoE-Sim-VAE exhibits superior clustering performance on all these tasks in comparison to the baselines as well as competitor methods.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kRd-T1PTHPM" width="1" />

<p>by Xize Xu, Hermann Riecke</p>

The synchronization of different <i>γ</i>-rhythms arising in different brain areas has been implicated in various cognitive functions. Here, we focus on the effect of the ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity on the synchronization of ING (interneuronal network gamma) and PING (pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma) rhythms. The synchronization properties of rhythms depends on the response of their collective phase to external input. We therefore determine the macroscopic phase-response curve for finite-amplitude perturbations (fmPRC) of ING- and PING-rhythms in all-to-all coupled networks comprised of linear (IF) or quadratic (QIF) integrate-and-fire neurons. For the QIF networks we complement the direct simulations with the adjoint method to determine the infinitesimal macroscopic PRC (imPRC) within the exact mean-field theory. We show that the intrinsic neuronal heterogeneity can qualitatively modify the fmPRC and the imPRC. Both PRCs can be biphasic and change sign (type II), even though the phase-response curve for the individual neurons is strictly non-negative (type I). Thus, for ING rhythms, say, external inhibition to the inhibitory cells can, in fact, advance the collective oscillation of the network, even though the same inhibition would lead to a delay when applied to uncoupled neurons. This paradoxical advance arises when the external inhibition modifies the internal dynamics of the network by reducing the number of spikes of inhibitory neurons; the advance resulting from this disinhibition outweighs the immediate delay caused by the external inhibition. These results explain how intrinsic heterogeneity allows ING- and PING-rhythms to become synchronized with a periodic forcing or another rhythm for a wider range in the mismatch of their frequencies. Our results identify a potential function of neuronal heterogeneity in the synchronization of coupled <i>γ</i>-rhythms, which may play a role in neural information transfer via communication through coherence.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k7q9H5KmN4I" width="1" />

<p>by Markus K. Klose, Paul J. Shaw</p>

Circadian rhythms help animals synchronize motivated behaviors to match environmental demands. Recent evidence indicates that clock neurons influence the timing of behavior by differentially altering the activity of a distributed network of downstream neurons. Downstream circuits can be remodeled by Hebbian plasticity, synaptic scaling, and, under some circumstances, activity-dependent addition of cell surface receptors; the role of this receptor respecification phenomena is not well studied. We demonstrate that high sleep pressure quickly reprograms the wake-promoting large ventrolateral clock neurons to express the pigment dispersing factor receptor (PDFR). The addition of this signaling input into the circuit is associated with increased waking and early mating success. The respecification of PDFR in both young and adult large ventrolateral neurons requires 2 dopamine (DA) receptors and activation of the transcriptional regulator <i>nejire</i> (cAMP response element-binding protein [CREB]). These data identify receptor respecification as an important mechanism to sculpt circuit function to match sleep levels with demand.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zS__JqbUlLg" width="1" />

Oxytocin/vasopressin-related neuropeptides are highly conserved and play major roles in regulating social behavior across vertebrates. However, whether their insect orthologue, inotocin, regulates the behavior of social groups remains unknown. Here, we show that in the clonal raider ant <i>Ooceraea biroi</i>, individuals that perform tasks outside the nest have higher levels of inotocin in their brains than individuals of the same age that remain inside the nest. We also show that older ants, which spend more time outside the nest, have higher inotocin levels than younger ants. Inotocin thus correlates with the propensity to perform tasks outside the nest. Additionally, increasing inotocin pharmacologically increases the tendency of ants to leave the nest. However, this effect is contingent on age and social context. Pharmacologically treated older ants have a higher propensity to leave the nest only in the presence of larvae, whereas younger ants seem to do so only in the presence of pupae. Our results suggest that inotocin signaling plays an important role in modulating behaviors that correlate with age, such as social foraging, possibly by modulating behavioral response thresholds to specific social cues. Inotocin signaling thereby likely contributes to behavioral individuality and division of labor in ant societies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TEXK-Kti1r0" width="1" />

Abstract
Reconsolidation of a contextual fear memory is a protein synthesis‐dependent process in which a previously destabilized memory returns to a stable state. This process has become the subject of many studies due to its importance in memory processing, maintenance and updating, and its potential role as a therapeutical target in fear memory disorders such as phobias and post‐traumatic stress disorder. In this sense, understanding the underlying mechanisms of memory reconsolidation is paramount in developing potential treatments for such memory dysfunctions. In the present work, we studied the interaction between two key neural structures involved in the reconsolidation process: the basolateral amygdala complex of the amygdala (BLA) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH). Our results show changes in the structural plasticity of the CA1 region of the DH in the form of dendritic spines density changes associated with the destabilization/reconsolidation process. Furthermore, we demonstrate a modulatory role of BLA over such structural plasticity by infusing different drugs such as ifenprodil, a destabilization blocker, and propranolol, a reconsolidation disruptor, in this brain structure. Altogether our work shows a particular temporal dynamic in the CA1 region of DH that accompanies the destabilization/reconsolidation process and aims to provide new information on the underlying mechanisms of this process that potentially contributes for a better understanding of memory storage, maintenance, expression and updating, and its potential medical applications.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.643860">Inhibition of AKT Signaling Alters βIV Spectrin Distribution at the AIS and Increases Neuronal Excitability</a></h4>

<p>The axon initial segment (AIS) is a highly regulated subcellular domain required for neuronal firing. Changes in the AIS protein composition and distribution are a form of structural plasticity, which powerfully regulates neuronal activity and may underlie several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite its physiological and pathophysiological relevance, the signaling pathways mediating AIS protein distribution are still poorly studied. Here, we used confocal imaging and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology in primary hippocampal neurons to study how AIS protein composition and neuronal firing varied in response to selected kinase inhibitors targeting the AKT/GSK3 pathway, which has previously been shown to phosphorylate AIS proteins. Image-based features representing the cellular pattern distribution of the voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channel, ankyrin G, βIV spectrin, and the cell-adhesion molecule neurofascin were analyzed, revealing βIV spectrin as the most sensitive AIS protein to AKT/GSK3 pathway inhibition. Within this pathway, inhibition of AKT by triciribine has the greatest effect on βIV spectrin localization to the AIS and its subcellular distribution within neurons, a phenotype that Support Vector Machine classification was able to accurately distinguish from control. Treatment with triciribine also resulted in increased excitability in primary hippocampal neurons. Thus, perturbations to signaling mechanisms within the AKT pathway contribute to changes in βIV spectrin distribution and neuronal firing that may be associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.684988">Behavioral and Thermoregulatory Responses to Changes in Ambient Temperature and Wheel Running Availability in Octodon degus</a></h4>

<p>Octodon degus is primarily a diurnal species, however, in laboratory conditions, it can switch from diurnal to nocturnal in response to wheel running availability. It has been proposed that this activity inversion obeys thermoregulatory constraints induced by vigorous physical exercise. Thus, its activity shifts to the night as the ambient temperature is lower.Here, we investigate the relationship between thermoregulation and the activity phase-inversion in response to wheel-running in this species. We measured behavioral activity and body temperature rhythms in diurnal naïve animals under 12 h light: 12 h dark cycles at four different ambient temperatures (spanning from ~26°C to 32°C), and following access to running wheels while maintained under high ambient temperature.Our results show that naïve degus do not shift their diurnal activity and body temperature rhythms to a nocturnal phase when subjected to sequential increases in ambient temperature. However, when they were provided with wheels under constant high-temperature conditions, all animals inverted their diurnal phase preference becoming nocturnal. Both, negative masking by light and entrainment to the dark phase appeared involved in the nocturnalism of these animals. Analysis of the thermoregulatory response to wheel running revealed some differences between masked and entrained nocturnal chronotypes.These data highlight the importance of the coupling between wheel running availability and ambient temperature in the nocturnalism of the degus. The results support the view that an innate “protective” pre-program mechanism (associating darkness and lower ambient temperature) may change the timing of behavioral activity in this species to reduce the potential risk of hyperthermia.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by disrupted memory, learning functions, reduced life expectancy, and locomotor dysfunction, as a result of the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid peptides that cause neuronal damage in neuronal circuits. In the current study, we exploited a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster line, expressing amyloid-β peptides to investigate the efficacy of a newly synthesized acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, named XJP-1, as a potential AD therapy. Behavioral assays and confocal microscopy were used to characterize the drug effect on AD symptomatology and amyloid peptide deposition. The symptomatology induced in this particular transgenic model recapitulates the scenario observed in human AD patients, showing a shortened lifespan and reduced locomotor functions, along with a significant accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. XJP-1 treatment resulted in a significant improvement of AD symptoms and a reduction of amyloid plaques by diminishing the amyloid aggregation rate. In comparison with clinically effective AD drugs, our results demonstrated that XJP-1 has similar effects on AD symptomatology, but at 10 times lower drug concentration than donepezil. It also showed an earlier beneficial effect on the reduction of amyloid plaques at 10 days after drug treatment, as observed for donepezil at 20 days, while the other drugs tested have no such effect. As a novel and potent AChE inhibitor, our study demonstrates that inhibition of the enzyme AChE by XJP-1 treatment improves the amyloid-induced symptomatology in Drosophila, by reducing the number of amyloid plaques within the fruit fly CNS. Thus, compound XJP-1 has the therapeutic potential to be further investigated for the treatment of AD.</p>

<p>Severe cerebrovascular disease is an acute cerebrovascular event that causes severe neurological damage in patients, and is often accompanied by severe dysfunction of multiple systems such as breathing and circulation. Patients with severe cerebrovascular disease are in critical condition, have many complications, and are prone to deterioration of neurological function. Therefore, they need closer monitoring and treatment. The treatment strategy in the acute phase directly determines the prognosis of the patient. The case of this article selected 90 patients with severe cerebrovascular disease who were hospitalized in four wards of the Department of Neurology and the Department of Critical Care Medicine in a university hospital. The included cases were in accordance with the guidelines for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Patients with cerebral infarction are given routine treatments such as improving cerebral circulation, protecting nutrient brain cells, dehydration, and anti-platelet; patients with cerebral hemorrhage are treated within the corresponding safe time window. We use Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) Statistics21 software to perform statistical analysis on the results. Based on the study of the feature extraction process of convolutional neural network, according to the hierarchical principle of convolutional neural network, a backbone neural network MF (Multi-Features)—Dense Net that can realize the fusion, and extraction of multi-scale features is designed. The network combines the characteristics of densely connected network and feature pyramid network structure, and combines strong feature extraction ability, high robustness and relatively small parameter amount. An end-to-end monitoring algorithm for severe cerebrovascular diseases based on MF-Dense Net is proposed. In the experiment, the algorithm showed high monitoring accuracy, and at the same time reached the speed of real-time monitoring on the experimental platform. An improved spatial pyramid pooling structure is designed to strengthen the network’s ability to merge and extract local features at the same level and at multiple scales, which can further improve the accuracy of algorithm monitoring by paying a small amount of additional computational cost. At the same time, a method is designed to strengthen the use of low-level features by improving the network structure, which improves the algorithm’s monitoring performance on small-scale severe cerebrovascular diseases. For patients with severe cerebrovascular disease in general, APACHEII1, APACHEII2, APACHEII3 and the trend of APACHEII score change are divided into high-risk group and low-risk group. The overall severe cerebrovascular disease, severe cerebral hemorrhage and severe cerebral infarction are analyzed, respectively. The differences are statistically significant.</p>

<p>There has been a growing interest in the non-invasive stimulation of specific brain tissues, while reducing unintended stimulation in surrounding regions, for the medical treatment of brain disorders. Traditional methods for non-invasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), can stimulate brain regions, but they also simultaneously stimulate the brain and non-brain regions that lie between the target and the stimulation site of the source. Temporal interference (TI) stimulation has been suggested to selectively stimulate brain regions by superposing two alternating currents with slightly different frequencies injected through electrodes attached to the scalp. Previous studies have reported promising results for TI applied to the motor area in mice, but the mechanisms are yet to be clarified. As computational techniques can help reveal different aspects of TI, in this study, we computationally investigated TI stimulation using a multiscale model that computes the generated interference current pattern effects in a neural cortical model of a mouse head. The results indicated that the threshold increased with the carrier frequency and that the beat frequency did not influence the threshold. It was also found that the intensity ratio between the alternating currents changed the location of the responding nerve, which is in agreement with previous experiments. Moreover, particular characteristics of the envelope were investigated to predict the stimulation region intuitively. It was found that regions with high modulation depth (| maximum| − | minimum| values of the envelope) and low minimum envelope (near zero) corresponded with the activation region obtained via neural computation.</p>

<p>Axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), is a major cause of chronic pain and disability that profoundly alters the quality of life of patients. Nearly half of patients with SpA usually develop drug resistance. Non-pharmacological treatments targeting inflammation are an attractive alternative to drug administration. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), by promoting a cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex holds promise for treating inflammatory disease. Inflammatory reflex signaling, which is enhanced by electrically stimulating the vagus nerve, significantly reduces cytokine production and attenuates disease severity in animal models of endotoxemia, sepsis, colitis, and other preclinical models of inflammatory diseases. It has been proposed that vagal efferent fibers release acetylcholine (Ach), which can interact with α7-subunit-containing nicotinic receptors expressed by tissue macrophages and other immune cells to rapidly inhibit the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-18. External vagal nerve stimulation devices are now available that do not require surgery nor implantation to non-invasively stimulate the vagal nerve. This double-blind randomized cross-over clinical trial aims to study the change in SpA disease activity, according to Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis 20 (ASAS20) definition, after 12 weeks of non-invasive VNS treatment vs. non-specific dummy stimulation (control group). One hundred and twenty adult patients with drug resistant SpA, meeting the ASAS classification criteria, will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized into two parallel groups according to a cross over design: either active VNS for 12 weeks, then dummy stimulation for 12 weeks, or dummy stimulation for 12 weeks, then active VNS for 12 weeks. The two stimulation periods will be separated by a 4 weeks wash-out period. A transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulator Tens Eco Plus SCHWA MEDICO<sup>TM</sup> France will be used in this study. The active VNS stimulation will be applied in the cymba conchae of the left ear upon the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, using low intensity (2–5 mA), once à week, during 1 h. Dummy stimulation will be performed under the same conditions and parameters as active VNS stimulation, but at an irrelevant anatomical site: the left ear lobule. This multicenter study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04286373.</p>

<p>Both neural activities and psychological processes vary over time. Individuals with interdependent self-construal tend to define themselves and adjust their behaviors to social contexts and others. The current research tested the hypothesis that the coordination between interdependent self-construal and neural variability could predict life satisfaction changes in university freshmen. We integrated resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning and self-construal assessment to estimate self-dependent neural variability (SDNV). In the whole-brain prediction, SDNV successfully predicted individuals’ life satisfaction changes over 2 years. Interdependent individuals with higher neural variability and independent individuals with lower neural variability became more satisfied with their lives. In the network-based prediction, the predictive effects were significant in the default mode, frontoparietal control, visual and salience networks. The important nodes that contributed to the predictive models were more related to psychological constructs associated with the social and self-oriented functions. The current research sheds light on the neural and psychological mechanisms of the subjective well-being of individuals from a dynamic perspective.</p>

<p>The present study aimed to explore the cortical activity underlying mental rotation in high-altitude immigrants via the event-related desynchronization (ERD), the electroencephalogram time–frequency analysis, and source localization based on electroencephalographic data. When compared with the low-altitude individuals, the reaction time of mental rotation tasks was significantly slower in immigrants who had lived in high-altitude areas for 3 years. The time–frequency analysis showed that the alpha ERD and the beta ERD within the time window (400–700 ms) were decreased during the mental rotation tasks in these immigrants. The decreased ERD was observed at the parietal–occipital regions within the alpha band and at the central–parietal regions within the beta band. The decreased ERD might embody the sensorimotor-related cortical activity from hypoxia, which might be involved in cognitive control function in high-altitude immigrants, which provided insights into the neural mechanism of spatial cognition change on aspect of embodied cognition due to high-altitude exposure.</p>

<p>For this study, we examined how recognizing the writing process of calligraphy influences the cognitive and affective processes related to appreciating it, with the aim of contributing to both graphonomics and the psychology of aesthetics. To this end, we conducted two Web-based experiments in which some participants were instructed to view calligraphy by tracing it with their eyes (the tracing method), while others were told to feel free to think and imagine whatever they wanted. Study 1 (N = 103) revealed that the tracing method elicits stronger admiration, inspiration, and empathy in viewers. Study 2 (N = 87) showed that the tracing method decreases the average heart rate of those who do not frequently engage in calligraphy appreciation as they gaze at calligraphy for a minute-and-a-half (during the second half of the stimulus duration); this suggests that the tracing method could keep viewers from becoming bored while looking at calligraphy. In sum, the tracing method has positive effects on viewing calligraphy. From a broader perspective, the results imply that how in detail viewers recognize the process of creating an artwork will be a key determinant of art appreciation. In addition, our findings demonstrate how we can measure cardiac activities using the emerging technology of the photoplethysmogram (PPG).</p>

<p>We have previously reported different spike firing correlation patterns among pairs of adjacent pyramidal neurons within the same layer of S1 cortex in vivo, which was argued to suggest that acquired synaptic weight modifications would tend to differentiate adjacent cortical neurons despite them having access to near-identical afferent inputs. Here we made simultaneous single-electrode loose patch-clamp recordings from 14 pairs of adjacent neurons in the lateral thalamus of the ketamine-xylazine anesthetized rat in vivo to study the correlation patterns in their spike firing. As the synapses on thalamic neurons are dominated by a high number of low weight cortical inputs, which would be expected to be shared for two adjacent neurons, and as far as thalamic neurons have homogenous membrane physiology and spike generation, they would be expected to have overall similar spike firing and therefore also correlation patterns. However, we find that across a variety of thalamic nuclei the correlation patterns between pairs of adjacent thalamic neurons vary widely. The findings suggest that the connectivity and cellular physiology of the thalamocortical circuitry, in contrast to what would be expected from a straightforward interpretation of corticothalamic maps and uniform intrinsic cellular neurophysiology, has been shaped by learning to the extent that each pair of thalamic neuron has a unique relationship in their spike firing activity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.679796">Revisiting Persistent Neuronal Activity During Covert Spatial Attention</a></h4>

<p>Persistent activity has been observed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), in particular during the delay periods of visual attention tasks. Classical approaches based on the average activity over multiple trials have revealed that such an activity encodes the information about the attentional instruction provided in such tasks. However, single-trial approaches have shown that activity in this area is rather sparse than persistent and highly heterogeneous not only within the trials but also between the different trials. Thus, this observation raised the question of how persistent the actually persistent attention-related prefrontal activity is and how it contributes to spatial attention. In this paper, we review recent evidence of precisely deconstructing the persistence of the neural activity in the PFC in the context of attention orienting. The inclusion of machine-learning methods for decoding the information reveals that attention orienting is a highly dynamic process, possessing intrinsic oscillatory dynamics working at multiple timescales spanning from milliseconds to minutes. Dimensionality reduction methods further show that this persistent activity dynamically incorporates multiple sources of information. This novel framework reflects a high complexity in the neural representation of the attention-related information in the PFC, and how its computational organization predicts behavior.</p>

<p>The neurovascular unit (NVU) of the brain is composed of multiple cell types that act synergistically to modify blood flow to locally match the energy demand of neural activity, as well as to maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). It is becoming increasingly recognized that the functional specialization, as well as the cellular composition of the NVU varies spatially. This heterogeneity is encountered as variations in vascular and perivascular cells along the arteriole-capillary-venule axis, as well as through differences in NVU composition throughout anatomical regions of the brain. Given the wide variations in metabolic demands between brain regions, especially those of gray vs. white matter, the spatial heterogeneity of the NVU is critical to brain function. Here we review recent evidence demonstrating regional specialization of the NVU between brain regions, by focusing on the heterogeneity of its individual cellular components and briefly discussing novel approaches to investigate NVU diversity.</p>

<p>Denervation can activate the catabolic pathway in skeletal muscle and lead to progressive skeletal muscle atrophy. At present, there is no effective treatment for muscle atrophy. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) has recently been found to be closely related to muscle atrophy, but the underlying mechanism of HDAC4 in denervation-induced muscle atrophy have not been described clearly yet. In this study, we found that the expression of HDAC4 increased significantly in denervated skeletal muscle. HDAC4 inhibition can effectively diminish denervation-induced muscle atrophy, reduce the expression of muscle specific E3 ubiquitin ligase (MuRF1 and MAFbx) and autophagy related proteins (Atg7, LC3B, PINK1 and BNIP3), inhibit the transformation of type I fibers to type II fibers, and enhance the expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1 α. Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis was performed and suggested that HDAC4 may be involved in denervation-induced muscle atrophy by regulating the response to denervation involved in the regulation of muscle adaptation, cell division, cell cycle, apoptotic process, skeletal muscle atrophy, and cell differentiation. STRING analysis showed that HDAC4 may be involved in the process of muscle atrophy by directly regulating myogenin (MYOG), cell cycle inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A) and salt induced kinase 1 (SIK1). MYOG was significantly increased in denervated skeletal muscle, and MYOG inhibition could significantly alleviate denervation-induced muscle atrophy, accompanied by the decreased MuRF1 and MAFbx. MYOG overexpression could reduce the protective effect of HDAC4 inhibition on denervation-induced muscle atrophy, as evidenced by the decreased muscle mass and cross-sectional area of muscle fibers, and the increased mitophagy. Taken together, HDAC4 inhibition can alleviate denervation-induced muscle atrophy by reducing MYOG expression, and HDAC4 is also directly related to CDKN1A and SIK1 in skeletal muscle, which suggests that HDAC4 inhibitors may be a potential drug for the treatment of neurogenic muscle atrophy. These results not only enrich the molecular regulation mechanism of denervation-induced muscle atrophy, but also provide the experimental basis for HDAC4-MYOG axis as a new target for the prevention and treatment of muscular atrophy.</p>

<p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common microvascular complications associated with diabetes mellitus. However, its correlation with another diabetes-related disorder, cognitive impairment, has not been well studied. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the association between DR and cognitive impairment. MEDLINE (PubMed), the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were searched for observational studies that reported an association between DR and cognitive impairment. Data from selected studies were extracted, and a meta-analysis was conducted using fixed-effects modeling. Fifteen observational studies were included in the systematic review, and 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The odds ratio of the association between DR and cognitive impairment was 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.89–2.66; I<sup>2</sup> = 0.8%). The hazard ratio of the association between DR and cognitive impairment was significant in four studies, ranging from 1.09–1.32. Minimal or mild DR was not significantly associated with cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR], 2.04; 95% CI, 0.87–4.77). However, the association between proliferative DR and cognitive impairment (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.79–7.12; I<sup>2</sup> = 16.6%) was not stronger than the association between moderate or worse DR and cognitive impairment (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 2.01–9.07; I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%). DR is associated with cognitive impairment, and screening for DR will be helpful for the early identification of individuals with cognitive impairment. Further studies are needed to confirm the association between proliferative DR and cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>Microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response in the early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been reported to have an impact on progress, and the mechanism is not completely understood. Here, we performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis of microglia purified from damaged hemisphere of adult mice at 3 days after SAH or sham operation. Robust transcriptional changes were observed between SAH-induced and healthy microglia, indicating rapid activation of microglia after suffering from SAH. We identified 1576 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 928 upregulated and 648 downregulated) in SAH-induced microglia compared with sham microglia, representing a strong alteration of the genome (6.85% of total ∼23,000 genes). Functional enrichment of these DEGs indicated that cell division, inflammatory response, cytokine production, and leukocyte chemotaxis were strongly activated in SAH-induced microglia. Moreover, we identified and proved that the TLR2/IRF7 signaling axis was involved in the regulation of this microglia-mediated inflammation in SAH mice by performing flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Together, these results provided a perspective of microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response in the early stage of SAH and might give a new therapeutic target for SAH.</p>

Abstract
Social interactions are partly driven by our ability to empathize—the capacity to share and understand others’ inner states. While a growing body of evidence suggests a link between past experiences and empathy, to what degree empathy is dependent on our own previous experiences (autobiographical memories, AMs) is still unclear. Whereas neuroimaging studies have shown wide overlapping brain networks underpinning AM and empathic processes, studies on clinical populations with memory loss have not always shown empathy is impaired. The current transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography study will seek to shed light on this neuropsychological puzzle by testing whether self‐perceived empathy is causally linked to AM retrieval. Cortical activity, together with self‐rating of empathy, will be recorded for scenarios that echo personal experiences while a brain region critical for AM retrieval will be transiently inhibited using TMS before task performance.

<p>by Steffen S. Docken, Colleen E. Clancy, Timothy J. Lewis</p>

State-dependent sodium channel blockers are often prescribed to treat cardiac arrhythmias, but many sodium channel blockers are known to have pro-arrhythmic side effects. While the anti and proarrhythmic potential of a sodium channel blocker is thought to depend on the characteristics of its rate-dependent block, the mechanisms linking these two attributes are unclear. Furthermore, how specific properties of rate-dependent block arise from the binding kinetics of a particular drug is poorly understood. Here, we examine the rate-dependent effects of the sodium channel blocker lidocaine by constructing and analyzing a novel drug-channel interaction model. First, we identify the predominant mode of lidocaine binding in a 24 variable Markov model for lidocaine-sodium channel interaction by Moreno et al. Specifically, we find that (1) the vast majority of lidocaine bound to sodium channels is in the neutral form, i.e., the binding of charged lidocaine to sodium channels is negligible, and (2) neutral lidocaine binds almost exclusively to inactivated channels and, upon binding, immobilizes channels in the inactivated state. We then develop a novel 3-variable lidocaine-sodium channel interaction model that incorporates only the predominant mode of drug binding. Our low-dimensional model replicates an extensive amount of the voltage-clamp data used to parameterize the Moreno et al. model. Furthermore, the effects of lidocaine on action potential upstroke velocity and conduction velocity in our model are similar to those predicted by the Moreno et al. model. By exploiting the low-dimensionality of our model, we derive an algebraic expression for level of rate-dependent block as a function of pacing frequency, restitution properties, diastolic and plateau potentials, and drug binding rate constants. Our model predicts that the level of rate-dependent block is sensitive to alterations in restitution properties and increases in diastolic potential, but it is insensitive to variations in the shape of the action potential waveform and lidocaine binding rates.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9WWCiVsdDJo" width="1" />

Little is known about mechanisms of membrane fission in bacteria despite their requirement for cytokinesis. The only known dedicated membrane fission machinery in bacteria, fission protein B (FisB), is expressed during sporulation in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and is required to release the developing spore into the mother cell cytoplasm. Here, we characterized the requirements for FisB-mediated membrane fission. FisB forms mobile clusters of approximately 12 molecules that give way to an immobile cluster at the engulfment pole containing approximately 40 proteins at the time of membrane fission. Analysis of FisB mutants revealed that binding to acidic lipids and homo-oligomerization are both critical for targeting FisB to the engulfment pole and membrane fission. Experiments using artificial membranes and filamentous cells suggest that FisB does not have an intrinsic ability to sense or induce membrane curvature but can bridge membranes. Finally, modeling suggests that homo-oligomerization and <i>trans</i>-interactions with membranes are sufficient to explain FisB accumulation at the membrane neck that connects the engulfment membrane to the rest of the mother cell membrane during late stages of engulfment. Together, our results show that FisB is a robust and unusual membrane fission protein that relies on homo-oligomerization, lipid binding, and the unique membrane topology generated during engulfment for localization and membrane scission, but surprisingly, not on lipid microdomains, negative-curvature lipids, or curvature sensing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vSwKiN4nIyM" width="1" />

Objective
The MAST family of microtubule‐associated serine–threonine kinases (STK) have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature human and mouse brain. To date, only MAST1 has been conclusively associated with neurological disease, with de novo variants in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder, including a mega corpus callosum.


Methods
Using exome sequencing we identify MAST3 missense variants in individuals with epilepsy. We also assess the effect of these variants on the ability of MAST3 to phosphorylate the target gene product ARPP‐16 in HEK293T cells.


Results
We identify de novo missense variants in the STK domain in 11 individuals, including two recurrent variants p.G510S (n = 5) and p.G515S (n = 3). All 11 individuals had developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, with 8 having normal development prior to seizure onset at &lt;2 years of age. All patients developed multiple seizure types, while 9/11 had seizures triggered by fever and 9/11 had drug‐resistant seizures. In vitro analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with MAST3 cDNA carrying a subset of these patient‐specific missense variants demonstrated variable but generally lower expression, with concomitant increased phosphorylation of the MAST3 target, ARPP‐16, compared to wildtype. These findings suggest the patient‐specific variants may confer MAST3 gain‐of‐function. Moreover, single‐nuclei RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry shows that MAST3 expression is restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex late in prenatal development and postnatally.


Interpretation
In summary, we describe MAST3 as a novel epilepsy‐associated gene with a potential gain‐of‐function pathogenic mechanism that may be primarily restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex.

Resilience to stress in male rats is lost 2 weeks after social defeat stress.

Abstract
Resilience to stress is the ability to quickly adapt to adversity. There is evidence that exposure to prolonged stress triggers neuroinflammation what produces individual differences in stress vulnerability. However, the relationship between stress resilience, neuroinflammation, and depressive‐like behaviors remains unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the long‐term effects of social defeat stress (SDS) on neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and depressive‐like behaviors. Male rats were subjected to the SDS paradigm. Social interaction was analyzed 1 and 2 weeks after ending the SDS to determine which animals were susceptible or resilient to stress. Neuroinflammation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein, ionized calcium‐binding adaptor molecule 1, and elevated membrane permeability in astrocytes and microglia, as well as depressive‐like behaviors in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test were evaluated in all rats. One week after SDS, resilient rats increased their sucrose preference, and time spent in the floating behavior decreased in the forced swim test compared to susceptible rats. Surprisingly, resilient rats became susceptible to stress, and presented neuroinflammation 2 weeks after SDS. These findings suggest that SDS‐induced hippocampal neuroinflammation persists in post‐stress stages, regardless of whether rats were initially resilient or not. Our study opens a new approach to understanding the neurobiology of stress resilience.

Objective
To identify susceptibility loci for cluster headache and obtain insights into relevant disease pathways.


Methods
We carried out a genome‐wide association study, where 852 UK and 591 Swedish cluster headache cases were compared with 5,614 and 1,134 controls, respectively. Following quality control and imputation, single variant association testing was conducted using a logistic mixed model, for each cohort. The two cohorts were subsequently combined in a merged analysis. Downstream analyses, such as gene‐set enrichment, functional variant annotation, prediction and pathway analyses, were performed.


Results
Initial independent analysis identified two replicable cluster headache susceptibility loci on chromosome 2. A merged analysis identified an additional locus on chromosome 1 and confirmed a locus significant in the UK analysis on chromosome 6, which overlaps with a previously known migraine locus. The lead single nucleotide polymorphisms were rs113658130 (p = 1.92 x 10−17, OR [95%CI] = 1.51 [1.37–1.66]) and rs4519530 (p = 6.98 x 10−17, OR = 1.47 [1.34–1.61]) on chromosome 2, rs12121134 on chromosome 1 (p = 1.66 x 10−8, OR = 1.36 [1.22–1.52]) and rs11153082 (p = 1.85 x 10−8, OR = 1.30 [1.19–1.42]) on chromosome 6. Downstream analyses implicated immunological processes in the pathogenesis of cluster headache.


Interpretation
We identified and replicated several genome‐wide‐significant associations supporting a genetic predisposition in cluster headache in a genome‐wide association study involving 1,443 cases. Replication in larger independent cohorts combined with comprehensive phenotyping, in relation to e.g. treatment response and cluster headache subtypes, could provide unprecedented insights into genotype–phenotype correlations and the pathophysiological pathways underlying cluster headache.

Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have a huge impact on patients, caregivers, and the health‐care system. To date, the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairments in PD has been established based on domain‐general functions such as executive functions, attention, or working memory. However, specific numerical deficits observed in clinical practice have not yet been systematically investigated. PD‐immanent deterioration of domain‐general functions and domain‐specific numerical areas suggests the mechanisms of both primary and secondary dyscalculia. The current study will systematically investigate basic number processing performance in PD patients for the first time, targeting domain‐specific cognitive representations of numerosity and the influence of domain‐general factors. The overall sample consists of patients with a diagnosis of PD, according to consensus guidelines, and healthy controls. PD patients will be stratified into patients with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment (level I‐PD‐MCI based on cognitive screening). Basic number processing will be assessed using transcoding, number line estimation, and (non)symbolic number magnitude comparison tasks. Discriminant analysis will be employed to assess whether basic number processing tasks can differentiate between a healthy control group and both PD groups. All participants will be subjected to a comprehensive numerical and a neuropsychological test battery, as well as sociodemographic and clinical measures. Study results will give the first broad insight into the extent of basic numerical deficits in different PD patient groups and will help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of the numerical deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.

The illustration of the generation of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells from SCPs associated with nerves during zebrafish development. In fish, peripheral nerve‐associated SCPs detach and generate the majority of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells over significant periods of development and growth.

Abstract
The autonomic portion of the peripheral nervous system orchestrates tissue homeostasis through direct innervation of internal organs, and via release of adrenalin and noradrenalin into the blood flow. The developmental mechanisms behind the formation of autonomic neurons and chromaffin cells are not fully understood. Using genetic tracing, we discovered that a significant proportion of sympathetic neurons in zebrafish originates from Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) during a defined period of embryonic development. Moreover, SCPs give rise to the main portion of the chromaffin cells, as well as to a significant proportion of enteric and other autonomic neurons associated with internal organs. The conversion of SCPs into neuronal and chromaffin cells is ErbB receptor dependent, as the pharmacological inhibition of the ErbB pathway effectively perturbed this transition. Finally, using genetic ablations, we revealed that SCPs producing neurons and chromaffin cells migrate along spinal motor axons to reach appropriate target locations. This study reveals the evolutionary conservation of SCP‐to‐neuron and SCP‐to‐chromaffin cell transitions over significant growth periods in fish and highlights relevant cellular‐genetic mechanisms. Based on this, we anticipate that multipotent SCPs might be present in postnatal vertebrate tissues, retaining the capacity to regenerate autonomic neurons and chromaffin cells.

<p>Zinc and copper are important trace elements necessary for the proper functioning of neurons. Impaired zinc and/or copper metabolism and signaling are implicated in many brain diseases, including autism (ASD). In our studies, autistic-like behavior in rat offsprings was induced by application to pregnant mothers valproic acid or thalidomide. Zinc and copper contents were measured in serum and brain structures: hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. Our research shows no interconnections in the particular metal concentrations measured in autistic animal brains and their sera. Based on patient researches, we studied 26 genes belonging to disturbed neurotransmitter pathways. In the same brain regions, we examined the expression of genes encoding proteins of cholinergic, adrenergic, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. In both rats’ ASD models, 17 out of the tested gene expression were decreased. In the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, expression of genes encoding cholinergic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic receptors decreased, whereas in the hippocampus only expression of serotoninergic receptors genes was downregulated. The changes in metals content observed in the rat brain can be secondary phenomena, perhaps elements of mechanisms that compensate for neurotransmission dysfunctions.</p>

<p>Dendrites and axons can extend dozens to hundreds of centimeters away from the cell body so that a single neuron can sense and respond to thousands of stimuli. Thus, for an accurate function of dendrites and axons the neuronal proteome needs to be asymmetrically distributed within neurons. Protein asymmetry can be achieved by the transport of the protein itself or the transport of the mRNA that is then translated at target sites in neuronal processes. The latter transport mechanism implies local translation of localized mRNAs. The role of local translation in nervous system (NS) development and maintenance is well established, but recently there is growing evidence that this mechanism and its deregulation are also relevant in NS pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, upon pathological signals disease-related proteins can be locally synthesized in dendrites and axons. Locally synthesized proteins can exert their effects at or close to the site of translation, or they can be delivered to distal compartments like the nucleus and induce transcriptional responses that lead to neurodegeneration, nerve regeneration and other cell-wide responses. Relevant key players in the process of local protein synthesis are RNA binding proteins (RBPs), responsible for mRNA transport to neurites. Several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal motor atrophy, are characterized by mutations in genes encoding for RBPs and consequently mRNA localization and local translation are impaired. In other diseases changes in the local mRNA repertoire and altered local protein synthesis have been reported. In this review, we will discuss how deregulation of localized translation at different levels can contribute to the development and progression of nervous system pathologies.</p>

<p>Neuromorphic devices that can emulate the bionic sensory and perceptual functions of neural systems have great applications in personal healthcare monitoring, neuro-prosthetics, and human–machine interfaces. In order to realize bionic sensing and perception, it’s crucial to prepare neuromorphic devices with the function of perceiving environment in real-time. Up to now, lots of efforts have been made in the incorporation of the bio-inspired sensing and neuromorphic engineering in the booming artificial intelligence industry. In this review, we first introduce neuromorphic devices based on diverse materials and mechanisms. Then we summarize the progress made in the emulation of biological sensing and perception systems. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in these fields are also discussed.</p>

<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide non-invasive measures of brain activity at varying spatial and temporal scales, offering different views on brain function for both clinical and experimental applications. Simultaneous recording of these measures attempts to maximize the respective strengths of each method, while compensating for their weaknesses. However, combined recording is not necessary to address all research questions of interest, and experiments may have greater statistical power to detect effects by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in separate recording sessions. While several existing papers discuss the reasons for or against combined recording, this article aims to synthesize these arguments into a flow chart of questions that researchers can consider when deciding whether to record EEG and fMRI separately or simultaneously. Given the potential advantages of simultaneous EEG-fMRI, the aim is to provide an initial overview of the most important concepts and to direct readers to relevant literature that will aid them in this decision.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.700046">How Self-Appraisal Is Mediated by the Brain</a></h4>

<p>Self-appraisal is a process that leads to the formation of self-esteem, which contributes to subjective well-being and mental health. Neuroimaging studies link self-esteem with the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), anterior insula (AIns), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It is not known, however, how the process of self-appraisal itself is mediated by the brain and how different nodes of the self-appraisal network interact with each other. In this study, we used multilevel mediation analysis of functional MRI data recorded during the trait adjective judgment task, treating the emotional valence of adjectives as the predictor, behavioral response as the dependent variable, and brain activity as the mediator. The mediation effect was revealed in the rTPJ. Dynamic causal modeling showed that positive self-descriptions trigger communication within the network, with the rTPJ exerting the strongest excitatory output and MPFC receiving the strongest excitatory input. rAIns receives the strongest inhibitory input and sends exclusively inhibitory connections to other regions pointing out to its role in the processing of negative self-descriptions. Analysis of individual differences showed that in some individuals, self-appraisal is mostly driven by the endorsement of positive self-descriptions and is accompanied by increased activation and communication between rTPJ, MPFC, and PCC. In others, self-appraisal is driven by the rejection of negative self-descriptions and is accompanied by increased activation of rAIns and inhibition of PCC and MPFC. Membership of these groups was predicted by different personality variables. This evidence uncovers different mechanisms of positive self-bias, which may contribute to different facets of self-esteem and are associated with different personality profiles.</p>

<p>Neurofeedback for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has long been studied as an alternative to medication, promising non-invasive treatment with minimal side-effects and sustained outcome. However, debate continues over the efficacy of neurofeedback, partly because existing evidence for efficacy is mixed and often non-specific, with unclear relationships between prognostic variables, patient performance when learning to self-regulate, and treatment outcomes. We report an extensive analysis on the understudied area of neurofeedback learning. Our data comes from a randomised controlled clinical trial in adults with ADHD (registered trial ISRCTN13915109; N = 23; 13:10 female:male; age 25–57). Patients were treated with either theta-beta ratio or sensorimotor-rhythm regimes for 40 one-hour sessions. We classify 11 learners vs 12 non-learners by the significance of random slopes in a linear mixed growth-curve model. We then analyse the predictors, outcomes, and processes of learners vs non-learners, using these groups as mutual controls. Significant predictive relationships were found in anxiety disorder (GAD), dissociative experience (DES), and behavioural inhibition (BIS) scores obtained during screening. Low DES, but high GAD and BIS, predicted positive learning. Patterns of behavioural outcomes from Test Of Variables of Attention, and symptoms from adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, suggested that learning itself is not required for positive outcomes. Finally, the learning process was analysed using structural-equations modelling with continuous-time data, estimating the short-term and sustained impact of each session on learning. A key finding is that our results support the conceptualisation of neurofeedback learning as skill acquisition, and not merely operant conditioning as originally proposed in the literature.</p>

<p>Action video gaming (AVG) places sustained cognitive load on various behavioral systems, thus offering new insights into learning-related neural plasticity. This study aims to determine whether AVG experience is associated with resting-state electroencephalogram (rs-EEG) temporal and spatial complexity, and if so, whether this effect is observable across AVG subgenres. Two AVG games – League of Legends (LOL) and Player Unknown’s Battle Grounds (PUBG) that represent two major AVG subgenres – were examined. We compared rs-EEG microstate and omega complexity between LOL experts and non-experts (Experiment 1) and between PUBG experts and non-experts (Experiment 2). We found that the experts and non-experts had different rs-EEG activities in both experiments, thus revealing the adaptive effect of AVG experience on brain development. Furthermore, we also found certain subgenre-specific complexity changes, supporting the recent proposal that AVG should be categorized based on the gaming mechanics of a specific game rather than a generic genre designation.</p>

<p>Microglia are the brain’s immunocompetent macrophages with a unique feature that allows surveillance of the surrounding microenvironment and subsequent reactions to tissue damage, infection, or homeostatic perturbations. Thereby, microglia’s striking morphological plasticity is one of their prominent characteristics and the categorization of microglial cell function based on morphology is well established. Frequently, automated classification of microglial morphological phenotypes is performed by using quantitative parameters. As this process is typically limited to a few and especially manually chosen criteria, a relevant selection bias may compromise the resulting classifications. In our study, we describe a novel microglial classification method by morphological evaluation using a convolutional neuronal network on the basis of manually selected cells in addition to classical morphological parameters. We focused on four microglial morphologies, ramified, rod-like, activated and amoeboid microglia within the murine hippocampus and cortex. The developed method for the classification was confirmed in a mouse model of ischemic stroke which is already known to result in microglial activation within affected brain regions. In conclusion, our classification of microglial morphological phenotypes using machine learning can serve as a time-saving and objective method for post-mortem characterization of microglial changes in healthy and disease mouse models, and might also represent a useful tool for human brain autopsy samples.</p>

<p>The present paper is the first comparative study on the astroglia of several actinopterygian species at different phylogenetical positions, teleosts (16 species), and non-teleosts (3 species), based on the immunohistochemical staining of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), the characteristic cytoskeletal intermediary filament protein, and immunohistochemical marker of astroglia. The question was, how the astroglial architecture reflexes the high diversity of this largest vertebrate group. The actinopterygian telencephalon has a so-called ‘eversive’ development in contrast to the ‘evagination’ found in sarcopterygii (including tetrapods). Several brain parts either have no equivalents in tetrapod vertebrates (e.g., torus longitudinalis, lobus inferior, lobus nervi vagi), or have rather different shapes (e.g., the cerebellum). GFAP was visualized applying DAKO polyclonal anti-GFAP serum. The study was focused mainly on the telencephalon (eversion), tectum (visual orientation), and cerebellum (motor coordination) where the evolutionary changes were most expected, but the other areas were also investigated. The predominant astroglial elements were tanycytes (long, thin, fiber-like cells). In the teleost telencephala a ‘fan-shape’ re-arrangement of radial glia reflects the eversion. In bichir, starlet, and gar, in which the eversion is less pronounced, the ‘fan-shape’ re-arrangement did not form. In the tectum the radial glial processes were immunostained, but in Ostariophysi and Euteleostei it did not extend into their deep segments. In the cerebellum Bergmann-like glia was found in each group, including non-teleosts, except for Cyprinidae. The vagal lobe was uniquely enlarged and layered in Cyprininae, and had a corresponding layered astroglial system, which left almost free of GFAP the zones of sensory and motor neurons. In conclusion, despite the diversity and evolutionary alterations of Actinopterygii brains, the diversity of the astroglial architecture is moderate. In contrast to Chondrichthyes and Amniotes; in Actinopterygii true astrocytes (stellate-shaped extraependymal cells) did not appear during evolution, and the expansion of GFAP-free areas was limited.</p>

<p>Everyday decision-making is supported by a dual-system of control comprised of parallel goal-directed and habitual systems. Over the past decade, the two-stage Markov decision task has become popularized for its ability to dissociate between goal-directed and habitual decision-making. While a handful of studies have implemented decision-making tasks online, only one study has validated the task by comparing in-person and web-based performance on the two-stage task in children and young adults. To date, no study has validated the dissociation of goal-directed and habitual behaviors in older adults online. Here, we implemented and validated a web-based version of the two-stage Markov task using parameter simulation and recovery and compared behavioral results from online and in-person participation on the two-stage task in both young and healthy older adults. We found no differences in estimated free parameters between online and in-person participation on the two-stage task. Further, we replicate previous findings that young adults are more goal-directed than older adults both in-person and online. Overall, this work demonstrates that the implementation and use of the two-stage Markov decision task for remote participation is feasible in the older adult demographic, which would allow for the study of decision-making with larger and more diverse samples.</p>

<p>by Silvia Ambrós, Neus Gómez-Muñoz, Silvia Giménez-Santamarina, Javier Sánchez-Vicente, Josep Navarro-López, Fernando Martínez, José-Antonio Daròs, Guillermo Rodrigo</p>

As genomic architectures become more complex, they begin to accumulate degenerate and redundant elements. However, analyses of the molecular mechanisms underlying these genetic architecture features remain scarce, especially in compact but sufficiently complex genomes. In the present study, we followed a proteomic approach together with a computational network analysis to reveal molecular signatures of protein function degeneracy from a plant virus (as virus-host protein-protein interactions). We employed affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry to detect several host factors interacting with two proteins of <i>Citrus tristeza virus</i> (p20 and p25) that are known to function as RNA silencing suppressors, using an experimental system of transient expression in a model plant. The study was expanded by considering two different isolates of the virus, and some key interactions were confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. We found that p20 and p25 target a common set of plant proteins including chloroplastic proteins and translation factors. Moreover, we noted that even specific targets of each viral protein overlap in function. Notably, we identified argonaute proteins (key players in RNA silencing) as reliable targets of p20. Furthermore, we found that these viral proteins preferentially do not target hubs in the host protein interactome, but elements that can transfer information by bridging different parts of the interactome. Overall, our results demonstrate that two distinct proteins encoded in the same viral genome that overlap in function also overlap in their interactions with the cell proteome, thereby highlighting an overlooked connection from a degenerate viral system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DmgBonblARI" width="1" />

<p>by Yuanhong Tang, Lingling An, Quan Wang, Jian K. Liu</p>

Synchronous oscillations in neural populations are considered being controlled by inhibitory neurons. In the granular layer of the cerebellum, two major types of cells are excitatory granular cells (GCs) and inhibitory Golgi cells (GoCs). GC spatiotemporal dynamics, as the output of the granular layer, is highly regulated by GoCs. However, there are various types of inhibition implemented by GoCs. With inputs from mossy fibers, GCs and GoCs are reciprocally connected to exhibit different network motifs of synaptic connections. From the view of GCs, feedforward inhibition is expressed as the direct input from GoCs excited by mossy fibers, whereas feedback inhibition is from GoCs via GCs themselves. In addition, there are abundant gap junctions between GoCs showing another form of inhibition. It remains unclear how these diverse copies of inhibition regulate neural population oscillation changes. Leveraging a computational model of the granular layer network, we addressed this question to examine the emergence and modulation of network oscillation using different types of inhibition. We show that at the network level, feedback inhibition is crucial to generate neural oscillation. When short-term plasticity was equipped on GoC-GC synapses, oscillations were largely diminished. Robust oscillations can only appear with additional gap junctions. Moreover, there was a substantial level of cross-frequency coupling in oscillation dynamics. Such a coupling was adjusted and strengthened by GoCs through feedback inhibition. Taken together, our results suggest that the cooperation of distinct types of GoC inhibition plays an essential role in regulating synchronous oscillations of the GC population. With GCs as the sole output of the granular network, their oscillation dynamics could potentially enhance the computational capability of downstream neurons.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mUWR-zZDQ7Q" width="1" />

<p>by Adam Richie-Halford, Jason Yeatman, Noah Simon, Ariel Rokem</p>

The white matter contains long-range connections between different brain regions and the organization of these connections holds important implications for brain function in health and disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue properties along the trajectories of these connections. Statistical inference from tractometry usually either averages these quantities along the length of each fiber bundle or computes regression models separately for each point along every one of the bundles. These approaches are limited in their sensitivity, in the former case, or in their statistical power, in the latter. We developed a method based on the sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into account tissue properties along all of the bundles and selects informative features by enforcing both global and bundle-level sparsity. We demonstrate the performance of the method in two settings: i) in a classification setting, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are accurately distinguished from matched controls. Furthermore, SGL identifies the corticospinal tract as important for this classification, correctly finding the parts of the white matter known to be affected by the disease. ii) In a regression setting, SGL accurately predicts “brain age.” In this case, the weights are distributed throughout the white matter indicating that many different regions of the white matter change over the lifespan. Thus, SGL leverages the multivariate relationships between diffusion properties in multiple bundles to make accurate phenotypic predictions while simultaneously discovering the most relevant features of the white matter.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rIbdV9_I_VM" width="1" />

Cancer is the result of mutagenic processes that can be inferred from tumor genomes by analyzing rate spectra of point mutations, or “mutational signatures”. Here we present SparseSignatures, a novel framework to extract signatures from somatic point mutation data. Our approach incorporates a user-specified background signature, employs regularization to reduce noise in non-background signatures, uses cross-validation to identify the number of signatures, and is scalable to large datasets. We show that SparseSignatures outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on simulated data using a variety of standard metrics. We then apply SparseSignatures to whole genome sequences of pancreatic and breast tumors, discovering well-differentiated signatures that are linked to known mutagenic mechanisms and are strongly associated with patient clinical features.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CyAiWRPg3_k" width="1" />

<p>by John T. Nardini, Bernadette J. Stolz, Kevin B. Flores, Heather A. Harrington, Helen M. Byrne</p>

Angiogenesis is the process by which blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels. It plays a key role in many biological processes, including embryonic development and wound healing, and contributes to many diseases including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. The structure of the resulting vessel networks determines their ability to deliver nutrients and remove waste products from biological tissues. Here we simulate the Anderson-Chaplain model of angiogenesis at different parameter values and quantify the vessel architectures of the resulting synthetic data. Specifically, we propose a topological data analysis (TDA) pipeline for systematic analysis of the model. TDA is a vibrant and relatively new field of computational mathematics for studying the shape of data. We compute topological and standard descriptors of model simulations generated by different parameter values. We show that TDA of model simulation data stratifies parameter space into regions with similar vessel morphology. The methodologies proposed here are widely applicable to other synthetic and experimental data including wound healing, development, and plant biology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yhP3eEOYSho" width="1" />

<p>by Adarsh Chitradurga Achutha, Herbert Peremans, Uwe Firzlaff, Dieter Vanderelst</p>

In most animals, natural stimuli are characterized by a high degree of redundancy, limiting the ensemble of ecologically valid stimuli to a significantly reduced subspace of the representation space. Neural encodings can exploit this redundancy and increase sensing efficiency by generating low-dimensional representations that retain all information essential to support behavior. In this study, we investigate whether such an efficient encoding can be found to support a broad range of echolocation tasks in bats. Starting from an ensemble of echo signals collected with a biomimetic sonar system in natural indoor and outdoor environments, we use independent component analysis to derive a low-dimensional encoding of the output of a cochlear model. We show that this compressive encoding retains all essential information. To this end, we simulate a range of psycho-acoustic experiments with bats. In these simulations, we train a set of neural networks to use the encoded echoes as input while performing the experiments. The results show that the neural networks’ performance is at least as good as that of the bats. We conclude that our results indicate that efficient encoding of echo information is feasible and, given its many advantages, very likely to be employed by bats. Previous studies have demonstrated that low-dimensional encodings allow for task resolution at a relatively high level. In contrast to previous work in this area, we show that high performance can also be achieved when low-dimensional filters are derived from a data set of realistic echo signals, not tailored to specific experimental conditions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WPbUhUfiA7g" width="1" />

The brain exhibits capabilities of fast incremental learning from few noisy examples, as well as the ability to associate similar memories in autonomously-created categories and to combine contextual hints with sensory perceptions. Together with sleep, these mechanisms are thought to be key components of many high-level cognitive functions. Yet, little is known about the underlying processes and the specific roles of different brain states. In this work, we exploited the combination of context and perception in a thalamo-cortical model based on a soft winner-take-all circuit of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons. After calibrating this model to express awake and deep-sleep states with features comparable with biological measures, we demonstrate the model capability of fast incremental learning from few examples, its resilience when proposed with noisy perceptions and contextual signals, and an improvement in visual classification after sleep due to induced synaptic homeostasis and association of similar memories.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KEA-y1Hdr-s" width="1" />

<p>by Jing Jiao, Gonzalo P. Suarez, Nina H. Fefferman</p>

With the development of social media, the information about vector-borne disease incidence over broad spatial scales can cause demand for local vector control before local risk exists. Anticipatory intervention may still benefit local disease control efforts; however, infection risks are not the only focal concerns governing public demand for vector control. Concern for environmental contamination from pesticides and economic limitations on the frequency and magnitude of control measures also play key roles. Further, public concern may be focused more on ecological factors (i.e., controlling mosquito populations) or on epidemiological factors (i.e., controlling infection-carrying mosquitoes), which may lead to very different control outcomes. Here we introduced a generic Ross-MacDonald model, incorporating these factors under three spatial scales of disease information: local, regional, and global. We tailored and parameterized the model for Zika virus transmitted by <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito. We found that sensitive reactivity caused by larger-scale incidence information could decrease average human infections per patch breeding capacity, however, the associated increase in total control effort plays a larger role, which leads to an overall decrease in control efficacy. The shift of focal concerns from epidemiological to ecological risk could relax the negative effect of the sensitive reactivity on control efficacy when mosquito breeding capacity populations are expected to be large. This work demonstrates that, depending on expected total mosquito breeding capacity population size, and weights of different focal concerns, large-scale disease information can reduce disease infections without lowering control efficacy. Our findings provide guidance for vector-control strategies by considering public reaction through social media.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bOqhziw6mu8" width="1" />

Proteins of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), predominantly known for antigen presentation in the immune system, have recently been shown to be necessary for developmental neural refinement and adult synaptic plasticity. However, their roles in nonneuronal cell populations in the brain remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify classical MHC I molecule H2-K<sup>b</sup> as a negative regulator of proliferation in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Using genetic knockout mouse models and in vivo viral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression, we delineate a role for H2-K<sup>b</sup> in negatively regulating NSPC proliferation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Transcriptomic analysis of H2-K<sup>b</sup> knockout NSPCs, in combination with in vitro RNAi, overexpression, and pharmacological approaches, further revealed that H2-K<sup>b</sup> inhibits cell proliferation by dampening signaling pathways downstream of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1). These findings identify H2-K<sup>b</sup> as a critical regulator of cell proliferation through the modulation of growth factor signaling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Gcex-ADRIZs" width="1" />

Can transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex improve implicit motor sequence learning in individuals with Parkinson's disease? A comparison with neurologically healthy, age‐ and sex‐matched controls.

Abstract
Implicit motor sequence learning (IMSL) is a cognitive function that is known to be directly associated with impaired motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Research on healthy young participants shows the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, over the primary motor cortex (M1) to enhance IMSL. tDCS has direct effects on the underlying cortex, but also induces distant (basal ganglia) network effects—hence its potential value in PD, a prime model of basal ganglia dysfunction. To date, only null effects have been reported in persons with PD. However, these studies did not determine the reacquisition effects, although previous studies in healthy young adults suggest that tDCS specifically exerts its beneficial effects on IMSL on reacquisition rather than acquisition. In the current study, we will therefore establish possible reacquisition effects, which are of a particular interest, as long‐term effects are vital for the successful functional rehabilitation of persons with PD. Using a sham‐controlled, counterbalanced design, we will investigate the potential of tDCS delivered over M1 to enhance IMSL, as measured by the serial reaction time task, in persons with PD and a neurologically healthy age‐ and sex‐matched control (HC) group. Multilevel Mixed Models will be implemented to analyze the sequence‐specific aspect of IMSL (primary outcome) and general learning (secondary outcome). We will determine not only the immediate effects that may occur concurrently with the application of tDCS but also the short‐term (5 min post‐tDCS) and long‐term (1 week post‐tDCS) reacquisition effects.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26149?af=R">Non‐cell autonomous epileptogenesis in focal cortical dysplasia</a></h4>

Objective
Low‐level somatic mosaicism in the brain has been shown to be a major genetic cause of intractable focal epilepsy. However, how a relatively few mutation‐carrying neurons are able to induce epileptogenesis at the local network level remains poorly understood.


Methods
To probe the origin of epileptogenesis, we measured the excitability of neurons with MTOR mutation and nearby non‐mutated neurons recorded by whole‐cell patch‐clamp and array‐based electrodes comparing the topographic distribution of mutation. Computational simulation is used to understand neural network‐level changes based on electrophysiological properties. To examine the underlying mechanism, we measured inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in mutated neurons and nearby neurons by electrophysiological and histological methods using the mouse model and postoperative human brain tissue for cortical dysplasia. To explain non‐cell autonomous hyperexcitability, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase was injected into mice to enhance adenosine signaling and to mitigate hyperactivity of nearby non‐mutated neurons.


Results
We generated mice having a low‐level somatic mutation in MTOR presenting spontaneous seizures. The seizure‐triggering hyperexcitability was originated from non‐mutated neurons near mutation‐carrying neurons which proved to be less excitable than non‐mutated neurons. Interestingly, the net balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto mutated neurons remained unchanged. Additionally, we found that inhibition of adenosine kinase, which affects adenosine metabolism and neuronal excitability, reduced the hyperexcitability of non‐mutated neurons.


Interpretation
This study showed that neurons carrying somatic mutations in MTOR lead to focal epileptogenesis via non‐cell autonomous hyperexcitability of nearby non‐mutated neurons.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26148?af=R">ANXA1 with anti‐inflammatory properties might contribute to parkinsonism</a></h4>

We here describe the identification of a novel variant in the anti‐inflammatory Annexin A1 protein likely to be the cause of disease in two siblings with autosomal recessive parkinsonism. The disease‐segregating variant was ascertained through a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole genome sequencing and was shown to impair phagocytosis in zebrafish mutant embryos. The highly conserved variant, absent in healthy individuals and public SNP databases, affected a functional domain of the protein with neuroprotective properties. This study supports the hypothesis that damaged microglia might lead to impairments in the clearance of accumulated and aggregated proteins resulting in parkinsonism.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25205?af=R">Differential expression of microRNAs in the developing avian auditory hindbrain</a></h4>

This study analyzed the spatiotemporal expression of ten microRNAs (miRNAs) in the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were broadly expressed in all four auditory nuclei.  In the nucleus magnocelluaris (NM), nine miRNAs showed a spatially differential expression along the cochleotopic axis at embryonic day 13, a pre‐hearing stage. Quantification resulted in four distinct miRNA expression patterns, namely, homogenous, gradient, selective, and highly selective. The latter two expression patterns matched rhombomeric boundaries of this plurisegmental nucleus. Bioinformatics identified several functional groups of target mRNAs that might play an important role during ontogeny of this nucleus. This study adds miRNAs to the list of developmental gradients in the auditory system.







Abstract
The avian auditory hindbrain is a longstanding model for studying neural circuit development. Information on gene regulatory network (GRN) components underlying this process, however, is scarce. Recently, the spatiotemporal expression of 12 miRNAs was investigated in the mammalian auditory hindbrain. As a comparative study, we here investigated the spatiotemporal expression of the orthologous miRNAs during development of the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were expressed both at E13, an immature stage, and P14, a mature stage of the auditory system. In most auditory nuclei, a homogeneous expression pattern was observed at both stages, like the mammalian system. An exception was the nucleus magnocellularis (NM). There, at E13, nine miRNAs showed a differential expression pattern along the cochleotopic axis with high expression at the rostromedial pole. One of them showed a gradient expression whereas eight showed a spatially selective expression at the rostral pole that reflected the different rhombomeric origins of this composite nucleus. The miRNA differential expression persisted in the NM to the mature stage, with the selective expression changed to linear gradients. Bioinformatics analysis predicted mRNA targets that are associated with neuronal developmental processes such as neurite and synapse organization, calcium and ephrin‐Eph signaling, and neurotransmission. Overall, this first analysis of miRNAs in the chicken central auditory system reveals shared and strikingly distinct features between chicken and murine orthologues. The embryonic gradient expression of these GRN elements in the NM adds miRNA patterns to the list of cochleotopic and developmental gradients in the central auditory system.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25204?af=R">Anatomy and function of retinorecipient arborization fields in zebrafish</a></h4>

Abstract
Burrill and Easter (1994) described the retinal projections in embryonic and larval zebrafish, introducing the term "arborization fields" (AFs) for the retinorecipient areas. AFs were numbered from 1 to 10 according to their positions along the optic tract. With the exception of AF10 (neuropil of the optic tectum), annotations of AFs remained tentative. Here we offer an update on the likely identities and functions of zebrafish AFs after successfully matching classical neuroanatomy to the digital Max Plack Zebrafish Brain atlas. In our system, individual AFs are neuropil areas associated with the following nuclei: AF1 with the suprachiasmatic nucleus; AF2 with the posterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus; AF3 and AF4 with the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus; AF4 with the anterior and intermediate thalamic nuclei; AF5 with the dorsal accessory optic nucleus; AF7 with the parvocellular superficial pretectal nucleus; AF8 with the central pretectal nucleus; and AF9d and AF9v with the dorsal and ventral periventricular pretectal nuclei. AF6 is probably part of the accessory optic system. Imaging, ablation and activation experiments showed contributions of AF5 and potentially AF6 to optokinetic and optomotor reflexes, AF4 to phototaxis, and AF7 to prey detection. AF6, AF8 and AF9v respond to dimming, and AF4 and AF9d to brightening. While few annotations remain tentative, it is apparent that the larval zebrafish visual system is anatomically and functionally continuous with its adult successor and fits the general cyprinid pattern. This study illustrates the synergy created by merging classical neuroanatomy with a cellular‐resolution digital brain atlas resource and functional imaging in larval zebrafish.

Objective
Identifying common genetic variants that confer genetic risk for cluster headache.


Methods
We conducted a case–control study in the Dutch Leiden University Cluster headache neuro‐Analysis program (LUCA) study population (n = 840) and controls from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity Study (NEO) (n = 1,457), representing the general population. Replication was performed in a Norwegian sample of 144 cases from the Trondheim Cluster headache sample and 1,800 controls from the Nord‐Trøndelag Health Survey (HUNT). Gene set and tissue enrichment analyses, blood cell‐derived RNA‐sequencing of genes around the risk loci and linkage disequilibrium score regression were part of the downstream analyses.


Results
An association was found with cluster headache for four independent loci (r2 &lt; 0.1) with genome‐wide significance (p &lt; 5 x 10−8), rs11579212 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% CI 1.33–1.72 near RP11‐815 M8.1), rs6541998 (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.37–1.74 near MERTK), rs10184573 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.26–1.61 near AC093590.1), and rs2499799 (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.54–0.73 near UFL1/FHL5), collectively explaining 7.2% of the variance of the phenotype. SNPs rs11579212, rs10184573 and rs976357, as proxy SNP for rs2499799 (r2 = 1.0), replicated in the Norwegian sample (p &lt; 0.05). Gene‐based mapping yielded ASZ1 as possible fifth locus. RNA‐sequencing indicated differential expression of POLR1B and TMEM87B in cluster headache.


Interpretation
This GWAS identified and replicated genetic risk loci for cluster headache with effect sizes larger than those typically seen in complex genetic disorders.

<p>The overconsumption of sugar-sweetened food and beverages underpins the current rise in obesity rates. Sugar overconsumption induces maladaptive neuroplasticity to decrease dietary control. Although serotonin and glutamate co-localisation has been implicated in reward processing, it is still unknown how chronic sucrose consumption changes this transmission in regions associated with executive control over feeding—such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. To address this, a total of 16 C57Bl6 mice received either 5% w/v sucrose or water as a control for 12 weeks using the Drinking-In-The-Dark paradigm (n = 8 mice per group). We then examined the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the immunological distribution of serotonin (5-HT), vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3) and 5-HT<sup>+</sup>/VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> co-localised axonal varicosities. Sucrose consumption over 12 weeks decreased the number of 5-HT<sup>–</sup>/VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> and 5-HT<sup>+</sup>/VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> varicosities within the PFC and DG. The number of 5-HT<sup>+</sup>/VGLUT3<sup>–</sup> varicosities remained unchanged within the PFC but decreased in the DG following sucrose consumption. Given that serotonin mediates DG neurogenesis through microglial migration, the number of microglia within the DG was also assessed in both experimental groups. Sucrose consumption decreased the number of DG microglia. Although the DG and PFC are associated with executive control over rewarding activities and emotional memory formation, we did not detect a subsequent change in DG neurogenesis or anxiety-like behaviour or depressive-like behaviour. Overall, these findings suggest that the chronic consumption of sugar alters serotonergic neuroplasticity within neural circuits responsible for feeding control. Although these alterations alone were not sufficient to induce changes in neurogenesis or behaviour, it is proposed that the sucrose consumption may predispose individuals to these cognitive deficits which ultimately promote further sugar intake.</p>

<p>The tweety genes encode gated chloride channels that are found in animals, plants, and even simple eukaryotes, signifying their deep evolutionary origin. In vertebrates, the tweety gene family is highly conserved and consists of three members—ttyh1, ttyh2, and ttyh3—that are important for the regulation of cell volume. While research has elucidated potential physiological functions of ttyh1 in neural stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and filopodia formation during neural development, the roles of ttyh2 and ttyh3 are less characterized, though their expression patterns during embryonic and fetal development suggest potential roles in the development of a wide range of tissues including a role in the immune system in response to pathogen-associated molecules. Additionally, members of the tweety gene family have been implicated in various pathologies including cancers, particularly pediatric brain tumors, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Here, we review the current state of research using information from published articles and open-source databases on the tweety gene family with regard to its structure, evolution, expression during development and adulthood, biochemical and cellular functions, and role in human disease. We also identify promising areas for further research to advance our understanding of this important, yet still understudied, family of genes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.695668">High-Resolution EEG Source Localization in Segmentation-Free Head Models Based on Finite-Difference Method and Matching Pursuit Algorithm</a></h4>

<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a method to monitor electrophysiological activity on the scalp, which represents the macroscopic activity of the brain. However, it is challenging to identify EEG source regions inside the brain based on data measured by a scalp-attached network of electrodes. The accuracy of EEG source localization significantly depends on the type of head modeling and inverse problem solver. In this study, we adopted different models with a resolution of 0.5 mm to account for thin tissues/fluids, such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and dura. In particular, a spatially dependent conductivity (segmentation-free) model created using deep learning was developed and used for more realist representation of electrical conductivity. We then adopted a multi-grid-based finite-difference method (FDM) for forward problem analysis and a sparse-based algorithm to solve the inverse problem. This enabled us to perform efficient source localization using high-resolution model with a reasonable computational cost. Results indicated that the abrupt spatial change in conductivity, inherent in conventional segmentation-based head models, may trigger source localization error accumulation. The accurate modeling of the CSF, whose conductivity is the highest in the head, was an important factor affecting localization accuracy. Moreover, computational experiments with different noise levels and electrode setups demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method with segmentation-free head model.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily develops in old age. In recent years, it has been reported that early diagnosis of AD and early intervention significantly delays disease progression. Hence, early diagnosis and intervention are emphasized. As a diagnostic index for AD patients, evaluating the complexity of the dependence of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal on the temporal scale of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is effective. Multiscale entropy analysis and multifractal analysis have been performed individually, and their usefulness as diagnostic indicators has been confirmed, but the complemental relationship between these analyses, which may enhance diagnostic accuracy, has not been investigated. We hypothesize that combining multiscale entropy and fractal analyses may add another dimension to understanding the alteration of EEG dynamics in AD. In this study, we performed both multiscale entropy and multifractal analyses on EEGs from AD patients and healthy subjects. We found that the classification accuracy was improved using both techniques. These findings suggest that the use of multiscale entropy analysis and multifractal analysis may lead to the development of AD diagnostic tools.</p>

<p>The objective of this study was to explore using ECoG spectrogram images for training reliable cross-patient electrographic seizure classifiers, and to characterize the classifiers’ test accuracy as a function of amount of training data. ECoG channels in ∼138,000 time-series ECoG records from 113 patients were converted to RGB spectrogram images. Using an unsupervised spectrogram image clustering technique, manual labeling of 138,000 ECoG records (each with up to 4 ECoG channels) was completed in 320 h, which is an estimated 5 times faster than manual labeling without ECoG clustering. For training supervised classifier models, five random folds of data were created; with each fold containing 72, 18, and 23 patients’ data for model training, validation and testing respectively. Five convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including two with residual connections, were trained. Cross-patient classification accuracies and F<sub>1</sub> scores improved with model complexity, with the shallowest 6-layer model (with ∼1.5 million trainable parameters) producing a class-balanced seizure/non-seizure classification accuracy of 87.9% on ECoG channels and the deepest ResNet50-based model (with ∼23.5 million trainable parameters) producing a classification accuracy of 95.7%. The trained ResNet50-based model additionally had 93.5% agreement in scores with an independent expert labeller. Visual inspection of gradient-based saliency maps confirmed that the models’ classifications were based on relevant portions of the spectrogram images. Further, by repeating training experiments with data from varying number of patients, it was found that ECoG spectrogram images from just 10 patients were sufficient to train ResNet50-based models with 88% cross-patient accuracy, while at least 30 patients’ data was required to produce cross-patient classification accuracies of &gt;90%.</p>

Introduction<p>Hippocampal volume is one of the main biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD). Over the years, advanced tools that performed automatic segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) T13D scans have been developed, such as FreeSurfer (FS) and ACM-Adaboost (AA). Hippocampal volume is considered abnormal when it is below the 5th percentile of the normative population. The aim of this study was to set norms, established from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) population, for hippocampal volume measured with FS v.6.0 and AA tools in the neuGRID platform (www.neugrid2.eu) and demonstrate their applicability for the Italian population.</p>Methods<p>Norms were set from a large group of 545 healthy controls belonging to ADNI. For each pipeline, subjects with segmentation errors were discarded, resulting in 532 valid segmentations for FS and 421 for AA (age range 56–90 years). The comparability of ADNI and the Italian Brain Normative Archive (IBNA), representative of the Italian general population, was assessed testing clinical variables, neuropsychological scores and normalized hippocampal volumes. Finally, percentiles were validated using the Italian Alzheimer’s disease Repository Without Borders (ARWiBo) as external independent data set to evaluate FS and AA generalizability.</p>Results<p>Hippocampal percentiles were checked with the chi-square goodness of fit test. P-values were not significant, showing that FS and AA algorithm distributions fitted the data well. Clinical, neuropsychological and volumetric features were similar in ADNI and IBNA (p &gt; 0.01). Hippocampal volumes measured with both FS and AA were associated with age (p &lt; 0.001). The 5th percentile thresholds, indicating left/right hippocampal atrophy were respectively: (i) below 3,223/3,456 mm<sup>3</sup> at 56 years and 2,506/2,415 mm<sup>3</sup> at 90 years for FS; (ii) below 4,583/4,873 mm<sup>3</sup> at 56 years and 3,831/3,870 mm<sup>3</sup> at 90 years for AA. The average volumes computed on 100 cognitively intact healthy controls (CN) selected from ARWiBo were close to the 50th percentiles, while those for 100 AD patients were close to the abnormal percentiles.</p>Discussion<p>Norms generated from ADNI through the automatic FS and AA segmentation tools may be used as normative references for Italian patients with suspected AD.</p>

<p>The input–output properties of spinal motoneurons and muscle fibers comprising motor units are highly non-linear. The goal of this study was to investigate the stimulation type (continuous versus discrete) and waveform (linear versus non-linear) controlling force production at the motor unit level under intraspinal microstimulation. We constructed a physiological model of the motor unit with computer software enabling virtual experiments on single motor units under a wide range of input conditions, including intracellular and synaptic stimulation of the motoneuron and variation in the muscle length under neuromodulatory inputs originating from the brainstem. Continuous current intensity and impulse current frequency waveforms were inversely estimated such that the motor unit could linearly develop and relax the muscle force within a broad range of contraction speeds and levels during isometric contraction at various muscle lengths. Under both continuous and discrete stimulation, the stimulation waveform non-linearity increased with increasing speed and level of force production and with decreasing muscle length. Only discrete stimulation could control force relaxation at all muscle lengths. In contrast, continuous stimulation could not control force relaxation at high contraction levels in shorter-than-optimal muscles due to persistent inward current saturation on the motoneuron dendrites. These results indicate that non-linear adjustment of the stimulation waveform is more effective in regard to varying the force profile and muscle length and that the discrete stimulation protocol is a more robust approach for designing stimulation patterns aimed at neural interfaces for precise movement control under pathological conditions.</p>

<p>Introduction: Various functional neuroimaging studies help to better understand the changes in brain activity during meditation. The purpose of this study was to investigate how brain energy metabolism changes during focused attention meditation (FAM) state, measured by phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>31</sup>P-MRS).</p><p>Methods:<sup>31</sup>P-MRS imaging was carried out in 27 participants after 7 weeks of FAM training. Metabolite ratios and the absolute values of metabolites were assessed after meditation training in two MRI measurements, by comparing effects in a FAM state with those in a distinct focused attention awake state during a backwards counting task.</p><p>Results: The results showed decreased phosphocreatine/ATP (PCr/ATP), PCr/ inorganic phosphate (Pi), and intracellular pH values in the entire brain, but especially in basal ganglia, frontal lobes, and occipital lobes, and increased Pi/ATP ratio, cerebral Mg, and Pi absolute values were found in the same areas during FAM compared to the control focused attention awake state.</p><p>Conclusions: Changes in the temporal areas and basal ganglia may be interpreted as a higher energetic state induced by meditation, whereas the frontal and occipital areas showed changes that may be related to a down-regulation in ATP turnover, energy state, and oxidative capacity.</p>

Objective<p>To investigate the association of pre-existing migraine in patients hospitalised and who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with the presence of post-coronavirus disease (COVID) symptoms.</p>Background<p>No study has investigated the role of migraine as a risk factor for development of post-COVID symptoms.</p>Methods<p>A case-control study including individuals hospitalised during the first wave of the pandemic (from February 20 to May 31, 2020) was conducted. Patients with confirmed previous diagnosis of migraine were considered cases. Two age- and sex-matched individuals without a history of headache per case were also recruited as controls. Hospitalisation/clinical data were collected from hospital medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview. A list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically evaluated, but participants were invited to freely report any symptom. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to assess anxiety/depressive symptoms and sleep quality. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were constructed.</p>Results<p>Overall, 57 patients with confirmed diagnosis of migraine and 144 non-migraine controls who had recovered from COVID-19 were assessed at 7.3 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. The number of post-COVID symptoms in the migraine group was significantly greater (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.29–2.25, P &lt; 0.001) than in the non-migraine group. Fatigue was significantly more prevalent (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.32–6.32, P = 0.008) in the migraine group. However, no between-groups difference in the prevalence of headache as a post-COVID symptom was detected.</p>Conclusion<p>Patients with a history of migraine who recovered from COVID-19 exhibited more long-term fatigue as post-COVID sequelae than those without migraine. Some of the pathophysiological changes associated with migraine could predispose to the occurrence of post-COVID symptoms.</p>

<p>Background: Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) can negatively impact quality of life and health. For clinicians and researchers seeking to improve outcomes for patients with dysphagia, understanding the neural control of swallowing is critical. The role of gray matter in swallowing control has been extensively documented, but knowledge is limited regarding the contributions of white matter. Our aim was to identify, evaluate, and summarize the populations, methods, and results of published articles describing the role of white matter in neural control of swallowing.</p><p>Methods: We completed a systematic review with a multi-engine search following PRISMA-P 2015 standards. Two authors screened articles and completed blind full-text review and quality assessments using an adapted U.S. National Institute of Health's Quality Assessment. The senior author resolved any disagreements. Qualitative synthesis of evidence was completed.</p><p>Results: The search yielded 105 non-duplicate articles, twenty-two of which met inclusion criteria. Twenty were rated as Good (5/22; 23%) or Fair (15/22; 68%) quality. Stroke was the most represented diagnosis (n = 20; 91%). All studies were observational, and half were retrospective cohort design. The majority of studies (13/22; 59%) quantified white matter damage with lesion-based methods, whereas 7/22 (32%) described intrinsic characteristics of white matter using methods like fractional anisotropy. Fifteen studies (68%) used instrumental methods for swallowing evaluations. White matter areas commonly implicated in swallowing control included the pyramidal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule, and corpus callosum. Additional noteworthy themes included: severity of white matter damage is related to dysphagia severity; bilateral white matter lesions appear particularly disruptive to swallowing; and white matter adaptation can facilitate dysphagia recovery. Gaps in the literature included limited sample size and populations, lack of in-depth evaluations, and issues with research design.</p><p>Conclusion: Although traditionally understudied, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that white matter is critical in the neural control of swallowing. The reviewed studies indicated that white matter damage can be directly tied to swallowing deficits, and several white matter structures were implicated across studies. Further well-designed interdisciplinary research is needed to understand white matter's role in neural control of normal swallowing and in dysphagia recovery and rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Humans have a natural ability to understand the emotions and feelings of others, whether one actually witnesses the situation of another, perceives it from a photograph, reads about it in a fiction book, or merely imagines it. This is the phenomenon of empathy, which requires us to mentally represent external information to experience the emotions of others. Studies have shown that individuals with high empathy have high anterior insula and adjacent frontal operculum activation when they are aware of negative emotions in others. As a negative emotion, disgust processing involves insula coupling. What are the neurophysiological characteristics for regulating the levels of empathy and disgust? To answer this question, we collected electroencephalogram microstates (EEG-ms) of 196 college students at rest and used the Disgust Scale and Interpersonal Reactivity Index. The results showed that: (1) there was a significant positive correlation between empathy and disgust sensitivity; (2) the empathy score and the intensity of transition possibility between EEG-ms C and D were significantly positively correlated; and (3) the connection strength between the transition possibility of EEG-ms C and D could adjust the relationship between the disgust sensitivity score and the empathy score. This study provides new neurophysiological characteristics for an understanding of the regulate relationship between empathy and disgust and provides a new perspective on emotion and attention.</p>

<p>Neuroligin is a postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule that is involved in synapse formation and maturation by interacting with presynaptic neurexin. Mutations in neuroligin genes, including the arginine to cystein substitution at the 451st amino acid residue (R451C) of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), have been identified in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging and examination of post-mortem brain in ASD patients implicate alteration of cerebellar morphology and Purkinje cell (PC) loss. In the present study, we examined possible association between the R451C mutation in NLGN3 and synaptic development and function in the mouse cerebellum. In NLGN3-R451C mutant mice, the expression of NLGN3 protein in the cerebellum was reduced to about 10% of the level of wild-type mice. Elimination of redundant climbing fiber (CF) to PC synapses was impaired from postnatal day 10–15 (P10–15) in NLGN3-R451C mutant mice, but majority of PCs became mono-innervated as in wild-type mice after P16. In NLGN3-R451C mutant mice, selective strengthening of a single CF relative to the other CFs in each PC was impaired from P16, which persisted into juvenile stage. Furthermore, the inhibition to excitation (I/E) balance of synaptic inputs to PCs was elevated, and calcium transients in the soma induced by strong and weak CF inputs were reduced in NLGN3-R451C mutant mice. These results suggest that a single point mutation in NLGN3 significantly influences the synapse development and refinement in cerebellar circuitry, which might be related to the pathogenesis of ASD.</p>

<p>Despite advancements in the radiotherapeutic management of brain malignancies, resultant sequelae include persistent cognitive dysfunction in the majority of survivors. Defining the precise causes of normal tissue toxicity has proven challenging, but the use of preclinical rodent models has suggested that reductions in neurogenesis and microvascular integrity, impaired synaptic plasticity, increased inflammation, and alterations in neuronal structure are contributory if not causal. As such, strategies to reverse these persistent radiotherapy-induced neurological disorders represent an unmet medical need. AM251, a cannabinoid receptor 1 reverse agonist known to facilitate adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, may help to ameliorate radiation-induced CNS impairments. To test this hypothesis, three treatment paradigms were used to evaluate the efficacy of AM251 to ameliorate radiation-induced learning and memory deficits along with disruptions in mood at 4 and 12 weeks postirradiation. Results demonstrated that acute (four weekly injections) and chronic (16 weekly injections) AM251 treatments (1 mg/kg) effectively alleviated cognitive and mood dysfunction in cranially irradiated mice. The beneficial effects of AM251 were exemplified by improved hippocampal- and cortical-dependent memory function on the novel object recognition and object in place tasks, while similar benefits on mood were shown by reductions in depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors on the forced swim test and elevated plus maze. The foregoing neurocognitive benefits were associated with significant increases in newly born (doublecortin+) neurons (1.7-fold), hippocampal neurogenesis (BrdU+/NeuN+mature neurons, 2.5-fold), and reduced expression of the inflammatory mediator HMGB (1.2-fold) in the hippocampus of irradiated mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that AM251 ameliorates the effects of clinically relevant cranial irradiation where overall neurological benefits in memory and mood coincided with increased hippocampal cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and reduced expression of proinflammatory markers.</p>

<p>Perforin-mediated cytotoxicity plays a crucial role in microbial defense, tumor surveillance, and primary autoimmune disorders. However, the contribution of the cytolytic protein perforin to ischemia-induced secondary tissue damage in the brain has not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the kinetics and subpopulations of perforin-positive cells and then evaluated the direct effects of perforin-mediated cytotoxicity on outcomes after ischemic stroke. Using flow cytometry, we showed that perforin<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells could be detected at 12 h and that the percentage of these cells increased largely until on day 3 and then significantly declined on day 7. Surprisingly, the percentage of Perforin<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> cells also unexpectedly increased from day 7 to day 14 after ischemic stroke in Perforin1-EGFP transgenic mice. Our results suggested that Perforin<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> cells play vital roles in the ischemic brain at early and late stages and further suggested that Perforin<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> cells are a heterogeneous population. Surprisingly, in addition to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells, central nervous system (CNS)-resident immune microglia, which are first triggered and activated within minutes after ischemic stroke in mice, also secreted perforin during ischemic brain injury. In our study, the percentage of perforin<sup>+</sup> microglia increased from 12 h after ischemic stroke, increased largely until on day 3 after ischemic stroke, and then moderately declined from days 3 to 7. Intriguingly, the percentage of perforin<sup>+</sup> microglia also dramatically increased from days 7 to 14 after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, compared with wild-type littermates, Perforin 1<sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibited significant increases in the cerebral infarct volume, neurological deficits, and neurogenesis and inhibition of neurotoxic astrogliosis. Interestingly, the number of CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells was significantly decreased in Perforin 1<sup>–/–</sup> mice compared with their wild-type littermates, especially the number of γδ T cells. In addition, Perforin 1<sup>–/–</sup> mice had lower levels of IL-17 than their wild-type littermates. Our results identified a critical function of perforin-mediated neurotoxicity in the ischemic brain, suggesting that targeting perforin-mediated neurotoxicity in brain-resident microglia and invading perforin<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells may be a potential strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke.</p>

<p>Retinal organoids (ROs), which are derived from stem cells, can automatically form three-dimensional laminar structures that include all cell types and the ultrastructure of the retina. Therefore, they are highly similar to the retinal structure in the human body. The development of organoids has been a great technological breakthrough in the fields of transplantation therapy and disease modeling. However, the translation of RO applications into medical practice still has various deficiencies at the current stage, including the long culture process, insufficient yield, and great heterogeneity among ROs produced under different conditions. Nevertheless, many technological breakthroughs have been made in transplanting ROs for treatment of diseases such as retinal degeneration. This review discusses recent advances in the development of ROs, improvements of the culture protocol, and the latest developments in RO replacement therapy techniques.</p>

Objective
X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X‐ALD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive demyelination ranging from mild myelopathic forms (adrenomyeloneuropathy [AMN]) to severe cerebral variants (adult cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy [ACALD]). The aim of this study was to compare cognitive function in adult‐onset X‐ALD phenotypes.


Methods
Cognitive function in various domains (intelligence, attention, memory, executive function, and processing speed) was assessed in 172 adults (117 with AMN, 30 with arrested ACALD, and 25 with acute ACALD) using comprehensive neuropsychological batteries. Phenotype differences were examined by analyses of variance.


Results
X‐ALD phenotypes significantly differed in nonverbal intelligence, sustained attention, verbal encoding, nonverbal recognition, and processing speed (ps &lt; 0.050). No group differences emerged regarding verbal intelligence, verbal retrieval and recognition, and executive function (ps &gt; 0.050). Specifically, patients with acute ACALD showed severe cognitive deficits compared to AMN and normal data, with largest effects on processing speed. Contrary, cognition was overall intact in patients with AMN, independent of sex and corticospinal tract involvement, and those with arrested ACALD showed mild cognitive dysfunction, particularly in verbal encoding and processing speed.


Interpretation
Cerebral demyelination in patients with X‐ALD causes white matter dementia, mainly characterized by an extreme slowdown in processing speed associated with deficits in attention and learning. Most patients with AMN show intact cognitive function. Future prospective, longitudinal studies with more sensitive imaging techniques are required to clarify whether early mild cognitive dysfunction found in some patients with AMN may be associated with subtle myelin abnormalities that do not yet appear as white matter lesions on cerebral MRI (cMRI) but have the potential to serve as early predictors of later cerebral progression.

Abstract
Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is an extraordinary form of plasticity fundamental for cognitive flexibility. Recent evidence showed that newborn neurons differentially modulate input to the infra‐ and supra‐pyramidal blades of the DG during the processing of spatial and contextual information, respectively. However, how this differential regulation by neurogenesis is translated into different aspects contributing cognitive flexibility is unclear. Here, we increased adult‐born neurons by a genetic expansion of neural stem cells and studied their influence during navigational learning. We found that increased neurogenesis improved both memory precision and flexibility. Interestingly, each of these gains was associated with distinct subregional patterns of activity and better separation of memory representations in the DG‐CA3 network. Our results highlight the role of adult‐born neurons in promoting memory precision and indexing and suggests their anatomical allocation within specific DG‐CA3 compartments, together contributing to cognitive flexibility.

In this study, we used source‐space EEG and graph theory to examine the association between network small worldness and cognitive test performance in focal epilepsy patients and healthy controls. Correlations were observed between the default mode network and memory in patients, the central‐executive network and executive functioning in controls, and the salience network and social cognition in both groups

Abstract
Understanding and diagnosing cognitive impairment in epilepsy remains a prominent challenge. New etiological models suggest that cognitive difficulties might not be directly linked to seizure activity, but are rather a manifestation of a broader brain pathology. Consequently, treating seizures is not sufficient to alleviate cognitive symptoms, highlighting the need for novel diagnostic tools. Here, we investigated whether the organization of three intrinsic, resting‐state functional connectivity networks was correlated with domain‐specific cognitive test performance. Using individualized EEG source reconstruction and graph theory, we examined the association between network small worldness and cognitive test performance in 23 patients with focal epilepsy and 17 healthy controls, who underwent a series of standardized pencil‐and‐paper and digital cognitive tests. We observed that the specific networks robustly correlated with test performance in distinct cognitive domains. Specifically, correlations were evident between the default mode network and memory in patients, the central‐executive network and executive functioning in controls, and the salience network and social cognition in both groups. Interestingly, the correlations were evident in both groups, but in different domains, suggesting an alteration in these functional neurocognitive networks in focal epilepsy. The present findings highlight the potential clinical relevance of functional brain network dysfunction in cognitive impairment.

A new model of Partial+Full uterine ischemia mimicking the transition from partial to total placental abruption in humans was developed in rabbits. Similar neurobehavioral deficits but worse cell viability ex vivo were found in the new Partial+Full uterine ischemia model compared to the previous Full uterine ischemia model.

Abstract
All placental abruptions begin as partial abruptions, which sometimes manifest as fetal bradycardia. The progression from partial to total abruption was mimicked by a new rabbit model of placental insufficiency, and we compared it, with sufficient statistical power, with the previous model mimicking total placental abruption. The previous model uses total uterine ischemia at E22 or E25 (70% or 79% term, respectively), in pregnant New Zealand white rabbits for 40 min (Full H‐I). The new model, Partial+Full H‐I, added a 30‐min partial ischemia before the 40‐min total ischemia. Fetuses were delivered either at E31.5 (full term) vaginally for neurobehavior testing, or by C‐section at E25 for ex vivo brain cell viability evaluation. The onset of fetal bradycardia was within the first 2 min of either H‐I protocol. There was no difference between Full H‐I (n = 442 for E22, 312 for E25) and Partial+Full H‐I (n = 154 and 80) groups in death or severely affected kits at E22 (76% vs. 79%) or at E25 (66% vs. 64%), or normal kits at E22 or E25, or any of the individual newborn neurobehavioral tests at any age. No sex differences were found. Partial+Full H‐I (n = 6) showed less cell viability than Full H‐I (n = 8) at 72‐hr ex vivo in the brain regions studied. Partial+Full H‐I insult produced similar cerebral palsy phenotype as our previous Full H‐I model in a sufficiently powered study and may be more suitable for testing of potential neuroprotectants.

Objective
Iron has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain injury and hydrocephalus after preterm germinal matrix hemorrhage‐intraventricular hemorrhage, however, it is unknown how external or endogenous intraventricular clearance of iron pathway proteins affect the outcome in this group.


Methods
This prospective multicenter cohort included patients with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) who underwent (1) temporary and permanent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion and (2) Bayley Scales of Infant Development‐III testing around 2 years of age. CSF proteins in the iron handling pathway were analyzed longitudinally and compared to ventricle size and neurodevelopmental outcomes.


Results
Thirty‐seven patients met inclusion criteria with a median estimated gestational age at birth of 25 weeks; 65% were boys. Ventricular CSF levels of hemoglobin, iron, total bilirubin, and ferritin decreased between temporary and permanent CSF diversion with no change in CSF levels of ceruloplasmin, transferrin, haptoglobin, and hepcidin. There was an increase in CSF hemopexin during this interval. Larger ventricle size at permanent CSF diversion was associated with elevated CSF ferritin (p = 0.015) and decreased CSF hemopexin (p = 0.007). CSF levels of proteins at temporary CSF diversion were not associated with outcome, however, higher CSF transferrin at permanent CSF diversion was associated with improved cognitive outcome (p = 0.015). Importantly, longitudinal change in CSF iron pathway proteins, ferritin (decrease), and transferrin (increase) were associated with improved cognitive (p = 0.04) and motor (p = 0.03) scores and improved cognitive (p = 0.04), language (p = 0.035), and motor (p = 0.008) scores, respectively.


Interpretation
Longitudinal changes in CSF transferrin (increase) and ferritin (decrease) are associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonatal PHH, with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of poor outcomes in PHH. ANN NEUROL 2021

Free-living bacteria adapt to environmental change by reprogramming gene expression through precise interactions of hundreds of DNA-binding proteins. A predictive understanding of bacterial physiology requires us to globally monitor all such protein–DNA interactions across a range of environmental and genetic perturbations. Here, we show that such global observations are possible using an optimized version of in vivo protein occupancy display technology (in vivo protein occupancy display—high resolution, IPOD-HR) and present a pilot application to <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We observe that the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> protein–DNA interactome organizes into 2 distinct prototypic features: (1) highly dynamic condition-dependent transcription factor (TF) occupancy; and (2) robust kilobase scale occupancy by nucleoid factors, forming silencing domains analogous to eukaryotic heterochromatin. We show that occupancy dynamics across a range of conditions can rapidly reveal the global transcriptional regulatory organization of a bacterium. Beyond discovery of previously hidden regulatory logic, we show that these observations can be utilized to computationally determine sequence specificity models for the majority of active TFs. Our study demonstrates that global observations of protein occupancy combined with statistical inference can rapidly and systematically reveal the transcriptional regulatory and structural features of a bacterial genome. This capacity is particularly crucial for non-model bacteria that are not amenable to routine genetic manipulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1yPs-rhAA7U" width="1" />

<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening type of stroke that disrupts the normal neurological function of the brain. Clinical studies have reported a non-linear J-shaped association between alcohol consumption levels and the occurrence of cerebral stroke. Specifically, alcohol intoxication increases stroke incidence, while moderate alcohol pre-conditioning decreases stroke frequency and improves outcomes. Although alcohol pre-consumption is likely a crucial player in ICH, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We performed 1-h alcohol pre-conditioning followed by ICH induction in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to investigate the role of alcohol pre-conditioning in ICH. Interestingly, behavioral test analysis found that ethanol intoxication (3 g/kg) aggravated ICH-induced neurological deficits, but moderate ethanol pre-conditioning (0.75 g/kg) ameliorated ICH-induced neurological deficits by reducing the oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines release. Moreover, we found that moderate ethanol pretreatment improved the striatal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis by increasing the chaperone protein expression and reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis caused by ICH. Our findings show that the mechanism regulated by moderate ethanol pre-conditioning might be beneficial for ICH, indicating the importance of ER homeostasis, oxidative stress, and differential cytokines release in ICH.</p>

<p>Microtubule-associated protein tau forms insoluble neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which is one of the major histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Many studies have demonstrated that tau causes early functional deficits prior to the formation of neurofibrillary aggregates. The redistribution of tau from axons to the somatodendritic compartment of neurons and dendritic spines causes synaptic impairment, and then leads to the loss of synaptic contacts that correlates better with cognitive deficits than amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates do in AD patients. In this review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms by which tau is mislocalized to dendritic spines and contributes to synaptic dysfunction in AD. We also discuss the synergistic effects of tau and oligomeric forms of Aβ on promoting synaptic dysfunction in AD.</p>

Background<p>T<sub>2</sub>-weighted (T<sub>2</sub>w) intracranial vessel wall imaging (IVWI) provides good contrast to differentiate intracranial vasculopathies and discriminate various important plaque components. However, the strong cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal in T<sub>2</sub>w images interferes with depicting the intracranial vessel wall. In this study, we propose a T<sub>2</sub>-prepared sequence for whole-brain IVWI at 3T with CSF suppression.</p>Methods<p>A preparation module that combines T<sub>2</sub> preparation and inversion recovery (T<sub>2</sub>IR) was used to suppress the CSF signal and was incorporated into the commercial three-dimensional (3D) turbo spin echo sequence-Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrast using different flip angle Evolution (SPACE). This new technique (hereafter called T<sub>2</sub>IR-SPACE) was evaluated on nine healthy volunteers and compared with two other commonly used 3D T<sub>2</sub>-weighted sequences: T<sub>2</sub>w-SPACE and FLAIR-SPACE (FLAIR: fluid-attenuated inversion recovery). The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the vessel wall (VW) and CSF and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) between them were measured and compared among these three T<sub>2</sub>-weighted sequences. Subjective wall visualization of the three T<sub>2</sub>-weighted sequences was scored blindly and independently by two radiologists using a four-point scale followed by inter-rater reproducibility analysis. A pilot study of four stroke patients was performed to preliminarily evaluate the diagnostic value of this new sequence, which was compared with two conventional T<sub>2</sub>-weighted sequences.</p>Results<p>T<sub>2</sub>IR-SPACE had the highest CNR (11.01 ± 6.75) compared with FLAIR-SPACE (4.49 ± 3.15; p &lt; 0.001) and T<sub>2</sub>w-SPACE (−56.16 ± 18.58; p &lt; 0.001). The subjective wall visualization score of T<sub>2</sub>IR-SPACE was higher than those of FLAIR-SPACE and T<sub>2</sub>w-SPACE (T<sub>2</sub>IR-SPACE: 2.35 ± 0.59; FLAIR-SPACE: 0.52 ± 0.54; T<sub>2</sub>w-SPACE: 1.67 ± 0.58); the two radiologists’ scores showed excellent agreement (ICC = 0.883).</p>Conclusion<p>The T<sub>2</sub>IR preparation module markedly suppressed the CSF signal without much SNR loss of the other tissues (i.e., vessel wall, white matter, and gray matter) compared with the IR pulse. Our results suggest that T<sub>2</sub>IR-SPACE is a potential alternative T<sub>2</sub>-weighted sequence for assessing intracranial vascular diseases.</p>

<p>Motivated by the challenge of investigating the reproducibility of spiking neural network simulations, we have developed the Arpra library: an open source C library for arbitrary precision range analysis based on the mixed Interval Arithmetic (IA)/Affine Arithmetic (AA) method. Arpra builds on this method by implementing a novel mixed trimmed IA/AA, in which the error terms of AA ranges are minimised using information from IA ranges. Overhead rounding error is minimised by computing intermediate values as extended precision variables using the MPFR library. This optimisation is most useful in cases where the ratio of overhead error to range width is high. Three novel affine term reduction strategies improve memory efficiency by merging affine terms of lesser significance. We also investigate the viability of using mixed trimmed IA/AA and other AA methods for studying reproducibility in unstable spiking neural network simulations.</p>

Objective<p>Stimulus-selective response modulation (SRM) of sensory evoked potentials represents a well-established non-invasive index of long-term potentiation-like (LTP-like) synaptic plasticity in the human sensory cortices. Although our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stimulus-SRM has increased over the past two decades, it remains unclear how this form of LTP-like synaptic plasticity is related to other basic learning mechanisms, such as perceptual learning. The aim of the current study was twofold; firstly, we aimed to corroborate former stimulus-SRM studies, demonstrating modulation of visual evoked potential (VEP) components following high-frequency visual stimulation. Secondly, we aimed to investigate the association between the magnitudes of LTP-like plasticity and visual perceptual learning (VPL).</p>Methods<p>42 healthy adults participated in the study. EEG data was recorded during a standard high-frequency stimulus-SRM paradigm. Amplitude values were measured from the peaks of visual components C1, P1, and N1. Embedded in the same experimental session, the VPL task required the participants to discriminate between a masked checkerboard pattern and a visual “noise” stimulus before, during and after the stimulus-SRM probes.</p>Results<p>We demonstrated significant amplitude modulations of VEPs components C1 and N1 from baseline to both post-stimulation probes. In the VPL task, we observed a significant change in the average threshold levels from the first to the second round. No significant association between the magnitudes of LTP-like plasticity and performance on the VPL task was evident.</p>Conclusion<p>To the extent of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the relationship between the visual stimulus-RM phenomenon and VPL in humans. In accordance with previous studies, we demonstrated robust amplitude modulations of the C1 and N1 components of the VEP waveform. However, we did not observe any significant correlations between modulation magnitude of VEP components and VPL task performance, suggesting that these phenomena rely on separate learning mechanisms implemented by different neural mechanisms.</p>

<p>Current evidence strongly suggests that the arcuate fasciculus (AF) is critical for language, from spontaneous speech and word retrieval to repetition and comprehension abilities. However, to further pinpoint its unique and differential role in language, its anatomy needs to be explored in greater detail and its contribution to language processing beyond that of known cortical language areas must be established. We address this in a comprehensive evaluation of the specific functional role of the AF in a well-characterized cohort of individuals with chronic aphasia (n = 33) following left hemisphere stroke. To evaluate macro- and microstructural integrity of the AF, tractography based on the constrained spherical deconvolution model was performed. The AF in the left and right hemispheres were then manually reconstructed using a modified 3-segment model (Catani et al., 2005), and a modified 2-segment model (Glasser and Rilling, 2008). The normalized volume and a measure of microstructural integrity of the long and the posterior segments of the AF were significantly correlated with language indices while controlling for gender and lesion volume. Specific contributions of AF segments to language while accounting for the role of specific cortical language areas – inferior frontal, inferior parietal, and posterior temporal – were tested using multiple regression analyses. Involvement of the following tract segments in the left hemisphere in language processing beyond the contribution of cortical areas was demonstrated: the long segment of the AF contributed to naming abilities; anterior segment – to fluency and naming; the posterior segment – to comprehension. The results highlight the important contributions of the AF fiber pathways to language impairments beyond that of known cortical language areas. At the same time, no clear role of the right hemisphere AF tracts in language processing could be ascertained. In sum, our findings lend support to the broader role of the left AF in language processing, with particular emphasis on comprehension and naming, and point to the posterior segment of this tract as being most crucial for supporting residual language abilities.</p>

<p>Introduction: Neuromodulation is an important group of therapeutic modalities for neuropsychiatric disorders. Prior studies have focused on efficacy and adverse events associated with neuromodulation. Less is known regarding the influence of neuromodulation treatments on suicidality. This systematic review sought to examine the effects of various neuromodulation techniques on suicidality.</p><p>Methods: A systematic review of the literature from 1940 to 2020 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline was conducted. Any reported suicide-related outcome, including suicidal ideation, suicide intent, suicide attempt, completed suicide in reports were considered as a putative measure of treatment effect on suicidality.</p><p>Results: The review identified 129 relevant studies. An exploratory analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of sertraline and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) for treating depression reported a decrease in suicidal ideation favoring tDCS vs. placebo and tDCS combined with sertraline vs. placebo. Several studies reported an association between repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and improvements in suicidal ideation. In 12 of the studies, suicidality was the primary outcome, ten of which showed a significant improvement in suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy was also shown to be associated with lower suicidal ideation and completed suicide rates. There were 11 studies which suicidality was the primary outcome and seven of these showed an improvement in suicidal ideation or suicide intent and fewer suicide attempts or completed suicides in patients treated with ECT. There was limited literature focused on the potential protective effect of vagal nerve stimulation with respect to suicidal ideation. Data were mixed regarding the potential effects of deep brain stimulation on suicidality.</p><p>Conclusions: Future prospective studies of neuromodulation that focus on the primary outcome of suicidality are urgently needed.</p><p>Systematic Review Registration:https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=125599, identifier: CRD42019125599.</p>

<p>Functional genomics studies through transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomics have become increasingly important tools to understand the molecular basis of biological systems in the last decade. In most cases, when these approaches are applied to the nervous system, they are centered in cell bodies or somatodendritic compartments, as these are easier to isolate and, at least in vitro, contain most of the mRNA and proteins present in all neuronal compartments. However, key functional processes and many neuronal disorders are initiated by changes occurring far away from cell bodies, particularly in axons (axopathologies) and synapses (synaptopathies). Both neuronal compartments contain specific RNAs and proteins, which are known to vary depending on their anatomical distribution, developmental stage and function, and thus form the complex network of molecular pathways required for neuron connectivity. Modifications in these components due to metabolic, environmental, and/or genetic issues could trigger or exacerbate a neuronal disease. For this reason, detailed profiling and functional understanding of the precise changes in these compartments may thus yield new insights into the still intractable molecular basis of most neuronal disorders. In the case of synaptic dysfunctions or synaptopathies, they contribute to dozens of diseases in the human brain including neurodevelopmental (i.e., autism, Down syndrome, and epilepsy) as well as neurodegenerative disorders (i.e., Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases). Histological, biochemical, cellular, and general molecular biology techniques have been key in understanding these pathologies. Now, the growing number of omics approaches can add significant extra information at a high and wide resolution level and, used effectively, can lead to novel and insightful interpretations of the biological processes at play. This review describes current approaches that use transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomic related methods to analyze the axon and presynaptic elements, focusing on the relationship that axon and synapses have with neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), knowledge about contribution of individual ion channels to axonal impairment and remyelination failure in progressive MS remains incomplete. Ion channel families play a fundamental role in maintaining white matter (WM) integrity and in regulating WM activities in axons, interstitial neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Recently, transcriptomic studies have considerably increased insight into the gene expression changes that occur in diverse WM lesions and the gene expression fingerprint of specific WM cells associated with secondary progressive MS. Here, we review the ion channel genes encoding K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>−</sup> channels; ryanodine receptors; TRP channels; and others that are significantly and uniquely dysregulated in active, chronic active, inactive, remyelinating WM lesions, and normal-appearing WM of secondary progressive MS brain, based on recently published bulk and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets. We discuss the current state of knowledge about the corresponding ion channels and their implication in the MS brain or in experimental models of MS. This comprehensive review suggests that the intense upregulation of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel genes in WM lesions with ongoing tissue damage may reflect the imbalance of Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis that is observed in progressive MS brain, while the upregulation of a large number of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel genes may be linked to a protective response to limit neuronal excitability. In addition, the altered chloride homeostasis, revealed by the significant downregulation of voltage-gated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels in MS lesions, may contribute to an altered inhibitory neurotransmission and increased excitability.</p>

<p>Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is a serious illness of unknown etiology, characterized by debilitating exhaustion, memory impairment, pain and sleep abnormalities. Viral infections are believed to initiate the pathogenesis of this syndrome although the definite proof remains elusive. With the unfolding of COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in this condition has resurfaced as excessive tiredness, a major complaint of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, often lingers for a long time, resulting in disability, and poor life quality. In a previous article, we hypothesized that COVID-19-upregulated angiotensin II triggered premature endothelial cell senescence, disrupting the intestinal and blood brain barriers. Here, we hypothesize further that post-viral sequelae, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, are promoted by the gut microbes or toxin translocation from the gastrointestinal tract into other tissues, including the brain. This model is supported by the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host proteins and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Conversely, targeting microbial translocation and cellular senescence may ameliorate the symptoms of this disabling illness.</p>

<p>Synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly correlated with cognitive impairment. Accumulating evidence indicates that amyloid pathology leads to synaptic degeneration and mitochondrial damage in AD. However, it remains unclear whether synapses and presynaptic mitochondria are differentially affected in various cortical regions of the AD brain at the ultrastructural level. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we assessed synaptic structures in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary visual cortex (V1) of the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. At 6 months of age, 5xFAD mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of amyloid deposition in layer 2/3 of the mPFC but not V1. Accordingly, three-dimensional reconstruction of synaptic connectivity revealed a significant reduction in excitatory synaptic density in layer 2 of the mPFC, but not V1, of male transgenic mice. Notably, the density of synapses lacking presynaptic mitochondria was selectively decreased in the mPFC of 5xFAD mice, with no change in the density of mitochondria-containing synapses. Further classification of spines into shape categories confirmed a preferential loss of thin spines whose presynaptic boutons were largely devoid of mitochondria in the 5xFAD mPFC. Furthermore, the number of mitochondria per bouton in spared mitochondria-containing boutons was reduced in the mPFC, but not V1, of 5xFAD mice. Collectively, these results highlight region-specific vulnerability of cortical synapses to amyloid deposition and suggest that the presence of presynaptic mitochondria may affect synaptic degeneration in AD.</p>

<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) transduce signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to effector ion channels and enzymes G<sub>αo</sub>, a member of the pertussis toxin-sensitive G<sub>i/o</sub> family, is widely expressed in the brain, although its role within a neuronal context remains largely unknown. Using immunohistochemical and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy techniques, we have investigated the expression, cellular and subcellular localization of G<sub>αo</sub> in the cerebellar cortex. Histoblot revealed that G<sub>αo</sub> is expressed in many brain regions, including the cerebellum. At the cellular level, G<sub>αo</sub> protein was distributed in Purkinje cells, basket cells, stellate cells, granule cells and Golgi cells. At the subcellular level, pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy revealed mainly a postsynaptic localization of G<sub>αo</sub> along the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of Purkinje cell dendritic shafts and spines, and dendrites of basket, stellate and granule cells. To a lesser extent, immunolabeling for G<sub>αo</sub> was localized in different types of axon terminals establishing excitatory synapses. Moreover, post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy revealed the synaptic localization of G<sub>αo</sub> on PSDs of glutamatergic synapses between Purkinje cell spines and parallel fiber terminals and its co-localization with GABA<sub>B1</sub> in the same spines. Quantitative analysis of G<sub>αo</sub> immunoparticles revealed they preferentially localized on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the analysis revealed a high concentration of G<sub>αo</sub> around excitatory synapses on Purkinje cell dendritic spines, but a uniform distribution in granule cell dendrites. These molecular-anatomical findings suggest that G<sub>αo</sub> is a major signal transducer of specific GPCRs in different neuronal populations in the cerebellum.</p>

<p>High-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) imaging of the in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB), is a promising modality for investigating the dynamic morphological interplay underpinning BBB development. The successful establishment of BBB integrity is grounded in the brain endothelial cells (BEC’s) ability to occlude its paracellular spaces of brain capillaries through the expression of the intercellular tight junction (TJ) proteins. The impermeability of these paracellular spaces are crucial in the regulation of transcellular transport systems to achieve homeostasis of the central nervous system. To-date research describing morphologically, the dynamics by which TJ interaction is orchestrated to successfully construct a specialized barrier remains undescribed. In this study, the application of HREM illuminates the novel, dynamic and highly restrictive BEC paracellular pathway which is founded based on lateral membrane alignment which is the functional imperative for the mechanical juxtapositioning of TJ zones that underpin molecular bonding and sealing of the paracellular space. For the first time, we report on the secretion of a basement membrane in vitro, which allow BECs to orientate themselves into distinct basolateral and apicolateral domains and establish a 3-dimensional BEC construct. We report for the first time, on the expression of nanovesicles bound to the plasma membrane surfaces of the BECs. These membrane-bound vesicles are reported to possess an array of DNA/RNA constituents and chemotaxic properties affecting the formation of nanotubes that span the paracellular space between BECs, facilitating BBB construction, alluding to a functional role in mediating cell-to-cell communication. This study suggests that novel, ultrathin nanotubular (NT) structures are involved in functional roles in bringing into alignment the paracellular space of BECs. Immortalized mouse BECs (b.End3, b.End5) and primary rat cardiac microvascular ECs were used to further validate the in vitro BBB model by profiling variances in peripheral EC monolayer development. These cardiac capillary ECs presented with an opposite topographical profile: large fenestra and intercellular spaces, devoid of morphological ultrastructures. This comparative study alludes to the role of NT facilitation in TJ-induced hemifusion of apicolateral BEC membranes, as a structural event forming the basis for establishing a polarized BBB.</p>

<p>From the early days of life infants distinguish between social and non-social physical entities and have different expectations for the way these two entities should move and interact. At the same time, we know very little about the cortical systems that support this early emerging ability. The goal of the current research was to assess the extent to which infant’s processing of social and non-social physical entities is mediated by distinct information processing systems in the temporal cortex. Using a cross-sectional design, infants aged 6–9 months (Experiment 1) and 11–18 months (Experiment 2) were presented with two types of events: social interaction and mechanical interaction. In the social interaction event (patterned after Hamlin et al., 2007), an entity with googly eyes, hair tufts, and an implied goal of moving up the hill was either helped up, or pushed down, a hill through the actions of another social entity. In the mechanical interaction event, the googly eyes and hair tufts were replaced with vertical black dots and a hook and clasp, and the objects moved up or down the hill via mechanical interactions. FNIRS was used to measure activation from temporal cortex while infants viewed the test events. In both age groups, viewing social and mechanical interaction events elicited different patterns of activation in the right temporal cortex, although responses were more specialized in the older age group. Activation was not obtained in these areas when the objects moved in synchrony without interacting, suggesting that the causal nature of the interaction events may be responsible, in part, to the results obtained. This is one of the few fNIRS studies that has investigated age-related patterns of cortical activation and the first to provide insight into the functional development of networks specialized for processing of social and non-social physical entities engaged in interaction events.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) still depicts an incurable and devastating disease. Drug development efforts are mostly based on superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1)-G93A mice that present a very strong and early phenotype, allowing only a short time window for intervention. An alternative mouse model is available, that is based on the same founder line but has a reduced SOD1-G93A copy number, resulting in a weaker and delayed phenotype. To be able to use these SOD1-G93A/low mice for drug testing, we performed a characterization of ALS-typical pathologies. All analyses were performed compared to non-transgenic (ntg) littermates of the same sex and age. In vivo analysis of SOD1-G93A/low mice was performed by weekly body weight measurements, analysis of the survival rate, and measurement of the muscle strength of 24–30 weeks old female and male SOD1-G93A/low mice. Immunofluorescent labeling of SOD1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) protein was performed in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar ventral horn of the spinal cord of 24–30 weeks old male and female SOD1-G93A/low mice. The musculus gastrocnemius of male SOD1-G93A/low mice was labeled with fluorophore-conjugated α-bungarotoxin and antibodies against phosphorylated neurofilaments. Fluorescent labeling was detected and quantified by macro-based image analysis. Although SOD1 protein levels were highly increased in both sexes and all age groups, levels strongly peaked in 30 weeks old male SOD1-G93A/low mice. Astrocytosis and activated microglia in the spinal cord ventral horn and phosphorylated neurofilaments in the motor unit of the musculus gastrocnemius progressively increased, while muscle strength progressively decreased in male SOD1-G93A/low mice. In female SOD1-G93A/low mice, only activated microglia increased progressively, while muscle strength was constantly reduced starting at 26 weeks. These differences result in a shorter survival time of male SOD1-G93A/low mice of about 3 weeks compared to female animals. The results suggest that male SOD1-G93A/low mice present a stronger pathology and are, therefore, better suitable to evaluate the efficacy of new drugs against ALS as most pathological features are developing progressively paralleled by a survival time that allows treatment to start before symptom onset.</p>

<p>Semantic segmentation of mitochondria from electron microscopy (EM) images is an essential step to obtain reliable morphological statistics about mitochondria. However, automatically delineating plenty of mitochondria of varied shapes from complex backgrounds with sufficient accuracy is challenging. To address these challenges, we develop a hierarchical encoder-decoder network (HED-Net), which has a three-level nested U-shape architecture to capture rich contextual information. Given the irregular shape of mitochondria, we introduce a novel soft label-decomposition strategy to exploit shape knowledge in manual labels. Rather than simply using the ground truth label maps as the unique supervision in the model training, we introduce additional subcategory-aware supervision by softly decomposing each manual label map into two complementary label maps according to mitochondria's ovality. The three label maps are integrated with our HED-Net to supervise the model training. While the original label map guides the network to segment all the mitochondria of varied shapes, the auxiliary label maps guide the network to segment subcategories of mitochondria of circular shape and elliptic shape, respectively, which are much more manageable tasks. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks show that our HED-Net performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Non-invasive whole-brain scans aid the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorder diseases such as autism, dementia, and brain cancer. The assessable analysis for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is rationally challenging due to the limitations of publicly available datasets. For diagnostic or prognostic tools, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) exposed affirmation to the biomarkers in neuroimaging research because of fMRI pickup inherent connectivity between the brain and regions. There are profound studies in ASD with introducing machine learning or deep learning methods that have manifested advanced steps for ASD predictions based on fMRI data. However, utmost antecedent models have an inadequacy in their capacity to manipulate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To overcome these problems, we proposed an avant-garde DarkASDNet, which has the competence to extract features from a lower level to a higher level and bring out promising results. In this work, we considered 3D fMRI data to predict binary classification between ASD and typical control (TC). Firstly, we pre-processed the 3D fMRI data by adopting proper slice time correction and normalization. Then, we introduced a novel DarkASDNet which surpassed the benchmark accuracy for the classification of ASD. Our model's outcomes unveil that our proposed method established state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.70% to classify ASD vs. TC in ABIDE-I, NYU dataset. Finally, we contemplated our model by performing evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC score, and legitimize by distinguishing with recent literature descriptions to vindicate our outcomes. The proposed DarkASDNet architecture provides a novel benchmark approach for ASD classification using fMRI processed data.</p>
