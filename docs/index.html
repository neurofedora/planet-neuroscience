	<p>Recent evidence suggests a connection between hyperacusis and the motor system of the brain. For instance, our recent study reported that hyperacusis in participants with tinnitus and hearing loss is associated with smaller gray matter volumes in the supplementary motor area (SMA). Given that hearing loss can affect gray matter changes in tinnitus, this study aimed to determine if the changes reported in our previous findings of smaller SMA gray matter volumes in hyperacusis persist in the absence of hearing loss. Data for this study were gathered from four prior studies conducted between 2004 and 2019 at the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG). A total of 101 participants with tinnitus and either clinically normal hearing (normal hearing with tinnitus or NHT, n = 35) or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (hearing loss with tinnitus or HLT, n = 66) were included across four studies. Hyperacusis was determined by a score of &amp;amp;ge;22 on the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ). In the NHT group, 22 (63%) participants scored &amp;amp;ge;22 on the HQ (NHT with hyperacusis: mean age 44.1 years, 12 females), while in the HLT group, 25 (38%) participants scored &amp;amp;ge;22 on the HQ (HLT with hyperacusis: mean age 59.5 years, 10 females). The 2 &amp;amp;times; 2 between-group ANOVAs revealed that hyperacusis is associated with smaller SMA gray matter volumes, regardless of hearing levels. Notably, the smaller SMA gray matter volumes in hyperacusis were primarily influenced by the attentional subscales of the HQ. The association between hyperacusis and the motor system may indicate a constant alertness to sounds and a readiness for motor action.</p>

	<p>Background. The majority of deaths in patients with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses (SMIs) are caused by natural causes, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The increased risk of CVD and other somatic diseases in SMIs cannot be fully explained by the contribution of traditional risk factors, behavioral risk factors, patients&amp;amp;rsquo; lifestyle peculiarities, and the influence of antipsychotics. The present review has the following main objectives: (1) to aggregate evidence that neurodevelopmental disorders are the basis of SMIs; (2) to provide a review of studies that have addressed the shared genetic architecture of SMI and cardiovascular disease; and (3) to propose and substantiate the consideration of somatic diseases as independent endophenotypes of SMIs, which will make it possible to place the research of somatic diseases in SMIs within the framework of the concepts of the &amp;amp;ldquo;neurodevelopmental continuum and gradient&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;endophenotype&amp;amp;rdquo;. Methods. A comprehensive literature search was performed on 1 July 2024. The search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar databases up to June 2024. Results. The current literature reveals considerable overlap between the genetic susceptibility loci for SMIs and CVDs. We propose that somatic diseases observed in SMIs that have a shared genetic architecture with SMIs can be considered distinct physical health-related endophenotypes. Conclusions. In this narrative review, the results of recent studies of CVDs in SMIs are summarized. Reframing schizophrenia as a multisystem disease should contribute to the activation of new research on somatic diseases in SMIs.</p>

                <p>In human adults, multiple cortical regions respond robustly to faces, including the occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA), implicated in face perception, and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), implicated in higher-level social functions. When in development, does face selectivity arise in each of these regions? Here, we combined two awake infant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets to create a sample size twice the size of previous reports (<I>n</I> = 65 infants; 2.6&ndash;9.6&nbsp;months). Infants watched movies of faces, bodies, objects, and scenes, while fMRI data were collected. Despite variable amounts of data from each infant, individual subject whole-brain activation maps revealed responses to faces compared to nonface visual categories in the approximate location of OFA, FFA, STS, and MPFC. To determine the strength and nature of face selectivity in these regions, we used cross-validated functional region of interest analyses. Across this larger sample size, face responses in OFA, FFA, STS, and MPFC were significantly greater than responses to bodies, objects, and scenes. Even the youngest infants (2&ndash;5&nbsp;months) showed significantly face-selective responses in FFA, STS, and MPFC, but not OFA. These results demonstrate that face selectivity is present in multiple cortical regions within months of birth, providing powerful constraints on theories of cortical development.</p>

                <p>Quantifying and analyzing licking behavior can offer valuable insights into fundamental neurobiological mechanisms controlling animal consummatory behaviors. Lickometers are typically based on electrical properties, a strategy that comes with limitations, including susceptibility to electrical interference and generation of electrical disturbances in electrophysiological measurements. While optical lickometers offer an alternative method to measure licks and quantify fluid intake in animals, they are prone to false readings and susceptibility to outside light sources. To overcome this problem, we propose a low-cost open-source lickometer that combines a restricted infrared beam defined by optical fibers, with a poke design that allows easy access to the tongue while limiting access of other body parts and external light sources. This device also includes features for detecting nose pokes and presenting visual cues during behavioral tasks. We provide validation experiments that demonstrate the optical lickometer's reliability, high-sensitivity and precision, and its application in a behavioral task, showcasing the potential of this tool to study lick microstructure in combination with other techniques, such as imaging of neural activity, in freely moving mice.</p>

                Objective: To evaluate the scientific production on university social responsibility (USR) from institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was conducted on documents published in indexed journals in the Scopus database from its inception until April 2023. Eligible documents included those on USR describing experiences carried out by universities in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of articles per author, average authors per article, average citations per article, and the number of documents with one or more author were described. Bibliometric indicators regarding authors per article, co-authors per article, and institutional collaboration were presented. Bibliometric networks were constructed based on bibliographic coupling analysis of documents by countries and term co-occurrence in titles and abstracts. Results: Of a total of 4075 documents retrieved from Scopus, 150 were included. Documents published between 1997 and 2023 were identified, with an average annual growth rate of 2.7%. A total of 439 authors were identified, 18 articles had a single author, and an average of 0.3 articles per author and a co-authorship index of 3.13 were found. The percentage of international collaborations was 30.7%. Brazil had the highest proportion of publications (26.4%), followed by Chile (17%) and Colombia (13.2%). Opción and Revista de Ciencias Sociales were the journals with the highest number of articles published (13 each). In the analysis of term co-occurrence, recent years showed an increase in the use of terms related to e-learning, information and communication technologies, virtual education, COVID-19, sustainable development goals, and URSULA (initiative on USR in institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean). Conclusions: A growth in scientific production on USR in Latin America and the Caribbean was identified. The interest in USR documents in recent years has been focused on COVID-19 and the challenges of virtual education and sustainable development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-813/v1?src=rss">Exploring the landscape of digital servitization: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Digital servitization is a strategic transformation where companies adopt a service-focused approach in response to the prevailing trend of digitalization. Utilizing digital technology, businesses manage product and service operations and develop new value propositions. Further research into digital servitization is essential for maintaining competitiveness and meeting evolving market demands globally. This study aims to comprehend the evolution of digital services from theoretical and practical viewpoints and examines how these challenges are tackled. Methods Utilizing a systematic literature review methodology, the study adopts the PRISMA approach to identify 26 pertinent articles from a pool of 340 papers obtained through a SCOPUS database search. These papers were published between 2019 and 2024 and were retrieved using the keywords (‘digitalization OR digital AND servitization OR servitization’). The selection process involved scrutinizing titles, abstracts, and keywords based on predefined criteria. Results The findings reveal that current digital servitization research emphasizes five determinant variables: digitization, servitization, manufacturing servitization, process innovation, and product innovation. Additionally, response variables influenced by digital servitization were identified, including firm competitiveness, firm performance, financial performance, firm profitability, and sustainable performance. Discussion The results of this review point to inconsistencies, underscoring the necessity for additional research into the factors influencing digital servitization across companies beyond the manufacturing sector. This highlights the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of digital servitization strategies and their impacts across various industries. By expanding the scope of research to include a broader range of sectors, researchers can provide more comprehensive insights into the complexities and nuances of digital servitization adoption. This broader perspective enables a more thorough examination of the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing digital servitization strategies, ultimately contributing to a richer understanding of its implications for businesses across diverse industries.

                <p>by David A. Brewster, Martin A. Nowak, Josef Tkadlec</p>

Computing the rate of evolution in spatially structured populations is difficult. A key quantity is the fixation time of a single mutant with relative reproduction rate <i>r</i> which invades a population of residents. We say that the fixation time is “fast” if it is at most a polynomial function in terms of the population size <i>N</i>. Here we study fixation times of advantageous mutants (<i>r</i> > 1) and neutral mutants (<i>r</i> = 1) on <i>directed</i> graphs, which are those graphs that have at least some one-way connections. We obtain three main results. First, we prove that for any directed graph the fixation time is fast, provided that <i>r</i> is sufficiently large. Second, we construct an efficient algorithm that gives an upper bound for the fixation time for any graph and any <i>r</i> ≥ 1. Third, we identify a broad class of directed graphs with fast fixation times for any <i>r</i> ≥ 1. This class includes previously studied amplifiers of selection, such as Superstars and Metafunnels. We also show that on some graphs the fixation time is not a monotonically declining function of <i>r</i>; in particular, neutral fixation can occur faster than fixation for small selective advantages.

                <p>by Botond B. Antal, Anthony G. Chesebro, Helmut H. Strey, Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, Corey Weistuch</p>

All fields of science depend on mathematical models. <i>Occam’s razor</i> refers to the principle that good models should exclude parameters beyond those minimally required to describe the systems they represent. This is because redundancy can lead to incorrect estimates of model parameters from data, and thus inaccurate or ambiguous conclusions. Here, we show how deep learning can be powerfully leveraged to apply Occam’s razor to model parameters. Our method, FixFit, uses a feedforward deep neural network with a bottleneck layer to characterize and predict the behavior of a given model from its input parameters. FixFit has three major benefits. First, it provides a metric to quantify the original model’s degree of complexity. Second, it allows for the unique fitting of data. Third, it provides an unbiased way to discriminate between experimental hypotheses that add value versus those that do not. In three use cases, we demonstrate the broad applicability of this method across scientific domains. To validate the method using a known system, we apply FixFit to recover known composite parameters for the Kepler orbit model and a dynamic model of blood glucose regulation. In the latter, we demonstrate the ability to fit the latent parameters to real data. To illustrate how the method can be applied to less well-established fields, we use it to identify parameters for a multi-scale brain model and reduce the search space for viable candidate mechanisms.

                <p>by Nathan J. Doyle, Fergus Cumming, Robin N. Thompson, Michael J. Tildesley</p>

During an infectious disease outbreak, public health policy makers are tasked with strategically implementing interventions whilst balancing competing objectives. To provide a quantitative framework that can be used to guide these decisions, it is helpful to devise a clear and specific objective function that can be evaluated to determine the optimal outbreak response. In this study, we have developed a mathematical modelling framework representing outbreaks of a novel emerging pathogen for which non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are imposed or removed based on thresholds for hospital occupancy. These thresholds are set at different levels to define four unique strategies for disease control. We illustrate that the optimal intervention strategy is contingent on the choice of objective function. Specifically, the optimal strategy depends on the extent to which policy makers prioritise reducing health costs due to infection over the costs associated with maintaining interventions. Motivated by the scenario early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we incorporate the development of a vaccine into our modelling framework and demonstrate that a policy maker’s belief about when a vaccine will become available in future, and its eventual coverage (and/or effectiveness), affects the optimal strategy to adopt early in the outbreak. Furthermore, we show how uncertainty in these quantities can be accounted for when deciding which interventions to introduce. This research highlights the benefits of policy makers being explicit about the precise objectives of introducing interventions.

                <p>by Michal Staum, Ayelet-Chen Abraham, Reema Arbid, Varun Sanjay Birari, Matanel Dominitz, Ithai Rabinowitch</p>

Sensory neurons specialize in detecting and signaling the presence of diverse environmental stimuli. Neuronal injury or disease may undermine such signaling, diminishing the availability of crucial information. Can animals distinguish between a stimulus not being present and the inability to sense that stimulus in the first place? To address this question, we studied <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematode worms that lack gentle body touch sensation due to genetic mechanoreceptor dysfunction. We previously showed that worms can compensate for the loss of touch by enhancing their sense of smell, via an FLP-20 neuropeptide pathway. Here, we find that touch-deficient worms exhibit, in addition to sensory compensation, also cautious-like behavior, as if preemptively avoiding potential undetectable hazards. Intriguingly, these behavioral adjustments are abolished when the touch neurons are removed, suggesting that touch neurons are required for signaling the unavailability of touch information, in addition to their conventional role of signaling touch stimulation. Furthermore, we found that the ASE taste neurons, which similarly to the touch neurons, express the FLP-20 neuropeptide, exhibit altered FLP-20 expression levels in a touch-dependent manner, thus cooperating with the touch circuit. These results imply a novel form of neuronal signaling that enables <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> to distinguish between lack of touch stimulation and loss of touch sensation, producing adaptive behavioral adjustments that could overcome the inability to detect potential threats.

Long-read sequencing is driving rapid progress in genome assembly across all major groups of life, including species of the family Drosophilidae, a longtime model system for genetics, genomics, and evolution. We previously developed a cost-effective hybrid Oxford Nanopore (ONT) long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing approach and used it to assemble 101 drosophilid genomes from laboratory cultures, greatly increasing the number of genome assemblies for this taxonomic group. The next major challenge is to address the laboratory culture bias in taxon sampling by sequencing genomes of species that cannot easily be reared in the lab. Here, we build upon our previous methods to perform amplification-free ONT sequencing of single wild flies obtained either directly from the field or from ethanol-preserved specimens in museum collections, greatly improving the representation of lesser studied drosophilid taxa in whole-genome data. Using Illumina Novaseq X Plus and ONT P2 sequencers with R10.4.1 chemistry, we set a new benchmark for inexpensive hybrid genome assembly at US $150 per genome while assembling genomes from as little as 35 ng of genomic DNA from a single fly. We present 183 new genome assemblies for 179 species as a resource for drosophilid systematics, phylogenetics, and comparative genomics. Of these genomes, 62 are from pooled lab strains and 121 from single adult flies. Despite the sample limitations of working with small insects, most single-fly diploid assemblies are comparable in contiguity (>1 Mb contig N50), completeness (>98% complete dipteran BUSCOs), and accuracy (>QV40 genome-wide with ONT R10.4.1) to assemblies from inbred lines. We present a well-resolved multi-locus phylogeny for 360 drosophilid and 4 outgroup species encompassing all publicly available (as of August 2023) genomes for this group. Finally, we present a Progressive Cactus whole-genome, reference-free alignment built from a subset of 298 suitably high-quality drosophilid genomes. The new assemblies and alignment, along with updated laboratory protocols and computational pipelines, are released as an open resource and as a tool for studying evolution at the scale of an entire insect family.

                Background: Insomnia is difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep for at least three nights a week or more and lasting for at least 3 months. One of the molecules that play a role in the circadian rhythm of arousal system is hypocretin/orexin. Orexin activates the p38-MAPK signaling pathway and increases phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. Centella asiatica (CA) has a role in the signal work of the MAPK/ERK, Akt, and p38 path in many various diseases. Methods: The research method used is true laboratory experimental. The research approach used was randomized control group post-test only. Zebrafish embryos aged 0-7 dpf were used in this study. The treatment group consisted of 5 groups: normal, insomnia, insomnia + 2.5 μg/mL CA, insomnia + 5 μg/mL CA, and insomnia + 10 μg/mL CA. The locomotor motion of zebrafish larvae was observed using Basler cameras on days five-, six- and seven-day post fertilization (dpf), then analyzed by using Western Blot method. Results: The results proved that exposure to CA extract was able to reduce the expression of orexin (91963 ± 9129) and p38 (117425 ± 6398) as an arousal trigger in the sleep-wake cycle, with the most optimal concentration of CA 5 μg/mL. Exposure to CA extract was also able to reduce the expression of ERK (94795 ± 30830) and Akt (60113.5 ± 27833.5) with an optimum concentration of CA 2.5 μg/mL. Conclusion: Exposure to CA extract was able to improve the sleep activity of zebrafish larvae insomnia model by extending the total inactivity time (cumulative duration) and shortening the duration of first sleep (latency to first) in light and dark phases through inhibition of orexin, ERK, p38, and Akt.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1272/v2?src=rss">Comparative analysis of computed tomography severity indices in predicting the severity and clinical outcome in patients with acute pancreatitis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) has unpredictable severity. Its management is based on initial assessment of disease severity. It ranges from mild interstitial to severe necrotic form; the latter is associated with poor prognosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is the gold standard in early detection of pancreatic necrosis and in assessing the severity of AP. Two CT grading systems exist to assess the severity of AP: CT severity Index (CSI) and modified CSI (MCSI). This study compares the usefulness of these two systems in predicting the severity and clinical outcome in AP in comparison with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters. Methods: This is a prospective hospital-based screening study of 80 patients aged >12 years with clinical diagnosis of AP who underwent contrast-enhanced CT study of the abdomen. Comparative analysis between MCSI and CSI with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters was assessed by Chi-Squared test. Results: The accuracy of CSI and MCSI in predicting the requirement of critical care, superadded infection, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and requirement of intervention were 73.0%, 64.5%, 69.8% 60.9% and 77.2%, 76.0%, 74.4% & 56.6% respectively. Area under the curve for MCSI score was significantly higher (AUC: 0.861; 95% CI: 0.736-0.986) than CSI score (AUC:0.815;95% CI:0.749-0.941). MCSI and CSI showed significant correlation with Ranson’s criteria; however, MCSI correlation was better (r:0.53; p<0.01) than CSI (r:0.35;p:0.04). Conclusion: CSI and MCSI are better predictors of severity, clinical outcome and mortality compared with Ranson’s criteria, with MCSI being more accurate and better predictor than CSI. The accuracy of MCSI is better than CSI for prediction of requirement of critical care, development of superadded infection and development of MODS in AP. However, CSI and MCSI have low accuracy in predicting intervention in AP.

                Foreign bodies are objects that do not typically belong in the human body but can be ingested, inserted, or entered due to injuries. This article presents various cases and examples of foreign bodies, including objects swallowed, objects inserted into the rectum, vagina, urethra, ear, and nose, or due to injuries caused by falls, puncture wounds, and gunshot wounds. Foreign bodies can be difficult to detect, particularly if they are not inherently radio-opaque, and may be overlooked by patients who cannot provide an adequate history. These foreign bodies may cause harm to the patient. Interpretation is done on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), Ultrasonography (USG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Most foreign objects pass through the gastrointestinal tract without problem; sharp and elongated objects can cause significant injury, and even if they only partially perforate the bowel wall, they can produce chronic inflammatory processes that produce symptoms months or years later. Hence, searching for foreign bodies should be done throughout the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in children and people with mental illness who are more likely to swallow multiple items more than once. Although rare, various materials can be left behind in the body of a patient after surgery, including large and small wire sutures, surgical drains, and retained sponges, which can cause potential complications and foreign body reactions. This article highlights the importance of being aware of the presence of foreign bodies in clinical practice, and a thorough search should be carried out using different modalities, especially CT. Great suspicion and early diagnosis of foreign bodies can avoid potential complications and morbidity. In general, it provides information on the diagnosis and treatment of various types of foreign bodies.

                Stabilized soluble HIV-1 envelope trimers may be effective vaccine components. Zhang et al. design stabilized soluble trimers without covalent bonds between gp120 and gp41 such as the SOS bridge, a constraint that may alter structure and antigenicity. Given their native-like conformation and lack of CD4 binding, these trimers may have vaccine immunogen potential.

                We reliably judge locations of static objects when we walk despite the retinal images of these objects moving with every step we take. Here, we showed our brains solve this optical illusion by adopting an allocentric spatial reference frame. We measured perceived target location after the observer walked a short distance from the home base. Supporting the allocentric coding scheme, we found the intrinsic bias , which acts as a spatial reference frame for perceiving location of a dimly lit target in the dark, remained grounded at the home base rather than traveled along with the observer. The path-integration mechanism responsible for this can utilize both active and passive (vestibular) translational motion signals, but only along the horizontal direction. This asymmetric path-integration finding in human visual space perception is reminiscent of the asymmetric spatial memory finding in desert ants, pointing to nature’s wondrous and logically simple design for terrestrial creatures.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89611">Cortical plasticity is associated with blood–brain barrier modulation</a></h4>

              
                Brain microvessels possess the unique properties of a blood–brain barrier (BBB), tightly regulating the passage of molecules from the blood to the brain neuropil and vice versa. In models of brain injury, BBB dysfunction and the associated leakage of serum albumin to the neuropil have been shown to induce pathological plasticity, neuronal hyper-excitability, and seizures. The effect of neuronal activity on BBB function and whether it plays a role in plasticity in the healthy brain remain unclear. Here we show that neuronal activity induces modulation of microvascular permeability in the healthy brain and that it has a role in local network reorganization. Combining simultaneous electrophysiological recording and vascular imaging with transcriptomic analysis in rats, and functional and BBB-mapping MRI in human subjects, we show that prolonged stimulation of the limb induces a focal increase in BBB permeability in the corresponding somatosensory cortex that is associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. We further show that the increased microvascular permeability depends on neuronal activity and involves caveolae-mediated transcytosis and transforming growth factor β signaling. Our results reveal a role of BBB modulation in cortical plasticity in the healthy brain, highlighting the importance of neurovascular interactions for sensory experience and learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88173">A synergistic workspace for human consciousness revealed by Integrated Information Decomposition</a></h4>

              
                How is the information-processing architecture of the human brain organised, and how does its organisation support consciousness? Here, we combine network science and a rigorous information-theoretic notion of synergy to delineate a ‘synergistic global workspace’, comprising gateway regions that gather synergistic information from specialised modules across the human brain. This information is then integrated within the workspace and widely distributed via broadcaster regions. Through functional MRI analysis, we show that gateway regions of the synergistic workspace correspond to the human brain’s default mode network, whereas broadcasters coincide with the executive control network. We find that loss of consciousness due to general anaesthesia or disorders of consciousness corresponds to diminished ability of the synergistic workspace to integrate information, which is restored upon recovery. Thus, loss of consciousness coincides with a breakdown of information integration within the synergistic workspace of the human brain. This work contributes to conceptual and empirical reconciliation between two prominent scientific theories of consciousness, the Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory, while also advancing our understanding of how the human brain supports consciousness through the synergistic integration of information.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91421">Non-Hebbian plasticity transforms transient experiences into lasting memories</a></h4>

              
                The dominant models of learning and memory, such as Hebbian plasticity, propose that experiences are transformed into memories through input-specific synaptic plasticity at the time of learning. However, synaptic plasticity is neither strictly input-specific nor restricted to the time of its induction. The impact of such forms of non-Hebbian plasticity on memory has been difficult to test, and hence poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that synaptic manipulations can deviate from the Hebbian model of learning, yet produce a lasting memory. First, we established a weak associative conditioning protocol in mice, where optogenetic stimulation of sensory thalamic input to the amygdala was paired with a footshock, but no detectable memory was formed. However, when the same input was potentiated minutes before or after, or even 24 hr later, the associative experience was converted into a lasting memory. Importantly, potentiating an independent input to the amygdala minutes but not 24 hr after the pairing produced a lasting memory. Thus, our findings suggest that the process of transformation of a transient experience into a memory is neither restricted to the time of the experience nor to the synapses triggered by it; instead, it can be influenced by past and future events.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91766">Netrin signaling mediates survival of dormant epithelial ovarian cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Dormancy in cancer is a clinical state in which residual disease remains undetectable for a prolonged duration. At a cellular level, rare cancer cells cease proliferation and survive chemotherapy and disseminate disease. We created a suspension culture model of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) dormancy and devised a novel CRISPR screening approach to identify survival genes in this context. In combination with RNA-seq, we discovered the Netrin signaling pathway as critical to dormant HGSOC cell survival. We demonstrate that Netrin-1, –3, and its receptors are essential for low level ERK activation to promote survival, and that Netrin activation of ERK is unable to induce proliferation. Deletion of all UNC5 family receptors blocks Netrin signaling in HGSOC cells and compromises viability during the dormancy step of dissemination in xenograft assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 and –3 overexpression in HGSOC correlates with poor outcome. Specifically, our experiments reveal that Netrin overexpression elevates cell survival in dormant culture conditions and contributes to greater spread of disease in a xenograft model of abdominal dissemination. This study highlights Netrin signaling as a key mediator HGSOC cancer cell dormancy and metastasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90793">Selective consolidation of learning and memory via recall-gated plasticity</a></h4>

              
                In a variety of species and behavioral contexts, learning and memory formation recruits two neural systems, with initial plasticity in one system being consolidated into the other over time. Moreover, consolidation is known to be selective; that is, some experiences are more likely to be consolidated into long-term memory than others. Here, we propose and analyze a model that captures common computational principles underlying such phenomena. The key component of this model is a mechanism by which a long-term learning and memory system prioritizes the storage of synaptic changes that are consistent with prior updates to the short-term system. This mechanism, which we refer to as recall-gated consolidation, has the effect of shielding long-term memory from spurious synaptic changes, enabling it to focus on reliable signals in the environment. We describe neural circuit implementations of this model for different types of learning problems, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and autoassociative memory storage. These implementations involve synaptic plasticity rules modulated by factors such as prediction accuracy, decision confidence, or familiarity. We then develop an analytical theory of the learning and memory performance of the model, in comparison to alternatives relying only on synapse-local consolidation mechanisms. We find that recall-gated consolidation provides significant advantages, substantially amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio with which memories can be stored in noisy environments. We show that recall-gated consolidation gives rise to a number of phenomena that are present in behavioral learning paradigms, including spaced learning effects, task-dependent rates of consolidation, and differing neural representations in short- and long-term pathways.

">Pathogenic LRRK2 causes age-dependent and region-specific deficits in ciliation, innervation and viability of cholinergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic activating point mutations in the LRRK2 kinase cause autosomal-dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). In cultured cells, mutant LRRK2 causes a deficit in de novo cilia formation and also impairs ciliary stability. In brain, previous studies have shown that in PD patients due to the G2019S-LRRK2 mutation as well as in middle-aged G2019S-LRRK2 knockin mice, striatal cholinergic interneurons show a deficit in primary cilia. Here, we show that cilia loss in G2019S-LRRK2 knockin mice is not limited to cholinergic striatal interneurons but common to cholinergic neurons across distinct brain nuclei. The lack of cilia in cholinergic forebrain neurons is accompanied by the accumulation of LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab12 GTPase and correlates with the presence of dystrophic cholinergic axons. Those deficits are already evident in young adult mutant LRRK2 mice. In contrast, the age-dependent loss of cilia in brainstem cholinergic neurons correlates with an age-dependent loss of cholinergic innervation derived from this brain area. Strikingly, we find cholinergic cell loss in mutant LRRK2 mice that is age-dependent, cell type-specific and disease-relevant. The age-dependent loss of a subset of cholinergic neurons mimics that observed in sporadic PD patients, highlighting the possibility that these particular neurons may require functional cilia for long-term cell survival.

">Inter-individual variability in motor learning due to differences in effective learning rates between generalist and specialist memory stores</a></h4>

              
                Humans exhibit large interindividual differences in motor learning ability. However, most previous studies have examined properties common across populations, with less emphasis on interindividual differences. We hypothesized here, based on our previous experimental and computational motor adaptation studies, that individual differences in effective learning rates between a generalist memory module that assumes environmental continuity and specialist modules that are responsive to trial-by-trial environmental changes could explain both large population-wise and individual-wise differences in dual tasks adaptation under block and random schedules. Participants adapted to two opposing force fields, either sequentially with alternating training blocks or simultaneously with random sequences. As previously reported, in the block training schedule, all participants adapted to the force field presented in a block but showed large interference in the subsequent opposing force field blocks, such that adapting to the two force fields was impossible. In contrast, in the random training schedule, participants could adapt to the two conflicting tasks simultaneously as a group; however, large interindividual variability was observed. A modified MOSAIC computational model of motor learning equipped with one generalist module and two specialist modules explained the observed behavior and variability for wide parameter ranges: when the predictions errors were large and consistent as in block schedules, the generalist module was selected to adapt quickly. In contrast, the specialist modules were selected when they more accurately predicted the changing environment than the generalist, as during random schedules; this resulted in consolidated memory specialized to each environment, but only when the ratio of learning rates of the generalist to specialists was relatively small. This dynamic selection process plays a crucial role in explaining the individual differences observed in motor learning abilities.

                Alternative splicing (AS) plays important roles in neuronal development, function, and diseases. Efforts to analyze AS transcriptome-wide in neurons remain limited. We characterized the transcriptome-wide AS changes in SH-SY5Y neuronal differentiation model, which is widely used to study neuronal function and disorders. Our analysis revealed global changes in five AS programs that drive neuronal differentiation. Motif analysis revealed the contribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) to the regulation of AS during neuronal development. We focused on the predominant AS program during differentiation, exon skipping (SE) events. Motif analysis revealed motifs for PTB and HuR/ELAVL1 to be the top enriched in SE events, and their protein levels were downregulated after differentiation. shRNA Knockdown of either PTB and HuR were associated with enhanced neuronal differentiation and transcriptome-wide exon skipping events driving the process of differentiation. At the level of gene expression, we observed only modest changes, indicating predominant post-transcriptional effects of PTB and HuR. We also observed that both RBPs altered cellular responses to oxidative stress, in line with the differentiated phenotype observed after KD. Our work characterizes the AS changes in a widely used and important model of neuronal development and neuroscience research and reveals intricate post-transcriptional regulation of neuronal differentiation.

                Although several studies, including our own (Hodgetts et al., 2015), have demonstrated that perceptual discrimination of complex scenes relies on an extended hippocampal network, distinct from the anterotemporal network supporting the perceptual discrimination of faces, we currently have limited insight into the specific functional and structural properties of these networks. Here, combining electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography, MEG) and microstructural (multi-shell diffusion MRI, dMRI) imaging in healthy human adults, we show that both hippocampal theta power modulation and fibre restriction of the fornix (a major input/output pathway of the hippocampus) independently related to accuracy during scene, but not face, perceptual discrimination. Conversely, inferior longitudinal fasciculus (a long-range occipito-anterotemporal tract) tissue properties correlated with face, but not scene, oddity discrimination accuracy. Our results provide new mechanistic insight into the neurocognitive systems underpinning complex scene and face perception, providing support for multiple-system representation-based accounts of the medial temporal lobe.

                GABAergic interneurons, including somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) positive cells, play a crucial role in cortical circuit processing. Cre recombinase-mediated manipulation of these interneurons is facilitated by commercially available knock-in mouse strains such as Sst-IRES-Cre (Sst-Cre) and Vip-IRES-Cre (Vip-Cre). However, these strains are troublesome for hearing research because they are only available on the C57BL/6 genetic background, which suffer from early onset age-related hearing loss (AHL) due to a mutation of the Cdh23 gene. To overcome this limitation, we backcrossed Sst-Cre and Vip-Cre mice to CBA mice to create normal-hearing offspring with the desired Cre transgenes. We confirmed that in these "CBA Cre" lines, Cre drives appropriate expression of Cre-dependent genes, by crossing CBA Cre mice to Ai14 reporter mice. To assess the hearing capabilities of the CBA Cre mice, we measured auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) using clicks and tones. CBA Cre mice showed significantly lower ABR thresholds compared to C57 control mice at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. In conclusion, our study successfully generated Sst-Cre and Vip-Cre mouse lines on the CBA background that will be valuable tools for investigating the roles of SST and VIP positive interneurons without the confounding effects of age-related hearing loss.

                Background: Classifying psychostimulant users as high and low responders based on median split of drug intake levels has face-validity: these appear to be different types of drug users. However, because psychostimulant intake levels a) are defined by an inverted U-shaped dose response (IUDR) curve, and b) do not necessarily imply motivation for the drug, it is unclear that median split-designated high and low drug responders represent different drug user types. Aims: To determine if median split-designated groups of high and low drug takers represent distinct groups when subjected to a new cluster-based model. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 11) self-administered cocaine doses (0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.56 and 1.00 mg/kg/infusion) to reveal the IUDR curve per individual. We derived six variables defining the structure of the IUDR curve (amplitude, mean, width, and area under the curve: AUC) and the IUDR-derived economic demand curve (consumption at zero price or Q0 and the motivation for drug or ). We compared median split and clustering of all variables (cocaine dose, IUDR/demand curves) obtained. Results: Median split of individual cocaine doses and IUDR curve-derived variables identified high versus low responders, but these groups were inconsistent with regards to group composition. Clustering of all cocaine doses revealed one cluster. Clustering of IUDR curve-derived variables revealed one cluster. Global clustering of all cocaine doses and all IUDR curve-derived variables revealed only one cluster. Conclusions: High and low drug takers do not necessarily represent distinct drug user types.

Through a genetic modifier screen, we find that a mild attenuation of Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling specifically rescued the sleep and longevity phenotypes of inc mutants. Surprisingly, this mild PKA signaling reduction further boosted the excessive memory in inc mutants, coupled with further exaggerated mushroom body overgrowth phenotypes. We propose that an intrinsic hyperplasticity scenario genuine to inc mutants enhances cognitive functions. Elevating PKA signaling seems to serve as a checkpoint which allows to constrain the excessive memory and mushroom body overgrowth in these animals, albeit at the sacrifice of sleep and longevity. Our data offer a mechanistic explanation for the sleep deficits of inc mutants, which challenges traditional views on the relation between sleep and memory, and suggest that behavioral hyperplasticity, e.g., prominent in autistic patients, can provoke sleep deficits.

">A third kind of episodic memory: Context familiarity is a distinct process from item familiarity and recollection</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memory is accounted for with two processes: familiarity when generally recognizing an item and recollection when retrieving the full contextual details bound with the item. Paradoxically, people sometimes report contextual information as familiar but without recollecting details, which is not easily accounted for by existing theories. We tested a combination of item recognition confidence and source memory, focusing upon item-only hits with source unknown (item familiarity), low-confidence hits with correct source memory (context familiarity), and high-confidence hits with correct source memory (recollection). Results across multiple within-subjects (trial-wise) and between subjects (individual variability) levels indicated these were behaviorally and physiologically distinct. Behaviorally, a crossover interaction was evident in response times, with context familiarity being slower than each condition during item recognition, but faster during source memory. Electrophysiologically, a Condition x Time x Location triple dissociation was evident in event-related potentials (ERPs), which was then independently replicated among different multiple datasets. Context familiarity exhibited an independent negative central effect from 800-1200 ms, differentiated from positive ERPs for item-familiarity (400 to 600 ms) and recollection (600 to 900 ms). These three conditions thus reflect mutually exclusive, fundamentally different processes of episodic memory. Context familiarity is a third distinct process of episodic memory.

">State dependent motor cortex stimulation reveals distinct mechanisms for corticospinal excitability and cortical responses</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method which can modulate brain activity by inducing electric fields in the brain. It is a popular tool to study causal brain-behavior relationships. However, brain states vary over time and affect the response of TMS. Neural oscillations can track the current brain state and are a promising marker to guide stimulation timing. Real-time, state-dependent brain stimulation has shown that neural oscillation phase modulates corticospinal excitability reflecting the connection from the primary motor cortex to a target muscle. However, such motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) only indirectly reflect motor cortex activation and are unavailable at other brain regions of interest. The direct and secondary cortical effects of phase-dependent brain stimulation remain an open question. In this study, we recorded the cortical responses during single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using electroencephalography (EEG) concurrently with the MEP measurements. TMS was delivered at peak, rising, trough, and falling phases of mu (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) oscillations in the motor cortex. The cortical responses were quantified through TMS-evoked potential components N15, P50, and N100 as peak-to-peak amplitudes (P50-N15 and P50-N100). We further analyzed whether the pre-stimulus frequency band power was predictive of the motor cortical responses. We found a significant main effect of neural oscillation phase on early evoked component (P50-N15). Furthermore, we found an interaction effect of oscillation phase and frequency on both early and late (P50-N100) components. Next, we compared the direct EEG response to the corticospinal excitability reflected by MEP amplitude. Interestingly, the preferred phase of the mu rhythm showed a 900 phase shift between the early TEP components and MEPs. The late component showed the same phase preference between EEG and MEPs. However, such a well-defined relationship did not exist for either of the components during beta phase specific stimulation. In addition, pre-TMS mu oscillatory power and phase significantly predicted both early and late cortical EEG responses when mu rhythm was targeted, indicating the independent causal effects of phase and power. However, only pre-TMS beta power significantly predicted the early and late TEP components when beta rhythm was targeted. Further analysis indicated that both pre-TMS mu and beta power jointly affect early cortical responses. In contrast, the late cortical responses were only influenced by pre-TMS mu power. These findings provide insight to mechanistic understanding of neural oscillation states in cortical and corticospinal activation in humans.

">Visual field asymmetries in responses to ON and OFF pathway biasing stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Recent reports suggest the ON and OFF pathways are differentially susceptible to selective vision loss in glaucoma. Thus, perimetric assessment of ON- and OFF-pathway function may serve as a useful diagnostic. However, this necessitates a developed understanding of normal ON/OFF pathway function around the visual field and as a function of input intensity. Here, using electroencephalography, we measured ON- and OFF-pathway biased contrast response functions in the upper and lower visual fields. Using the steady-state visually evoked potential paradigm, we flickered achromatic luminance probes according to a saw-tooth waveform, the fast-phase of which biased responses towards the ON or OFF pathways. Neural responses from the upper and lower visual fields were simultaneously measured using frequency tagging - probes in the upper visual field modulated at 3.75Hz, while those in the lower visual field modulated at 3Hz. We find that responses to OFF/decrements are larger than ON/increments, especially in the lower visual field. In the lower visual field, both ON and OFF responses were well described by a sigmoidal non-linearity. In the upper visual field, the ON pathway function was very similar to that of the lower, but the OFF pathway function showed reduced saturation and more cross-subject variability. Overall, this demonstrates that the relationship between the ON and OFF pathways depends on the visual field location and contrast level, potentially reflective of natural scene statistics.

">Automatic dendritic spine segmentation in widefield fluorescence images reveal synaptic nanostructures distribution with super-resolution imaging</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spines are the main sites for synaptic communication in neurons, and alterations in their density, size, and shapes occur in many brain disorders. Current spine segmentation methods perform poorly in conditions with low signal-to-noise and resolution, particularly in the widefield images of thick (over 10 m) brain slices. Here, we combined two open-source machine-learning models to achieve automatic 3D spine segmentation in widefield diffraction-limited fluorescence images of neurons in thick brain slices. We validated the performance by comparison with manually segmented super-resolution images of spines reconstructed from direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Lastly, we show an application of our approach by combining spine segmentation from diffraction-limited images with dSTORM of synaptic protein PSD-95 in the same field-of-view. This allowed us to automatically analyze and quantify the nanoscale distribution of PSD-95 inside the spine. Importantly, we found the numbers, but not the average sizes, of synaptic nanomodules and nanodomains increase with spine size.

">Resistance to age-related hearing loss in the echolocating big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus)</a></h4>

              
                Hearing mediates many behaviors critical for survival in echolocating bats, including foraging and navigation. Most mammals are susceptible to progressive age-related hearing loss; however, the evolution of biosonar, which requires the ability to hear low-intensity echoes from outgoing sonar signals, may have selected against the development of hearing deficits in echolocating bats. Although many echolocating bats exhibit exceptional longevity and rely on acoustic behaviors for survival to old age, relatively little is known about the aging bat auditory system. In this study, we used DNA methylation to estimate the ages of wild-caught big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and measured hearing sensitivity in young and aging bats using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). We found no evidence for hearing deficits in aging bats, demonstrated by comparable thresholds and similar ABR wave and DPOAE amplitudes across age groups. We additionally found no significant histological evidence for cochlear aging, with similar hair cell counts, afferent, and efferent innervation patterns in young and aging bats. Here we demonstrate that big brown bats show minimal evidence for age-related loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity and therefore represent informative models for investigating mechanisms that may preserve hearing function over a long lifetime.

">SV2A is expressed in synapse subpopulations in mouse and human brain: implications for PET radiotracer studies</a></h4>

              
                Synapse pathology is a feature of most brain diseases and there is a pressing need to monitor the onset and progression of this pathology using brain imaging in living patients. A major step toward this goal has been the development of small-molecule radiotracers that bind to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) for use in positron emission tomography (PET). Changes in SV2A radiotracer binding in PET are widely interpreted to report differences in the density of all synapses throughout brain regions. Here, we analyse the expression of SV2A at single-synapse resolution across regions of adult mouse and human brain. We find that SV2A is expressed in fewer than 50% of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and that the density of SV2A-positive synapses differs between brain regions. Furthermore, individual synapses differ in their amounts of SV2A. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of PET imaging studies in a clinical setting and point to the need for a detailed understanding of SV2A synaptome architecture in both healthy brain and disease cases where PET imaging is being applied.

">The Neurobiology of Cognitive Fatigue and Its Influence on Effort-Based Choice</a></h4>

              
                Feelings of cognitive fatigue emerge through repeated mental exertion and are ubiquitous in our daily lives. However, there is a limited understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the influence of cognitive fatigue on decisions to exert. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activity while participants make choices to exert effort for reward, before and after bouts of fatiguing cognitive exertion. We found that when participants became cognitively fatigued, they were more likely to choose to forgo higher levels of reward that required more effort. We describe a mechanism by which signals related to cognitive exertion in dlPFC influence effort value computations, instantiated by the insula, thereby influencing an individual's decisions to exert while fatigued. Our results suggest that cognitive fatigue plays a critical role in decisions to exert effort and provides a mechanistic link through which information about cognitive state shapes effort-based choice.

">Prefrontal metabolite alterations in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder: a 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Evidence from animal and human studies suggests glutamatergic dysfunction in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this study was to investigate glutamate abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) of individuals with PTSD using 7T MRS, which has better spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio than lower field strengths, thus allowing for better spectral quality and higher sensitivity. We hypothesized that individuals with PTSD would have lower glutamate levels compared to trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD and individuals without trauma exposure. Additionally, we explored potential alterations in other neurometabolites and the relationship between glutamate and psychiatric symptoms. Methods: Individuals with PTSD (n=27), trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD (n=27), and individuals without trauma exposure (n=26) underwent 7T MRS to measure glutamate and other neurometabolites in the left DLPFC. The severities of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and dissociation symptoms were assessed. Results: We found that glutamate was lower in the PTSD and trauma-exposed groups compared to the group without trauma exposure. Furthermore, N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was lower and lactate was higher in the PTSD group compared to the group without trauma exposure. Glutamate was negatively correlated with depression symptom severity in the PTSD group. Glutamate was not correlated with PTSD symptom severity. Conclusion: In this first 7T MRS study of PTSD, we observed altered concentrations of glutamate, NAA, and lactate. Our findings provide evidence for multiple possible pathological processes in individuals with PTSD. High-field MRS offers insight into the neurometabolic alterations associated with PTSD and is a powerful tool to probe trauma- and stress-related neurotransmission and metabolism in vivo.

">Primary auditory thalamus relays directly to cortical layer 1 interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory interneurons within cortical layer 1 (L1-INs) integrate inputs from diverse brain regions to modulate sensory processing and plasticity, but the sensory inputs that recruit these interneurons have not been identified. Here we used monosynaptic retrograde tracing and whole-cell electrophysiology to characterize the thalamic inputs onto two major subpopulations of L1-INs in the mouse auditory cortex. We find that the vast majority of auditory thalamic inputs to these L1-INs unexpectedly arise from the ventral subdivision of the medial geniculate body (MGBv), the tonotopically-organized primary auditory thalamus. Moreover, these interneurons receive robust functional monosynaptic MGBv inputs that are comparable to those recorded in the L4 excitatory pyramidal neurons. Our findings identify a direct pathway from the primary auditory thalamus to the L1-INs, suggesting that these interneurons are uniquely positioned to integrate thalamic inputs conveying precise sensory information with top-down inputs carrying information about brain states and learned associations.

	<p>Background: The role of exercise programs during substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is considered particularly supportive in fostering positive psychological and behavioral changes. The treatment of SUD is a challenging and demanding process. Therefore, it is crucial to discover innovative methods to enhance and facilitate it. Integrating exercise into a virtual environment is an innovative approach for drug rehabilitation, offering multiple benefits to individuals undergoing treatment. The aim of this feasibility study was to explore the acute effects of cycling exercise in an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment on attentional control and self-efficacy expectations of individuals undergoing SUD treatment. Methods: A total of 20 individuals (mean age of 37.75 years) enrolled in a SUD treatment program participated in the study. They were instructed to complete a single session of cycling with a self-selected duration within the VR system. Results: Following the cycling session, pre-post measures indicated a statistically significant improvement in self-efficacy expectations and attentional control measured with the Stroop test. The results revealed that participants expressed high levels of intention for future use, interest/enjoyment, and positive attitudes toward the VR exercise system. Qualitative data indicated that participants found the VR exercise system enjoyable, expressed a strong intention to use it, and did not encounter technical difficulties or negative emotions. Conclusions: In conclusion, it seems that engaging in a brief period of self-selected exercise within a virtual environment can result in temporary activation of cognitive changes, heightened self-efficacy expectations, and a motivating approach to increasing physical activity participation among individuals with SUD, thus suggesting the feasibility of this approach.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent with a high subjective and socio-economic burden. Despite the effectiveness of classical treatment methods, 20&amp;amp;ndash;30% of patients stay treatment-resistant. Deep Brain Stimulation of the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle is emerging as a clinical treatment. The stimulation region (ventral tegmental area, VTA), supported by experimental data, points to the role of dopaminergic (DA) transmission in disease pathology. This work sets out to develop a workflow that will allow the performance of analyses on midbrain DA-ergic neurons and projections in subjects who have committed suicide. Human midbrains were retrieved during autopsy, formalin-fixed, and scanned in a Bruker MRI scanner (7T). Sections were sliced, stained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), digitized, and integrated into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain space together with a high-resolution fiber tract atlas. Subnuclei of the VTA region were identified. TH-positive neurons and fibers were semi-quantitatively evaluated. The study established a rigorous protocol allowing for parallel histological assessments and fiber tractographic analysis in a common space. Semi-quantitative readings are feasible and allow the detection of cell loss in VTA subnuclei. This work describes the intricate workflow and first results of an investigation of DA anatomy in VTA subnuclei in a growing naturalistic database.</p>

	<p>Neurodegenerative disease is a major global health problem with 150 million people predicted to have dementia by 2050. Genetic factors, environmental factors, demographics, and some diseases have been associated with dementia. In addition to associations between diseases such as hypertension and cerebrovascular disease and dementia, emerging findings associate some psychiatric disorders with incident dementia. Because of the high and increasing global prevalence of dementia and the high worldwide prevalence of psychiatric disorders, the primary objective of this narrative review was to evaluate published findings that evaluate the association between bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and other psychosis syndromes, and personality disorders and personality traits and incident dementia. Here, we highlight findings indicating possible associations between these psychiatric disorders and subsequent dementia and suggest that some psychiatric disorders may be risk factors for incident dementia. Further research, including more large longitudinal studies and additional meta-analyses, however, is needed to better characterize the associations between psychiatric disorders and incident dementia, to identify possible mechanisms for these putative associations, and to identify risk factors within psychiatric disorders that predispose some people with a psychiatric disorder but not others to subsequent dementia. Additional important questions concern how the treatment of psychiatric disorders might affect the risk of incident dementia.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum is a conserved structure of the vertebrate brain involved in the timing and calibration of movements. Its function is supported by the convergence of fibers from granule cells (GCs) and inferior olive neurons (IONs) onto Purkinje cells (PCs). Theories of cerebellar function postulate that IONs convey error signals to PCs that, paired with the contextual information provided by GCs, can instruct motor learning. Here, we use the larval zebrafish to investigate (1) how sensory representations of the same stimulus vary across GCs and IONs and (2) how PC activity reflects these two different input streams. We use population calcium imaging to measure ION and GC responses to flashes of diverse luminance and duration. First, we observe that GCs show tonic and graded responses, as opposed to IONs, whose activity peaks mostly at luminance transitions, consistently with the notion that GCs and IONs encode context and error information, respectively. Second, we show that GC activity is patterned over time: some neurons exhibit sustained responses for the entire duration of the stimulus, while in others activity ramps up with slow time constants. This activity could provide a substrate for time representation in the cerebellum. Together, our observations give support to the notion of an error signal coming from IONs and provide the first experimental evidence for a temporal patterning of GC activity over many seconds.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0043-24.2024?rss=1">Neural Filtering of Physiological Tremor Oscillations to Spinal Motor Neurons Mediates Short-Term Acquisition of a Skill Learning Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>The acquisition of a motor skill involves adaptations of spinal and supraspinal pathways to alpha motoneurons. In this study, we estimated the shared synaptic contributions of these pathways to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the short-term acquisition of a new force-matching task. High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was acquired from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI; 7 males and 6 females) and tibialis anterior (TA; 7 males and 4 females) during 15 trials of an isometric force-matching task. For two selected trials (pre- and post-skill acquisition), we decomposed the HDsEMG into motor unit spike trains, tracked motor units between trials, and calculated the mean discharge rate and the coefficient of variation of interspike interval (COV<SUB>ISI</SUB>). We also quantified the post/pre ratio of motor units&rsquo; coherence within delta, alpha, and beta bands. Force-matching improvements were accompanied by increased mean discharge rate and decreased COV<SUB>ISI</SUB> for both muscles. Moreover, the area under the curve within alpha band decreased by ~22% (TA) and ~13% (FDI), with no delta or beta bands changes. These reductions correlated significantly with increased coupling between force/neural drive and target oscillations. These results suggest that short-term force-matching skill acquisition is mediated by attenuation of physiological tremor oscillations in the shared synaptic inputs. Supported by simulations, a plausible mechanism for alpha band reductions may involve spinal interneuron phase-cancelling descending oscillations. Therefore, during skill learning, the central nervous system acts as a matched filter, adjusting synaptic weights of shared inputs to suppress neural components unrelated to the specific task.</p>

                <p>Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons, classified by their expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin, play crucial roles in the function and plasticity of the lateral habenular nucleus (LHb). This study aimed to deepen our understanding of the LHb by collecting information about the heterogeneity of LHb PV neurons in mice. To achieve this, we investigated the proportions of the transmitter machinery in LHb PV neurons, including GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmitter markers, using transcriptome analysis, mRNA in situ hybridization chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. LHb PV neurons comprise three subsets: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and double-positive for glutamatergic and GABAergic machinery. By comparing the percentages of the subsets, we found that the LHb was topographically organized anteroposteriorly; the GABAergic and glutamatergic PV neurons were preferentially distributed in the anterior and posterior LHb, respectively, uncovering the anteroposterior topography of the LHb. In addition, we confirmed the mediolateral topography of lateral GABAergic PV neurons. These findings suggest that PV neurons play distinct roles in different parts of the LHb along the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes, facilitating the topographic function of the LHb. It would be interesting to determine whether their topography is differentially involved in various cognitive and motivational processes associated with the LHb, particularly the involvement of posterior glutamatergic PV neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/29/e0020242024?rss=1">Distinct Action Signals by Subregions in the Nucleus Accumbens during STOP-Change Performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to contribute to motivated behavior by signaling the value of reward-predicting cues and the delivery of anticipated reward. The NAc is subdivided into core and shell, with each region containing different populations of neurons that increase or decrease firing to rewarding events. While there are numerous theories of functions pertaining to these subregions and cell types, most are in the context of reward processing, with fewer considering that the NAc might serve functions related to action selection more generally. We recorded from single neurons in the NAc as rats of both sexes performed a STOP&ndash;change task that is commonly used to study motor control and impulsivity. In this task, rats respond quickly to a spatial cue on 80% of trials (GO) and must stop and redirect planned movement on 20% of trials (STOP). We found that the activity of reward-excited neurons signaled accurate response direction on GO, but not STOP, trials and that these neurons exhibited higher precue firing after correct trials. In contrast, reward-inhibited neurons significantly represented response direction on STOP trials at the time of the instrumental response. Finally, the proportion of reward-excited to reward-inhibited neurons and the strength of precue firing decreased as the electrode traversed the NAc. We conclude that reward-excited cells (more common in core) promote proactive action selection, while reward-inhibited cells (more common in shell) contribute to accurate responding on STOP trials that require reactive suppression and redirection of behavior.</p>

                <p>Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus (FK506), are commonly used immunosuppressants for preserving transplanted organs and tissues. However, these drugs can cause severe and persistent pain. GluA2-lacking, calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) are implicated in various neurological disorders, including neuropathic pain. It is unclear whether and how constitutive calcineurin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin protein phosphatase, controls synaptic CP-AMPARs. In this study, we found that blocking CP-AMPARs with IEM-1460 markedly reduced the amplitude of AMPAR-EPSCs in excitatory neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGluT2), but not in inhibitory neurons expressing vesicular GABA transporter, in the spinal cord of FK506-treated male and female mice. FK506 treatment also caused an inward rectification in the current&ndash;voltage relationship of AMPAR-EPSCs specifically in VGluT2 neurons. Intrathecal injection of IEM-1460 rapidly alleviated pain hypersensitivity in FK506-treated mice. Furthermore, FK506 treatment substantially increased physical interaction of &alpha;2-1 with GluA1 and GluA2 in the spinal cord and reduced GluA1/GluA2 heteromers in endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fractions of spinal cords. Correspondingly, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with pregabalin, <I>Cacna2d1</I> genetic knock-out, or disrupting &alpha;2-1&ndash;AMPAR interactions with an &alpha;2-1 C terminus peptide reversed inward rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs in spinal VGluT2 neurons caused by FK506 treatment. In addition, CK2 inhibition reversed FK506 treatment&ndash;induced pain hypersensitivity, &alpha;2-1 interactions with GluA1 and GluA2, and inward rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs in spinal VGluT2 neurons. Thus, the increased prevalence of synaptic CP-AMPARs in spinal excitatory neurons plays a major role in calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain hypersensitivity. Calcineurin and CK2 antagonistically regulate postsynaptic CP-AMPARs through &alpha;2-1&mdash;mediated GluA1/GluA2 heteromeric assembly in the spinal dorsal horn.</p>

                <p>Sleep disorders affect millions of people around the world and have a high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. While current hypnotics mostly increase non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), drugs acting selectively on enhancing rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) are lacking. This polysomnographic study in male rats showed that the first-in-class selective melatonin MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptor partial agonist UCM871 increases the duration of REMS without affecting that of NREMS. The REMS-promoting effects of UCM871 occurred by inhibiting, in a dose&ndash;response manner, the firing activity of the locus ceruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neurons, which express MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptors. The increase of REMS duration and the inhibition of LC-NE neuronal activity by UCM871 were abolished by MT<SUB>1</SUB> pharmacological antagonism and by an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, which selectively knocked down MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptors in the LC-NE neurons. In conclusion, MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptor agonism inhibits LC-NE neurons and triggers REMS, thus representing a novel mechanism and target for REMS disorders and/or psychiatric disorders associated with REMS impairments.</p>

                <p>We investigated sex differences in dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) using a chronic 16-channel carbon fiber electrode and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). Electrical stimulation-induced (ES; 60&nbsp;Hz) DA release was recorded in the NAc of single- or pair-housed male and female rats. When core (NAcC) and shell (NAcS) were recorded simultaneously, there was greater ES DA release in NAcC of pair-housed females compared with single females and males. Housing did not affect ES NAc DA release in males. In contrast, there was significantly more ES DA release from the DLS of female rats than male rats. This was true prior to and after treatment with methamphetamine. Furthermore, in castrated (CAST) males and ovariectomized (OVX) females, there were no sex differences in ES DA release from the DLS, demonstrating the hormone dependence of this sex difference. However, in the DLS of both intact and gonadectomized rats, DA reuptake was slower in females than that in males. Finally, DA release following ES of the medial forebrain bundle at 60&nbsp;Hz was studied over 4&nbsp;weeks. ES DA release increased over time for both CAST males and OVX females, demonstrating sensitization. Using this novel 16-channel chronic FSCV electrode, we found sex differences in the effects of social housing in the NAcS, sex differences in DA release from intact rats in DLS, and sex differences in DA reuptake in DLS of intake and gonadectomized rats, and we report sensitization of ES-induced DA release in DLS in vivo.</p>

                <p>During the second-to-third trimester, the neuronal pathways of the fetal brain experience rapid development, resulting in the complex architecture of the interwired network at birth. While diffusion MRI-based tractography has been employed to study the prenatal development of structural connectivity network (SCN) in preterm neonatal and postmortem fetal brains, the in utero development of SCN in the normal fetal brain remains largely unknown. In this study, we utilized in utero dMRI data from human fetuses of both sexes between 26 and 38 gestational weeks to investigate the developmental trajectories of the fetal brain SCN, focusing on intrahemispheric connections. Our analysis revealed significant increases in global efficiency, mean local efficiency, and clustering coefficient, along with significant decrease in shortest path length, while small-worldness persisted during the studied period, revealing balanced network integration and segregation. Widespread short-ranged connectivity strengthened significantly. The nodal strength developed in a posterior-to-anterior and medial-to-lateral order, reflecting a spatiotemporal gradient in cortical network connectivity development. Moreover, we observed distinct lateralization patterns in the fetal brain SCN. Globally, there was a leftward lateralization in network efficiency, clustering coefficient, and small-worldness. The regional lateralization patterns in most language, motor, and visual-related areas were consistent with prior knowledge, except for Wernicke's area, indicating lateralized brain wiring is an innate property of the human brain starting from the fetal period. Our findings provided a comprehensive view of the development of the fetal brain SCN and its lateralization, as a normative template that may be used to characterize atypical development.</p>

                <p>The small G-protein Ras&ndash;related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) promotes the formation of filamentous actin (F-actin). Actin is a major component of dendritic spines, and we previously found that alcohol alters actin composition and dendritic spine structure in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). To examine if Rac1 contributes to these alcohol-mediated adaptations, we measured the level of GTP-bound active Rac1 in the striatum of mice following 7&nbsp;weeks of intermittent access to 20% alcohol. We found that chronic alcohol intake activates Rac1 in the DMS of male mice. In contrast, Rac1 is not activated by alcohol in the NAc and DLS of male mice or in the DMS of female mice. Similarly, closely related small G-proteins are not activated by alcohol in the DMS, and Rac1 activity is not increased in the DMS by moderate alcohol or natural reward. To determine the consequences of alcohol-dependent Rac1 activation in the DMS of male mice, we inhibited endogenous Rac1 by infecting the DMS of mice with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a dominant negative form of the small G-protein (Rac1-DN). We found that overexpression of AAV-Rac1-DN in the DMS inhibits alcohol-mediated Rac1 signaling and attenuates alcohol-mediated F-actin polymerization, which corresponded with a decrease in dendritic arborization and spine maturation. Finally, we provide evidence to suggest that Rac1 in the DMS plays a role in alcohol-associated goal&ndash;directed learning. Together, our data suggest that Rac1 in the DMS plays an important role in alcohol-dependent structural plasticity and aberrant learning.</p>

                <p>The intention to act influences the computations of various task-relevant features. However, little is known about the time course of these computations. Furthermore, it is commonly held that these computations are governed by conjunctive neural representations of the features. But, support for this view comes from paradigms arbitrarily combining task features and affordances, thus requiring representations in working memory. Therefore, the present study used electroencephalography and a well-rehearsed task with features that afford minimal working memory representations to investigate the temporal evolution of feature representations and their potential integration in the brain. Female and male human participants grasped objects or touched them with a knuckle. Objects had different shapes and were made of heavy or light materials with shape and weight being relevant for grasping, not for "knuckling." Using multivariate analysis showed that representations of object shape were similar for grasping and knuckling. However, only for grasping did early shape representations reactivate at later phases of grasp planning, suggesting that sensorimotor control signals feed back to the early visual cortex. Grasp-specific representations of material/weight only arose during grasp execution after object contact during the load phase. A trend for integrated representations of shape and material also became grasp-specific but only briefly during the movement onset. These results suggest that the brain generates action-specific representations of relevant features as required for the different subcomponents of its action computations. Our results argue against the view that goal-directed actions inevitably join all features of a task into a sustained and unified neural representation.</p>

                <p>Anxiety-related disorders respond to cognitive behavioral therapies, which involved the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Previous studies have suggested that subregions of the mPFC have different and even opposite roles in regulating innate anxiety. However, the specific causal targets of their descending projections in modulating innate anxiety and stress-induced anxiety have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that among the various downstream pathways of the prelimbic cortex (PL), a subregion of the mPFC, PL-mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) projection, and PL-ventral tegmental area (VTA) projection exhibited antagonistic effects on anxiety-like behavior, while the PL-MD projection but not PL-VTA projection was necessary for the animal to guide anxiety-related behavior. In addition, MD-projecting PL neurons bidirectionally regulated remote but not recent fear memory retrieval. Notably, restraint stress induced high-anxiety state accompanied by strengthening the excitatory inputs onto MD-projecting PL neurons, and inhibiting PL-MD pathway rescued the stress-induced anxiety. Our findings reveal that the activity of PL-MD pathway may be an essential factor to maintain certain level of anxiety, and stress increased the excitability of this pathway, leading to inappropriate emotional expression, and suggests that targeting specific PL circuits may aid the development of therapies for the treatment of stress-related disorders.</p>

                <p>Preclinical assessments of pain have often relied upon behavioral measurements and anesthetized neurophysiological recordings. Current technologies enabling large-scale neural recordings, however, have the potential to unveil quantifiable pain signals in conscious animals for preclinical studies. Although pain processing is distributed across many brain regions, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is of particular interest in isolating these signals given its suggested role in the affective ("unpleasant") component of pain. Here, we explored the utility of the ACC toward preclinical pain research using head-mounted miniaturized microscopes to record calcium transients in freely moving male mice expressing genetically encoded calcium indicator 6f (GCaMP6f) under the Thy1 promoter. We verified the expression of GCaMP6f in excitatory neurons and found no intrinsic behavioral differences in this model. Using a multimodal stimulation paradigm across naive, pain, and analgesic conditions, we found that while ACC population activity roughly scaled with stimulus intensity, single-cell representations were highly flexible. We found only low-magnitude increases in population activity after complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and insufficient evidence for the existence of a robust nociceptive ensemble in the ACC. However, we found a temporal sharpening of response durations and generalized increases in pairwise neural correlations in the presence of the mechanistically distinct analgesics gabapentin or ibuprofen after (but not before) CFA-induced inflammatory pain. This increase was not explainable by changes in locomotion alone. Taken together, these results highlight challenges in isolating distinct pain signals among flexible representations in the ACC but suggest a neurophysiological hallmark of analgesia after pain that generalizes to at least two analgesics.</p>

                <p>Human genetics and preclinical studies have identified key contributions of TREM2 to several neurodegenerative conditions, inspiring efforts to modulate TREM2 therapeutically. Here, we characterize the activities of three TREM2 agonist antibodies in multiple mixed-sex mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and remyelination. Receptor activation and downstream signaling are explored in vitro, and active dose ranges are determined in vivo based on pharmacodynamic responses from microglia. For mice bearing amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) pathology (PS2APP) or combined A&beta; and tau pathology (TauPS2APP), chronic TREM2 agonist antibody treatment had limited impact on microglia engagement with pathology, overall pathology burden, or downstream neuronal damage. For mice with demyelinating injuries triggered acutely with lysolecithin, TREM2 agonist antibodies unexpectedly disrupted injury resolution. Likewise, TREM2 agonist antibodies limited myelin recovery for mice experiencing chronic demyelination from cuprizone. We highlight the contributions of dose timing and frequency across models. These results introduce important considerations for future TREM2-targeting approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/29/e2396232024?rss=1">A Reinterpretation of the Relationship between Persistent and Resurgent Sodium Currents</a></h4>

              
                <p>The resurgent sodium current (I<SUB>NaR</SUB>) activates on membrane repolarization, such as during the downstroke of neuronal action potentials. Due to its unique activation properties, I<SUB>NaR</SUB> is thought to drive high rates of repetitive neuronal firing. However, I<SUB>NaR</SUB> is often studied in combination with the persistent or noninactivating portion of sodium currents (I<SUB>NaP</SUB>). We used dynamic clamp to test how I<SUB>NaR</SUB> and I<SUB>NaP</SUB> individually affect repetitive firing in adult cerebellar Purkinje neurons from male and female mice. We learned I<SUB>NaR</SUB> does not scale repetitive firing rates due to its rapid decay at subthreshold voltages and that subthreshold I<SUB>NaP</SUB> is critical in regulating neuronal firing rate. Adjustments to the voltage-gated sodium conductance model used in these studies revealed I<SUB>NaP</SUB> and I<SUB>NaR</SUB> can be inversely scaled by adjusting occupancy in the slow-inactivated kinetic state. Together with additional dynamic clamp experiments, these data suggest the regulation of sodium channel slow inactivation can fine-tune I<SUB>NaP</SUB> and Purkinje neuron repetitive firing rates.</p>

                Background Natural forest resources in northwestern Ethiopia are currently under threat, requiring immediate conservation measures and a management strategy. Thus, an understanding of the present floristic diversity status is required. There is lack of such type of studies specific to fragmented forest patches and across environmental factors. Consequently, this study aimed to examine the existing state of these resources to apply sustainable forest management practices. Methods To achieve this, transects with 200 square plots measuring 400 m2 were set up at nine forest patches with 200m spacing between plots and transects. Vegetation and environmental data were collected and analyzed using R version 4.1. Results Significant variations (p 0.008) were found in vegetation features along the slope, forest patches, and agroclimatic zone. When compared to other forest patches, highland, and mid-altitude forest patches had the highest species diversity (2.48) and stocking (2578 trees/ha). The gentle slope has the most species diversity (2.83). The species similarity between highland and mid-altitude forest habitats was found significant (69%). The vegetation cover in the mid-altitude forest patches was also high (abundance: 5-12%). In all the forest patches examined, tree life forms exceeded shrubs, climbers, and herbs. Conclusions According to the study’s findings, the state of forest resources varies considerably across different environmental variations. Despite the impression of entire forest patches from the outside, the interiors are open, with only huge and mature trees covering the canopy. This state has been triggered by deforestation, degradation, and inappropriate human and grazing operations.

                Aims To study the association between AIM2 gene polymorphisms and the tendency for periodontal infection and coronary heart disease, and to determine whether males or females are more susceptible to these diseases. Additionally, we examined its association with the features of periodontal disease. Methods 140 patients were enrolled in this study, and those who took part were divided into four groups as follows: healthy (c), periodontal disease (P), coronary heart disease with intact periodontium (AS-C), and coronary heart disease with periodontal disease (AS-P). Information on entrants, including age, sex, body mass index, and indicators of periodontal disease severity, was documented. Blood samples were collected, and AIM2 gene polymorphisms were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction test, gel phase, and sequences. Results Genetic analysis of AIM2 G/T (rs2793845) revealed a high frequency of the (T) allele and (GT and TT) genotypes that were detected in the periodontal disease and coronary heart disease groups in males. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of alleles and genotypes did not differ significantly between the study groups. Gene polymorphisms were also significantly correlated with indicators of periodontal disease severity. Conclusion High frequenting of (T) alleles and (GT, TT) genotypes in AIM2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were associated with an increased tendency to develop periodontal disease and coronary heart disease. It can be supposed that it has a causative function in the pathophysiology of both disorders, and the validity of SNP as a potential genomic factor for the risk of both disorders in Iraqi males.

                <p>by Harry Saxton, Xu Xu, Torsten Schenkel, Richard H. Clayton, Ian Halliday</p>

Dynamical system models typically involve numerous input parameters whose “effects” and orthogonality need to be quantified through sensitivity analysis, to identify inputs contributing the greatest uncertainty. Whilst prior art has compared total-order estimators’ role in recovering “true” effects, assessing their ability to recover robust parameter orthogonality for use in identifiability metrics has not been investigated. In this paper, we perform: (i) an assessment using a different class of numerical models representing the cardiovascular system, (ii) a wider evaluation of sampling methodologies and their interactions with estimators, (iii) an investigation of the consequences of permuting estimators and sampling methodologies on input parameter orthogonality, (iv) a study of sample convergence through resampling, and (v) an assessment of whether positive outcomes are sustained when model input dimensionality increases. Our results indicate that Jansen or Janon estimators display efficient convergence with minimum uncertainty when coupled with Sobol and the lattice rule sampling methods, making them prime choices for calculating parameter orthogonality and influence. This study reveals that global sensitivity analysis is convergence driven. Unconverged indices are subject to error and therefore the true influence or orthogonality of the input parameters are not recovered. This investigation importantly clarifies the interactions of the estimator and the sampling methodology by reducing the associated ambiguities, defining novel practices for modelling in the life sciences.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1030/v3?src=rss">Uptake of core outcome sets by clinical trialists in China: a protocol [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The concept of core outcome sets (COS) has been introduced in China for about 10 years. In recent years, some Chinese researchers also committed to developing COS, though the majority of COS are ongoing. However, there were more than 500 published COS for research in the COMET database by 2020. The extent of availability of COS for the top 25 diseases with the highest burden in China is unknown. In addition, the uptake of COS in clinical trials for these diseases is unknown, along with the knowledge, perceptions, and views of the clinical trialist community in China on the use of COS in relation to choosing outcomes for their research. Methods The main burden of disease in China will be identified. Then we will search the COMET database to identify if there are ongoing or completed relevant COS research A COS published since 2012 would be preferred to one published before 2012 for the analysis of COS uptake if one meets the eligibility criteria. We will extract scopes of published eligible COS, including condition, population, interventions, and core outcomes. Then we will search the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry using disease names for each disease that has a published COS. We will assess the overlap in scope between clinical trials and COS. Then we will conduct an online survey and semi-structured interviews to identify the knowledge and perceptions of COS among primary investigators of included clinical trials. Discussion This research will fill in gaps between COS and the burden of disease in China. Understanding clinical trialists’knowledge and perceptions of COS may help dissemination and application of COS in the future. Trial registration This research is registered in Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness: https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/2563.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The consolidation of memory is thought to ultimately depend on the synthesis of new proteins, since translational inhibitors such as anisomycin and cycloheximide adversely affect the permanence of long-term memory. However, when applied directly in brain, these agents also profoundly suppress neural activity to an extent that is directly correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition caused. Given that neural activity itself is likely to help mediate consolidation, this finding is a serious criticism of the strict de novo protein hypothesis of memory. Here, we test the neurophysiological effects of another translational inhibitor, emetine. Unilateral intra-hippocampal infusion of emetine suppressed ongoing local field and multiunit activity at ipsilateral sites as compared to the contralateral hippocampus in a fashion that was positively correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition as confirmed by autoradiography. This suppression of activity was also specific to the circumscribed brain region in which protein synthesis inhibition took place. These experiments provide further evidence that ongoing protein synthesis is necessary and fundamental for neural function and suggest that the disruption of memory observed in behavioral experiments using translational inhibitors may be due, in large part, to neural suppression.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Synaptic excitation and inhibition are essential for neuronal communication. However, the variables that regulate synaptic excitation and inhibition in the intact brain remain largely unknown. Here, we examined how spike transmission and suppression between principal cells (PCs) and interneurons (INTs) are modulated by activity history, brain state, cell type, and somatic distance between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons by applying cross-correlogram analyses to datasets recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of 11 male behaving and sleeping Long Evans rats. The strength, temporal delay, and brain-state dependency of the spike transmission and suppression depended on the subregions/layers. The spike transmission probability of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression versus short-term facilitation was higher in CA1 and lower in CA3. Likewise, the intersomatic distance affected the proportion of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression and facilitation in the opposite manner in CA1 compared with CA3. The time constant of depression was longer, while that of facilitation was shorter in MEC than in CA1 and CA3. During sharp-wave ripples, spike transmission showed a larger gain in the MEC than in CA1 and CA3. The intersomatic distance affected the spike transmission gain during sharp-wave ripples differently in CA1 versus CA3. A subgroup of MEC layer 3 (EC3) INTs preferentially received excitatory inputs from and inhibited MEC layer 2 (EC2) PCs. The EC2 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs, most of which showed short-term depression, exhibited higher spike transmission probabilities than the EC2 PC–EC2 INT and EC3 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs. EC2 putative stellate cells exhibited stronger spike transmission to and received weaker spike suppression from EC3 INTs than EC2 putative pyramidal cells. This study provides detailed comparisons of monosynaptic interaction dynamics in the hippocampal–entorhinal loop, which may help to elucidate circuit operations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Remembering what just happened is a crucial prerequisite to form long-term memories but also for establishing and maintaining working memory. So far there is no general agreement about cortical mechanisms that support short-term memory. Using a classifier-based decoding approach, we report that hippocampal activity during few sparsely distributed brief time intervals contains information about the previous sensory motor experience of rodents. These intervals are characterized by only a small increase of firing rate of only a few neurons. These low-rate predictive patterns are present in both working memory and non-working memory tasks, in two rodent species, rats and Mongolian gerbils, are strongly reduced for rats with medial entorhinal cortex lesions, and depend on the familiarity of the sensory-motor context.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23620?af=R">Temporal organization of narrative recall is present but attenuated in adults with hippocampal amnesia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Studies of the impact of brain injury on memory processes often focus on the quantity and episodic richness of those recollections. Here, we argue that the organization of one's recollections offers critical insights into the impact of brain injury on functional memory. It is well-established in studies of word list memory that free recall of unrelated words exhibits a clear temporal organization. This <i>temporal contiguity effect</i> refers to the fact that the order in which word lists are recalled reflects the original presentation order. Little is known, however, about the organization of recall for semantically rich materials, nor how recall organization is impacted by hippocampal damage and memory impairment. The present research is the first study, to our knowledge, of temporal organization in semantically rich narratives in three groups: (1) Adults with bilateral hippocampal damage and severe declarative memory impairment, (2) adults with bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) damage and no memory impairment, and (3) demographically matched non-brain-injured comparison participants. We find that although the narrative recall of adults with bilateral hippocampal damage reflected the temporal order in which those narratives were experienced above chance levels, their temporal contiguity effect was significantly attenuated relative to comparison groups. In contrast, individuals with vmPFC damage did not differ from non-brain-injured comparison participants in temporal contiguity. This pattern of group differences yields insights into the cognitive and neural systems that support the use of temporal organization in recall. These data provide evidence that the retrieval of temporal context in narrative recall is hippocampal-dependent, whereas damage to the vmPFC does not impair the temporal organization of narrative recall. This evidence of limited but demonstrable organization of memory in participants with hippocampal damage and amnesia speaks to the power of narrative structures in supporting meaningfully organized recall despite memory impairment.</p>

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials. Narcissism refers to the personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behaviour, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of the influence of selfie-taking behavior and narcissism on oral health. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age. Step forward binary regression demonstrated a significant odds ratio for grandiose narcissism followed by selfie-taking behavior Conclusion This study revealed a correlation between perceived oral health and selfie-taking behaviour. Further studies are required to assess selfie-taking behaviour and oral health.

                The U.S. government has invested in distressed communities in the 21st century but with minimal effect. Regarding income, poverty, joblessness, and vacancy rates, the average distressed zip code in 2018 showed no improvement compared to its standing relative to the average prosperous zip code in 2000. We have discovered the formation of unique business clusters funded by public-private partnerships have the potential to make a difference in lifting distressed communities. Our research of literature and artifacts (photographs, videos, documents, digital media - websites or social media posts) suggests the discovery of a Clean Innovation Ecosystem (CIE). CIE refers to the network of social entrepreneurs, organizations, institutions, and individuals that work together to promote sustainable technologies and practices. As of the 4th quarter of 2023, manufacturing annual run rate construction spending has skyrocketed to over $200 billion. There are another $600 billion of Voltage Valley projects announced that have not yet been built. Over the past two decades, private investment has been between $20 billion and $100 billion annually in U.S. manufacturing infrastructure. Governments are making unprecedented investments in clean energy - which include approximately $400 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), $8 billion to establish 6–10 regional Hydrogen Hubs in the U.S., investments in carbon capture, renewable energy technologies, and other investments in clean energy sectors and technologies. All these investments come with the condition that the investment lifts distressed communities. This article explains why investing in Appalachia and geographic regions with similar characteristics will maximize the social benefit of public investment in a Clean Innovation Ecosystem. Our case study covers the Greater Central Appalachian Voltage Valley (GCAVV) – the states of Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Upstate New York, and Michigan, as well as the Central Appalachian region as defined by 56 of the 85 distressed communities of Appalachia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-807/v1?src=rss">A study of association between early menarche and anxiety in undergraduate  students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Anxiety has been reported to be one of the most common epidemics in recent years. The present study focused on understanding the association between early menarche and the prevalence of anxiety and anxiety symptoms among adult undergraduate students. Methods This was an observational, case-control study. The sample included 146 young female adults aged more than or equal to 18 years pursuing the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) and Bachelor of Dental Sciences (BDS). Using an online questionnaire, participants were asked to recall and enter the age at which they attained menarche. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7- Item Questionnaire (GAD-7) to measure the severity of their present anxiety symptoms. Results The results showed a significant increase in anxiety symptoms in participants who had early menarche compared to those who did not have early menarche. The mean score on the GAD-7 Questionnaire for the cases was 9.93 and the control group was 6.89. The GAD-7 scores among the cases group were significantly higher in the GAD-7 scores than in the control group. Conclusions This study concluded that early menarche is associated with higher anxiety levels in young adults.

                <p>Despite the use of ‘high efficacy’ disease-modifying therapies, disease activity and clinical progression of different immune-mediated neurological diseases continue for some patients, resulting in accumulating disability, deteriorating social and mental health, and high economic cost to patients and society. Although autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant is an effective treatment modality, it is an intensive chemotherapy-based therapy with a range of short- and long-term side-effects. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell and other hematological malignancies, conferring long-term remission for otherwise refractory diseases. However, the toxicity of this treatment, particularly cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and the complexity of production necessitate the need for a high level of specialization at treating centers. Early-phase trials of CAR-T therapies in immune-mediated B cell driven conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and myasthenia gravis, have shown dramatic clinical response with few adverse events. Based on the common physiopathology, CAR-T therapy in other immune-mediated neurological disease, including multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory polyradiculopathy, autoimmune encephalitis, and stiff person syndrome, might be an effective option for patients, avoiding the need for long-term immunosuppressant medications. It may prove to be a more selective immunoablative approach than autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with potentially increased efficacy and lower adverse events. In this review, we present the state of the art and future directions of the use of CAR-T in such conditions. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                The dispanins are a family of 15 transmembrane proteins that have diverse and often unclear physiological functions. Many dispanins, including synapse differentiation induced gene 1 (SynDIG1), proline-rich transmembrane protein 1 (PRRT1)/SynDIG4, and PRRT2, are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), where they are involved in the development of synapses, regulation of neurotransmitter release, and interactions with ion channels, including AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Others, including transmembrane protein 233 (TMEM233) and trafficking regulator of GLUT4-1 (TRARG1), are expressed in the peripheral nervous system (PNS); however, the function of these dispanins is less clear. Recently, a family of neurotoxins isolated from the giant Australian stinging tree was shown to target TMEM233 to modulate the function of voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels, suggesting that the dispanins are inherently druggable. Here, we review current knowledge about the structure and function of the dispanins, in particular TMEM233 and its two most closely related homologs PRRT2 and TRARG1, which may be drug targets involved in neurological disease.

                In this issue of Neuron, Wang et al. demonstrate that parvalbumin interneurons in the sensory thalamic reticular nucleus are necessary and sufficient for regulating social memory in mice, identify a novel cortico-reticular thalamic-parafascicular pathway for social cognition, and highlight an essential role of GABAergic inhibitory neurons in social memory engrams.

                The pupil is the eye’s adjustable aperture. Fitzpatrick et al. find that visual contrast constricts the pupil, increasing contrast. This process improves behavioral performance. Its retinal origin has unorthodox elements, like interneurons that make connections in unusual locales and photoreceptive ganglion cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89781">Stimulation-induced cytokine polyfunctionality as a dynamic concept</a></h4>

              
                Cytokine polyfunctionality is a well-established concept in immune cells, especially T cells, and their ability to concurrently produce multiple cytokines has been associated with better immunological disease control and subsequent effectiveness during infection and disease. To date, only little is known about the secretion dynamics of those cells, masked by the widespread deployment of mainly time-integrated endpoint measurement techniques that do not easily differentiate between concurrent and sequential secretion. Here, we employed a single-cell microfluidic platform capable of resolving the secretion dynamics of individual PBMCs. To study the dynamics of poly-cytokine secretion, as well as the dynamics of concurrent and sequential polyfunctionality, we analyzed the response at different time points after ex vivo activation. First, we observed the simultaneous secretion of cytokines over the measurement time for most stimulants in a subpopulation of cells only. Second, polyfunctionality generally decreased with prolonged stimulation times and revealed no correlation with the concentration of secreted cytokines in response to stimulation. However, we observed a general trend towards higher cytokine secretion in polyfunctional cells, with their secretion dynamics being distinctly different from mono-cytokine-secreting cells. This study provided insights into the distinct secretion behavior of heterogenous cell populations after stimulation with well-described agents and such a system could provide a better understanding of various immune dynamics in therapy and disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94276">Mapping responses to focal injections of bicuculline in the lateral parafacial region identifies core regions for maximal generation of active expiration</a></h4>

              
                The lateral parafacial area (pFL) is a crucial region involved in respiratory control, particularly in generating active expiration through an expiratory oscillatory network. Active expiration involves rhythmic abdominal (ABD) muscle contractions during late-expiration, increasing ventilation during elevated respiratory demands. The precise anatomical location of the expiratory oscillator within the ventral medulla’s rostro-caudal axis is debated. While some studies point to the caudal tip of the facial nucleus (VIIc) as the oscillator’s core, others suggest more rostral areas. Our study employed bicuculline (a γ-aminobutyric acid type A [GABA-A] receptor antagonist) injections at various pFL sites (–0.2 mm to +0.8 mm from VIIc) to investigate the impact of GABAergic disinhibition on respiration. These injections consistently elicited ABD recruitment, but the response strength varied along the rostro-caudal zone. Remarkably, the most robust and enduring changes in tidal volume, minute ventilation, and combined respiratory responses occurred at more rostral pFL locations (+0.6/+0.8 mm from VIIc). Multivariate analysis of the respiratory cycle further differentiated between locations, revealing the core site for active expiration generation with this experimental approach. Our study advances our understanding of neural mechanisms governing active expiration and emphasizes the significance of investigating the rostral pFL region.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91650">Modulation of alpha oscillations by attention is predicted by hemispheric asymmetry of subcortical regions</a></h4>

              
                Evidence suggests that subcortical structures play a role in high-level cognitive functions such as the allocation of spatial attention. While there is abundant evidence in humans for posterior alpha band oscillations being modulated by spatial attention, little is known about how subcortical regions contribute to these oscillatory modulations, particularly under varying conditions of cognitive challenge. In this study, we combined MEG and structural MRI data to investigate the role of subcortical structures in controlling the allocation of attentional resources by employing a cued spatial attention paradigm with varying levels of perceptual load. We asked whether hemispheric lateralization of volumetric measures of the thalamus and basal ganglia predicted the hemispheric modulation of alpha-band power. Lateral asymmetry of the globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and thalamus predicted attention-related modulations of posterior alpha oscillations. When the perceptual load was applied to the target and the distractor was salient caudate nucleus asymmetry predicted alpha-band modulations. Globus pallidus was predictive of alpha-band modulations when either the target had a high load, or the distractor was salient, but not both. Finally, the asymmetry of the thalamus predicted alpha band modulation when neither component of the task was perceptually demanding. In addition to delivering new insight into the subcortical circuity controlling alpha oscillations with spatial attention, our finding might also have clinical applications. We provide a framework that could be followed for detecting how structural changes in subcortical regions that are associated with neurological disorders can be reflected in the modulation of oscillatory brain activity.

">HINT1 Inhibitors as Selective Modulators of MOR-NMDAR Cross Regulation and Non-Opioid Analgesia</a></h4>

              
                The Human Histidine Triad Nucleotide Binding Protein 1 (HINT1) has recently become a protein of interest due to its involvement in several CNS processes, including neuroplasticity and the development of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Crucially, HINT1 behaves as a mediator for the cross-regulation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Active site inhibition of HINT1 using small molecule inhibitors has been demonstrated to have a significant impact on this cross-regulatory relationship in vivo. Herein, we describe the development of a series of ethenoadenosine HINT1 inhibitors to further evaluate the effect of HINT1 inhibition on morphines blockade of NMDA-evoked behaviors, the development of acute endomorphin-2 tolerance and analgesia. X-ray crystallographic analysis and HINT1 binding experiments demonstrate that modifications to the inhibitor nucleobase greatly impact the inhibitor binding interactions with HINT1. Our results reveal a complex structural-activity relationship for HINT1 inhibitors in which minor modifications to the ethenoadenosine scaffold resulted in dramatic changes to their activity in these assays modeling MOR-NMDAR interaction. Specifically, we observed the ability of HINT1 inhibitors to selectively affect individual pathways of MOR-NMDAR crosstalk. Furthermore, we observed that a carbamate ethenoadenosine inhibitor of HINT1 can induce analgesia, while not affecting opioid tolerance. Additionally, although past studies have indicated that that loss of HINT1 expression can result in the downregulation of p53, we have shown that inhibition of HINT1 has no effect on either the expression of HINT1 or p53. These studies highlight the critical role of HINT1 in MOR-NMDAR crosstalk and demonstrate the intriguing potential of using HINT1 active-site inhibitors as tools to probe its role in these biochemical pathways and its potential as a novel pain target.

                Dynamic CpG methylation barcodes were read from 15,000 to 21,000 single cells from three human male brains. To overcome sparse sequencing coverage, the barcode had ~31,000 rapidly fluctuating X-chromosome CpG sites (fCpGs), with at least 500 covered sites per cell and at least 30 common sites between cell pairs (average of ~48). Barcodes appear to start methylated and record mitotic ages because excitatory neurons and glial cells that emerge later in development were less methylated. Barcodes are different between most cells, with average pairwise differences (PWDs) of ~0.5 between cells. About 10 cell pairs per million were more closely related with PWDs < 0.05. Barcodes appear to record ancestry and reconstruct trees where more related cells had similar phenotypes, albeit some pairs had phenotypic differences. Inhibitory and excitatory neurons both showed evidence of tangential migration with related cells in different cortical regions. fCpG barcodes become polymorphic during development and can distinguish between thousands of human cells.

">Mistargeted retinal axons form synaptically segregated subcircuits in the visual thalamus of albino mice</a></h4>

              
                A Hebbian model of circuit remodeling predicts that two sets of inputs with very different activity patterns will synaptically capture separate sets of target cells. Support for this prediction appears to come from studies of albino mice where a set of mistargeted retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) forms a cluster of axon terminals that is distinct from the surrounding dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei (dLGN) neuropil. The formation of these islands depends on retinal activity. However, the synaptic connectivity of these islands was unknown. Here, we combine light and electron microscopy to determine if these activity-dependent islands of axon terminals represent synaptically segregated subcircuits. We reconstructed the microcircuitry of the boundary between the island and non-island RGCs and found a remarkably strong segregation within retinogeniculate connectivity. We conclude that, when sets of retinal input are established in the wrong part of the dLGN, the developing circuitry responds by forming a synaptically isolated subcircuit within the otherwise fully connected network. The fact that there is a developmental starting condition that can induce a synaptically segregated microcircuit has important implications for our understanding of the organization of visual circuits and for our understanding of the implementation of activity dependent development.

">Actions obey Weber's law when precision is evaluated at goal attainment</a></h4>

              
                Weber's law, the psychophysical principle stating that the just noticeable difference (JND), which is inversely related to sensory precision, increases proportionally with the magnitude of a stimulus, impacts all domains of human perception, but it is violated in visually guided grasping actions. The underlying reasons for this dissociation between perception and action are still debated, and various hypotheses have been put forward, including a different coding of visual size information for perception and action, the use of positional information to guide grasping, biomechanical factors, or sensorimotor calibration. To contrast these hypotheses, we investigated Weber's law in a new action task, the two-finger pointing task. Participants reached and touched two targets positioned at different distances apart by using their index finger and thumb. Consistent with Weber's law, we found that the standard deviation (SD) of the final inter-finger separation, serving as a measure analogous to the JND, increased with larger inter-target distances. These findings suggest that, when considering measures strongly related with the attainment of the action goal, Weber's law is regularly at play.

">Grape extract and resveratrol mitigate sleep fragmentation, Aβ accumulation, and abnormal neuronal excitability in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Consumption of red wine and grape extracts may offer a range of health benefits, largely attributable to the grapes' rich content of vitamins, fiber, and antioxidant compounds, such as polyphenols. To determine if resveratrol (RES) present in grape extracts is responsible for these benefits, we conducted a study on the effects of red grape skin extract (GSKE), seed extract (GSEE), and RES on sleep patterns, amyloid-beta (A{beta}) deposition, neuronal excitability, and lifespan in a Drosophila model expressing A{beta}42. A{beta}42 flies experienced significant sleep fragmentation at night, yet their overall sleep duration was unaffected. Dietary GSKE significantly enhanced sleep duration and mitigated sleep fragmentation in these flies, whereas GSEE only increased the duration of sleep bouts during the day. RES demonstrated a similar effect, albeit to a lesser extent compared to GSKE. All three dietary interventions led to a reduction in A{beta}42 levels and an extension of the lifespan in A{beta}42 flies, with GSEE showing the least pronounced effects. Furthermore, GSEE and RES were able to reverse the hyperexcitability of mushroom body neurons (MBNs) caused by A{beta}42 expression. These results suggest that GSKE and RES are potent promoters of sleep and have the potential to ameliorate sleep disturbances. Additionally, the study highlights that other bioactive component in GSKE, beyond RES, may contribute to its diverse pharmacological activities, which could differ from those of GSEE or RES alone. This underscores the multifaceted nature of grape extracts and their potential therapeutic applications in addressing sleep disorders and neurodegenerative conditions associated with A{beta} deposition.

">Loss of MEF2C function by enhancer mutation leads to neuronal mitochondria dysfunction and motor deficits in mice</a></h4>

              
                Genetic changes and epigenetic modifications are associated with neuronal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanism behind genetic mutations in the non-coding region of genes that affect epigenetic modifications remains unclear. Here, we identified an ALS-associated SNP located in the intronic region of MEF2C (rs304152), residing in a putative enhancer element, using convolutional neural network. The enhancer mutation of MEF2C reduces own gene expression and consequently impairs mitochondrial function in motor neurons. MEF2C localizes and binds to the mitochondria DNA, and directly modulates mitochondria-encoded gene expression. CRISPR/Cas-9-induced mutation of the MEF2C enhancer decreases expression of mitochondria-encoded genes. Moreover, MEF2C mutant cells show reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP level but elevation of oxidative stress. MEF2C deficiency in the upper and lower motor neurons of mice impairs mitochondria-encoded genes, and leads to mitochondrial metabolic disruption and progressive motor behavioral deficits. Together, MEF2C dysregulation by the enhancer mutation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which are prevalent features in motor neuronal damage and ALS pathogenesis. This genetic and epigenetic crosstalk mechanism provides insights for advancing our understanding of motor neuron disease and developing effective treatments.

">A focal traumatic injury to the spinal cord causes an immediate and massive spreading depolarization sustained by chloride ions, with transient network dysfunction and remote cortical glia changes.</a></h4>

              
                In clinics, physical injuries to the spinal cord cause a temporary motor areflexia below lesion, known as spinal shock. This topic is still underexplored due to the lack of preclinical SCI models that do not use anesthesia, which would affect spinal excitability. Our innovative design considered a custom-made micro impactor that provides localized and calibrated strikes to the ventral surface of the thoracic spinal cord of the entire CNS isolated from neonatal rats. Before and after injury, multiple ventral root (VR) recordings continuously traced respiratory rhythm, baseline spontaneous activities, and electrically-induced reflex responses. As early as 200 ms after impact, an immediate transient depolarization spread from the injury site to the whole spinal cord with distinct segmental velocities. Stronger strikes induced higher potentials causing, at the site of injury, a transient drop in tissue oxygen levels and a massive cell death with complete disconnection of longitudinal tracts. Below the impact site, expiratory rhythm and spontaneous lumbar activity were suppressed. On lumbar VRs, reflex responses transiently halted but later recovered to control values, while electrically-induced fictive locomotion remained perturbed. Moreover, low-ion modified Krebs solutions differently influenced impact-induced depolarizations, the magnitude of which amplified in low-Cl-. Moreover, remote changes in cortical glia occurred soon after spinal damage. Overall, our novel in vitro platform traces the immediate functional consequences of impacts to the spinal cord during development. This basic study provides insights on the SCI pathophysiology, unveiling an immediate chloride dysregulation and transient remote glial changes in the cortex.

">Neurophysiological correlates of cortical hierarchy across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                The brain processes information along a hierarchical structure, forming a gradient of cortical hierarchy from sensorimotor areas to transmodal areas. Here, we aim to understand which aspects of neural dynamics characterize this gradient and whether the respective spatial distribution varies across the lifespan. Therefore, we extracted neurophysiological features from magnetoencephalography recordings in 350 participants between 18 and 88 years during rest. Among traditional features related to the power spectrum, delta power (1-4 Hz) showed the most robust association with cortical hierarchy, increasing along this axis. Beyond traditional features, we employed comprehensive time-series characterization and identified a novel hierarchy-sensitive feature capturing the variability of the signal's mean over time. This feature increases along the cortical hierarchy, suggesting that higher-level brain areas exhibit more dynamic and context-dependent activity patterns. Furthermore, we highlight changes in the gradient of brain dynamics across the lifespan. Alpha power distribution, for instance, exhibits a posterior-anterior gradient in young adults that becomes less pronounced with increasing age. Further, the change of the autocorrelation and auto mutual information function along the cortical hierarchy is heavily modulated by age. These findings reveal simple but robust neurophysiological markers of cortical hierarchy and highlight the dynamic nature of the brain's organization throughout life.

">Complementary Organization of Driver and Modulator Cortico-Thalamo-Cortical Circuits</a></h4>

              
                Corticocortical (CC) projections in the visual system facilitate the hierarchical processing of sensory information. In addition to direct CC connections, indirect cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathways through the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus can relay sensory signals and mediate interactions between areas according to behavioral demands. While the pulvinar is extensively connected to the entire visual cortex, it is unknown whether transthalamic pathways link all cortical areas or whether they follow systematic organizational rules. Because pulvinar neurons projecting to different cortical areas are spatially intermingled, their input/output relationships have been difficult to characterize using traditional anatomical methods. To determine the organization of CTC circuits, we mapped the higher visual areas (HVAs) of mice with intrinsic signal imaging and targeted five pulvinar[-&gt;]HVA pathways for projection-specific rabies tracing. We aligned post-mortem cortical tissue to in vivo maps for precise quantification of the areas and cell types projecting to each pulvinar[-&gt;]HVA population. Layer 5 corticothalamic (L5CT) ''driver'' inputs to the pulvinar originate predominantly from primary visual cortex (V1), consistent with the CC hierarchy. L5CT inputs from lateral HVAs specifically avoid driving reciprocal connections, consistent with the ''no-strong-loops'' hypothesis. Conversely, layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) ''modulator'' inputs are distributed across areas and are biased toward reciprocal connections. Unlike previous studies in primates, we find that every HVA receives disynaptic input from the superior colliculus. CTC circuits in the pulvinar thus depend on both target HVA and input cell type, such that driving and modulating higher-order pathways follow complementary connection rules similar to those governing first-order CT circuits.

">Criticality explains structure-function relationships in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Healthy brain exhibits a rich dynamical repertoire, with flexible spatiotemporal patterns replays on both microscopic and macroscopic scales. How do fixed structural connections yield a diverse range of dynamic patterns in spontaneous brain activity? We hypothesize that the observed relationship between empirical structure and functional patterns is best explained when the microscopic neuronal dynamics is close to a critical regime. Using a modular Spiking Neuronal Network model based on empirical connectomes, we posit that multiple stored functional patterns can transiently reoccur when the system operates near a critical regime, generating realistic brain dynamics and structural-functional relationships. The connections in the model are chosen as to force the network to learn and propagate suited modular spatiotemporal patterns. To test our hypothesis, we employ magnetoencephalography and tractography data from five healthy individuals. We show that the critical regime of the model is able to generate realistic features, and demonstrate the relevance of near-critical regimes for physiological brain activity.

">Insights into the foraging Gene's Influence on Mating Investments of Male Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The foraging gene is a key genetic factor that modulates social behavior in insects, primarily by governing the trade-off between individual foraging and group-related activities. It has been associated with various behaviors associated with food search and resource exploitation, thereby playing a crucial role in determining the efficiency of foraging and the overall success of the collective. In this study, we investigate the critical role of the foraging gene in mediating complex interval timing behaviors, particularly mating duration, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. By examining two distinct variant phenotypes, rover and sitter, we observe specific deficiencies in longer (LMD) and shorter mating duration (SMD) behaviors, respectively, suggesting the genes crucial influence on these interval timing mechanisms. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing and knockdown experiments, we identify the genes significant expression in key neurons involved in learning and memory. However, its impact on mating duration is not observed in these brain regions. Instead, our data reveal the genes crucial role in specific neurons expressing Pdfr, a critical regulator of circadian rhythms. Furthermore, the study uncovers sexually dimorphic expression patterns in the brain and highlights the necessity of the genes dosage in specific cell populations within the ellipsoid body for normal mating duration. These findings underscore the foraging genes pivotal role in mediating complex interval timing behaviors in Drosophila, providing valuable insights into the intricate interplay between genetics, environment, and behavior. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying complex interval timing behaviors, with broader implications for unraveling the function of foraging gene.

">Canonical time-series features for characterizing biologically informative dynamical patterns in fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The interdisciplinary time-series analysis literature encompasses thousands of statistical features for quantifying interpretable properties of dynamical data. But for any given application, it is likely that just a small subset of informative time-series features is required to capture the dynamical quantities of interest. So, while comprehensive libraries of time-series features have been developed, it is useful to construct reduced and computationally efficient subsets for specific applications. In this work, we demonstrate a systematic process to deduce such a reduced set, focused on the problem of distinguishing changes to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series caused by a range of experimental manipulations of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity in mouse cortical circuits. We reduce a comprehensive library of over 7000 candidate time-series features down to a subset of 16 features, which we call catchaMouse16, that aims to both: (i) accurately characterize biologically relevant properties of fMRI time series; and (ii) minimize inter-feature redundancy. The catchaMouse16 feature set accurately classifies experimental perturbations of neuronal activity from fMRI recordings, and also shows strong generalization performance on an unseen mouse and human resting-state fMRI data where it tracks spatial variations in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cell densities, often with greater statistical power than the full hctsa feature set. We provide an efficient, open-source implementation of the catchaMouse16 feature set in C (achieving an approximately 60 times speed-up relative to the native Matlab code of the same features), with wrappers for Python and Matlab. This work demonstrates a procedure to reduce a large candidate time-series feature set down to the key statistical properties of mouse fMRI dynamics that can be used to efficiently quantify and interpret informative dynamical patterns in neural time series.

">Enhancing sleep via rocking ameliorates motor behavior and reduces beta-amyloid levels in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive decline and characterized by beta-amyloid plaque and tau tangle pathology. Recent research indicates a bidirectional relationship between AD pathology and sleep disturbances, with disrupted sleep exacerbating AD progression through increased beta-amyloid and tau accumulation. This strongly indicates that improving sleep may exert a direct protective effect on preventing the accumulation and spreading of AD pathology, and possibly slow the cognitive decline. Here we investigated the effects of enhancing sleep via vestibular stimulation (rocking) on AD progression in a 3xTg mouse model. Over a four-month period starting in early adulthood (p60), we monitored sleep patterns, motor function, memory, and AD pathology. Twelve-hour rocking during the light period significantly increased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep duration in mice, although this effect diminished over time due to habituation. Despite this, rocking attenuated motor function decline and reduced beta-amyloid levels in the cerebral cortex of treated mice. No noticeable changes in tau levels were observed following sleep enhancement. In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of non-pharmacological methods to enhance NREM sleep and modify disease trajectory in AD models, emphasizing the critical role of sleep in neuroprotection.

">Large-scale Dynamical Fingerprints of Distributed Synaptic Alterations in Early-Stage Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, present a major challenge for research and clinical practice: its pathogenesis is complex and only partially understood, the individual symptomatology is heterogenous, and there is a lack of biomarkers for the early detection, diagnosis, and individualized treatment. The underlying synaptic and microcircuitry alterations are widely distributed across the cerebral cortex. Here, we developed a magnetoencephalography approach to map the resulting cortex-wide alterations of local cortical population dynamics. We identified large-scale patterns of changes in cortical dynamics that were remarkably similar between first-episode psychosis patients and individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis. These spatial patterns also resembled those induced by pharmacological manipulations of excitatory NMDA glutamate receptors and inhibitory GABA-A receptors in healthy participants. Differences in those spatial patterns of cortical dynamics between first-episode psychosis patients related to individual symptomatology. Our approach and results open a window on the distributed pathophysiology of psychosis.

	<p>Hormone changes across women&amp;amp;rsquo;s menstrual cycles may lead to changes in their perceptions of chemical signals and their hormonal responses to these cues. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of menstrual cycle phase in the response to extracts of male axillary secretions (EMAS) in women. We tested healthy reproductive age and premenopausal women (n = 29). An EMAS/control solution was applied once every two hours during either the follicular or luteal phase, at which point saliva samples for luteinizing hormone (LH) and cortisol monitoring were collected. LH and cortisol concentrations were analyzed using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technique. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) scores were used to assess the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; moods. For the first time, we showed that EMAS may produce opposite effects on LH secretion depending on the menstrual cycle phase of the recipient. We observed a significant increase in the number of LH peaks (p = 0.0447) and their amplitudes (p = 0.0469) when EMAS was applied during the follicular phase, while the same application in the luteal phase lowered the amplitudes of LH peaks (p = 0.0382). For the first time, we showed that EMAS application increased salivary cortisol levels in reproductive age women relative to premenopausal women (p = 0.0032). PANAS scores revealed changes in positive and negative affect after EMAS application. Our data indicate the significance of the menstrual cycle phase for EMAS&amp;amp;rsquo; effects on LH secretion and mood, but not on cortisol secretion in women.</p>

	<p>In the previous literature, specific attention has been paid to investigate autism spectrum symptoms and traits in university students. In this framework, we aimed to evaluate the presence and correlates of autistic traits, hikikomori tendencies, altered eating behaviors, and pathological videogaming in a sample of Italian university students enrolled in bachelor&amp;amp;rsquo;s degree courses. A total of 1192 students were recruited via an online survey and assessed with the Hikikomori Questionnaire-25, the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum Questionnaire, the Eating Attitude test-26, and the Assessment of Internet and Computer Game Addiction. Our results highlighted significant differences in the prevalence of autistic traits, social withdrawal tendencies, altered eating habits, and pathological videogame use in university students based on gender, age, parents&amp;amp;rsquo; level of instruction, and field of study. A significant effect of the presence of autistic traits and gender on the scores obtained with the other questionnaires was reported. Our results not only support the role of autistic traits as a vulnerability factor for the development of a set of psychopathological conditions but also suggest that gender could modulate this vulnerability, supporting the hypothesis of gender-specific phenotypes in the autism spectrum.</p>

	<p>Background: Hyperactivity may play a functional role in upregulating prefrontal cortical hypoarousal and executive functioning in ADHD. This study investigated the neurocognitive impact of movement during executive functioning on children with ADHD. Methods: Twenty-four children with and without ADHD completed a Stroop task and self-efficacy ratings while remaining stationary (Stationary condition) and while desk cycling (Movement condition). Simultaneous functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recorded oxygenated and deoxygenated changes in hemoglobin within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Results: Among children with ADHD, the Movement condition produced superior Stroop reaction time compared to the Stationary condition (p = 0.046, d = 1.00). Self-efficacy improved in the Movement condition (p = 0.033, d = 0.41), whereas it did not in the Stationary condition (p = 0.323). Seventy-eight percent of participants showed greater oxygenation in the left DLPFC during the Movement condition vs. the Stationary condition. Among children without ADHD, there were no differences in Stroop or self-efficacy outcomes between Stationary and Movement conditions (ps &amp;amp;gt; 0.085, ts &amp;amp;lt; 1.45); 60% of participants showed greater oxygenation in the left DLPFC during the Movement vs. the Stationary condition. Conclusions: This work provides supportive evidence that hyperactivity in ADHD may be a compensatory mechanism to upregulate PFC hypoarousal to support executive functioning and self-efficacy.</p>

	<p>Brain health is a complex concept, shaped by a plethora of determinants related to physical health, healthy environments, safety and security, learning and social connection, as well as access to quality healthcare services. Decision-making in this complex field is characterized by diverse values, potentially conflicting interests, and asymmetrically influential stakeholders. Values-based practice (VBP) is a toolkit for balancing values in a democratic and inclusive way, so that every stakeholder feels a sense of ownership over the decision made. In VBP, the emphasis is on good process rather than on pre-determined &amp;amp;lsquo;correct&amp;amp;rsquo; outcomes. Based on two case vignettes, we highlight the relevance of the ten principles of VBP for balancing different values to the satisfaction of those directly concerned, in a given decision-making process. In addition, we argue that the successful implementation of VBP in the complex area of brain health, as well as in other fields, is premised on higher order values (meta-values), beyond mutual respect and the legal, regulatory, and bioethical framework. These include mutual regard, reciprocity, autonomy, and an egalitarian attitude towards VBP procedures and involved stakeholders.</p>

	<p>Background: Misophonia is a chronic condition in which the exposure to specific sounds increases the arousal and recurrence of specific intense negative emotions. We hypothesized that misophonia may be strongly related to maladaptive interpersonal schemas that create difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Subjects with maladaptive interpersonal schemas think that other people try to subjugate, criticize, dominate, exploit, deceive, disregard, and humiliate them. Furthermore, these patients typically endorse a representation of self as mistreated, constricted, harmed, damaged, humiliated, impotent, inadequate, or fragile. Methods: We describe the course of a treatment of Metacognitive Interpersonal Therapy (MIT) in a young man presenting misophonia and co-occurrent obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) and avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), with narcissistic traits and normal hearing. We collected qualitative and quantitative data at the beginning of the intervention and at 2 years follow-up. Results: The therapy aimed at increasing awareness of maladaptive interpersonal schemas and promoting a healthy self. The results reported a significant decrease in misophonia; behavioural experiments were used to increase the quality of social relationships and tolerance to the trigger sounds. Conclusions: MIT can be an effective therapy for the treatment of misophonia.</p>

	<p>This select overview examines the important intersection of adult domestic violence, including intimate partner violence and elder abuse, with brain injury. Despite the high prevalence of domestic violence amongst brain injury patients, there is a notable gap in screening and management training for providers. To provide optimal patient care, brain injury medicine clinicians must screen, recognize, and treat patients who have experienced domestic violence. This select overview highlights barriers to screening, validated screening tools from other medical disciplines, and management considerations for the brain injury clinician. A suggested protocol for domestic violence screening and management, as well as recommended resources for providers and patients, is summarized.</p>

	<p>Our goal was to evaluate persisting deficits in gait and executive functioning in asymptomatic athletes with a history of concussion using a novel approach combining a dual-task paradigm and post-exercise exertion. Thirty-eight athletes aged 17 to 25 years old participated in the study, including 18 with a history of concussion. The dual-task paradigm required walking continuously at a predetermined self-paced target speed of 6.5 km/h while executing a complex switch task. Athletes completed two conditions, each on separate days: (1) dual task alone and (2) dual task following 20 min of running on a non-motorized treadmill. The statistical analyses revealed a significant reduction in gait speed exclusively for athletes with a history of concussion and only following the post-exercise condition (p = 0.008). These findings suggest that although asymptomatic concussed athletes maintain a cognitive performance comparable to non-concussed athletes, this appears to be achieved at the expense of gait speed. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating gait assessments and post-exercise exertion into concussion evaluation protocols in both research and clinical settings.</p>
