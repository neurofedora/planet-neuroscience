              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1388/v2?src=rss">Characteristics and contributing factors of adverse drug reactions: an analytical study of patients with tuberculosis receiving treatment under the National TB Program of India [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a serious threat to the public health system in India. Although the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) is providing a wide range of interventions from early diagnosis to complete treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality from TB, adverse drug reactions (ADR) remain a challenge in treatment adherence and completion. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in selected districts of Gujarat state. A total of 593 reported TB patients were recruited with an adjusted unified distribution based on the type of cases, site of diseases, and service facility through a simple random sampling method. A semi-structured questionnaire tool was used to collect socio-demographic, clinical, and ADR-related data from the TB patients. Data was analyzed for the frequency, percentage, chi-squared, and adjusted odds ratio to find the association between the variables. Results The majority of the study participants were male (87.2%), aged 15 to 60 (57.8%), daily laborers (22.4%), and married (64.2%). Over 75% of individuals had pulmonary TB, with 87% having experienced their first episode, 83% being new cases, and 44.7% having a history of addiction. ADR with mild symptoms was reported by more than a quarter (29%) of TB patients during the intensive phase (77%). The association between ADR experience and drug susceptibility was significant (p<0.005) and drug-resistant TB patients experience two times more ADRs than drug-sensitive TB patients (OR 2.04). Binomial logistic regression was carried out to describe the association between various variables and occurrence of ADRs. Conclusion The study highlighted a need to enhance health care providers’ capacity and program structure for managing ADRs among TB patients. In order to completely eliminate TB across the country, it also emphasized the attention for a holistic and all-encompassing strategy for managing TB patients at the field level.

                Midkine is a secreted protein that acts as a growth factor or cytokine involved in cell survival and inflammatory processes. It accumulates in amyloid plaques, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The reproducibility of Midkine research would be enhanced if the community had access to well-characterized anti-Midkine antibodies. In this study, we characterized 8 commercial Midkine antibodies for Western blot and immunoprecipitation, using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in a knockout cell line and isogenic parental control. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address the antibody reproducibility issue by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-495/v2?src=rss">A review on the phytochemistry and biological activities of Curculigo latifolia Dryand ex. W.Aiton [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Curculigo latifolia Dryand. ex W. T. Aiton, from the genus Curculigo, is a medicinal plant traditionally used to treat numerous illnesses such as fever, stomach aches, jaundice, wounds, and inflammation. C. latifolia is a perennial herb that is widely found in tropical and subtropical regions, such as Southeast Asia, Southern China, Bangladesh, Australia, and the Andaman Islands. This review collates the reported studies on the different aspects of C. latifolia from its plant description, nutritional value, phytochemistry, chemical composition, and pharmacological properties. This review aims to identify gaps in the literature and provide useful references for future work on this plant. Previous studies have shown that C. latifolia contains high mineral contents of calcium, iron, and magnesium, which are essential components of human health. Moreover, the plant is rich in phytochemicals, which play a prominent role in various pharmacological activities. The most common compounds identified included curculigoside, crassifoside I, nyasicoside, and curculigine. C. latifolia demonstrated high antioxidant activity through its ability to scavenge superoxide anions, 1,1–diphenyl–2–picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azino–bis(3–ethylbenzthiazoline–6–sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radicals, reducing ferric ions to ferrous complexes, iron chelation, and β –carotene bleaching. It was also shown that the roots, stems, and leaves of C. latifolia were effective in exerting antimicrobial activity against several microbial strains, including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtillis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia sp., Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., Candida albicans, Salmonella choleraesuis and Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, the root, fruit, leaf, petiole, and rhizome extracts were found to improve glucose uptake and insulin secretion in diabetic rats, suggesting their antidiabetic potential. C. latifolia presents a wide range of medicinal properties that could make it a promising functional food or source of food supplements to prevent nutrition–related or chronic diseases.

                <p>Psychotic symptoms and delusional beliefs have been linked to dopamine transmission in both healthy and clinical samples and are assumed to result at least in part from perceiving illusory patterns in noise. However, the existing literature on the role of dopamine in detecting patterns in noise is inconclusive. To address this issue, we assessed the effect of manipulating dopaminergic neurotransmission on illusory pattern perception in healthy individuals (<I>n </I>= 48, <I>n </I>= 19 female) in a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design (see preregistration at <A HREF="https://osf.io/a4k9j/">https://osf.io/a4k9j/</A>). We predicted individuals on versus off &#x029F;-DOPA to be more likely to perceive illusory patterns, specifically objects in images containing only noise. Using a signal detection model, however, we found no credible evidence that &#x029F;-DOPA compared with placebo increased false alarm rates. Further, &#x029F;-DOPA did not reliably modulate measures of accuracy, discrimination sensitivity, and response bias. In all cases, Bayesian statistics revealed strong evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. The task design followed previous work on illusory pattern perception and comprised a limited number of items per condition. The results therefore need to be interpreted with caution, as power was limited. Future studies should address illusory pattern perception using more items and take into account potential dose-dependent effects and differential effects in healthy versus clinical samples.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0484-23.2024?rss=1">Practical Bayesian Inference in Neuroscience: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Embrace the Distribution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Typical statistical practices in the biological sciences have been increasingly called into question due to difficulties in the replication of an increasing number of studies, many of which are confounded by the relative difficulty of null significance hypothesis testing designs and interpretation of <I>p</I>-values. Bayesian inference, representing a fundamentally different approach to hypothesis testing, is receiving renewed interest as a potential alternative or complement to traditional null significance hypothesis testing due to its ease of interpretation and explicit declarations of prior assumptions. Bayesian models are more mathematically complex than equivalent frequentist approaches, which have historically limited applications to simplified analysis cases. However, the advent of probability distribution sampling tools with exponential increases in computational power now allows for quick and robust inference under any distribution of data. Here we present a practical tutorial on the use of Bayesian inference in the context of neuroscientific studies in both rat electrophysiological and computational modeling data. We first start with an intuitive discussion of Bayes' rule and inference followed by the formulation of Bayesian-based regression and ANOVA models using data from a variety of neuroscientific studies. We show how Bayesian inference leads to easily interpretable analysis of data while providing an open-source toolbox to facilitate the use of Bayesian tools.</p>

                Background Hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord are a complex and diagnostically challenging entity that can present with diverse clinical features. This study protocol outlines a comprehensive investigation to understand the causes, clinical and imaging characteristics, and correlation with pathological findings of hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord. By establishing a systematic assessment approach, this study seeks to provide valuable insights into these abnormalities’ diagnostic and prognostic implications. Methods The study will be conducted as a prospective observational design. Patients with clinically diagnosed or suspected spinal cord lesion presenting with intramedullary T2-weighted hyperintensity and referred for MRI evaluation will be included. Data collection will encompass patient demographics, clinical features, and extensive imaging parameters. Pathological data, when available, will be correlated with imaging findings. Various statistical methods will be employed to analyse the data, including frequency analysis, comparative tests, logistic regression, and survival analysis. Expected Results The study anticipates elucidating the spectrum of etiologies underlying hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord and their clinical and imaging profiles. The systematic approach will offer a structured diagnostic method, while correlations with pathological data will provide an enhanced understanding of these conditions. The results are expected to provide clinicians with valuable insights into diagnosing, treating, and prognosticating patients with spinal cord hyperintensities on T2-weighted images.

                Seed priming enhances germination and growth, which are important determinants of crop yield. This study was carried out to assess the effect of priming duration and metabolite concentration on the priming of five (5) different crops, using the metabolites of five (5) bacterial isolates. The crop seeds were treated in the cold-extracted metabolites of the five isolates at five (5) different priming durations (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h) and then in five metabolite concentrations (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 mg/L) of the five extracted metabolites at the optimal priming duration determined in the first experiment. Characterization of the cold-extracted metabolites was also carried out using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results revealed that priming cowpea and soybean for longer durations (< 3 h) could hinder their growth and development. Lower concentrations were observed to be optimal for cowpea and soybean, but for sesame and okra, there was no detectable pattern with metabolite concentration. The GC-MS revealed the presence of some molecules (e.g. hexadecanoic acid) that have shown plant growth promotion potential in other studies. This study showed that seeds with large endosperm, such as, cowpea and soybean, are more prone to the deleterious effects of treatment for longer durations. Further experiments should be carried out to isolate and purify the bioactive moieties for further studies and onward application.

                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-427/v2?src=rss">Novel Deep Learning Application: Recognizing Inconsistent Characters on Pharmaceutical Packaging [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Machine vision faces significant challenges when applied to text recognition on cardboard packaging particularly due to multiple printing methods, irregular character shapes, and curved packaging surfaces. Methods This research introduces a novel deep learning application for recognizing binarized expiration date and batch code characters printed using multiple printing methods. The method, based on Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN), enables character recognition directly from in the images without the need for extracting handcrafted features. In detail, this approach performs character recognition by using the whole image as input, extracting and learning salient character features directly from the packaging surface images. Results The R-CNN model, with a precision of 91.1% and an F1 score of 80.9%, effectively recognizes manufacturing markings on pharmaceutical packages, with inconsistencies in the characters’ shapes. In a comparative experiment using the same dataset of images, the R-CNN model significantly outperformed Tesseract OCR, achieving much higher precision, recall, and F1 scores. Conclusions The results of this study reveal that the deep learning method outperforms the well-established optical character recognition method in recognizing text characters printed with different printing methods. Presented in this study, the deep learning method recognizes text characters with high precision. It is also suitable for recognizing text printed on curved surfaces, provided proper preprocessing is applied. The problem investigated in the study differs from previous research in the field, focusing on the recognition of texts printed with different printing methods. The research thus fills a gap in text recognition that existed in the research of the field. Furthermore, the study presents new ideas that will be utilized in our future research.

                Background Recent studies have established that Medicinal Marijuana (MM) is beneficial in the treatment of spasms, sleep, and pain in adult patients with varying medical diagnoses and symptoms. However, MM has rarely been used for the treatment of Cerebral Palsy (CP) complications in adults. The aim of this systematic literature review was to explore MM interventions globally, with a focus on identifying the best practice with MM for the treatment of complications of CP. Methods A systematic literature search was performed using keywords and synonyms related to MM treatment and CP complications. Inclusions and exclusions were scoped to scholarly peer reviewed academic literature published 2019 to 2021 located in the Deakin Library collection. A screening process confirmed criteria adherence and identified additional papers in referencing. The papers were appraised and evaluated to ensure selections do not have perceived or actual bias. Results From 409 publications, 27 papers were selected for review because they investigated the benefits of MM treatment for patients with sleep, pain, and spasm complications. There was no literature found on the use of MM for adults with CP. Discussion Recent research has demonstrated that with an informed understanding of MM treatment adult patients with varying medical diagnoses and symptoms can use MM to manage sleep disruption and improve relaxation. Therefore, there are potential benefits for the use of MM in treating spasticity, pain, sleep, quality of life, and social and emotional wellbeing in adult patients with CP. No funding was sort or provided for this review and the results are specific to adults with CP, so they are not to be generalized to other populations.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of the physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. Eleven articles attained the inclusion criteria. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Introduction Acquired hemophilia is a rare disease characterized by the presence of neutralizing autoantibodies against hemostasis factors, most often factor VII. However, a few cases of anti-factor VII (FVII) autoantibodies have been reported in the literature. We report a case in this regard. Case report A 28-year-old woman with no family or personal history presented with a severe hemorrhagic syndrome made of very abundant metrorrhagia with multiple compressive cervical hematomas, associated with pulmonary embolism and thrombosis. of the right external iliac vein. On the biological assessment, the patient presented with an undetectable PT with a factor VII titer less than 6%. The hemorrhagic syndrome was aggravated by infusions of activated factor VII (FVIIa) with the appearance of hemoptysis and hematomas in all four limbs. Etiological assessment concluded the presence of anti-factor VII autoantibodies as well as circulating lupus anticoagulant. Other antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) antibodies as well as antibodies against other hemostasis factors were absent. A treatment combining corticosteroid therapy (1mg per kg per day of prednisone) and Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (3g) was initiated. Faced with the persistence of the hemorrhagic syndrome, rituximab was administered according to the rheumatological protocol (1g on D1 and 1g on D15). Metrorrhagia improved initially but recurred with the resumption of menstruation with a drop in hemoglobin from 9 to 7 g/dl. Plasmapheresis sessions were attempted but thromboses on the catheters occurred each time. Immunoglobulin (IVIg) courses were administered. No anticoagulant was administered. TP increased to 23%. Levels of neutralizing antibodies fell from 512 to 2 IBU at the last follow-up at five months from the bleeding event. The circulating lupus anticoagulant was present on the follow-up test after 12 weeks, thus confirming the diagnosis of APS. Conclusion Our patient presents an extremely rare case of acquired haemophilia. The combination of corticosteroid therapy, conventional and biological immunosupressives, IVIG and plasmapheresis saved the patient. In the absence of consensus on the treatment, it remains adapted according to the severity of the haemorrhagic syndrome and the associated comorbidities.

                <p>by Thomas Williams, James M. McCaw, James M. Osborne</p>

The role of direct cell–to–cell spread in viral infections—where virions spread between host and susceptible cells without needing to be secreted into the extracellular environment—has come to be understood as essential to the dynamics of medically significant viruses like hepatitis C and influenza. Recent work in both the experimental and mathematical modelling literature has attempted to quantify the prevalence of cell–to–cell infection compared to the conventional free virus route using a variety of methods and experimental data. However, estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and moreover rely on data collected by inhibiting one mode of infection by either chemical or physical factors, which may influence the other mode of infection to an extent which is difficult to quantify. In this work, we conduct a simulation–estimation study to probe the practical identifiability of the proportion of cell–to–cell infection, using two standard mathematical models and synthetic data that would likely be realistic to obtain in the laboratory. We show that this quantity cannot be estimated using non–spatial data alone, and that the collection of a data which describes the spatial structure of the infection is necessary to infer the proportion of cell–to–cell infection. Our results provide guidance for the design of relevant experiments and mathematical tools for accurately inferring the prevalence of cell–to–cell infection in <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> contexts.

                <p>by Rikesh M. Rajani, Robert Ellingford, Mariam Hellmuth, Samuel S. Harris, Orjona S. Taso, David Graykowski, Francesca Kar Wey Lam, Charles Arber, Emre Fertan, John S. H. Danial, Matthew Swire, Marcus Lloyd, Tatiana A. Giovannucci, Mathieu Bourdenx, David Klenerman, Robert Vassar, Selina Wray, Carlo Sala Frigerio, Marc Aurel Busche</p>

Reduction of amyloid beta (Aβ) has been shown to be effective in treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the underlying assumption that neurons are the main source of pathogenic Aβ is untested. Here, we challenge this prevailing belief by demonstrating that oligodendrocytes are an important source of Aβ in the human brain and play a key role in promoting abnormal neuronal hyperactivity in an AD knock-in mouse model. We show that selectively suppressing oligodendrocyte Aβ production improves AD brain pathology and restores neuronal function in the mouse model in vivo. Our findings suggest that targeting oligodendrocyte Aβ production could be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating AD.

Awards can propel academic careers. They also reflect the culture and values of the scientific community. But do awards incentivize greater transparency, inclusivity, and openness in science? Our cross-disciplinary survey of 222 awards for the “best” journal articles across all 27 SCImago subject areas revealed that journals and learned societies administering such awards generally publish little detail on their procedures and criteria. Award descriptions were brief, rarely including contact details or information on the nominations pool. Nominations of underrepresented groups were not explicitly encouraged, and concepts that align with Open Science were almost absent from the assessment criteria. At the same time, 10% of awards, especially the recently established ones, tended to use article-level impact metrics. USA-affiliated researchers dominated the winner’s pool (48%), while researchers from the Global South were uncommon (11%). Sixty-one percent of individual winners were men. Overall, Best Paper awards miss the global calls for greater transparency and equitable access to academic recognition. We provide concrete and implementable recommendations for scientific awards to improve the scientific recognition system and incentives for better scientific practice.

Miq as a potential antiviral agent for Newcastle disease [version 8; peer review: 2 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent evidence suggests that some flavonoid compounds obtained from crude methanol extract of mistletoe leaves (Dendrophthoe pentandra L. Miq), also known as Benalu Duku (BD), have antimicrobial effects. Thus, the plant has the potential to eliminate viruses that may cause outbreaks in chicken farms. This study aimed to prove the in vitro ability of flavonoid compounds, namely quercetin-like compounds (QLCs), to eliminate field viruses, specifically the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Methods This research was performed in two stages. An in vitro test was used with a post-test of the control groups designed at a significance of 0.05. BD leaves (5 kg) were extracted using a maceration method with methanol and then separated into hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions. The final extracted products were separated using semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain QLCs. The QLCs were identified and compared with quercetin using HPLC, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The activity of QLCs was tested in vitro against the NDV at a virulence titter of 10−5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. Results Solutions of 0.05% (w/v) QLCs were discovered to have antiviral activity against NDVs, with an average cytopathogenic effect antigenicity at a 10−5 dilution (p<0.05). Conclusions QLCs from flavonoids from the leaves of BD have in vitro antiviral bioactivity against NDV at a virulence titter of 10-5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. QLCs may have the potential to be developed as medicinal compounds for the treatment of other human or animal viral infections.

                Background Malnourished pregnant women are at increased risk of micronutrient deficiency. We assessed the vitamin B12 status in both malnourished and normally nourished pregnant women and their neonates. Additionally, we studied the association between maternal B12 levels, cord B12 levels and neonatal anthropometry. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 63 malnourished and 63 normally nourished mothers and neonates. Maternal and cord blood samples were collected at the time of delivery for estimation of vitamin B12 levels. Maternal and cord vitamin B12 levels were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Neonatal anthropometry was correlated with maternal and cord B12 levels using Spearman’s correlation. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results Mean maternal age was 26.58 yrs. The median cord B12 levels were lower than the maternal B12 levels. Maternal B12 levels showed a strong positive correlation with cord B12 levels (rho = 0.879; p < 0.001). Maternal (p < 0.001) and cord (p < 0.001) vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower in the malnourished group than in the normally nourished group. In malnourished group, 66.8% mothers and 95.2% neonates were Vitamin B12 deficient, whereas 1.5% mothers and 4.7% neonates were vitamin B12 deficient in normally nourished group. In the malnourished group, maternal B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight (rho 0.363, p = 0.003) and length (rho 0.330, p =0.008), whereas cord B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight in the normally nourished group. (rho 0.277 p= 0.028) Conclusion High rates of vitamin B12 deficiency were observed in malnourished mothers and neonates. There was a positive correlation between birth weight, length, and maternal vitamin B12 levels in malnourished mothers. These findings emphasize the need to address maternal malnutrition and vitamin B12 deficiency to improve neonatal health.

                Gallstone ileus, a rare complication of cholelithiasis, presents significant morbidity and mortality challenges, with no established consensus on optimal management. This study aimed to highlight the complexities surrounding its occurrence and emphasize the need for tailored therapeutic strategies. An 88-year-old female, with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting. Clinical evaluation revealed signs of small-bowel obstruction. Radiological assessments, including Computed Tomography CT) scans, confirmed biliary ileus, showcasing a sizable gallstone causing subacute obstruction. Emergency surgery involving enterolithotomy was performed, successfully addressing the immediate concerns. Postoperative follow-up demonstrated a one-year asymptomatic period, emphasizing the effectiveness of the chosen intervention. Gallstone ileus typically follows acute cholecystitis, leading to gallstone erosion and fistula formation commonly in the duodenum. Diagnosis is challenging because of nonspecific symptoms, necessitating a high index of suspicion. Computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in accurate and rapid diagnoses. This study delves into the intricate details of gallstone ileus presentation, complications, and the debate surrounding optimal surgical management, acknowledging the effectiveness of the two-stage procedure and emerging laparoscopic approaches. This case provides valuable insights into the intricate facets of gallstone ileus and emphasizes the need for individualized treatment strategies. Successful management, as demonstrated in our case, underscores the importance of considering patient-specific factors when choosing between the surgical approaches. This study supports recent reports advocating for laparoscopic interventions, encouraging further exploration of evolving therapeutic modalities for gallstone ileus.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Multiple cortical motor areas are critically involved in the voluntary control of discrete movement (e.g., reaching) and gait. Here, we outline experimental findings in nonhuman primates with clinical reports and research in humans that explain characteristic movement control mechanisms in the primary, supplementary, and presupplementary motor areas, as well as in the dorsal premotor area. We then focus on single-neuron activity recorded while monkeys performed motor sequences consisting of multiple discrete movements, and we consider how area-specific control mechanisms may contribute to the performance of complex movements. Following this, we explore the motor areas in cats that we have considered as analogs of those in primates based on similarities in their cortical surface topology, anatomic connections, microstimulation effects, and activity patterns. Emphasizing that discrete movement and gait modification entail similar control mechanisms, we argue that single-neuron activity in each area of the cat during gait modification is compatible with the function ascribed to the activity in the corresponding area in primates, recorded during the performance of discrete movements. The findings that demonstrate the premotor areas’ contribution to locomotion, currently unique to the cat model, should offer highly valuable insights into the control mechanisms of locomotion in primates, including humans.

                Background There have been significant changes in the lifestyles of individuals in the past few decades, which has led to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Both smoking and chewing forms of tobacco are highly prevalent, especially in India, and are implicated as causes of diseases, including oropharyngeal carcinomas. Effective tobacco cessation techniques and sources can help overcome addiction and reduce the disease burden in society. The aim was to evaluate the quality and readability of contents of various sources on an internet website about tobacco cessation. Objectives i) To evaluate the readability of internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests and the quality of internet content (Google) by using the JAMA benchmark, HONcode and DISCERN questionnaire. Methods A content review was employed to screen the content of the Google search engine for educational tobacco cessation websites, and the top 50 websites were selected according to criteria and reviewed by two reviewers. The readability of the internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation was evaluated using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests. The quality of the screened sites was evaluated by using the JAMA benchmark, HONcode and DISCERN questionnaire, and the readability and quality of the screened websites were correlated using the above instruments. Results FK readability ease was found to be 49% standard and 30% easy. The FK grade test found that 33% of the content could be easily understood by < 5th grade. All 4 JAMA benchmarks were met by 23% of websites, and authorship was the least fulfilled criterion. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association between FK ease score and FK grade score. Conclusions The Read-ability Ease and Read-ability Grade Levels of the websites related to tobacco cessation were not standard, and few websites fulfilled the JAMA benchmarks and had HONcode certification.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The vagus nerve, as an important component of the gut-brain axis, plays a crucial role in the communication between the gut and brain. It influences food intake, fat metabolism, and emotion by regulating the gut-brain axis, which is closely associated with the development of gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and metabolism-related disorders. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the vagus-mediated regulatory pathway, highlighting its profound implications in the development of many diseases. Here, we summarize the latest advancements in vagus-mediated gut-brain pathways and the novel interventions targeting the vagus nerve. This will provide valuable insights for future research on treatment of obesity and gastrointestinal and depressive disorders based on vagus nerve stimulation.

     alt="Clinicopathologic Dissociation: Robust Lafora Body Accumulation in Malin KO Mice Without Observable Changes in Home-Cage Behavior"/>
<p>One-year-old mice with deletions of <i>malin</i> display robust Lafora body accumulation, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and evidence of cortical circuit dysfunction. Despite these pathologies, malin KO mice exhibited no abnormalities in a wide range of home-cage neurobehavioral endpoints, pointing to a broad window for intervention in this otherwise fatal form of epilepsy. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Lafora disease (LD) is a syndrome of progressive myoclonic epilepsy and cumulative neurocognitive deterioration caused by recessively inherited genetic lesions of EPM2A (laforin) or NHLRC1 (malin). Neuropsychiatric symptomatology in LD is thought to be directly downstream of neuronal and astrocytic polyglucosan aggregates, termed Lafora bodies (LBs), which faithfully accumulate in an age-dependent manner in all mouse models of LD. In this study, we applied home-cage monitoring to examine the extent of neurobehavioral deterioration in a model of malin-deficient LD as a means to identify robust preclinical endpoints that may guide the selection of novel genetic treatments. At 6 weeks, ∼6–7 months, and ∼12 months of age, malin-deficient mice (“KO”) and wild-type (WT) littermates underwent a standardized home-cage behavioral assessment designed to non-obtrusively appraise features of rest/arousal, consumptive behaviors, risk aversion, and voluntary wheel-running. At all timepoints, and over a range of metrics that we report transparently, WT and KO mice were essentially indistinguishable. In contrast, within WT mice compared across the same timepoints, we identified age-related nocturnal hypoactivity, diminished sucrose preference, and reduced wheel-running. Neuropathological examinations in subsets of the same mice revealed expected age-dependent LB accumulation, gliosis, and microglial activation in cortical and subcortical brain regions. At 12 months of age, despite the burden of neocortical LBs, we did not identify spontaneous seizures during an electroencephalographic (EEG) survey, and KO and WT mice exhibited similar spectral EEG features. However, in an in vitro assay of neocortical function, paroxysmal bursts of network activity (UP states) in KO slices were more prolonged at 3 and 6 months of age, but similar to WT at 12 months. KO mice displayed a distinct response to pentylenetetrazole, with a greater incidence of clonic seizures and a more pronounced postictal suppression of movement, feeding, and drinking behavior. Together, these results highlight the clinicopathologic dissociation in a mouse model of LD, where the accrual of LBs may latently modify cortical circuit function and seizure threshold without clinically meaningful changes in home-cage behavior. Our findings allude to a delay between LB accumulation and neurobehavioral decline in LD: one that may provide a window for treatment, and whose precise duration may be difficult to ascertain within the typical lifespan of a laboratory mouse.</p>

                <p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) safety and efficacy in patients with large core infarcts receiving oral anticoagulants (OAC) are unknown. In the SELECT2 trial (NCT03876457), 29 of 180 (16%; vitamin K antagonists 15, direct OACs 14) EVT, and 18 of 172 (10%; vitamin K antagonists 3, direct OACs 15) medical management (MM) patients reported OAC use at baseline. EVT was not associated with better clinical outcomes in the OAC group (EVT 6 [4–6] vs MM 5 [4–6], adjusted generalized odds ratio 0.89 [0.53–1.50]), but demonstrated significantly better outcomes in patients without OAC (EVT 4 [3–6] vs MM 5 [4–6], adjusted generalized odds ratio 1.87 [1.45–2.40], <i>p</i> = 0.02). The OAC group had higher comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation (70% vs 17%), congestive heart failure (28% vs 10%), and hypertension (87% vs 72%), suggesting increased frailty. However, the results were consistent after adjustment for these comorbidities, and was similar regardless of the type of OACs used. Whereas any hemorrhage rates were higher in the OAC group receiving EVT (86% in OAC vs 70% in no OAC), no parenchymal hemorrhage or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were observed with OAC use in both the EVT and MM arms. Although we did not find evidence that the effect was due to excess hemorrhage or confounded by underlying cardiac disease or older age, OAC use alone should not exclude patients from receiving EVT. Baseline comorbidities and ischemic injury extent should be considered while making individualized treatment decisions. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The telencephalon of reptiles has been suggested to be the key to understanding the evolution of the forebrain. Nevertheless, a meaningful framework to organize the telencephalon in any reptile has, with rare exception, yet to be presented. To address this gap in knowledge, the telencephalon was investigated in two species of crocodiles. A variety of morphological stains were used to examine tissue in transverse, horizontal, and sagittal planes of sections. Besides providing a description of individual nuclei, brain parts were organized based on two features. One was related to two fixed, internal structures: the lateral ventricle and the dorsal medullary lamina. The other was the alignment of neurons into either layers, cortex, or not, nucleus. Viewed from this perspective, all structures, with limited exceptions, could be accurately placed within the telencephalon regardless of the plane of section. Furthermore, this framework can be applied to other reptiles. A further extension of this scheme suggests that all structures in the telencephalon could be grouped into one of two categories: pallial or basal.</p>

                Lin et al. demonstrate that PAI-1-suppressed genes DKK1, SPARC, and TIMP2 exhibit increased promoter methylation in obesity-driven endometrial cancer. This suppression event induces β-catenin uncoupling from transmembrane integrins, which triggers inside-out signaling. Consequently, integrin engagement with epithelial-deposited ECM leads to extensive COL1 fibril branching conducive to neoplastic transformation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96507">The mechanism of mammalian proton-coupled peptide transporters</a></h4>

              
                Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are of great pharmaceutical interest owing to their promiscuous substrate binding site that has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2. Nevertheless, these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling, while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here, we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces. By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underpining secondary active transport in POTs. This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.

                During locomotion, soft-bodied terrestrial animals solve complex control problems at substrate interfaces, but our understanding of how they achieve this without rigid components remains incomplete. Here, we develop new all-optical methods based on optical interference in a deformable substrate to measure ground reaction forces (GRFs) with micrometre and nanonewton precision in behaving <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. Combining this with a kinematic analysis of substrate-interfacing features, we shed new light onto the biomechanical control of larval locomotion. Crawling in larvae measuring ~1 mm in length involves an intricate pattern of cuticle sequestration and planting, producing GRFs of 1–7 µN. We show that larvae insert and expand denticulated, feet-like structures into substrates as they move, a process not previously observed in soft-bodied animals. These ‘protopodia’ form dynamic anchors to compensate counteracting forces. Our work provides a framework for future biomechanics research in soft-bodied animals and promises to inspire improved soft-robot design.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93804">Aberrant hippocampal Ca2+ microwaves following synapsin-dependent adeno-associated viral expression of Ca2+ indicators</a></h4>

              
                Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP are invaluable tools in neuroscience to monitor neuronal activity using optical imaging. The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line, and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adeno-associated viral (AAV) transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7, or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer in a titre-dependent fashion. Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 wk after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 wk. The phenomenon was robust and observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves depend on the promoter and viral titre of the GECI, density of expression, as well as the targeted brain region. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artefact. The results show that commonly used Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator AAV transduction procedures can produce artefactual Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Our aim is to raise awareness in the field of these artefactual transduction-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves, and we provide a potential solution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91783">circHIPK3 nucleates IGF2BP2 and functions as a competing endogenous RNA</a></h4>

              
                Circular RNAs represent a class of endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression and influence cell biological decisions with implications for the pathogenesis of several diseases. Here, we disclose a novel gene-regulatory role of circHIPK3 by combining analyses of large genomics datasets and mechanistic cell biological follow-up experiments. Using time-course depletion of circHIPK3 and specific candidate RNA-binding proteins, we identify several perturbed genes by RNA sequencing analyses. Expression-coupled motif analyses identify an 11-mer motif within circHIPK3, which also becomes enriched in genes that are downregulated upon circHIPK3 depletion. By mining eCLIP datasets and combined with RNA immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that the 11-mer motif constitutes a strong binding site for IGF2BP2 in bladder cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that circHIPK3 can sequester IGF2BP2 as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), leading to target mRNA stabilization. As an example of a circHIPK3-regulated gene, we focus on the <i>STAT3</i> mRNA as a specific substrate of IGF2BP2 and validate that manipulation of circHIPK3 regulates IGF2BP2-<i>STAT3</i> mRNA binding and, thereby, <i>STAT3</i> mRNA levels. Surprisingly, absolute copy number quantifications demonstrate that IGF2BP2 outnumbers circHIPK3 by orders of magnitude, which is inconsistent with a simple 1:1 ceRNA hypothesis. Instead, we show that circHIPK3 can nucleate multiple copies of IGF2BP2, potentially via phase separation, to produce IGF2BP2 condensates. Our results support a model where a few cellular circHIPK3 molecules can induce IGF2BP2 condensation, thereby regulating key factors for cell proliferation.

">Noradrenergic and Dopaminergic Neural Correlates of Trait Anxiety: Unveiling the Impact of Maladaptive Emotion Regulation</a></h4>

              
                Maladaptive emotion regulation plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of elevated anxiety levels, both in patients and in individuals with subclinical symptomatology. While pharmacological treatments for anxiety target the emotion dysregulation through dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the current study depicts the association of these neuromodulatory systems' resting-state functioning with trait-anxiety, investigating the role of maladaptive emotion regulation. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) were obtained from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), locus coeruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe, and correlated with trait-anxiety and self-reported maladaptive emotion regulation (N = 60). Trait-anxiety was positively associated with LC's fALFF and negatively with VTA's whole-brain rs-FC with the left inferior parietal lobule (L-IPL) and the left superior frontal gyrus (L-SFG). Maladaptive emotion regulation was negatively associated with VTA's rs-FC with these regions, with trait-anxiety fully mediating this association. VTA connectivity with the frontal region, but not parietal, positively predicted its amplitude of neural oscillations, an effect that was paralleled by stronger frontal dopaminergic innervation. In conclusion, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems appear to contribute differently to subclinical anxiety. While noradrenaline likely acts through a more general mechanism, the dopaminergic dysconnectivity with the frontoparietal control network may act as one of the mechanisms of maladaptive emotion regulation, informing the models on the disorder development.

">Parabrachial CGRP neurons modulates conditioned active defensive behavior under a naturalistic threat</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm, activation of CGRP neurons can trigger either freezing or fleeing defensive behavior, depending on the circumstances. However, the majority of previous findings have reported that CGRP neurons modulate only freezing behavior. Thus, the present study examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior, using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice in fear conditioning. Our electrophysiological results showed that CGRP neurons encoded the intensity of various unconditioned stimuli (US) through different firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic and behavioral results revealed that activation of CGRP neurons in the presence of the chasing robot intensified fear memory and significantly elevated conditioned fleeing behavior during recall of an aversive memory. Animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited significantly low levels of fleeing behavior even when the robot was set to be more threatening during conditioning. Our findings expand the known role of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a crucial part of the brain's alarm system, showing they can regulate not only passive but also active defensive behaviors.

">Different timescales of neural activities introduce different representations of task-relevant information</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings indicate significant variations in neuronal activity timescales across and within cortical areas, yet their impact on cognitive processing remains inadequately understood. This study explores the role of neurons with different timescales in information processing within the neural system, particularly during the execution of context-dependent working memory tasks. Especially, we hypothesized that neurons with varying timescales contribute distinctively to task performance by forming diverse representations of task-relevant information. To test this, the model was trained to perform a context-dependent working memory task with a machine-learning technique. Results revealed that slow timescale neurons maintained stable representations of contextual information throughout the trial, whereas fast timescale neurons responded transiently to immediate stimuli. This differentiation in neuronal function suggests a fundamental role for timescale diversity in supporting the neural system's ability to integrate and process information dynamically. Our findings contribute to understanding how neural timescale diversity underpins cognitive flexibility and task-specific information processing, highlighting implications for both theoretical neuroscience and practical applications in designing artificial neural networks.

">A Hypothalamic Circuit that Modulates Feeding and Parenting Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Across mammalian species, new mothers undergo considerable behavioral changes to nurture their offspring and meet the caloric demands of milk production. While many neural circuits underlying feeding and parenting behaviors are well characterized, it is unclear how these different circuits interact and adapt during lactation. Here, we characterized the transcriptomic changes in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the mouse hypothalamus in response to lactation and hunger. Furthermore, we showed that heightened appetite in lactating mice was accompanied by increased activity of hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the ARC. To assess the strength of hunger versus maternal drives, we designed a conflict assay where female mice chose between a food source or a chamber containing pups and nesting material. Although food-deprived lactating mothers prioritized parenting over feeding, hunger reduced the duration and disrupted the sequences of parenting behaviors in both lactating and virgin females. We discovered that ARCAgRP neurons directly inhibit bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS3) neurons in the MPOA, a population that governs both parenting and satiety. Selective activation of this ARCAgRP to MPOABRS3 circuit shifted behaviors from parenting to food-seeking. Thus, hypothalamic networks are modulated by physiological states and work antagonistically during the prioritization of competing motivated behaviors.

">Enhanced restoration of visual code after targeting on bipolar cells compared to retinal ganglion cells with optogenetic therapy</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetic therapy is a promising vision restoration method where light sensitive opsins are introduced to the surviving inner retina following photoreceptor degeneration. The cell type targeted for opsin expression will likely influence the quality of restored vision. However, a like-for-like pre-clinical comparison of visual responses evoked following equivalent opsin expression in the two major targets, ON bipolar (ON BCs) or retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), is absent. We address this deficit by comparing stimulus-response characteristics at single unit resolution in retina and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of retinally degenerate mice genetically engineered to express the opsin ReaChR in Grm6- or Brn3c-expressing cells (ON BC vs RGCs respectively). For both targeting strategies, we find ReaChR-evoked responses have equivalent sensitivity and can encode contrast across different background irradiances. Compared to ON BCs, targeting RGCs decreased response reproducibility and resulted in more stereotyped responses with reduced diversity in response polarity, contrast sensitivity and temporal frequency tuning. Recording ReaChR-driven responses in visually intact retinas confirmed that RGC-targeted ReaChR expression disrupts visual feature selectivity of individual RGCs. Our data show that while both approaches restore visual responses with impressive fidelity, ON BC targeting produces a richer visual code better approaching that of wildtype mice.

">Bayesian Prior Uncertainty and Surprisal Elicit Distinct Neural Patterns During Sound Localization in Dynamic Environments</a></h4>

              
                Estimating the location of a stimulus is a key function in sensory processing, and widely considered to result from the integration of prior information and sensory input according to Bayesian principles. A deviation of sensory input from the prior elicits surprisal, depending on the uncertainty of the prior. While this mechanism is increasingly understood in the visual domain, much less is known about its implementation in audition, especially regarding spatial localization. Here, we combined human EEG with computational modeling to study auditory spatial inference in a noisy, volatile environment and analyzed behavioral and neural patterns associated with prior uncertainty and surprisal. First, our results demonstrate that participants indeed used prior information during periods of stable environmental statistics, but showed evidence of surprisal and discarded prior information following environmental changes. Second, we observed distinct EEG activity patterns associated with prior uncertainty and surprisal in both the time- and time-frequency domain, which are in line with previous studies using visual tasks. Third, these EEG activity patterns were predictive of our participants' sound localization error, response uncertainty, and prior bias on a trial-by-trial basis. In summary, our work provides novel behavioral and neural evidence for Bayesian inference during dynamic auditory localization.

">Sympathetic Nervous System Overactivation Induces Colonic Eosinophil-Associated Microinflammation and Contributes to the Pathogenesis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Mucosal microinflammation is a characteristic clinical manifestation of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and its symptoms are often triggered by psychological stress. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the impact of early life stress-associated dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) on mucosal immune changes in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and its contribution to IBS pathogenesis. Design: We utilised a traditional animal model of IBS with maternal separation (MS) and evaluated colorectal hypersensitivity, immune alterations, and SNS activity in adult rats with MS. We conducted a series of experiments to manipulate peripheral SNS activity pharmacologically and chemogenetically to explore the interaction between SNS activity and GI events. Results: The MS-induced IBS model exhibited visceral hypersensitivity and eosinophilic infiltration in the colonic mucosa, along with SNS overactivation. Degeneration of the SNS using 6-OHDA neurotoxin decreased eosinophil infiltration and visceral hypersensitivity in the MS model. Notably, specific chemogenetic activation of the peripheral SNS induced eosinophil infiltration in the intestinal mucosa through the noradrenergic signalling-mediated release of eotaxin-1 from mesenchymal cells. Conclusion: This study highlights the critical role of SNS overactivation in eotaxin-1-driven eosinophil infiltration in the colon, leading to the development of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS. The results provide important insights into the mechanistic links among increased sympathetic activity, mucosal microinflammation, and visceral hypersensitivity in individuals with IBS, suggesting potential therapeutic approaches.

">Brief sleep disruption alters synaptic structures among hippocampal and neocortical somatostatin-expressing interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Brief sleep loss can disrupt cognition, including information processing in neocortex and hippocampus. Recent studies have identified alterations in synaptic structures of principal neurons within these circuits. However, while in vivo recording and bioinformatic data suggest that inhibitory interneurons are more strongly affected by sleep loss, it is unclear how sleep and sleep deprivation affect interneuron synapses. Recent data suggest that activity among hippocampal somatostatin-expressing (SST+) interneurons is selectively increased by experimental sleep disruption. We used Brainbow 3.0 to label SST+ interneurons in the dorsal hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and visual cortex of SST-CRE transgenic mice, then compared synaptic structures in labeled neurons after a 6-h period of ad lib sleep, or gentle handling sleep deprivation (SD) starting at lights on. We find that dendritic spine density among SST+ interneurons in both hippocampus and neocortex was altered in a subregion-specific manner, with increased overall and thin spine density in CA1, decreased mushroom spine density in CA3, and decreased overall and stubby spine density in V1 after SD. Spine size also changed significantly after SD, with dramatic increases in spine volume and surface area in CA3, and small but significant decreases in CA1, PFC and V1. Together, our data suggest that the synaptic connectivity of SST+ interneurons is significantly altered, in a brain region-specific manner, by a few hours of sleep loss. Further, they suggest that sleep loss can disrupt cognition by altering the balance of excitation and inhibition in hippocampal and neocortical networks.

">The Unity/Diversity Framework of Executive Functions in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                Executive functions (EFs), encompassing inhibition, shifting, and updating as three fundamental subdomains, are typically characterized by a unity/diversity construct. However, given the dedifferentiation trend observed in aging, it remains controversial whether the construct of EFs in older adults becomes unidimensional or maintains unity/diversity. This study aims to explore and validate the construct of EFs in older adults. At the behavioral level, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis on data from 222 older adults who completed six tasks specifically targeting inhibition, shifting, and updating. One unidimensional model and six unity/diversity models of EFs were evaluated. Our results indicated that the EFs of older adults demonstrated greater congruence with the unity/diversity construct. At neural level, thirty older adults completed three thematically consistent fMRI tasks, targeting three subdomains of EFs respectively. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that rostromedia prefrontal cortex robustly showed similar neural representation across different tasks (unity). Meanwhile, the three EF domains were encoded by distinct global neural representation and the lateral prefrontal cortex play a crucial role in classification (diversity). These findings underscore the unity/diversity framework of EFs in older adults and offer important insights for designing interventions aimed at improving EFs in this population.

">Leveraging multivariate information for community detection in functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Embedded in neuroscience is the concept that brain functioning is underpinned by specialized systems whose integration enables cognition and behavior. Modeling the brain as a network of interconnected brain regions, allowed us to capitalize on network science tools and identify these segregated systems (modules, or communities) by optimizing the weights of pairwise connections within them. However, just knowing how strongly two brain areas are connected does not paint the whole picture. Brain dynamics is also engendered by interactions involving more areas at the same time, namely, higher-order interactions. In this paper, we propose a community detection algorithm that accounts for higher-order interactions and finds modules of brain regions whose brain activity is maximally redundant. Compared to modules identified with methods based on bivariate interactions, our redundancy-dominated modules are more symmetrical between the hemispheres, they overlap with canonical systems at the level of the sensory cortex, but describe a new organization of the transmodal cortex. By detecting redundant modules across spatial scales, we identified a sweet spot of maximum balance between segregation and integration of information as that scale where redundancy within modules and synergy between modules peaked. Moreover, we defined a local index that distinguishes brain regions in segregators and integrators based on how much they participate in the redundancy of their modules versus the redundancy of the whole system. Finally, we applied the algorithm to a lifespan dataset and tracked how redundant subsystems change across time. The results of this paper serve as educated guesses on how the brain organizes itself into modules accounting for higher-order interactions of its fundamental units, and pave the way for further investigation that could link them to cognition, behavior, and disease.

">The timing of preceding tactile inputs modulates cortical processing</a></h4>

              
                Tactile experiences in the real world are rich in texture and temporal patterns. While the role of texture in driving somatosensory cortical activity is well established, there is emerging evidence that somatosensory activity is sensitive to tactile temporal statistics (i.e., the time intervals that separate stimuli in trains of successive tactile pulses). Cortical processing of tactile pulses may be shaped by preceding pulses, but this influence will vary with inter-stimulus intervals. It is possible that tactile information lingers only briefly in primary somatosensory cortex and will influence processing of the next pulse only at short intervals; in secondary somatosensory cortex it lingers longer, allowing it to shape the processing of even multiple successive pulses over more prolonged intervals. Here we recorded scalp EEG signals from somatosensory cortex in response to a train of tactile pulses presented to the fingertips with varying inter-stimulus intervals spanning 100 to 10,000 ms. We traced cortical tactile processing through its early (<75 ms), intermediate (75 to 150 ms) and late stages (150 to 300 ms). The early and late stages of somatosensory activity were similarly shaped by the preceding pulse; this influence declined with increasing inter-stimulus interval. The intermediate stage of somatosensory activity was sensitive to both the previous and the penultimate pulses, a sensitivity that was again modulated by their temporal dynamics. Our findings suggest that somatosensory cortex integrates complex temporal patterns during its intermediary processing stages, allowing previous and even penultimate stimuli to modulate ongoing processing of current stimuli.

">Nanoscale organization is changed in native, surface AMPARs by mouse brain region and tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) on neuronal plasma membranes are correlated with learning and memory. Using a unique labeling and super-resolution imaging, we have visualized the nanoscale synaptic and extra-synaptic organization of native surface AMPARs for the first time in mouse brain slices as a function of brain region and tauopathy. We find that the fraction of surface AMPARs organized in synaptic clusters is two-times smaller in the hippocampus compared to the motor and somatosensory cortex. In 6 months old PS19 model of tauopathy, synaptic and extrasynaptic distributions are disrupted in the hippocampus but not in the cortex. Thus, this optimized super-resolution imaging tool allows us to observe synaptic deterioration at the onset of tauopathy before apparent neurodegeneration.

">Secretome analysis of oligodendrocytes and precursors reveals their roles as contributors to the extracellular matrix and potential regulators of inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes form myelin that ensheaths axons and accelerates the speed of action potential propagation. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferate and replenish oligodendrocytes. While the myelin-forming role of oligodendrocytes and OPCs is well-established, potential additional roles of these cells are yet to be fully explored. Here, we analyzed the secreted proteome of oligodendrocytes and OPCs in vitro to determine whether these cell types are major sources of secreted proteins in the central nervous system (CNS). Interestingly, we found that both oligodendrocytes and OPCs secret various extracellular matrix proteins. Considering the critical role of neuroinflammation in neurological disorders, we evaluated the responses and potential contributions of oligodendrocytes and OPCs to this process. By characterizing the secreted proteomes of these cells after pro-inflammatory cytokine treatment, we discovered the secretion of immunoregulators such as C2 and B2m. This finding sheds new light on the hitherto underappreciated role of oligodendrocytes and OPCs in actively modulating neuroinflammation. Our study provides a comprehensive and unbiased proteomic dataset of proteins secreted by oligodendrocyte and OPC under both physiological and inflammatory conditions. It revealed the potential of these cells to secrete matrix and signaling molecules, highlighting their multifaceted function beyond their conventional myelin-forming roles.

">Neural microstates in real-world behaviour captured on the smartphone</a></h4>

              
                Microstates are periods of quasi-stability in large-scale neural networks, and they are ubiquitous spanning sleep, rest and behaviour. One possibility is that the temporal and spatial features of these states vary from person to person contributing to inter-individual behavioural differences. Another possibility is that the microstates support momentary behavioural needs and as a result their properties may vary with behavioural fluctuations in the same person. Here, we leverage the history of smartphone touchscreen interaction dynamics and combined smartphone and EEG recordings (N = 61), to address if and how microstates contribute to real-world behaviour. We find that microstates measured when at rest correlated with the history (~30 days) of smartphone interaction dynamics captured in the real world, indicating their role in the behaviour. During smartphone behaviour, the configuration of microstates varied over time. However, this variance was largely unrelated to the rich behavioural dynamics, as in similar temporal and spatial features were observed during rapid and slow smartphone interactions. We show that in the real world microstates do not respond to the fluctuations of the ongoing behaviour. Still, as microstates measured at rest are correlated to the inter-individual behavioural differences captured on the smartphone, we propose that microstates exert a top-down influence to broadly orchestrate real-world behaviour.

">Phosphorylation at serine 214 correlates with tau seeding activity in an age-dependent manner in two mouse models for tauopathies and is required for tau transsynaptic propagation.</a></h4>

              
                Pathological aggregation and propagation of hyperphosphorylated and aberrant forms of tau are critical features of the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. To better understand the correlation between these pathological tau species and disease progression, we profiled the temporal progression of tau seeding activity and the levels of various phospho- and conformational tau species in the brains of two mouse models of human tauopathies. Our findings indicate that tau seeding is an early event that occurs well before the appearance of AT8-positive NFT. Specifically, we observed that tau phosphorylation in serine 214 (pTau-Ser214) positively correlates to tau seeding activity during disease progression in both mouse models. Furthermore, we found that the histopathology of pTau-Ser214 appears much earlier and has a distinct pattern and compartmentalization compared to the pathology of AT8, demonstrating the diversity of tau species within the same region of the brain. Importantly, we also observed that preventing the phosphorylation of tau at Ser214 significantly decreases tau propagation in mouse primary neurons, and seeding activity in a Drosophila model of tauopathy, suggesting a role for this tau phosphorylation in spreading pathological forms of tau. Together, these results suggest that the diverse spectrum of soluble pathological tau species could be responsible for the distinct pathological properties of tau and that it is critical to dissect the nature of the tau seed in the context of disease progression.

">A disinhibitory basal forebrain to cortex projection supports sustained attention</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention, as an essential cognitive faculty governing selective sensory processing, exhibits remarkable temporal fluctuations. However, the underlying neural circuits and computational mechanisms driving moment-to-moment attention fluctuations remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that cortex-projecting basal forebrain parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons (BF-PV) mediate sustained attention in mice performing an attention task. BF-PV activity predicts the fluctuations of attentional performance metrics - reaction time and accuracy - trial-by-trial, and optogenetic activation of these neurons enhances performance. BF-PV neurons also respond to motivationally salient events, such as predictive cues, rewards, punishments, and surprises, which a computational model explains as representing motivational salience for allocating attention over time. Furthermore, we found that BF-PV neurons produce cortical disinhibition by inhibiting cortical PV+ inhibitory neurons, potentially underpinning the observed attentional gain modulation in the cortex. These findings reveal a disinhibitory BF-to-cortex projection that regulates cortical gain based on motivational salience, thereby promoting sustained attention.

">Trait anxiety impairs reciprocity behavior: A multi-modal and computational modeling study</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety significantly impacts reciprocal behavior, crucial for positive social interactions. The neurocomputational mechanisms of anxiety's effects on the core (individual propensity) and peripheral (decision context) factors shaping reciprocity remain unclear. Here, we investigated reciprocity in individuals with low and high trait anxiety using a binary trust game with gain/loss framing, combining computational modeling, eye-tracking, and event-related potentials (ERPs). Our computational model, validated by eye-tracking data, identified four psychological components driving reciprocal behavior: reward, guilt aversion, superiority aversion, and superiority attraction. Regarding the core of reciprocity, trait anxiety diminished both overall reciprocity and specific psychological components like guilt aversion and superiority attraction, irrespective of context. The reduction in guilt aversion was supported by ERP findings showing decreased P2 (selective attention) and increased LPP (emotion regulation) amplitudes in anxious individuals. Regarding the periphery of reciprocity, trait anxiety altered the contextual perception of both superiority aversion and reward. Further, trait anxiety reversed the perception of superiority aversion from gain to loss contexts, a pattern that was linked to the N2 amplitudes (cognitive control). Our findings revealed distinct effects of trait anxiety on core and peripheral factors in reciprocity, offering potential targets for interventions aimed at improving reciprocity in individuals with anxiety disorders.

">Recent odor experience selectively modulates olfactory sensitivity across the glomerular output in the mouse olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Although animals can reliably locate and recognize odorants embedded in complex environments, the neural circuits for accomplishing these tasks remain incompletely understood. Adaptation is likely to be important in this process as it could allow neurons in a brain area to adjust to the broader sensory environment. Adaptive processes must be flexible enough to allow the brain to make dynamic adjustments, while also maintaining sufficient stability such that organisms do not forget important olfactory associations. Processing within the mouse olfactory bulb is likely involved in generating adaptation, although there are conflicting models of how it transforms the glomerular output of the mouse olfactory bulb. Here we performed 2-photon Ca2+ imaging in awake mice to determine the time course of recovery from adaptation, and whether it acts broadly or selectively acts across the glomerular population. Individual glomerular responses, as well as the overall population odor representation was similar across imaging sessions. However, odor-concentration pairings presented with interstimulus intervals upwards of 30-s could evoke heterogeneous adaptation across the glomerular population. This adaptation was strongest at higher concentrations, unrelated to variations in respiration, and measurements from olfactory receptor neuron glomeruli indicate that it is unlikely to be inherited from the periphery. Our results indicate that the olfactory bulb output reliably transmits stable odor representations, although dynamic processes exist by which recent odor exposure can selectively impact odor sensitivity for upwards of 30 seconds. We propose that dynamic adaptation in subsets of glomeruli is necessary for making dynamic adjustments to complex odor environments.

">Stiffness-tunable neurotentacles for minimally invasive implantation and long-term neural activity recordings</a></h4>

              
                Flexible implantable microelectrodes have been demonstrated to exhibit excellent biocompatibility for chronic neural activity recordings. However, the low bending strength of the commonly employed flexible materials presents a significant challenge for probe insertion into the brain. Traditional implantation methods for flexible electrodes generally require additional auxiliary materials or tools, which tend to have a much larger footprint than the probes themselves, greatly increasing the damage to neurons during insertion. Here we have proposed a stiffness-tunable polyimide probe for deep brain implantation, referred to as Neurotentacle, enabled by embedded microchannels in which the liquid pressure is controllable (from 0.1MPa to more than 2.0MPa). During the insertion phase into the brain, the neurotentacle can pose a high stiffness under elevated internal pressure to penetrate the brain tissues without the use of any additional materials or tools. Once the device has been successfully inserted, it can regain its flexibility by reducing the internal pressure. Importantly, the novel multilayer microfabrication process keeps the structural dimensions of the neurotentacle similar to those of a regular flexible probe. Therefore, the neurotentacle can produce an extremely low level of damage to brain tissue during its insertion phase, while extending its long-term biocompatibility and stability, which has been experimentally verified in histological evaluations conducted on both acute and chronic animal specimens. In addition, the chronically implanted neurotentacles enabled stable neural activity recordings in mice with an average spike yield of 96% and an average signal-to-noise ratio of 15.2. The proposed neurotentacle does not necessitate the use of complex devices and its insertion process is straightforward and highly controllable, thus rendering it an appealing technique for minimally invasive implantation and long-term neural recording of flexible electrodes.

">Reduced learning rate and E/I imbalance drive Peripersonal Space boundaries expansion in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Background and Hypothesis: Abnormalities in the encoding of the space close to the body, named peripersonal space (PPS), is thought to play a crucial role in the disruption of the bodily self observed in schizophrenia (SCZ). Empirical evidence indicates a narrower extension of the PPS in SCZ compared to controls but preserved plasticity of the PPS. Computational studies suggest that increased excitation of sensory neurons could explain the smaller PPS observed in SCZ. However, it is unclear why SCZ patients preserve PPS plasticity and how such an excitation imbalance influences learning during the extension of the PPS boundaries. Study Design: We hypothesise that Hebbian plasticity can account for PPS expansion after active tool use training, which occurs in spite of E/I imbalance and reduced synaptic density. Using simulations in a SCZ network model, we explored the effects of such impairments on PPS plasticity and fitted the model to behavioural data before and after a training routine. Study Results: We found that increased excitation of sensory neurons does not impede the expansion of PPS and could explain a sharper demarcation of PPS boundaries after training. In addition, we found that a reduction in the learning rate is required to reproduce the post-training PPS representation of SCZ patients. Conclusion: We discuss how the neural mechanisms behind the plasticity of PPS in the SCZ spectrum are related to the core pathophysiology of the disease.

">Synapse protein signatures in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma predict cognitive maintenance versus decline in Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Rates of cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease (AD) are extremely heterogeneous, with ages of symptom onset ranging from age 40 to 100 years and conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD dementia taking 2 to 20 years. Development of biomarkers for amyloid-beta (AB) and tau protein aggregates, the hallmark pathologies of AD, have improved patient monitoring/stratification and drug development, but they still only explain 20 to 40% of the variance in cognitive impairment (CI) in AD. To discover additional molecular drivers and biomarkers of AD dementia, we perform cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,416 individuals from six deeply phenotyped prospective AD case-control cohorts. We identify synapse proteins as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of AB; and tau. Using machine learning we derive the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, a robust correlate of CI, which explains 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF PTau181:AB42, 10% beyond tau PET, and 50% beyond CSF NfL in AB positive individuals. We find YWHAG:NPTX2 also increases with normal aging as early as age 20 and increases at a faster rate in APOE4 carriers and autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers. Most notably, YWHAG:NPTX2 positive individuals (top 25th percentile) are 15 times (HR=15.4 [10.6 to 22.2]) more likely to experience cognitive decline over 15 years compared to YWHAG:NPTX2 negative individuals (bottom 25th percentile), and this rises to 19 times (HR=18.9 [10.83 to 32.9]) with additional stratification by AB and phosphorylated tau status. Lastly, we perform plasma proteomics on 4,245 individuals to develop a plasma-based signature of CI which partly recapitulates CSF YWHAG:NPTX2. Overall, our findings underscore CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 and the corresponding plasma signature as robust prognostic biomarkers for AD onset and progression beyond gold-standard biomarkers of AB, tau, and neurodegeneration and implicate synapse dysfunction as a core driver of AD dementia.

">Disposition of the chemosensory neurons in the neurotransmitter-release mutant unc-13</a></h4>

              
                Secretion of neurotransmitters- and neuropeptides-containing vesicles is a regulated process orchestrated by multiple proteins. Of these, mutants, defective in the unc-13 and unc-31 genes, responsible for neurotransmitter and neuropeptide release, respectively, are routinely used to elucidate neural and circuitry functions. While these mutants result in severe functional deficits, their neuroanatomy is assumed to be intact. Here, using C. elegans as the model animal system, we find that the head sensory neurons show aberrant positional layout in neurotransmitter (unc-13), but not in neuropeptide (unc-31), release mutants. This finding suggests that synaptic activity may be important for proper cell migration during neurodevelopment and warrants considering possible anatomical defects when using unc-13 neurotransmitter release mutants.

">Characterizing the heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases through EEG normative modeling</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD) exhibit considerable heterogeneity of functional brain features within patient populations, complicating diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and drug discovery. Here, we use electroencephalography (EEG) and normative modeling to investigate neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms underpinning this heterogeneity. To this aim, we use resting-state EEG activity collected by 14 clinical units, in healthy older persons (n=499) and patients with PD (n=237) and AD (n=197), aged over 40 years old. Spectral and source connectivity analyses of EEG activity provided EEG features for normative modeling and deviation measures in the PD and AD patients. Normative models confirmed significant deviations of the EEG features in PD and AD patients over population norms, characterized by high heterogeneity and frequency-dependence. The percentage of patients with at least one deviating EEG feature was ~30% for spectral measures and ~80% for functional source connectivity. Notably, the spatial overlap of the deviant EEG features did not exceed 60% for spectral analysis and 25% for functional source connectivity analysis. Furthermore, the patient-specific deviations were correlated with relevant clinical measures, such as the UPDRS for PD (=0.24, p=0.025) and the MMSE for AD (=-0.26, p=0.01), indicating that greater deviations from normative EEG features are associated with worsening score values. These results suggest that the deviation percentage from EEG norms may enrich clinical assessment in PD and AD patients at individual levels in the framework of Precision Neurology.

">Neurotoxic Methamphetamine Doses Alter CDCel-1 Levels and Its Interaction with Vesicular Monoamine Transporter-2 in Rat Striatum</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, methamphetamine METH misuse in the US has been rapidly increasing and there is no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for METH use disorder (MUD). In addition to being dependent on the drug, people with MUD develop a variety of neurological problems related to the toxicity of this drug. A variety of molecular mechanisms underlying METH neurotoxicity has been identified, including dysfunction of the neuroprotective protein parkin. However, it is not known whether parkin loss of function within striatal dopaminergic (DAergic) terminals translates into a decrease in DA storage capacity. This study examined the relationship between parkin, its substrate cell division cycle related-1 (CDCrel-1), and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) in METH neurotoxicity in male Sprague Dawley rats. To also assess individual differences in response to METH neurotoxic effects, a large group of rats was treated with binge METH or saline and sacrificed 1h or 24h later. This study is the first to show that binge METH alters the levels and subcellular localization of CDCrel-1 and that CDCrel-1 interacts with VMAT2 and increases its levels at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we found wide individual differences in the responses of measured indices to METH. Proteomic analysis of VMAT-2-associated proteins revealed upregulation of several proteins involved in the exocytosis/endocytosis cycle. The results suggest that at 1h after METH binge, DAergic neurons are engaged in counteracting METH-induced toxic effects, including oxidative stress- and hyperthermia-induced inhibition of synaptic vesicle cycling, with the responses varying between individual rats. Studying CDCrel-1, VMAT2, and other proteins in large groups of outbred rats can help define individual genetic and molecular differences in responses to METH neurotoxicity which, in turn, will aid treating humans suffering from METH use disorder and its neurological consequences.

">Patterns of Ongoing Thought in the Real World and Their Link to Mental Health and Well-Being</a></h4>

              
                The thoughts we experience in daily life have important implications for our health and well-being. However, it is often difficult to measure thoughts patterns outside of laboratory conditions due to concerns about the voracity of measurements taken outside of controlled laboratory conditions. To address this gap in the literature, our study set out to measure patterns of thought as they occur in daily life and assess the robustness of these measures and their associations with traits measurements of health and well-being. A sample of undergraduate participants completed multi-dimensional experience sampling (mDES) surveys eight times per day for five days in daily life. Principal component analysis (PCA) reduced these data to identify the dimensions that explained the patterns of thoughts reported in our study. We used (LMM) modelling to map how these thought patterns relate to the activities taking place, highlighting good consistency within the sample, as well as substantial overlap with prior work. Multiple regression was used to examine the association between patterns of ongoing thought and aspects of mental health and well-being, highlighting a pattern of negative intrusive distraction that had a positive association with anxiety, and a negative association with social well-being. Notably, states of intrusive distraction tended to be most prevalent in solo activities and was relatively suppressed when interacting with other people (either in person or virtually). Our study, therefore, highlights the use of mDES as a tool to understand how thoughts in daily life impact on our mental health and well-being and highlight an important role in social connectedness in the etiology of intrusive thinking.

">ERβ mediates sex-specific protection in the App-NL-G-F mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Menopausal loss of neuroprotective estrogen is thought to contribute to the sex differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation of estrogen receptor beta (ER{beta}) can be clinically relevant since it avoids the negative systemic effects of ER activation. However, very few studies have explored ER{beta}-mediated neuroprotection in AD, and no information on its contribution to the sex differences in AD exists. In the present study we specifically explored the role of ER{beta} in mediating sex-specific protection against AD pathology in the clinically relevant AppNL-G-F knock-in mouse model of amyloidosis, and if surgical menopause (ovariectomy) modulates pathology in this model. We treated male and female AppNL-G-F mice with the selective ER{beta} agonist LY500307 and subset of the females was ovariectomized prior to treatment. Memory performance was assessed and a battery of biochemical assays were used to evaluate amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation. Primary microglial cultures from male and female wild-type and ER{beta}-knockout mice were used to assess ER{beta}'s effect on microglial activation and phagocytosis. We find that ER{beta} activation protects against amyloid pathology and cognitive decline in male and female AppNL-G-F mice. Ovariectomy increased soluble amyloid beta (A{beta}) in cortex and insoluble A{beta} in hippocampus, but had otherwise limited effects on pathology. We further identify that ER{beta} does not alter APP processing, but rather exerts its protection through amyloid scavenging that at least in part is mediated via microglia in a sex-specific manner. Combined, we provide new understanding to the sex differences in AD by demonstrating that ER{beta} protects against AD pathology differently in males and females, warranting reassessment of ER{beta} in combating AD.

                This is a preliminary thesis on Temporal Difference Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (TDSTDP), a variation of STDP that considers dendritic potential. TDSTDP is capable of performing temporal difference (TD) learning without dopamine modulation. Major characteristics of TD learning, including value estimation, value propagation, and temporal shifting of dopamine, are demonstrated in simulations. Additionally, a synaptic calcium model demonstrates its biological plausibility.

">A novel method (RIM-Deep) enhances imaging depth and resolution stability of deep-cleared brain tissue in inverted confocal microscopy</a></h4>

              
                The increasing use of tissue clearing techniques underscores the urgent need for cost-effective and simplified deep imaging methods. While traditional inverted confocal microscopes excel in high-resolution imaging of tissue sections and cultured cells, they face limitations in deep imaging of cleared tissues due to refractive index mismatches between the immersion media of objectives and sample container. To overcome these challenges, the RIM-Deep was developed to significantly improve deep imaging capabilities without compromising the normal function of the confocal microscope. This system facilitates deep immunofluorescence imaging of the prefrontal cortex in cleared macaque tissue, extending imaging depth from 2 mm to 5 mm. Applied to an intact and cleared Thy1-EGFP mouse brain, the system allowed for clear axonal visualization at high imaging depth. Moreover, this advancement enables large-scale, deep 3D imaging of intact tissues. In principle, this concept can be extended to any imaging modality, including existing inverted wide-field, confocal, and two-photon microscopy. This would significantly upgrade traditional laboratory configurations and facilitate the study of connectomics in the brain and other tissues.

                Purpose: To determine the molecular and functional expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in developing and mature dopaminergic amacrine cells (DACs), the sole source of ocular dopamine that plays a vital role in visual function and eye development. Methods: HCN channels are encoded by isoforms 1-4. HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 were immunostained in retinal slices obtained from mice at postnatal day 4 (P4), P8, and P12 as well as in adults. Each HCN channel isoform was also immunostained with tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for DACs, at P12 and adult retinas. Genetically-marked DACs were recorded in flat-mount retina preparation using a whole-cell current-clamp technique. Results: HCN1 was expressed in rods/cones, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at P4, along with bipolar cells by P12. Different from HCN1, HCN2 and HCN4 were each expressed in amacrine cells and RGCs at P4, along with bipolar cells by P8, and in rods/cones by P12. Double immunostaining shows that each of the three isoforms was expressed in approximately half of DACs at P12 but in almost all DACs in adults. Electrophysiology results demonstrate that HCN channel isoforms form functional HCN channels, and the pharmacological blockade of HCN channels reduced the spontaneous firing frequency in most DACs. Conclusions: Each class of retinal neurons may use different isoforms of HCN channels to function during development. HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 form functional HCN channels in DACs, which appears to modulate their spontaneous firing activity.

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disabilities with persistent impairments in cognition, communication, and social behavior. Although environmental factors play a role in ASD etiopathogenesis, a growing body of evidence indicates that ASD is highly inherited. In the last two decades, the dramatic rise in the prevalence of ASD has interested researchers to explore the etiologic role of epigenetic marking and incredibly abnormal DNA methylation. This review aimed to explain the current understanding of the association between changes in DNA methylation signatures and ASD in patients or animal models. We reviewed studies reporting alterations in DNA methylation at specific genes as well as epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). Finally, we hypothesized that specific changes in DNA methylation patterns could be considered a potential biomarker for ASD diagnosis and prognosis and even a target for pharmacological intervention.</p>

                <p>The adult turtle spinal cord can generate multiple kinds of limb movements, including swimming, three forms of scratching, and limb withdrawal (flexion reflex), even without brain input and sensory feedback. There are many multifunctional spinal neurons, activated during multiple motor patterns, and some behaviorally specialized neurons, activated during only one. How do multifunctional and behaviorally specialized neurons each contribute to motor output? We analyzed in vivo intracellular recordings of multifunctional and specialized neurons. Neurons tended to spike in the same phase of the hip-flexor (HF) activity cycle during swimming and scratching, though one preferred opposite phases. During both swimming and scratching, a larger fraction of multifunctional neurons than specialized neurons were highly rhythmic. One group of multifunctional neurons was active during the HF-on phase and another during the HF-off phase. Thus, HF&ndash;extensor alternation may be generated by a subset of multifunctional spinal neurons during both swimming and scratching. Scratch-specialized neurons and flexion reflex-selective neurons may instead trigger their respective motor patterns, by biasing activity of multifunctional neurons. In phase-averaged membrane potentials of multifunctional neurons, trough phases were more highly correlated between swimming and scratching than peak phases, suggesting that rhythmic inhibition plays a greater role than rhythmic excitation. We also provide the first intracellular recording of a turtle swim-specialized neuron: tonically excited during swimming but inactive during scratching and flexion reflex. It displayed an excitatory postsynaptic potential following each swim-evoking electrical stimulus and thus may be an intermediary between reticulospinal axons and the swimming CPG they activate.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0065-24.2024?rss=1">Gaze and Arrows: Does the Gaze-Following Patch in the Posterior Temporal Cortex Differentiate Social and Symbolic Spatial Cues?</a></h4>

              
                <p>The gaze-following patch (GFP) is located in the posterior temporal cortex and has been described as a cortical module dedicated to processing other people's gaze-direction in a domain-specific manner. Thus, it appears to be the neural correlate of Baron-Cohen's eye direction detector (EDD) which is one of the core modules in his mindreading system&mdash;a neurocognitive model for the theory of mind concept. Inspired by Jerry Fodor's ideas on the modularity of the mind, Baron-Cohen proposed that, among other things, the individual modules are domain specific. In the case of the EDD, this means that it exclusively processes eye-like stimuli to extract gaze-direction and that other stimuli, which may carry directional information as well, are processed elsewhere. If the GFP is indeed EDD's neural correlate, it must meet this expectation. To test this, we compared the GFP's BOLD activity during gaze-direction following with the activity during arrow-direction following in the present human fMRI study. Contrary to the expectation based on the assumption of domain specificity, we did not find a differentiation between gaze- and arrow-direction following. In fact, we were not able to reproduce the GFP as presented in the previous studies. A possible explanation is that in the present study&mdash;unlike the previous work&mdash;the gaze stimuli did not contain an obvious change of direction that represented a visual motion. Hence, the critical stimulus component responsible for the identification of the GFP in the previous experiments might have been visual motion.</p>

                <p>by Hsun Chiang, Chih-Ang Chung</p>

Capillary plexus cultivation is crucial in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Theoretical simulations have been conducted to supplement the expensive experimental works. However, the mechanisms connecting mechanical and chemical stimuli remained undefined, and the functions of the different VEGF forms in the culture environment were still unclear. In this paper, we developed a hybrid model for simulating short-term <i>in vitro</i> capillary incubations. We used the Cellular Potts model to predict individual cell migration, morphology change, and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and VEGF transport dynamics. By bridging the mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation in the model, the results showed good agreement between the predicted network topology and experiments, in which elongated cells connected, forming the network cords and round cells gathered, creating cobblestone-like aggregates. The results revealed that the capillary-like networks could develop in high integrity only when the mechanical and chemical couplings worked adequately, with the cell morphology and haptotaxis driven by the soluble and bound forms of VEGF, respectively, functioning simultaneously.

                <p>by Simon K. S. Chu, Kush Narang, Justin B. Siegel</p>

Protein stability plays a crucial role in a variety of applications, such as food processing, therapeutics, and the identification of pathogenic mutations. Engineering campaigns commonly seek to improve protein stability, and there is a strong interest in streamlining these processes to enable rapid optimization of highly stabilized proteins with fewer iterations. In this work, we explore utilizing a mega-scale dataset to develop a protein language model optimized for stability prediction. ESM<sub>therm</sub> is trained on the folding stability of 528k natural and <i>de novo</i> sequences derived from 461 protein domains and can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. We show that a protein language model can be fine-tuned to predict folding stability. ESM<sub>therm</sub> performs reasonably on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. Lastly, we discuss our model’s limitations compared to other state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds. Our results highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature.

                <p>by Florian Borse, Dovydas Kičiatovas, Teemu Kuosmanen, Mabel Vidal, Guillermo Cabrera-Vives, Johannes Cairns, Jonas Warringer, Ville Mustonen</p>

Quantitative understanding of microbial growth is an essential prerequisite for successful control of pathogens as well as various biotechnology applications. Even though the growth of cell populations has been extensively studied, microbial growth remains poorly characterised at the spatial level. Indeed, even isogenic populations growing at different locations on solid growth medium typically show significant location-dependent variability in growth. Here we show that this variability can be attributed to the initial physiological states of the populations, the interplay between populations interacting with their local environment and the diffusion of nutrients and energy sources coupling the environments. We further show how the causes of this variability change throughout the growth of a population. We use a dual approach, first applying machine learning regression models to discover that location dominates growth variability at specific times, and, in parallel, developing explicit population growth models to describe this spatial effect. In particular, treating nutrient and energy source concentration as a latent variable allows us to develop a mechanistic resource consumer model that captures growth variability across the shared environment.
As a consequence, we are able to determine intrinsic growth parameters for each local population, removing confounders common to location-dependent variability in growth. Importantly, our explicit low-parametric model for the environment paves the way for massively parallel experimentation with configurable spatial niches for testing specific eco-evolutionary hypotheses.

                <p>by Yanel E. Bernardi, Estefania Sanchez-Vasquez, Rocío Belén Márquez, Michael L. Piacentino, Hugo Urrutia, Izadora Rossi, Karina L. Alcântara Saraiva, Antonio Pereira-Neves, Marcel I. Ramirez, Marianne E. Bronner, Natalia de Miguel, Pablo H. Strobl-Mazzulla</p>

While interactions between neural crest and placode cells are critical for the proper formation of the trigeminal ganglion, the mechanisms underlying this process remain largely uncharacterized. Here, by using chick embryos, we show that the microRNA (miR)-203, whose epigenetic repression is required for neural crest migration, is reactivated in coalescing and condensing trigeminal ganglion cells. Overexpression of miR-203 induces ectopic coalescence of neural crest cells and increases ganglion size. By employing cell-specific electroporations for either miR-203 sponging or genomic editing using CRISPR/Cas9, we elucidated that neural crest cells serve as the source, while placode cells serve as the site of action for miR-203 in trigeminal ganglion condensation. Demonstrating intercellular communication, overexpression of miR-203 in the neural crest in vitro or in vivo represses an miR-responsive sensor in placode cells. Moreover, neural crest-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), visualized using pHluorin-CD63 vector, become incorporated into the cytoplasm of placode cells. Finally, RT-PCR analysis shows that small EVs isolated from condensing trigeminal ganglia are selectively loaded with miR-203. Together, our findings reveal a critical role in vivo for neural crest-placode communication mediated by sEVs and their selective microRNA cargo for proper trigeminal ganglion formation.

                Background Industry 4.0 is a significant technical revolution that combines big data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems to improve manufacturing productivity. This study investigates the impact of digital trust and sustainable attitude on perceived value and the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. It also examines the moderating role of uncertainty avoidance in these relationships. Methods Data were collected from 189 employees of leading manufacturing companies in Indonesia that are recognized for their Industry 4.0 practices. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology with SmartPLS software to test the proposed hypotheses and explore the moderating effects. Results The findings reveal that both digital trust and sustainable attitude significantly influence perceived value. However, these factors do not directly affect the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship between digital trust and adoption intention. Specifically, in environments with high uncertainty avoidance, digital trust becomes a critical factor influencing the decision to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Conclusions The study provides valuable insights for organizations aiming to implement Industry 4.0 initiatives. It highlights the importance of fostering digital trust and considering cultural dimensions, such as uncertainty avoidance, in their technology adoption strategies.

                Background Coding in medical procedures is crucial for patients, and errors made by hospital administration during the coding process can have an impact on both the financial results and the course of therapy. The present study aims to assess the accuracy of diagnostic and procedural codes as recorded by the hospital’s coders and to also evaluate their impact on the hospital’s revenue. Methods In a local hospital in Najran, Saudi Arabia, a cross-sectional observational analysis was conducted on patients with a clinical coder. The percentage of precision and error following the re-coding of cases was calculated using a statistical analysis. Results Primary diagnosis was incorrectly coded in 57 (26 per cent) records, and secondary diagnosis was incorrectly coded in 21 (9.9 per cent) records. Inaccurate medical labelling has been seen in emergency rooms, operating rooms, and gynaecology facilities. Discussion The percentage of records with the most incorrect coding was found to be 16 (7.5 per cent) in the emergency room, 10 (4.7 per cent) in the surgical clinic, and 5 (2.3 per cent) in the gynaecology/OBS clinic. Six (2.8 per cent) records in the private clinic had inaccurate secondary diagnoses, followed by four (1.9 per cent) and two (1 per cent) records in nephrology. Conclusion The percentage of inaccurate clinical codes in primary diagnoses reached (26.8 per cent) and the percentage of incorrect clinical codes in secondary diagnoses reached (9.9 per cent).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cannabis consumption has increased from 1.5% to 2.5% in Canada between 2012 and 2019. Clinical studies have indicated effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on birth weight, substance use, and neurodevelopmental disorders, but are confounded by several difficult to control variables. Animal models allow for examination of the mechanism of cannabis-induced changes in neurodevelopment and behavior, while controlling dose and timing. Several animal models of prenatal cannabis exposure exist which provide varying levels of construct validity, control of dose, and exposure to maternal stress. Using a voluntary oral consumption model, mouse dams received 5 mg/kg Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) whole cannabis oil in peanut butter daily from gestational day 1 (GD1) to postnatal day 10 (PD10). At GD1, GD18, PD1, PD10, and PD15, maternal plasma was collected; pup brains were collected from GD18 onward. Pup brains had higher levels of THC and cannabidiol at each time point, each of which persisted in maternal plasma and pup brains past the end of treatment (PD15). Male and female adolescent offspring were examined for changes to ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron activity and cocaine-seeking behavior. Prenatal and early postnatal (GD1–PD10) cannabis-exposed male, but not female mice had decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) input, depolarized resting membrane potential, and increased spontaneous firing of VTA dopamine neurons. Cannabis-exposed offspring showed faster decay of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) currents in both sexes. However, no differences in cocaine-seeking behavior were noted. These data characterize a voluntary prenatal cannabis exposure model and demonstrates VTA dopamine neuronal activity is disinhibited in offspring.</p>

                Improvements in DNA sequencing technology are allowing the dramatic increase of whole genome data for a wide variety of species. Such genome sequence data can assist the monitoring of intraspecific genetic diversity, but is often lacking for threatened species. In this project, we focused on the national Red List, a catalog of extinct and threatened species, issued by the Japanese government. We combined the data included in it with the record of genome assembly in NCBI and tabulated the assembly availability of the species in the list. The combined data shows a low percentage (2.1%) of the availability of whole genome sequence data for the taxa ranked on the Japanese Red List as well as a strong bias towards mammals and birds in Animalia and vascular plants in Plantae. Our data presentation highlights potential systematic limitations in genome sequencing (e.g., budget for sequencing large genomes of amphibians) and instructs future policies including which taxon needs more effort for genome sequencing. The resultant tables are available in the original website https://treethinkers.nig.ac.jp/redlist/ and are regularly updated.

<p>Proteoglycans are important multifunctional components of the central and peripheral nervous systems and represent a diverse group of specialized proteins that stabilize and functionalize these tissues.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Central and peripheral nervous system (CNS/PNS) proteoglycans (PGs) have diverse functional roles, this study examined how these control cellular behavior and tissue function. The CNS/PNS extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic, responsive, highly interactive, space-filling, cell supportive, stabilizing structure maintaining tissue compartments, ionic microenvironments, and microgradients that regulate neuronal activity and maintain the neuron in an optimal ionic microenvironment. The CNS/PNS contains a high glycosaminoglycan content (60% hyaluronan, HA) and a diverse range of stabilizing PGs. Immobilization of HA in brain tissues by HA interactive hyalectan PGs preserves tissue hydration and neuronal activity, a paucity of HA in brain tissues results in a pro-convulsant epileptic phenotype. Diverse CS, KS, and HSPGs stabilize the blood–brain barrier and neurovascular unit, provide smart gel neurotransmitter neuron vesicle storage and delivery, organize the neuromuscular junction basement membrane, and provide motor neuron synaptic plasticity, and photoreceptor and neuron synaptic functions. PG-HA networks maintain ionic fluxes and microgradients and tissue compartments that contribute to membrane polarization dynamics essential to neuronal activation and neurotransduction. Hyalectans form neuroprotective perineuronal nets contributing to synaptic plasticity, memory, and cognitive learning. Sialoglycoprotein associated with cones and rods (SPACRCAN), an HA binding CSPG, stabilizes the inter-photoreceptor ECM. HSPGs pikachurin and eyes shut stabilize the photoreceptor synapse aiding in phototransduction and neurotransduction with retinal bipolar neurons crucial to visual acuity. This is achieved through Laminin G motifs in pikachurin, eyes shut, and neurexins that interact with the dystroglycan–cytoskeleton–ECM-stabilizing synaptic interconnections, neuronal interactive specificity, and co-ordination of regulatory action potentials in neural networks.</p>

                Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are characterized by neuronal loss accompanied by α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation in the brain. While research conventionally focused on brain pathology, there is growing interest in peripheral alterations. Erythrocytes, which are rich in α-syn, have emerged as a compelling site for synucleinopathies-related alterations. Erythrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing pathological α-syn species, can traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB) under certain conditions and the gastrointestinal tract, where α-syn and gut microbiota interact extensively. This review explores the accumulating evidence of erythrocyte involvement in synucleinopathies, as well as their potential in disease pathogenesis and diagnosis. Given their unique properties, erythrocytes and erythrocyte-derived EVs may also serve as an ideal therapeutic platform for treating synucleinopathies and beyond.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96797">Unraveling the role of urea hydrolysis in salt stress response during seed germination and seedling growth in Arabidopsis thaliana</a></h4>

              
                Urea is intensively utilized as a nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture, originating either from root uptake or from catabolism of arginine by arginase. Despite its extensive use, the underlying physiological mechanisms of urea, particularly its adverse effects on seed germination and seedling growth under salt stress remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that salt stress induces excessive hydrolysis of arginine-derived urea, leading to an increase in cytoplasmic pH within seed radical cells, which, in turn, triggers salt-induced inhibition of seed germination (SISG) and hampers seedling growth. Our findings challenge the long-held belief that ammonium accumulation and toxicity are the primary causes of SISG, offering a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying these processes. This study provides significant insights into the physiological impact of urea hydrolysis under salt stress, contributing to a better understanding of SISG.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87055">Firing rate adaptation affords place cell theta sweeps, phase precession, and procession</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells in freely moving rodents display both theta phase precession and procession, which is thought to play important roles in cognition, but the neural mechanism for producing theta phase shift remains largely unknown. Here, we show that firing rate adaptation within a continuous attractor neural network causes the neural activity bump to oscillate around the external input, resembling theta sweeps of decoded position during locomotion. These forward and backward sweeps naturally account for theta phase precession and procession of individual neurons, respectively. By tuning the adaptation strength, our model explains the difference between ‘bimodal cells’ showing interleaved phase precession and procession, and ‘unimodal cells’ in which phase precession predominates. Our model also explains the constant cycling of theta sweeps along different arms in a T-maze environment, the speed modulation of place cells’ firing frequency, and the continued phase shift after transient silencing of the hippocampus. We hope that this study will aid an understanding of the neural mechanism supporting theta phase coding in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94007">Multi-omic analysis of bat versus human fibroblasts reveals altered central metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Bats have unique characteristics compared to other mammals, including increased longevity and higher resistance to cancer and infectious disease. While previous studies have analyzed the metabolic requirements for flight, it is still unclear how bat metabolism supports these unique features, and no study has integrated metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to characterize bat metabolism. In this work, we performed a multi-omics data analysis using a computational model of metabolic fluxes to identify fundamental differences in central metabolism between primary lung fibroblast cell lines from the black flying fox fruit bat (<i>Pteropus alecto</i>) and human. Bat cells showed higher expression levels of Complex I components of electron transport chain (ETC), but, remarkably, a lower rate of oxygen consumption. Computational modeling interpreted these results as indicating that Complex II activity may be low or reversed, similar to an ischemic state. An ischemic-like state of bats was also supported by decreased levels of central metabolites and increased ratios of succinate to fumarate in bat cells. Ischemic states tend to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which would be incompatible with the longevity of bats. However, bat cells had higher antioxidant reservoirs (higher total glutathione and higher ratio of NADPH to NADP) despite higher mitochondrial ROS levels. In addition, bat cells were more resistant to glucose deprivation and had increased resistance to ferroptosis, one of the characteristics of which is oxidative stress. Thus, our studies revealed distinct differences in the ETC regulation and metabolic stress responses between human and bat cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93983">Neural activity ramps in frontal cortex signal extended motivation during learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning requires the ability to link actions to outcomes. How motivation facilitates learning is not well understood. We designed a behavioral task in which mice self-initiate trials to learn cue-reward contingencies and found that the anterior cingulate region of the prefrontal cortex (ACC) contains motivation-related signals to maximize rewards. In particular, we found that ACC neural activity was consistently tied to trial initiations where mice seek to leave unrewarded cues to reach reward-associated cues. Notably, this neural signal persisted over consecutive unrewarded cues until reward-associated cues were reached, and was required for learning. To determine how ACC inherits this motivational signal we performed projection-specific photometry recordings from several inputs to ACC during learning. In doing so, we identified a ramp in bulk neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-to-ACC projections as mice received unrewarded cues, which continued ramping across consecutive unrewarded cues, and finally peaked upon reaching a reward-associated cue, thus maintaining an extended motivational state. Cellular resolution imaging of OFC confirmed these neural correlates of motivation, and further delineated separate ensembles of neurons that sequentially tiled the ramp. Together, these results identify a mechanism by which OFC maps out task structure to convey an extended motivational state to ACC to facilitate goal-directed learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92033">Using synchronized brain rhythms to bias memory-guided decisions</a></h4>

              
                Functional interactions between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as revealed by strong oscillatory synchronization in the theta (6–11 Hz) frequency range, correlate with memory-guided decision-making. However, the degree to which this form of long-range synchronization influences memory-guided choice remains unclear. We developed a brain-machine interface that initiated task trials based on the magnitude of prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization, then measured choice outcomes. Trials initiated based on strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchrony were more likely to be correct compared to control trials on both working memory-dependent and -independent tasks. Prefrontal-thalamic neural interactions increased with prefrontal-hippocampal synchrony and optogenetic activation of the ventral midline thalamus primarily entrained prefrontal theta rhythms, but dynamically modulated synchrony. Together, our results show that prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization leads to a higher probability of a correct choice and strengthens prefrontal-thalamic dialogue. Our findings reveal new insights into the neural circuit dynamics underlying memory-guided choices and highlight a promising technique to potentiate cognitive processes or behavior via brain-machine interfacing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97256">Energetic demands regulate sleep-wake rhythm circuit development</a></h4>

              
                Sleep and feeding patterns lack strong daily rhythms during early life. As diurnal animals mature, feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. In <i>Drosophila</i>, circadian sleep patterns are initiated with formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal output neurons; emergence of circadian sleep also enables long-term memory (LTM). However, the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown. Here, we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. We find that in the 2nd instar larval period (L2), sleep and feeding are spread across the day; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage (L3). Forcing mature (L3) animals to adopt immature (L2) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit LTM. In addition, the development of the clock (DN1a)-arousal (Dh44) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Finally, we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. Together, our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors.

Using whole-brain intracranial EEG recordings in 18 epilepsy patients listening to natural, continuous speech or music, we investigated the presence of frequency-specific and network-level brain activity. We combined it with a statistical approach in which a clear operational distinction is made between <i>shared</i>, <i>preferred,</i> and domain-<i>selective</i> neural responses. We show that the majority of focal and network-level neural activity is shared between speech and music processing. Our data also reveal an absence of anatomical regional selectivity. Instead, domain-selective neural responses are restricted to distributed and frequency-specific coherent oscillations, typical of spectral fingerprints. Our work highlights the importance of considering natural stimuli and brain dynamics in their full complexity to map cognitive and brain functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80216">Recombinant origin and interspecies transmission of a HERV-K(HML-2)-related primate retrovirus with a novel RNA transport element</a></h4>

              
                HERV-K(HML-2), the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses, but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhesus macaques, but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear. We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact ORFs, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques. 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between <i>env</i> and the 3' LTR, derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K(HML-8)-related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys (OWM), but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Rec Response Element (RcRE), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the HML-8 derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element (CTE), indicating the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.

	<p>Self-ambivalence, a prevalent phenomenon in daily life, has been increasingly substantiated by research. It refers to conflicting self-views and evaluations, primarily concerning self-worth and morality. Previous behavioral research has distinguished self-worth and moral ambivalence, but it remains unclear whether they have separable neural bases. The present study addressed this question by examining resting-state brain activity (i.e., the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, fALFF) and connectivity (i.e., resting-state functional connectivity, RSFC) in 112 college students. The results found that self-worth ambivalence was positively related to the fALFF in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and left superior parietal lobule (SPL). The RSFC strength between the SPL and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was positively related to self-worth ambivalence. Moral ambivalence was positively associated with the fALFF in the left SPL (extending into the temporoparietal junction) and right SPL. The RSFC strengths between the left SPL/TPJ and OFC, as well as the RSFC strengths between the right SPL as a seed and the bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyrus, were associated with moral ambivalence. Overall, the neural bases of self-worth and moral ambivalence are associated with the SPL and OFC, involved in attentional alertness and value representation, respectively. Additionally, the neural basis of moral ambivalence is associated with the TPJ, responsible for mentalizing.</p>

	<p>In recent decades, the debate on consciousness has been conditioned by the idea of bottom-up emergence, which has influenced scientific research and raised a few obstacles to any attempt to bridge the explanatory gap. The analysis and explanation of vision conducted according to the accredited methodologies of scientific research in terms of physical stimuli, objectivity, methods, and explanation has encountered the resistance of subjective experience. Moreover, original Gestalt research into vision has generally been merged with cognitive neuroscience. Experimental phenomenology, building on the legacy of Gestalt psychology, has obtained new results in the fields of amodal contours and color stratifications, light perception, figurality, space, so-called perceptual illusions, and subjective space and time. Notwithstanding the outcomes and the impulse given to neuroscientific analyses, the research carried out around these phenomena has never directly confronted the issue of what it means to be conscious or, in other words, the nature of consciousness as self-referentiality. Research has tended to focus on the percept. Therefore, explaining the non-detachability of parts in subjective experience risks becoming a sort of impossible achievement, similar to that of Baron Munchausen, who succeeds in escaping unharmed from this quicksand by pulling himself out by his hair. This paper addresses how to analyze seeing as an undivided whole by discussing several basic dimensions of phenomenal consciousness on an experimental basis and suggesting an alternative way of escaping this quicksand. This mind-set reversal also sheds light on the organization and dependence relationships between phenomenology, psychophysics, and neuroscience.</p>

	<p>Studies on decision-making have classically focused exclusively on its cognitive component. Recent research has shown that a further essential component of decisional processes is the emotional one. Indeed, the emotional route in decision-making plays a crucial role, especially in situations characterized by ambiguity, uncertainty, and risk. Despite that, individual differences concerning such components and their associations with individual traits, decisional styles, and psychophysiological profiles are still understudied. This pilot study aimed at investigating the relationship between individual propensity toward using an emotional or cognitive information-processing route in decision-making, EEG and autonomic correlates of the decisional performance as collected via wearable non-invasive devices, and individual personality and decisional traits. Participants completed a novel task based on realistic decisional scenarios while their physiological activity (EEG and autonomic indices) was monitored. Self-report questionnaires were used to collect data on personality traits, individual differences, and decisional styles. Data analyses highlighted two main findings. Firstly, different personality traits and decisional styles showed significant and specific correlations, with an individual propensity toward either emotional or cognitive information processing for decision-making. Secondly, task-related EEG and autonomic measures presented a specific and distinct correlation pattern with different decisional styles, maximization traits, and personality traits, suggesting different latent profiles.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is primarily characterized by core deficits in social skills, communication, and cognition and by repetitive stereotyped behaviors. These manifestations are variable between individuals, and ASD pathogenesis is complex, with over a thousand implicated genes, many epigenetic factors, and multiple environmental influences. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) mediated brain reward system is held to play a key role, but the rapidly expanding literature reveals intricate, nuanced signaling involving a wide array of mesolimbic loci, neurotransmitters and receptor subtypes, and neuronal variants. How altered DA signaling may constitute a downstream convergence of the manifold causal origins of ASD is not well understood. A clear working framework of ASD pathogenesis may help delineate common stages and potential diagnostic and interventional opportunities. Hence, we summarize the known natural history of ASD in the context of emerging data and perspectives to update ASD reward signaling. Then, against this backdrop, we proffer a provisional framework that organizes ASD pathogenesis into successive levels, including (1) genetic and epigenetic changes, (2) disrupted mesolimbic reward signaling pathways, (3) dysregulated neurotransmitter/DA signaling, and finally, (4) altered neurocognitive and social behavior and possible antagonist/agonist based ASD interventions. This subdivision of ASD into a logical progression of potentially addressable parts may help facilitate the rational formulation of diagnostics and targeted treatments.</p>

	<p>Breast cancer (BC) and depression are globally prevalent problems. Numerous reviews have indicated the high prevalence of depression among BC survivors. However, the long-term impact of depression on survival among BC survivors has not been well explored. For this investigation, we aimed to explore the relationship between BC, depression, and mortality from a national random sample of adult American women. Data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (years 2005&amp;amp;ndash;2010) were linked with mortality data from the National Death Index up to December 31st, 2019. A total of 4719 adult women (ages 45 years and older) were included in the study sample with 5.1% having breast cancer and more than a tenth (12.7%) having depression. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality risk among those with BC was 1.50 (95% CI = 1.05&amp;amp;ndash;2.13) compared to those without BC. In the adjusted analysis, the risk of all-cause mortality was highest among women with both depression and BC (HR = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.15&amp;amp;ndash;8.05) compared to those without BC or depression. The relationship between BC and mortality was moderated by cardiovascular diseases, anemia, smoking, age, PIR, and marital status. Our analysis provides vital information on factors that could be helpful for interventions to reduce mortality risk among those with BC and depression. In addition, given the higher risk of mortality with co-occurring BC and depression, collaborative healthcare practices should help with widespread screening for and treatment of depression among BC survivors.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment impacts a sizable segment of the older population, and often evolves into dementia within a few years. At this stage, subjects may benefit from non-pharmacological therapies that can delay or stop the progression of the mild cognitive impairment into dementia and are crucial for improvement in the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s quality of life, while also being easily accessible and safe for use. Many research studies have shown that a variety of exercises, including cognitive training, have the potential to enhance or optimize cognitive function and general well-being. Recently, many authors have suggested video games as a promising approach for cognitive training and neurorehabilitation in older people, thanks to their increasing motivation and training effects through immersion in stimulating environments. Under this premise, our narrative review&amp;amp;rsquo;s objective is to discuss and summarize the body of existing material on the role of video games in improving cognitive performance, daily life activities, and depression symptoms in older individuals with different levels of cognitive decline. From the papers reviewed, it emerged that older subjects trained with video games showed a significant improvement in cognitive functions, sleep quality, and psychiatric symptoms, positioning video games as an intriguing and useful tool.</p>

	<p>Purpose: This study aims to highlight the feasibility of an olfactory training program entirely monitored through online media in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Classic olfactory training was performed with a sample with olfactory loss due COVID-19 (n = 11). Participants were engaged on a weekly video call in order to improve adherence and collect information regarding the number of correct answers and the individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; perception of olfactory function. The olfactory status after training was compared to two groups, one composed of participants who contracted COVID-19 but did not report olfactory loss (n = 11) and a sample composed of healthy participants (n = 11). Results: The experimental group showed improvements throughout the training period (TDI score on week 0 was 20.3 (5.6) and 24.6 (4.3) for week 12, and on week 24 was 25.4 (6.2) (F = 5.115, df = 2, 20, p = 0.016), and post hoc tests showed that participants significantly improved their TDI score in W12 compared to W0 (SMD = 0.869, p = 0.041) and in W24 compared to W0 (SMD = 0.859, p = 0.041). The experimental group showed lower scores when compared with both groups, and the no OT COVID-19 group showed lower scores than the healthy control group, even though they did not report olfactory alterations. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the strategies applied to improve adherence were successful since 100% of the sample completed the training adherence, offering a valuable framework for future olfactory training studies.</p>

<p>This study addresses a clinically relevant knowledge gap – whether low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) treatment long after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is still effective for chronic post-traumatic headache (PTH) and cognitive impairments. We have found that LD-IL-2 treatment preferentially expands meningeal regulatory T (Treg) cells, thereby abolishing PTH-related behaviors and memory deficit in mice with a wide therapeutic time window. This identifies Treg as a cellular target and LD-IL-2 as a promising therapy for mTBI with the potential of reducing polypharmacy.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the high prevalence, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced chronic headache and cognitive deficits are poorly understood and lack effective treatments. Low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) treatment soon after mTBI or overexpressing IL-2 in brain astrocytes prior to injury protects mice from developing post-traumatic headache (PTH)-related behaviors and cognitive decline. The present study addresses a clinically relevant knowledge gap: whether LD-IL-2 treatment long after the initial injury is still effective for chronic PTH and cognitive deficits.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>mTBI was induced by a noninvasive closed-head weight drop method. LD-IL-2 was administered 4–6 weeks post-mTBI to assess its effects on chronic PTH-related facial mechanical hypersensitivity as well as mTBI-induced impairment in novel object recognition and object location tests. Endogenous regulatory T (Treg) cells were depleted to investigate the mechanism of action of LD-IL-2.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Delayed LD-IL-2 treatment abolished chronic PTH-related behaviors. It also completely reversed mTBI-induced cognitive impairment in both male and female mice. Treg cell depletion not only prolonged PTH-related behaviors but also abolished the effects of LD-IL-2. Interestingly, LD-IL-2 treatment significantly increased the number of Treg cells in dura but not in brain tissues.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that the beneficial effects of LD-IL-2 treatment are mediated through the expansion of meningeal Treg cells. Collectively, our study identifies Treg as a cellular target and LD-IL-2 as a promising therapy for both chronic PTH and mTBI-induced cognitive impairment for both males and females, with a wide therapeutic time window and the potential of reducing polypharmacy in mTBI treatment.

                The field of rodent behavioral neuroscience is undergoing two major sea changes: an ever-growing technological revolution, and worldwide calls to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) in experimental design. Both have enormous potential to improve the precision and rigor with which the brain can be studied, but the convergence of these shifts in scientific practice has exposed critical limitations in classic and widely used behavioral paradigms. While our tools have advanced, our behavioral metrics – mostly developed in males and often allowing for only binary outcomes – have not. This opinion article explores how this disconnect has presented challenges for the accurate depiction and interpretation of sex differences in brain function, arguing for the expansion of current behavioral constructs to better account for behavioral diversity.

	<p>Sex differences in the effect of prolonged sitting time on anxiety symptoms have not yet been explored. This study examined the sex-specific association between prolonged sitting time and anxiety prevalence in Korean adults. Community-dwelling adults aged &amp;amp;gt;18 years who underwent a cross-sectional structured study survey of physical activity and mental health tests were enrolled as part of the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital Cohort Study from 2012 to 2019. The prevalence of anxiety was evaluated using the Clinically Useful Anxiety Outcome Scale (CUXOS) questionnaire. The mean daily sitting time was 7.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.4 h in men and 6.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.6 h in women. After adjustments for possible confounding factors, the adjusted mean CUXOS score was the highest in participants sitting for &amp;amp;ge;10 h, followed by 5&amp;amp;ndash;9 h, and &amp;amp;lt;5 h, in that order. In the post-hoc Bonferroni analysis, there were significant differences in the adjusted mean CUXOS scores in group comparisons. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted after adjusting for potential confounding factors. A prolonged sitting time was positively associated with an increased prevalence of anxiety in both men and women, with stronger associations in women than in men. It is necessary to prevent anxiety by adjusting or reducing sitting time in adults, especially women.</p>

	<p>Background: Stroke guideline statements are important references for clinicians due to the rapidly evolving nature of treatments. Guideline statements should be informed by up-to-date systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) because they provide the highest level of evidence. To investigate the utilization of SRs/MAs in stroke management guidelines, we conducted a literature review of guidelines and extracted relevant information regarding SRs/MAs. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed with supplementation using the Trip medical database with the term &amp;amp;ldquo;stroke&amp;amp;rdquo; as the target population, followed by using the filter &amp;amp;ldquo;guidelines&amp;amp;rdquo;. We extracted the number of included SRs/MAs, the years of publication, the country of origin, and other characteristics of interest. Descriptive statistics were generated using the R software version 4.2.1. Results: We included 27 guideline statements. The median number of overall SRs or MAs within the guidelines was 4.0 (interquartile range [IQR] = 2&amp;amp;ndash;9). For MAs only, the median number included in the guidelines was 3.0 (IQR = 2.0&amp;amp;ndash;5.5). Canadian guidelines had the oldest citations, with a median gap of 12.0 (IQR = 5.2&amp;amp;ndash;18.0) years for the oldest citation, followed by European (median = 12; IQR = 9.5&amp;amp;ndash;13.5) and US (median = 10.0; IQR = 5.2&amp;amp;ndash;16) guidelines. Conclusions: Stroke guideline writing groups and issuing bodies should devote greater effort to the inclusion of up-to-date SRs/MAs in their guideline statements so that clinicians can reference recent data with the highest level of evidence.</p>

                <p>Glutamatergic synapses exhibit significant molecular diversity, but circuit-specific mechanisms that underlie synaptic regulation are not well characterized. Prior reports show that Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) Tiam1 regulates perforant path-&gt;dentate gyrus granule neuron synapses. In the present study, we report Tiam1's homolog Tiam2 is implicated in glutamatergic neurotransmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that Tiam2 regulates evoked excitatory glutamatergic currents via a postsynaptic mechanism mediated by the catalytic Dbl-homology domain. Overall, we present evidence for RhoGEF Tiam2's role in glutamatergic synapse function at Schaffer collateral-&gt;CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses.</p>

                Fibroadenoma of the breast most often arises during the late teens and early reproductive years. It is the most prevalent tumor in women < 30 years. After the age of 40 to 45, fibroadenomas are rarely observed as new masses in women. Fibroadenomas are made up of both epithelial and stromal components. Fibroadenoma is the most frequent type of breast tumor. It is crucial to diagnose preoperatively, both clinically and pathologically, by using F.N.A.C. Postoperatively, Fibroadenoma is confirmed histopathology. However, malignant transformation is very rare in Fibroadenoma of the breast. Early identification, accurate analysis, and appropriate management are advantageous. The current study's goal is to examine preoperative and postoperative clinicopathological aspects of Fibroadenoma and to assess any differences between preoperative and postoperative diagnosis in patients admitted to Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi (M), Wardha, Maharashtra, India.

                Background/Objectives A drug-related problem (DRP) is an event or circumstance involving drug therapy that actually or potentially interferes with desired health outcomes. The aim of this study is to identify and categorize the DRPs associated with the use of antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean delivery and to analyze the causes of these problems, making an improvement proposal of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) use in accordance with international guidelines. Methods Observational, retrospective, descriptive study of 814 women undergoing cesarean delivery. Prescription adequacy was assessed based on the selection, administration, dose and duration of the antibiotic therapy. DRP analysis and characterization was conducted using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE) Classification V 9.1. Results DRPs were detected in all women (1125, 1.38 DRPs/patient), the most frequent ones associated to failure to administer PAP (30.10% of patients) and to unnecessary postsurgical antibiotic (100%). Of the 1935 possible causes for DRPs identified, most of them were related to inappropriate drug selection. Cefazolin was administered to 98.07% of women with PAP and 71.45% of patients received postsurgical cefalexin, with 13 different antibiotics being used in total. Conclusions The implementation of therapeutic protocols and early identification of DRPs is proposed in order to optimize antibiotic use in the institution.

                Synaptotagmin-1 is a synaptic vesicle transmembrane protein that senses calcium influx via its tandem C2-domains, triggering synchronous neurotransmitter release. Disruption to SYT1 is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the importance of identifying high-quality research reagents to enhance understanding of Synaptotagmin-1 in health and disease. Here we have characterized thirteen Synaptotagmin-1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background The utilization of zein and gum arabic has grown in an attempt to formulate wall materials based on protein–polysaccharide complexes. This mixture provides a versatile shelter for hydrophilic (guava leaf extract, GLE) or lipophilic (fish oil, FO) bioactive compounds from unwanted environmental factors, and it can be used as an edible film-forming polymer. This study was undertaken to characterize FO-containing edible films that were double-layered with a film containing GLE. Methods Modified zein and gum arabic solutions (MG complex) were mixed at a ratio of 1:1.5 (v/v), adjusted to pH 5, added with glycerol (20% of the complex) and FO (5% of the complex), and finally adjusted to pH 5. This was prepared as the bottom/lower layer. The upper/active layer was prepared by mixing MG complex, glycerol, and GLE (1, 3, and 5% w/v of the complex). Physical, mechanical, microstructural, thermal, microbiological, and oxidative measurements were also performed. Results The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in GLE were 15.81 mg GAE/g extract and 6.99 mg QE/g extract, respectively. The IC50 of the DPPH radical scavenging activity of GLE was 26.86 ppm with antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli of 9.83 and 12.55 mm. The total plate counts of films double-layered with a film containing GLE were retained below 3 log CFU/g during 28-day storage. The peroxide values of these films were dimmed for no more than 9.08 meq/kg sample on day 28 of storage. Thickness (872.00-971.67 μm), water vapor transmission rate (12.99-17.04 g/m2/day), tensile strength (1.56-2.02 kPa), elongation at break (61.53-75.41%), glass transition (52.74-57.50°C), melting peak (131.59-142.35°C), inhibition against B. subtilis (33.67-40.58 mm), and inhibition against E. coli (2.05-9.04 mm) were obtained by double-layer films. Conclusions GLE can be successfully incorporated into the active layer of a double-layer film to improve its characteristics while significantly slowing down the microbial contamination and oxidation rate.

                Background The profound impacts of climate change on the environment, economy, and society are anticipated to significantly influence smallholder farmers, whose livelihoods and traditional ways of life are inextricably intertwined with the natural environment. This comprehensive study delves into the multifaceted factors shaping the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices and their subsequent effects on crop productivity among the small-scale farming communities in Nyimba District, situated within Zambia. Methods The study collected data from 194 smallholder farmer households across 12 villages in 4 agricultural camps of Nyimba District between June and July 2022. A logistic regression model was utilized to assess the factors influencing crop production and the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices in response to climate change and variability within the study area. Furthermore, propensity score matching was performed to evaluate the impacts of adopting climate-smart agriculture by comparing adopter households with their non-adopter counterparts. Results The logit regression model’s findings from the research indicate that several factors influence smallholder farmer households’ adoption of climate-smart agricultural techniques and crop productivity. These factors include the farmer’s educational level, household size, fertilizer utilization, the household head’s age and gender, farming experience duration, livestock ownership status, annual household income, farmland size, the household head’s marital status, and access to climate-related information. Additionally, the propensity score matching analysis revealed that crop yields among smallholder farmers who adopted climate-smart agricultural practices were 20.20% higher compared to non-adopters. Furthermore, the analysis showed that implementing such practices in the study area led to a 21.50% increase in maize yields for adopter households relative to their non-adopter counterparts. Conclusion The findings of this research offer valuable insights to policymakers, guiding them in enhancing farmers’ climate change adaptation strategies and formulating relevant policies. Nevertheless, these initiatives and concerted efforts possess the potential to mitigate the detrimental impacts posed by climate change and climatic variability.

Slow-wave sleep (SWS), characterized by slow oscillations (SOs, <1Hz) of alternating active and silent states in the thalamocortical network, is a primary brain state during Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. In the last two decades, the traditional view of SWS as a global and uniform whole-brain state has been challenged by a growing body of evidence indicating that SO can be local and can coexist with wake-like activity. However, the mechanisms by which global and local SOs arise from micro-scale neuronal dynamics and network connectivity remain poorly understood. We developed a multi-scale, biophysically realistic human whole-brain thalamocortical network model capable of transitioning between the awake state and SWS, and we investigated the role of connectivity in the spatio-temporal dynamics of sleep SO. We found that the overall strength and a relative balance between long and short-range synaptic connections determined the network state. Importantly, for a range of synaptic strengths, the model demonstrated complex mixed SO states, where periods of synchronized global slow-wave activity were intermittent with the periods of asynchronous local slow-waves. An increase in the overall synaptic strength led to synchronized global SO, while a decrease in synaptic connectivity produced only local slow-waves that would not propagate beyond local areas. These results were compared to human data to validate probable models of biophysically realistic SO. The model producing mixed states provided the best match to the spatial coherence profile and the functional connectivity estimated from human subjects. These findings shed light on how the spatio-temporal properties of SO emerge from local and global cortical connectivity and provide a framework for further exploring the mechanisms and functions of SWS in health and disease.

                <p>by Heejin Jun, Shanshan Liu, Alexander J. Knights, Kezhou Zhu, Yingxu Ma, Jianke Gong, Ashley E. Lenhart, Xiaoling Peng, Yunying Huang, Jared P. Ginder, Christopher H. Downie, Erika Thalia Ramos, Klas Kullander, Robert T. Kennedy, X. Z. Shawn Xu, Jun Wu</p>

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the progressive form of liver steatosis, the most common liver disease, and substantially increases the mortality rate. However, limited therapies are currently available to prevent MASH development. Identifying potential pharmacological treatments for the condition has been hampered by its heterogeneous and complex nature. Here, we identified a hepatic nonneuronal cholinergic signaling pathway required for metabolic adaptation to caloric overload. We found that cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 2 subunit (CHRNA2) is highly expressed in hepatocytes of mice and humans. Further, CHRNA2 is activated by a subpopulation of local acetylcholine-producing macrophages during MASH development. The activation of CHRNA2 coordinates defensive programs against a broad spectrum of MASH-related pathogenesis, including steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatocyte-specific loss of CHRNA2 signaling accelerates the disease onset in different MASH mouse models. Activation of this pathway via pharmacological inhibition of acetylcholine degradation protects against MASH development. Our study uncovers a hepatic nicotinic cholinergic receptor pathway that constitutes a cell-autonomous self-defense route against prolonged metabolic stress and holds therapeutic potential for combatting human MASH.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding the complex dynamics of social communication behaviors, such as exploration, communication, courtship, mating, and aggression in animal models, is crucial to reveal key neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying these behaviors. The two-intruders test is designed to investigate residents' behavior toward both male and female intruders within the home cage of the test male. During this test imitating natural conditions, several aspects of social interaction were investigated: Exploration, courtship, mating, and aggressive behavior. As mating and aggression involve overlapping neural circuits, the behavioral setup testing both behaviors is best at reflecting their competitive nature. Our findings demonstrate that resident male mice exhibit strong preference to communicate with a female intruder, which correlates with baseline testosterone levels of test males. Relevant female preference in the two-intruders test was also found in BALB/c males. Behavioral breakdown revealed the anogenital sniffing as a key behavioral feature that discriminates resident male behavior toward intruders of different sex. Furthermore, resident male interaction with female intruder was accompanied by neuronal activation in the ventromedial hypothalamus. We demonstrate that odor recognition underlies preference toward females in male residents, as experimental anosmia reduced communication with a female intruder. We conclude the two-intruders test setup to be a useful tool to study the neurological basis of social communication in animal models, which provides detailed analysis of various aspects of the laboratory animals’ social behavior in the most natural conditions.</p>

                Background Improving awareness in patients with stroke to detect risk factors of recurrent stroke has recently become a major challenge for all health professionals in preventing recurrence among stroke survivors. Utilization of advanced technology, such as digital sensors, (a non-invasive device) is among the breakthroughs in detecting the risk of disease and promotes more effective prevention and improves quality of care. This study aims to conduct a systematic review on studies addressing early detection of the risk factors of recurrent stroke through the utilization of digital sensors. Methods A literature search was carried out on articles published between 2011 - 2018 on EBSCO, Elsevier, Science Direct, ProQuest, Springer link, PubMed, MEDLINE, PLoS, and the Journal of Community Nursing. The search identified quantitative research studies on the utilization of digital sensors in cases of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiac disorders that contributed to stroke recurrence. Each study’s bias was assessed using Review Manager 5. Results Ten articles were analyzed through data extraction. Robust assessment of independent risk factors which provoke recurrent stroke such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and heart diseases could lead to conservation of health resources. It is very important to monitor these factors. With the development of technology, the potential use of non-invasive monitoring for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and heart diseases as risk factors for recurrent stroke events is considered effective because it is easy, simple, low cost, sensitive, and does not cause additional suffering for patients. Conclusion A practical and non-invasive method for early detection and monitoring of risk factors may reduce the risk of stroke recurrence among stroke survivors.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27024?af=R">Cerebrospinal Fluid Cytokine and Chemokine Profiles in Central Nervous System Sarcoidosis: Diagnostic and Immunopathologic Insights</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine/chemokine profile of central nervous system (CNS) neurosarcoidosis (NS), and its utility in differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this case–control study, we validated 17 cytokines/chemokines (interleukin [IL]-1-beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, BAFF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) in a multiplexed automated immunoassay system (ELLA; Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and assessed them in CSF and serum of symptomatic patients with probable or definite CNS NS (01/2011–02/2023) with gadolinium enhancement and/or CSF pleocytosis. Patients with multiple sclerosis, primary CNS lymphoma, aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G positivity, non-inflammatory disorders, and healthy individuals were used as controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 32 NS patients (59% women; median age, 59 years [19–81]) were included; concurrent sera were available in 12. CSF controls consisted of 26 multiple sclerosis, 8 primary CNS lymphoma, 84 aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G positive, and 34 patients with non-inflammatory disorders. Gadolinium enhancement was present in 31 of 32 NS patients, and CSF pleocytosis in 27 of 32 (84%). CSF IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, BAFF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in NS patients compared with non-inflammatory controls (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.02); elevations were more common in CSF than serum. Concurrent elevation of IL-6, CXCL9, CXCL10, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha was present in 18 of 32 NS patients, but only in 1 control. Elevated IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, CXCL9, CXL10, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha associated with measures of disease activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NS CSF cytokine/chemokine profiles suggest T cell (mainly T helper cell type 1), macrophage, and B-cell involvement. These signatures aid in NS diagnosis, indicate disease activity, and suggest therapeutic avenues. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88905">Deficiency of IQCH causes male infertility in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                IQ motif-containing proteins can be recognized by calmodulin (CaM) and are essential for many biological processes. However, the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in spermatogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the novel gene IQ motif-containing H (<i>IQCH</i>) in a Chinese family with male infertility characterized by a cracked flagellar axoneme and abnormal mitochondrial structure. To verify the function of IQCH, <i>Iqch</i> knockout (KO) mice were generated via CRISPR-Cas9 technology. As expected, the <i>Iqch</i> KO male mice exhibited impaired fertility, which was related to deficient acrosome activity and abnormal structures of the axoneme and mitochondria, mirroring the patient phenotypes. Mechanistically, IQCH can bind to CaM and subsequently regulate the expression of RNA-binding proteins (especially HNRPAB), which are indispensable for spermatogenesis. Overall, this study revealed the function of IQCH, expanded the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in reproductive processes, and provided important guidance for genetic counseling and genetic diagnosis of male infertility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95849">Prediction error determines how memories are organized in the brain</a></h4>

              
                How is new information organized in memory? According to latent state theories, this is determined by the level of surprise, or prediction error, generated by the new information: a small prediction error leads to the updating of existing memory, large prediction error leads to encoding of a new memory. We tested this idea using a protocol in which rats were first conditioned to fear a stimulus paired with shock. The stimulus was then gradually extinguished by progressively reducing the shock intensity until the stimulus was presented alone. Consistent with latent state theories, this gradual extinction protocol (small prediction errors) was better than standard extinction (large prediction errors) in producing long-term suppression of fear responses, and the benefit of gradual extinction was due to updating of the conditioning memory with information about extinction. Thus, prediction error determines how new information is organized in memory, and latent state theories adequately describe the ways in which this occurs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92110">Allosteric activation of the co-receptor BAK1 by the EFR receptor kinase initiates immune signaling</a></h4>

              
                Transmembrane signaling by plant receptor kinases (RKs) has long been thought to involve reciprocal trans-phosphorylation of their intracellular kinase domains. The fact that many of these are pseudokinase domains, however, suggests that additional mechanisms must govern RK signaling activation. Non-catalytic signaling mechanisms of protein kinase domains have been described in metazoans, but information is scarce for plants. Recently, a non-catalytic function was reported for the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-RK subfamily XIIa member EFR (elongation factor Tu receptor) and phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes were proposed to regulate signaling of RKs with non-RD kinase domains. Here, using EFR as a model, we describe a non-catalytic activation mechanism for LRR-RKs with non-RD kinase domains. EFR is an active kinase, but a kinase-dead variant retains the ability to enhance catalytic activity of its co-receptor kinase BAK1/SERK3 (brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated kinase 1/somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 3). Applying hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis and designing homology-based intragenic suppressor mutations, we provide evidence that the EFR kinase domain must adopt its active conformation in order to activate BAK1 allosterically, likely by supporting αC-helix positioning in BAK1. Our results suggest a conformational toggle model for signaling, in which BAK1 first phosphorylates EFR in the activation loop to stabilize its active conformation, allowing EFR in turn to allosterically activate BAK1.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91054">Caenorhabditis elegans SEL-5/AAK1 regulates cell migration and cell outgrowth independently of its kinase activity</a></h4>

              
                During <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> development, multiple cells migrate long distances or extend processes to reach their final position and/or attain proper shape. The Wnt signalling pathway stands out as one of the major coordinators of cell migration or cell outgrowth along the anterior-posterior body axis. The outcome of Wnt signalling is fine-tuned by various mechanisms including endocytosis. In this study, we show that SEL-5, the <i>C. elegans</i> orthologue of mammalian AP2-associated kinase AAK1, acts together with the retromer complex as a positive regulator of EGL-20/Wnt signalling during the migration of QL neuroblast daughter cells. At the same time, SEL-5 in cooperation with the retromer complex is also required during excretory canal cell outgrowth. Importantly, SEL-5 kinase activity is not required for its role in neuronal migration or excretory cell outgrowth, and neither of these processes is dependent on DPY-23/AP2M1 phosphorylation. We further establish that the Wnt proteins CWN-1 and CWN-2 together with the Frizzled receptor CFZ-2 positively regulate excretory cell outgrowth, while LIN-44/Wnt and LIN-17/Frizzled together generate a stop signal inhibiting its extension.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90964">Myelin dystrophy impairs signal transmission and working memory in a multiscale model of the aging prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Normal aging leads to myelin alterations in the rhesus monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which are positively correlated with degree of cognitive impairment. It is hypothesized that remyelination with shorter and thinner myelin sheaths partially compensates for myelin degradation, but computational modeling has not yet explored these two phenomena together systematically. Here, we used a two-pronged modeling approach to determine how age-related myelin changes affect a core cognitive function: spatial working memory. First, we built a multicompartment pyramidal neuron model fit to monkey dlPFC empirical data, with an axon including myelinated segments having paranodes, juxtaparanodes, internodes, and tight junctions. This model was used to quantify conduction velocity (CV) changes and action potential (AP) failures after demyelination and subsequent remyelination. Next, we incorporated the single neuron results into a spiking neural network model of working memory. While complete remyelination nearly recovered axonal transmission and network function to unperturbed levels, our models predict that biologically plausible levels of myelin dystrophy, if uncompensated by other factors, can account for substantial working memory impairment with aging. The present computational study unites empirical data from ultrastructure up to behavior during normal aging, and has broader implications for many demyelinating conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90690">Alzheimer’s disease linked Aβ42 exerts product feedback inhibition on γ-secretase impairing downstream cell signaling</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Aβ42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in Aβ42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on γ-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of γ-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of Aβ, as well as cell-based and <i>ex vivo</i> assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of Aβ on γ-secretases. We show that human Aβ42 peptides, but neither murine Aβ42 nor human Aβ17–42 (p3), inhibit γ-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Aβ42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in Aβ42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the γ-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address Aβ toxicity in the context of γ-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.

	<p>Wilson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with pathological copper accumulation in many organs, resulting in clinical symptoms, mostly hepatic and neuropsychiatric. As copper accumulates in the brain during WD, and almost 50% of WD patients at diagnosis present with neurological symptoms, neuroimaging studies (especially brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) are part of WD diagnosis. The classical sequences (T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) were used to describe brain MRI; however, with the development of neuroradiology, several papers proposed the use of new MRI sequences and techniques like susceptibility-weighted images, T2*, diffusion MRI, tractography, volumetric assessment and post-processing brain MRI analysis of paramagnetic accumulation&amp;amp;mdash;quantitative susceptibility mapping. Based on these neuroradiological data in WD, currently, brain MRI semiquantitative scale and the pathognomonic neuroradiological brain MRI signs in WD were proposed. Further, the volumetric studies and brain iron accumulation MRI analysis suggested brain atrophy and iron accumulation as biomarkers of neurological WD disease severity. All these results highlight the significance of brain MRI examinations in WD. Due to the extreme progress of these studies, based on the available literature, the authors present the current state of knowledge about the significance, practical aspects, and future directions of brain MRI in WD.</p>

	<p>Recent evidence suggests a connection between hyperacusis and the motor system of the brain. For instance, our recent study reported that hyperacusis in participants with tinnitus and hearing loss is associated with smaller gray matter volumes in the supplementary motor area (SMA). Given that hearing loss can affect gray matter changes in tinnitus, this study aimed to determine if the changes reported in our previous findings of smaller SMA gray matter volumes in hyperacusis persist in the absence of hearing loss. Data for this study were gathered from four prior studies conducted between 2004 and 2019 at the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG). A total of 101 participants with tinnitus and either clinically normal hearing (normal hearing with tinnitus or NHT, n = 35) or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (hearing loss with tinnitus or HLT, n = 66) were included across four studies. Hyperacusis was determined by a score of &amp;amp;ge;22 on the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ). In the NHT group, 22 (63%) participants scored &amp;amp;ge;22 on the HQ (NHT with hyperacusis: mean age 44.1 years, 12 females), while in the HLT group, 25 (38%) participants scored &amp;amp;ge;22 on the HQ (HLT with hyperacusis: mean age 59.5 years, 10 females). The 2 &amp;amp;times; 2 between-group ANOVAs revealed that hyperacusis is associated with smaller SMA gray matter volumes, regardless of hearing levels. Notably, the smaller SMA gray matter volumes in hyperacusis were primarily influenced by the attentional subscales of the HQ. The association between hyperacusis and the motor system may indicate a constant alertness to sounds and a readiness for motor action.</p>

	<p>Background. The majority of deaths in patients with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses (SMIs) are caused by natural causes, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The increased risk of CVD and other somatic diseases in SMIs cannot be fully explained by the contribution of traditional risk factors, behavioral risk factors, patients&amp;amp;rsquo; lifestyle peculiarities, and the influence of antipsychotics. The present review has the following main objectives: (1) to aggregate evidence that neurodevelopmental disorders are the basis of SMIs; (2) to provide a review of studies that have addressed the shared genetic architecture of SMI and cardiovascular disease; and (3) to propose and substantiate the consideration of somatic diseases as independent endophenotypes of SMIs, which will make it possible to place the research of somatic diseases in SMIs within the framework of the concepts of the &amp;amp;ldquo;neurodevelopmental continuum and gradient&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;endophenotype&amp;amp;rdquo;. Methods. A comprehensive literature search was performed on 1 July 2024. The search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar databases up to June 2024. Results. The current literature reveals considerable overlap between the genetic susceptibility loci for SMIs and CVDs. We propose that somatic diseases observed in SMIs that have a shared genetic architecture with SMIs can be considered distinct physical health-related endophenotypes. Conclusions. In this narrative review, the results of recent studies of CVDs in SMIs are summarized. Reframing schizophrenia as a multisystem disease should contribute to the activation of new research on somatic diseases in SMIs.</p>

                <p>In human adults, multiple cortical regions respond robustly to faces, including the occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA), implicated in face perception, and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), implicated in higher-level social functions. When in development, does face selectivity arise in each of these regions? Here, we combined two awake infant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets to create a sample size twice the size of previous reports (<I>n</I> = 65 infants; 2.6&ndash;9.6&nbsp;months). Infants watched movies of faces, bodies, objects, and scenes, while fMRI data were collected. Despite variable amounts of data from each infant, individual subject whole-brain activation maps revealed responses to faces compared to nonface visual categories in the approximate location of OFA, FFA, STS, and MPFC. To determine the strength and nature of face selectivity in these regions, we used cross-validated functional region of interest analyses. Across this larger sample size, face responses in OFA, FFA, STS, and MPFC were significantly greater than responses to bodies, objects, and scenes. Even the youngest infants (2&ndash;5&nbsp;months) showed significantly face-selective responses in FFA, STS, and MPFC, but not OFA. These results demonstrate that face selectivity is present in multiple cortical regions within months of birth, providing powerful constraints on theories of cortical development.</p>

                <p>Quantifying and analyzing licking behavior can offer valuable insights into fundamental neurobiological mechanisms controlling animal consummatory behaviors. Lickometers are typically based on electrical properties, a strategy that comes with limitations, including susceptibility to electrical interference and generation of electrical disturbances in electrophysiological measurements. While optical lickometers offer an alternative method to measure licks and quantify fluid intake in animals, they are prone to false readings and susceptibility to outside light sources. To overcome this problem, we propose a low-cost open-source lickometer that combines a restricted infrared beam defined by optical fibers, with a poke design that allows easy access to the tongue while limiting access of other body parts and external light sources. This device also includes features for detecting nose pokes and presenting visual cues during behavioral tasks. We provide validation experiments that demonstrate the optical lickometer's reliability, high-sensitivity and precision, and its application in a behavioral task, showcasing the potential of this tool to study lick microstructure in combination with other techniques, such as imaging of neural activity, in freely moving mice.</p>

                Objective: To evaluate the scientific production on university social responsibility (USR) from institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was conducted on documents published in indexed journals in the Scopus database from its inception until April 2023. Eligible documents included those on USR describing experiences carried out by universities in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of articles per author, average authors per article, average citations per article, and the number of documents with one or more author were described. Bibliometric indicators regarding authors per article, co-authors per article, and institutional collaboration were presented. Bibliometric networks were constructed based on bibliographic coupling analysis of documents by countries and term co-occurrence in titles and abstracts. Results: Of a total of 4075 documents retrieved from Scopus, 150 were included. Documents published between 1997 and 2023 were identified, with an average annual growth rate of 2.7%. A total of 439 authors were identified, 18 articles had a single author, and an average of 0.3 articles per author and a co-authorship index of 3.13 were found. The percentage of international collaborations was 30.7%. Brazil had the highest proportion of publications (26.4%), followed by Chile (17%) and Colombia (13.2%). Opción and Revista de Ciencias Sociales were the journals with the highest number of articles published (13 each). In the analysis of term co-occurrence, recent years showed an increase in the use of terms related to e-learning, information and communication technologies, virtual education, COVID-19, sustainable development goals, and URSULA (initiative on USR in institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean). Conclusions: A growth in scientific production on USR in Latin America and the Caribbean was identified. The interest in USR documents in recent years has been focused on COVID-19 and the challenges of virtual education and sustainable development.

                Background Digital servitization is a strategic transformation where companies adopt a service-focused approach in response to the prevailing trend of digitalization. Utilizing digital technology, businesses manage product and service operations and develop new value propositions. Further research into digital servitization is essential for maintaining competitiveness and meeting evolving market demands globally. This study aims to comprehend the evolution of digital services from theoretical and practical viewpoints and examines how these challenges are tackled. Methods Utilizing a systematic literature review methodology, the study adopts the PRISMA approach to identify 26 pertinent articles from a pool of 340 papers obtained through a SCOPUS database search. These papers were published between 2019 and 2024 and were retrieved using the keywords (‘digitalization OR digital AND servitization OR servitization’). The selection process involved scrutinizing titles, abstracts, and keywords based on predefined criteria. Results The findings reveal that current digital servitization research emphasizes five determinant variables: digitization, servitization, manufacturing servitization, process innovation, and product innovation. Additionally, response variables influenced by digital servitization were identified, including firm competitiveness, firm performance, financial performance, firm profitability, and sustainable performance. Discussion The results of this review point to inconsistencies, underscoring the necessity for additional research into the factors influencing digital servitization across companies beyond the manufacturing sector. This highlights the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of digital servitization strategies and their impacts across various industries. By expanding the scope of research to include a broader range of sectors, researchers can provide more comprehensive insights into the complexities and nuances of digital servitization adoption. This broader perspective enables a more thorough examination of the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing digital servitization strategies, ultimately contributing to a richer understanding of its implications for businesses across diverse industries.

                <p>by David A. Brewster, Martin A. Nowak, Josef Tkadlec</p>

Computing the rate of evolution in spatially structured populations is difficult. A key quantity is the fixation time of a single mutant with relative reproduction rate <i>r</i> which invades a population of residents. We say that the fixation time is “fast” if it is at most a polynomial function in terms of the population size <i>N</i>. Here we study fixation times of advantageous mutants (<i>r</i> > 1) and neutral mutants (<i>r</i> = 1) on <i>directed</i> graphs, which are those graphs that have at least some one-way connections. We obtain three main results. First, we prove that for any directed graph the fixation time is fast, provided that <i>r</i> is sufficiently large. Second, we construct an efficient algorithm that gives an upper bound for the fixation time for any graph and any <i>r</i> ≥ 1. Third, we identify a broad class of directed graphs with fast fixation times for any <i>r</i> ≥ 1. This class includes previously studied amplifiers of selection, such as Superstars and Metafunnels. We also show that on some graphs the fixation time is not a monotonically declining function of <i>r</i>; in particular, neutral fixation can occur faster than fixation for small selective advantages.

                <p>by Botond B. Antal, Anthony G. Chesebro, Helmut H. Strey, Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, Corey Weistuch</p>

All fields of science depend on mathematical models. <i>Occam’s razor</i> refers to the principle that good models should exclude parameters beyond those minimally required to describe the systems they represent. This is because redundancy can lead to incorrect estimates of model parameters from data, and thus inaccurate or ambiguous conclusions. Here, we show how deep learning can be powerfully leveraged to apply Occam’s razor to model parameters. Our method, FixFit, uses a feedforward deep neural network with a bottleneck layer to characterize and predict the behavior of a given model from its input parameters. FixFit has three major benefits. First, it provides a metric to quantify the original model’s degree of complexity. Second, it allows for the unique fitting of data. Third, it provides an unbiased way to discriminate between experimental hypotheses that add value versus those that do not. In three use cases, we demonstrate the broad applicability of this method across scientific domains. To validate the method using a known system, we apply FixFit to recover known composite parameters for the Kepler orbit model and a dynamic model of blood glucose regulation. In the latter, we demonstrate the ability to fit the latent parameters to real data. To illustrate how the method can be applied to less well-established fields, we use it to identify parameters for a multi-scale brain model and reduce the search space for viable candidate mechanisms.

                <p>by Nathan J. Doyle, Fergus Cumming, Robin N. Thompson, Michael J. Tildesley</p>

During an infectious disease outbreak, public health policy makers are tasked with strategically implementing interventions whilst balancing competing objectives. To provide a quantitative framework that can be used to guide these decisions, it is helpful to devise a clear and specific objective function that can be evaluated to determine the optimal outbreak response. In this study, we have developed a mathematical modelling framework representing outbreaks of a novel emerging pathogen for which non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are imposed or removed based on thresholds for hospital occupancy. These thresholds are set at different levels to define four unique strategies for disease control. We illustrate that the optimal intervention strategy is contingent on the choice of objective function. Specifically, the optimal strategy depends on the extent to which policy makers prioritise reducing health costs due to infection over the costs associated with maintaining interventions. Motivated by the scenario early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we incorporate the development of a vaccine into our modelling framework and demonstrate that a policy maker’s belief about when a vaccine will become available in future, and its eventual coverage (and/or effectiveness), affects the optimal strategy to adopt early in the outbreak. Furthermore, we show how uncertainty in these quantities can be accounted for when deciding which interventions to introduce. This research highlights the benefits of policy makers being explicit about the precise objectives of introducing interventions.

                <p>by Michal Staum, Ayelet-Chen Abraham, Reema Arbid, Varun Sanjay Birari, Matanel Dominitz, Ithai Rabinowitch</p>

Sensory neurons specialize in detecting and signaling the presence of diverse environmental stimuli. Neuronal injury or disease may undermine such signaling, diminishing the availability of crucial information. Can animals distinguish between a stimulus not being present and the inability to sense that stimulus in the first place? To address this question, we studied <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematode worms that lack gentle body touch sensation due to genetic mechanoreceptor dysfunction. We previously showed that worms can compensate for the loss of touch by enhancing their sense of smell, via an FLP-20 neuropeptide pathway. Here, we find that touch-deficient worms exhibit, in addition to sensory compensation, also cautious-like behavior, as if preemptively avoiding potential undetectable hazards. Intriguingly, these behavioral adjustments are abolished when the touch neurons are removed, suggesting that touch neurons are required for signaling the unavailability of touch information, in addition to their conventional role of signaling touch stimulation. Furthermore, we found that the ASE taste neurons, which similarly to the touch neurons, express the FLP-20 neuropeptide, exhibit altered FLP-20 expression levels in a touch-dependent manner, thus cooperating with the touch circuit. These results imply a novel form of neuronal signaling that enables <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> to distinguish between lack of touch stimulation and loss of touch sensation, producing adaptive behavioral adjustments that could overcome the inability to detect potential threats.

Long-read sequencing is driving rapid progress in genome assembly across all major groups of life, including species of the family Drosophilidae, a longtime model system for genetics, genomics, and evolution. We previously developed a cost-effective hybrid Oxford Nanopore (ONT) long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing approach and used it to assemble 101 drosophilid genomes from laboratory cultures, greatly increasing the number of genome assemblies for this taxonomic group. The next major challenge is to address the laboratory culture bias in taxon sampling by sequencing genomes of species that cannot easily be reared in the lab. Here, we build upon our previous methods to perform amplification-free ONT sequencing of single wild flies obtained either directly from the field or from ethanol-preserved specimens in museum collections, greatly improving the representation of lesser studied drosophilid taxa in whole-genome data. Using Illumina Novaseq X Plus and ONT P2 sequencers with R10.4.1 chemistry, we set a new benchmark for inexpensive hybrid genome assembly at US $150 per genome while assembling genomes from as little as 35 ng of genomic DNA from a single fly. We present 183 new genome assemblies for 179 species as a resource for drosophilid systematics, phylogenetics, and comparative genomics. Of these genomes, 62 are from pooled lab strains and 121 from single adult flies. Despite the sample limitations of working with small insects, most single-fly diploid assemblies are comparable in contiguity (>1 Mb contig N50), completeness (>98% complete dipteran BUSCOs), and accuracy (>QV40 genome-wide with ONT R10.4.1) to assemblies from inbred lines. We present a well-resolved multi-locus phylogeny for 360 drosophilid and 4 outgroup species encompassing all publicly available (as of August 2023) genomes for this group. Finally, we present a Progressive Cactus whole-genome, reference-free alignment built from a subset of 298 suitably high-quality drosophilid genomes. The new assemblies and alignment, along with updated laboratory protocols and computational pipelines, are released as an open resource and as a tool for studying evolution at the scale of an entire insect family.

                Background: Insomnia is difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep for at least three nights a week or more and lasting for at least 3 months. One of the molecules that play a role in the circadian rhythm of arousal system is hypocretin/orexin. Orexin activates the p38-MAPK signaling pathway and increases phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. Centella asiatica (CA) has a role in the signal work of the MAPK/ERK, Akt, and p38 path in many various diseases. Methods: The research method used is true laboratory experimental. The research approach used was randomized control group post-test only. Zebrafish embryos aged 0-7 dpf were used in this study. The treatment group consisted of 5 groups: normal, insomnia, insomnia + 2.5 μg/mL CA, insomnia + 5 μg/mL CA, and insomnia + 10 μg/mL CA. The locomotor motion of zebrafish larvae was observed using Basler cameras on days five-, six- and seven-day post fertilization (dpf), then analyzed by using Western Blot method. Results: The results proved that exposure to CA extract was able to reduce the expression of orexin (91963 ± 9129) and p38 (117425 ± 6398) as an arousal trigger in the sleep-wake cycle, with the most optimal concentration of CA 5 μg/mL. Exposure to CA extract was also able to reduce the expression of ERK (94795 ± 30830) and Akt (60113.5 ± 27833.5) with an optimum concentration of CA 2.5 μg/mL. Conclusion: Exposure to CA extract was able to improve the sleep activity of zebrafish larvae insomnia model by extending the total inactivity time (cumulative duration) and shortening the duration of first sleep (latency to first) in light and dark phases through inhibition of orexin, ERK, p38, and Akt.

                Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) has unpredictable severity. Its management is based on initial assessment of disease severity. It ranges from mild interstitial to severe necrotic form; the latter is associated with poor prognosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is the gold standard in early detection of pancreatic necrosis and in assessing the severity of AP. Two CT grading systems exist to assess the severity of AP: CT severity Index (CSI) and modified CSI (MCSI). This study compares the usefulness of these two systems in predicting the severity and clinical outcome in AP in comparison with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters. Methods: This is a prospective hospital-based screening study of 80 patients aged >12 years with clinical diagnosis of AP who underwent contrast-enhanced CT study of the abdomen. Comparative analysis between MCSI and CSI with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters was assessed by Chi-Squared test. Results: The accuracy of CSI and MCSI in predicting the requirement of critical care, superadded infection, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and requirement of intervention were 73.0%, 64.5%, 69.8% 60.9% and 77.2%, 76.0%, 74.4% & 56.6% respectively. Area under the curve for MCSI score was significantly higher (AUC: 0.861; 95% CI: 0.736-0.986) than CSI score (AUC:0.815;95% CI:0.749-0.941). MCSI and CSI showed significant correlation with Ranson’s criteria; however, MCSI correlation was better (r:0.53; p<0.01) than CSI (r:0.35;p:0.04). Conclusion: CSI and MCSI are better predictors of severity, clinical outcome and mortality compared with Ranson’s criteria, with MCSI being more accurate and better predictor than CSI. The accuracy of MCSI is better than CSI for prediction of requirement of critical care, development of superadded infection and development of MODS in AP. However, CSI and MCSI have low accuracy in predicting intervention in AP.

                <p>Medical school research faculty is increasingly required to complete more comprehensive and time consuming compliance steps for regulatory oversight. These relate to animal studies, information technology, biosafety, and human resources. For physician-scientists, the additional role in clinical care adds to these research areas with regulatory compliance in patient care and ever-growing web trainings. The sum of all these compliance regimes is a considerable time and cost burden, diminished research performance, and disengagement of faculty from colleagues, collaborations, and institutions. Many research and clinical compliance processes were put in place, often using legacy systems, in well-meaning attempts to address straightforward regulations in humane animal care, safe use of biological agents, and medical care delivery. However, their accumulation and negative impact on faculty performance demand time, energy, and resources that impact academic productivity. There are solutions to a relentlessly increasing regulatory load for research faculty, which involve vertical integration, convergence, and performance assessment in medical school and health system compliance regimes.

                Foreign bodies are objects that do not typically belong in the human body but can be ingested, inserted, or entered due to injuries. This article presents various cases and examples of foreign bodies, including objects swallowed, objects inserted into the rectum, vagina, urethra, ear, and nose, or due to injuries caused by falls, puncture wounds, and gunshot wounds. Foreign bodies can be difficult to detect, particularly if they are not inherently radio-opaque, and may be overlooked by patients who cannot provide an adequate history. These foreign bodies may cause harm to the patient. Interpretation is done on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), Ultrasonography (USG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Most foreign objects pass through the gastrointestinal tract without problem; sharp and elongated objects can cause significant injury, and even if they only partially perforate the bowel wall, they can produce chronic inflammatory processes that produce symptoms months or years later. Hence, searching for foreign bodies should be done throughout the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in children and people with mental illness who are more likely to swallow multiple items more than once. Although rare, various materials can be left behind in the body of a patient after surgery, including large and small wire sutures, surgical drains, and retained sponges, which can cause potential complications and foreign body reactions. This article highlights the importance of being aware of the presence of foreign bodies in clinical practice, and a thorough search should be carried out using different modalities, especially CT. Great suspicion and early diagnosis of foreign bodies can avoid potential complications and morbidity. In general, it provides information on the diagnosis and treatment of various types of foreign bodies.
