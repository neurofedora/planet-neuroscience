">Anatomically resolved oscillatory bursts orchestrate visual thalamocortical activity during naturalistic stimulus viewing</a></h4>

              
                Natural vision involves encoding of complex visual input, which engages a plethora of interacting circuit mechanisms. In the mammalian forebrain, one signature of such interacting circuit mechanisms is fast oscillatory dynamics, which can be reflected in the local field potential (LFP). We here used data from the Allen Neuropixels Visual Coding project to show that local visual features in naturalistic stimuli induce retinotopically specific V1 oscillations in various frequency bands. These LFP oscillations occurred in bursts, were localized to specific V1 layers, and were associated with phase coupling of V1 translaminar spiking, pointing to feature-specific circuit motifs. Finally, we discovered that these visually-induced circuit motifs occurred across a range of stimuli, suggesting that they might constitute general routes for feature-specific information flow. Together, our analyses demonstrate visually-induced, fast oscillations, which likely reflect the operation of distinct mesoscale circuits for the differential and multiplexed coding of complex visual input and feature-specific thalamo-cortical information propagation.

">Parallel mechanisms signal a hierarchy of sequence structure violations in the auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The brain predicts regularities in sensory inputs at multiple complexity levels, with neuronal mechanisms that remain elusive. Here, we monitored auditory cortex activity during the local-global paradigm, a protocol nesting different regularity levels in sound sequences. We observed that mice encode local predictions based on stimulus occurrence and stimulus transition probabilities, because auditory responses are boosted upon prediction violation. This boosting was due to both short-term adaptation and an adaptation-independent surprise mechanism resisting anesthesia. In parallel, and only in wakefulness, VIP interneurons responded to the omission of the locally expected sound repeat at sequence ending, thus providing a chunking signal potentially useful for establishing global sequence structure. When this global structure was violated, by either shortening the sequence or ending it with a locally expected but globally unexpected sound transition, activity slightly increased in VIP and PV neurons respectively. Hence, distinct cellular mechanisms predict different regularity levels in sound sequences.

	<p>The aim of this study is to identify autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit&amp;amp;ndash;hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits in adolescents who experience psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), often ignored in clinical practice but widely prevalent in the general population. A total of 57 adolescents and young adults (aged between 16 and 24 years old) were recruited consecutively in the outpatient services. A total of 37 were females (64.9%), 18 were males (31.6%), and two participants (3.5%) were non-binary or gender non-conforming, with a mean age at referral of 18.26 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.06. To investigate these symptoms, three sets of standardized questionnaires were used, as follows: the Autism Spectrum Quotient&amp;amp;ndash;short form (AQ-10), the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-42), and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS). We found significant associations between the ASRS and AQ-10 total scores and all CAPE scales. The model which explained the highest variance was CAPE Score&amp;amp;rsquo;s Total Frequency score (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Our findings underline the importance of investigating the presence of subthreshold ASD and ADHD symptoms in clinical populations, particularly in the period of adolescence and young adulthood, to promptly identify the presence of PLEs and, thus, prevent the onset of a frank psychotic disorder, particularly in the presence of a comorbid psychopathological condition, leading to better diagnosis and treatment for individuals with two or more of these conditions.</p>

	<p>The human organism is affected by multiple stressors every single day, especially during extremely demanding activities. It needs a method to regulate itself better. One of the stressors that is affecting humans is social isolation. The state of prolonged isolation happens during space missions. In this study, 40 analog astronauts attended a two-week-long mission. The experimental group had EEG neurofeedback training intervention performed on a daily basis, while the control group remained isolated without neurofeedback. The results let us take this non-invasive intervention under consideration, while debating the methods to lower the physiological stress reaction in humans that are exposed to extremely hard circumstances. Although not statistically significant, the trends observed give us direction towards other research to confirm EEG neurofeedback as a method to lower cell stress response levels.</p>

	<p>Background: The use of music in cognitive interventions represents a possibility with potential worthy of further investigation in the field of aging, both in terms of prevention from dementia, in the phase of mild cognitive impairment, and in the treatment of overt dementia. Objectives: Currently, the types of music-based interventions proposed in the literature are characterized by wide heterogeneity, which is why it is necessary to clarify which interventions present more evidence of effectiveness in stimulating different cognitive domains. Method: The study was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews. By searching two different databases, PubMed and the Web of Science, all studies evaluating the cognitive effects of music-based interventions on people at early stages of cognitive decline (MCI or mild-to-moderate dementia) were selected. Results: The study selection included a total of 28 studies involving n = 1612 participants (mean age ranged from 69.45 to 85.3 years old). Most of the studies analyzed agree with the observation of an improvement, or at least maintenance, of global cognitive conditions (mainly represented by the results of the MMSE test) following music-based interventions, together with a series of other positive effects on verbal fluency, memory, and executive processes. Conclusions: The results of this review suggest the introduction of music-based interventions as complementary approaches to usual cognitive treatments. Also, the use of standardized and well-defined protocols, in addition to strong methodological research approaches, is suggested. Music-based interventions are recommended in the early stages of dementia, in MCI, and in a preventive sense in healthy older adults.</p>

                <p>Stress impairs fertility, at least in part, via inhibition of gonadotropin secretion. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is an important gonadotropin that is released in a pulsatile pattern in males and in females throughout the majority of the ovarian cycle. Several models of stress, including acute metabolic stress, suppress LH pulses via inhibition of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus that coexpress kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (termed KNDy cells) which form the pulse generator. The mechanism for inhibition of KNDy neurons during stress, however, remains a significant outstanding question. Here, we investigated a population of catecholamine neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), marked by expression of the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), in female mice. First, we found that a subpopulation of DBH neurons in the NTS is activated (express c-Fos) during metabolic stress. Then, using chemogenetics, we determined that activation of these cells is sufficient to suppress LH pulses, augment corticosterone secretion, and induce sickness-like behavior. In subsequent studies, we identified evidence for suppression of KNDy cells (rather than downstream signaling pathways) and determined that the suppression of LH pulses was not dependent on the acute rise in glucocorticoids. Together these data support the hypothesis that DBH cells in the NTS are important for regulation of neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress.</p>

                <p>During learning of a sensory discrimination task, the cortical and subcortical regions display complex spatiotemporal dynamics. During learning, both the amygdala and cortex link stimulus information to its appropriate association, for example, a reward. In addition, both structures are also related to nonsensory parameters such as body movements and licking during the reward period. However, the emergence of the cortico-amygdala relationships during learning is largely unknown. To study this, we combined wide-field cortical imaging with fiber photometry to simultaneously record cortico-amygdala population dynamics as male mice learn a whisker-dependent go/no-go task. We were able to simultaneously record neuronal populations from the posterior cortex and either the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or central/medial amygdala (CEM). Prior to learning, the somatosensory and associative cortex responded during sensation, while amygdala areas did not show significant responses. As mice became experts, amygdala responses emerged early during the sensation period, increasing in the CEM, while decreasing in the BLA. Interestingly, amygdala and cortical responses were associated with task-related body movement, displaying significant responses ~200&nbsp;ms before movement initiation which led to licking for the reward. A correlation analysis between the cortex and amygdala revealed negative and positive correlation with the BLA and CEM, respectively, only in the expert case. These results imply that learning induces an involvement of the cortex and amygdala which may aid to link sensory stimuli with appropriate associations.</p>

                <p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) increases resilience and buffers behavioral stress responses in male rats in part through decreasing the excitability of principal output neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Intra-BLA administration of NPY acutely increases social interaction (SI) through activation of either Y<SUB>1</SUB> or Y<SUB>5</SUB> receptors, whereas repeated NPY (rpNPY) injections (once daily for 5&nbsp;d) produce persistent increases in SI through Y<SUB>5</SUB> receptor-mediated neuroplasticity in the BLA. In this series of studies, we characterized the neural circuits from the BLA that underlie these behavioral responses to NPY. Using neuronal tract tracing, NPY Y<SUB>1</SUB> and Y<SUB>5</SUB> receptor immunoreactivity was identified on subpopulations of BLA neurons projecting to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Inhibition of BLA-&gt;BNST, but not BLA-&gt;CeA, neurons using projection-restricted, cre-driven designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug-G<SUB>i</SUB> expression increased SI and prevented stress-induced decreases in SI produced by a 30&nbsp;min restraint stress. This behavioral profile was similar to that seen after both acute and rpNPY injections into the BLA. Intracellular recordings of BLA-&gt;BNST neurons demonstrated NPY-mediated inhibition via suppression of H currents, as seen previously. Repeated intra-BLA injections of NPY, which are associated with the induction of BLA neuroplasticity, decreased the activity of BLA-&gt;BNST neurons and decreased their dendritic complexity. These results demonstrate that NPY modulates the activity of BNST-projecting BLA neurons, suggesting that this pathway contributes to the stress-buffering actions of NPY and provides a novel substrate for the proresilient effects of NPY.</p>

                <p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a major contributor to relapse to cocaine in humans and to reinstatement in rodent models of cocaine use disorder. The output from the mPFC is potently modulated by parvalbumin (PV)-containing fast&ndash;spiking interneurons, the majority of which are surrounded by perineuronal nets. We previously showed that treatment with chondroitinase ABC (ABC) reduced the consolidation and reconsolidation of a cocaine conditioned place preference memory. However, self-administration memories are more difficult to disrupt. Here we report in male rats that ABC treatment in the mPFC attenuated the consolidation and blocked the reconsolidation of a cocaine self-administration memory. However, reconsolidation was blocked when rats were given a novel, but not familiar, type of retrieval session. Furthermore, ABC treatment prior to, but not after, memory retrieval blocked reconsolidation. This same treatment did not alter a sucrose memory, indicating specificity for cocaine-induced memory. In naive rats, ABC treatment in the mPFC altered levels of PV intensity and cell firing properties. In vivo recordings from the mPFC and dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) during the novel retrieval session revealed that ABC prevented reward-associated increases in high-frequency oscillations and synchrony of these oscillations between the dHIP and mPFC. Together, this is the first study to show that ABC treatment disrupts reconsolidation of the original memory when combined with a novel retrieval session that elicits coupling between the dHIP and mPFC. This coupling after ABC treatment may serve as a fundamental signature for how to disrupt reconsolidation of cocaine memories and reduce relapse.</p>

                <p>The implementation of low-dimensional movement control by the central nervous system has been debated for decades. In this study, we investigated the dimensionality of the control signals received by spinal motor neurons when controlling either the ankle or knee joint torque. We first identified the low-dimensional latent factors underlying motor unit activity during torque-matched isometric contractions in male participants. Subsequently, we evaluated the extent to which motor units could be independently controlled. To this aim, we used an online control paradigm in which participants received the corresponding motor unit firing rates as visual feedback. We identified two main latent factors, regardless of the muscle group (vastus lateralis-medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis-medialis). The motor units of the gastrocnemius lateralis could be controlled largely independently from those of the gastrocnemius medialis during ankle plantarflexion. This dissociation of motor unit activity imposed similar behavior to the motor units that were not displayed in the feedback. Conversely, it was not possible to dissociate the activity of the motor units between the vastus lateralis and medialis muscles during the knee extension tasks. These results demonstrate that the number of latent factors estimated from linear dimensionality reduction algorithms does not necessarily reflect the dimensionality of volitional control of motor units. Overall, individual motor units were never controlled independently of all others but rather belonged to synergistic groups. Together, these findings provide evidence for a low-dimensional control of motor units constrained by common inputs, with notable differences between muscle groups.</p>

                <p>Although anesthesia provides favorable conditions for surgical procedures, recent studies have revealed that the brain remains active in processing noxious signals even during anesthesia. However, whether and how these responses affect the anesthesia effect remains unclear. The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), a crucial hub for pain regulation, also plays an essential role in controlling general anesthesia. Hence, it was hypothesized that the vlPAG may be involved in the regulation of general anesthesia by noxious stimuli. Here, we found that acute noxious stimuli, including capsaicin-induced inflammatory pain, acetic acid-induced visceral pain, and incision-induced surgical pain, significantly delayed recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia in male mice, whereas this effect was absent in the spared nerve injury-induced chronic pain. Pretreatment with peripheral analgesics could prevent the delayed recovery induced by acute nociception. Furthermore, we found that acute noxious stimuli, induced by the injection of capsaicin under sevoflurane anesthesia, increased c-Fos expression and activity in the GABAergic neurons of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Specific reactivation of capsaicin-activated vlPAG<sup>GABA</sup> neurons mimicked the effect of capsaicin and its chemogenetic inhibition prevented the delayed recovery from anesthesia induced by capsaicin. Finally, we revealed that the vlPAG<sup>GABA</sup> neurons regulated the recovery from anesthesia through the inhibition of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neuronal activity, thus decreasing dopamine (DA) release and activation of DA D<SUB>1</SUB>-like receptors in the brain. These findings reveal a novel, cell- and circuit-based mechanism for regulating anesthesia recovery by nociception, and it is important to provide new insights for guiding the management of the anesthesia recovery period.</p>

                <p>Naturalistic observations show that animals pre-empt danger by moving to locations that increase their success in avoiding future threats. To test this in humans, we created a spatial margin of safety (MOS) decision task that quantifies pre-emptive avoidance by measuring the distance subjects place themselves to safety when facing different threats whose attack locations vary in predictability. Behavioral results show that human participants place themselves closer to safe locations when facing threats that attack in spatial locations with more outliers. Using both univariate and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) on fMRI data collected during a 2&nbsp;h session on participants of both sexes, we demonstrate a dissociable role for the vmPFC in MOS-related decision-making. MVPA results revealed that the posterior vmPFC encoded for more unpredictable threats with univariate analyses showing a functional coupling with the amygdala and hippocampus. Conversely, the anterior vmPFC was more active for the more predictable attacks and showed coupling with the striatum. Our findings converge in showing that during pre-emptive danger, the anterior vmPFC may provide a safety signal, possibly via foreseeable outcomes, while the posterior vmPFC drives unpredictable danger signals.</p>

                <p>Current anesthetic theory is mostly based on neurons and/or neuronal circuits. A role for astrocytes also has been shown in promoting recovery from volatile anesthesia, while the exact modulatory mechanism and/or the molecular target in astrocytes is still unknown. In this study by animal models in male mice and electrophysiological recordings in vivo and in vitro, we found that activating astrocytes of the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) and/or knocking down PVT astrocytic Kir4.1 promoted the consciousness recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the PVT reveals two distinct cellular subtypes of glutamatergic neurons: PVT<I><sup>GRM</sup></I> and PVT<I><sup>ChAT</sup></I> neurons. Patch-clamp recording results proved astrocytic Kir4.1-mediated modulation of sevoflurane on the PVT mainly worked on PVT<I><sup>ChAT</sup></I> neurons, which projected mainly to the mPFC. In summary, our findings support the novel conception that there is a specific PVT-&gt;prefrontal cortex projection involved in consciousness recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia, which is mediated by the inhibition of sevoflurane on PVT astrocytic Kir4.1 conductance.</p>

                <p>Recent studies suggest that time estimation relies on bodily rhythms and interoceptive signals. We provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence suggesting an association between the brain's processing of heartbeat and duration judgment. We examined heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) and contingent negative variation (CNV) during an auditory duration-reproduction task and a control reaction-time task spanning 4, 8, and 12&nbsp;s intervals, in both male and female participants. Interoceptive awareness was assessed with the Self-Awareness Questionnaire (SAQ) and interoceptive accuracy through the heartbeat-counting task (HCT). Results revealed that SAQ scores, but not the HCT, correlated with mean reproduced durations with higher SAQ scores associating with longer and more accurate duration reproductions. Notably, the HEP amplitude changes during the encoding phase of the timing task, particularly within 130&ndash;270&nbsp;ms (HEP1) and 470&ndash;520&nbsp;ms (HEP2) after the <I>R</I>-peak, demonstrated interval-specific modulations that did not emerge in the control task. A significant ramp-like increase in HEP2 amplitudes occurred during the duration-encoding phase of the timing but not during the control task. This increase within the reproduction phase of the timing task correlated significantly with the reproduced durations for the 8&nbsp;s and the 4&nbsp;s intervals. The larger the increase in HEP2, the greater the under-reproduction of the estimated duration. CNV components during the encoding phase of the timing task were more negative than those in the reaction-time task, suggesting greater executive resources orientation toward time. We conclude that interoceptive awareness (SAQ) and cortical responses to heartbeats (HEP) predict duration reproductions, emphasizing the embodied nature of time.</p>

                <p>Models of human categorization predict the prefrontal cortex (PFC) serves a central role in category learning. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) have been implicated in categorization; however, it is unclear whether both are critical for categorization and whether they support unique functions. We administered three categorization tasks to patients with PFC lesions (mean age, 69.6&nbsp;years; 5 men, 5 women) to examine how the prefrontal subregions contribute to categorization. These included a rule-based (RB) task that was solved via a unidimensional rule, an information integration (II) task that was solved by combining information from two stimulus dimensions, and a deterministic/probabilistic (DP) task with stimulus features that had varying amounts of category-predictive information. Compared with healthy comparison participants, both patient groups had impaired performance. Impairments in the dlPFC patients were largest during the RB task, whereas impairments in the vmPFC patients were largest during the DP task. A hierarchical model was fit to the participants&rsquo; data to assess learning deficits in the patient groups. PFC damage was correlated with a regularization term that limited updates to attention after each trial. Our results suggest that the PFC, as a whole, is important for learning to orient attention to relevant stimulus information. The dlPFC may be especially important for rule-based learning, whereas the vmPFC may be important for focusing attention on deterministic (highly diagnostic) features and ignoring less predictive features. These results support overarching functions of the dlPFC in executive functioning and the vmPFC in value-based decision-making.</p>

Knowledge integration based on the relationship between structure and function of the neural substrate is one of the main targets of neuroinformatics and data-driven computational modeling. However, the multiplicity of data sources, the diversity of benchmarks, the mixing of observables of different natures, and the necessity of a long-term, systematic approach make such a task challenging. Here we present a first snapshot of a long-term integrative modeling program designed to address this issue in the domain of the visual system: a comprehensive spiking model of cat primary visual cortex. The presented model satisfies an extensive range of anatomical, statistical and functional constraints under a wide range of visual input statistics. In the presence of physiological levels of tonic stochastic bombardment by spontaneous thalamic activity, the modeled cortical reverberations self-generate a sparse asynchronous ongoing activity that quantitatively matches a range of experimentally measured statistics. When integrating feed-forward drive elicited by a high diversity of visual contexts, the simulated network produces a realistic, quantitatively accurate interplay between visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductances; contrast-invariant orientation-tuning width; center surround interactions; and stimulus-dependent changes in the precision of the neural code. This integrative model offers insights into how the studied properties interact, contributing to a better understanding of visual cortical dynamics. It provides a basis for future development towards a comprehensive model of low-level perception.

The band 3 transporter is a critical integral membrane protein of the red blood cell (RBC), as it is responsible for catalyzing the exchange of bicarbonate and chloride anions across the plasma membrane. To elucidate the structural mechanism of the band 3 transporter, detergent solubilized human ghost membrane reconstituted in nanodiscs was applied to a cryo-EM holey carbon grid to define its composition. With this approach, we identified and determined structural information of the human band 3 transporter. Here, we present 5 different cryo-EM structures of the transmembrane domain of dimeric band 3, either alone or bound with chloride or bicarbonate. Interestingly, we observed that human band 3 can form both symmetric and asymmetric dimers with a different combination of outward-facing (OF) and inward-facing (IF) states. These structures also allow us to obtain the first model of a human band 3 molecule at the IF conformation. Based on the structural data of these dimers, we propose a model of ion transport that is in favor of the elevator-type mechanism.

                Optic neuropathy is very rare and exceptionally inaugural in systemic erythematous lupus erythematosus (SLE), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a novel clinical disorder. What makes this observation unique is the combination of these two pathologies. We Hereby present the case of a severe presentation of PRES in a 15-year-old girl who was transferred to the intensive care unit for worsening hypertension and abdominal pain. The patient was first admitted to the adult medical department for sudden onset of binocular blindness. Therefore, antihypertensive drugs were prescribed and mechanical ventilation was required. A head computed tomography and MRI supported the diagnosis of PRES. The course was marked by a progressive improvement in blood pressure and recovery of normal vision after 2 days. The patient was transferred to the nephrology department for renal biopsy. The diagnosis of SLE was based on four ACR criteria: positive ANA, positive anti-DNA, proteinuria greater than 0.5 g/l and lymphopenia. In the presence of PRES, there should be no hesitation in requesting an immunological workup to look for a systemic disease. Despite a worrying clinical and radiological presentation, the prognosis of PRES remains favorable.

                This paper critically evaluates the UK’s policy responses to forced marriage through a postmodernist lens. Utilising data from the UK Forced Marriage Unit (FMU), which supported 302 cases in 2022 involving possible forced marriage or female genital mutilation, this paper highlights the complexity of addressing forced marriage as a human rights violation. To begin, the paper discusses three primary policy approaches employed by the UK in combatting forced marriages, which are regulation, exit, and community engagement. Through a postmodernist analysis, this paper critiques the essentialist view of forced marriage as a cultural problem and argues for a more nuanced understanding that incorporates diverse experiences and intersecting sociological, political, and economic factors. Due to this, this paper recommends removing forced marriage from the ‘honour-based abuse’ category and advocates for the implementation of reliable data-collecting methods to better address this issue.

[version 4; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Administration of local anesthesia via injection is the main reason for inducing anxiety in children and if not intervened it aggravates the anxiety in subsequent appointments. There are many approaches, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods that can be used to reduce children’s perception of pain and anxiety. A frequently used non-pharmacological behaviour management method to reduce anxiety and procedure pain is distraction. The rationale of distraction is to shift the attention to avert the brain from receiving unwanted stimulus which induce anxiousness. Many approaches including music, television, portable video games, virtual reality (VR) helmet, and virtual reality audio-visual eyewear, have been implemented so far. Kaleidoscope and virtual reality goggles may help as distraction techniques in reducing the levels of anxiety caused during administration of local anesthesia. By the aid of which the operator may be able to make the dental experience child friendly and ultimately provide quality dental care to anxious children. Non pharmacological measures of reducing pain are cost effective and best means that can be used while performing dental procedures. This is a research protocol for a study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of kaleidoscope and virtual reality goggles to reduce dental anxiety in young children.

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether arterial spin labeling perfusion images of healthy controls can enhance ictal single-photon emission computed tomography analysis and whether the acquisition of the interictal image can be omitted.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed 2 pipelines: The first uses ictal and interictal images and compares these to single-photon emission computed tomography and arterial spin labeling of healthy controls. The second pipeline uses only the ictal image and the analogous healthy controls. Both pipelines were compared to the gold standard analysis and evaluated on data of individuals with epilepsy who underwent ictal single-photon emission computed tomography imaging during presurgical evaluation between 2010 and 2022. Fifty healthy controls prospectively underwent arterial spin labeling imaging. The correspondence between the detected hyperperfusion and the postoperative resection cavity or the presumably affected lobe was assessed using Dice score and mean Euclidean distance. Additionally, the outcomes of the pipelines were automatically assigned to 1 of 5 concordance categories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Inclusion criteria were met by 43 individuals who underwent epilepsy surgery and by 73 non-surgical individuals with epilepsy. Compared to the gold standard analysis, both pipelines resulted in significantly higher Dice scores and lower mean distances (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The combination of both provided localizing results in 85/116 cases, compared to 54/116 generated by the current gold standard analysis and the ictal image alone produced localizing results in 60/116 (52%) cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose a new ictal single-photon emission computed tomography protocol; it finds relevantly more ictal hyperperfusion, and halves the radiation dose in about half of the individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Increased population growth and imbalance between the need for rice are driving the conversion of numerous rice fields into non-agricultural zones and posing a significant threat to national food security. Therefore, this research is carried out to effectively address Indonesian government’s policy in preventing conversion of rice fields due to the lack of harmonization between cross-sectoral policies. Method A juridical-normative research method is used to analyze policy problems through legal theory and reality. The method is studying regulations against social phenomenon in food security sourced from the unconformity between the policies and the reality. It started by elaborating a way of thought, synthesizing conclusions, stating errors, and advising the re-formulation of policies to change the appropriation of land that in turn will affect national food security. Results The results show that there is proposed concept for reformulating rice field policies to integrate policies across sectors, ensure coherence in policy planning, and enhance the efficiency policies. The addition and harmonization of the components will strengthen the protection of the rice fields while preventing inconsistency and overlapping of authority from different sectors. The realization of this re-formulation will in time manifest national food security. Conclusions Indonesian government stipulates various policies to prevent the conversion of rice fields and to manifest national food security. However, of inconsistency and overlapping authority persist in its practice. Further close examination and reviews show the need reformation of policy for a transfer of land appropriation.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrone and estradiol differentially modulate neuroplasticity and cognition. How they influence the maturation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus, however, is not known. The present study assessed the effects of estrone and estradiol on the maturation timeline of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of ovariectomized (a model of surgical menopause) young adult Sprague–Dawley rats using daily subcutaneous injections of 17β-estradiol, estrone or vehicle. Rats were injected with a DNA synthesis marker, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were perfused 1, 2, or 3 weeks after BrdU injection and daily hormone treatment. Brains were sectioned and processed for various markers including: sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), antigen kiel 67 (Ki67), doublecortin (DCX), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Immunofluorescent labeling or co-labelling of BrdU with Sox2 (progenitor cells), Sox2/GFAP (neural progenitor cells), Ki67 (cell proliferation), DCX (immature neurons), NeuN (mature neurons) was used to examine the trajectory and maturation of adult-born neurons over time. Estrogens had early (1 week of exposure) effects on different stages of neurogenesis (neural progenitor cells, cell proliferation and early maturation of new cells into neurons) but these effects were less pronounced after prolonged treatment. Estradiol enhanced, whereas estrone reduced cell proliferation after 1 week but not after longer exposure to either estrogen. Both estrogens increased the density of immature neurons (BrdU/DCX-ir) after 1 week of exposure compared to vehicle treatment but this increased density was not sustained over longer durations of treatments to estrogens, suggesting that the enhancing effects of estrogens on neurogenesis were short-lived. Longer duration post-ovariectomy, without treatments with either of the estrogens, was associated with reduced neural progenitor cells in the DG. These results demonstrate that estrogens modulate several aspects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis differently in the short term, but may lose their ability to influence neurogenesis after long-term exposure. These findings have potential implications for treatments involving estrogens after surgical menopause.</p>

                In this issue of Neuron, Chadarevian et al. and Munro et al. demonstrate how the absence of homeostatic microglia leads to severe neuropathologies, including axonal spheroids, calcifications, myelination abnormalities, and gliosis, associated with leukoencephalopathy and age-related neurodegeneration. Transplantation of healthy microglia can reverse these conditions, opening new avenues for therapeutic research.

                Precisely tracking time over second-long timescales is important for accurate anticipation and consequential actions, yet the neurobiological underpinnings remain unknown. In this issue of Neuron, Garcia-Garcia and colleagues show that computations in the cerebellum resulting from interactions between the mossy fiber and climbing fiber pathways contribute to long-interval learning during operant conditioning.

">Effective excitability captures network dynamics across development and phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal cultures in vitro are a versatile system for studying the fundamental properties of individual neurons and neuronal networks. Recently, this approach has gained attention as a precision medicine tool. Mature neuronal cultures in vitro exhibit synchronized collective dynamics called network bursting. If analyzed appropriately, this activity could offer insights into the network's properties, such as its composition, topology, and developmental and pathological processes. A promising method for investigating the collective dynamics of neuronal networks is to map them onto simplified dynamical systems. This approach allows the study of dynamical regimes and the characteristics of the parameters that lead to data-consistent activity. We designed a simple biophysically inspired dynamical system and used Bayesian inference to fit it to a large number of recordings of in vitro population activity. Even with a small number of parameters, the model showed strong inter-parameter dependencies leading to invariant bursting dynamics for many parameter combinations. We further validated this observation in our analytical solution. We found that in vitro bursting can be well characterized by each of three dynamical regimes: oscillatory, bistable, and excitable. The probability of finding a data-consistent match in a particular regime changes with network composition and development. The more informative way to describe the in vitro network bursting is the effective excitability, which we analytically show to be related to the parameter-invariance of the model's dynamics. We establish that the effective excitability can be estimated directly from the experimentally recorded data. Finally, we demonstrate that effective excitability reliably detects the differences between cultures of cortical, hippocampal, and human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, allowing us to map their developmental trajectories. Our results open a new avenue for the model-based description of in vitro network phenotypes emerging across different experimental conditions.

">Learning reshapes the hippocampal representation hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                A key feature of biological and artificial neural networks is the progressive refinement of their neural representations with experience. In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a spatial-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.

">Cellular and circuit features distinguish dentate gyrus semilunar granule cells and granule cells activated during contextual memory formation</a></h4>

              
                The dentate gyrus is critical for spatial memory formation and shows task related activation of cellular ensembles considered as memory engrams. Semilunar granule cells (SGCs), a sparse dentate projection neuron subtype distinct from granule cells (GCs), were recently reported to be enriched among behaviorally activated neurons. However, the mechanisms governing SGC recruitment during memory formation and their role in engram refinement remains unresolved. By examining neurons labeled during contextual memory formation in TRAP2 mice, we empirically tested competing hypotheses for GC and SGC recruitment into memory ensembles. In support of the proposal that more excitable neurons are preferentially recruited into memory ensembles, SGCs showed greater sustained firing than GCs. Additionally, SGCs labeled during memory formation showed less adapting firing than unlabeled SGCs. Our recordings did not reveal glutamatergic connections between behaviorally labeled SGCs and GCs, providing evidence against SGCs driving local circuit feedforward excitation in ensemble recruitment. Contrary to a leading hypothesis, there was little evidence for individual SGCs or labeled neuronal ensembles supporting lateral inhibition of unlabeled neurons. Instead, pairs of GCs and SGCs within labeled neuronal cohorts received more temporally correlated spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs than labeled-unlabeled neuronal pairs, validating a role for correlated afferent inputs in neuronal ensemble selection. These findings challenge the proposal that SGCs drive dentate GC ensemble refinement, while supporting a role for intrinsic active properties and correlated inputs in preferential SGC recruitment to contextual memory engrams.

">A Hippocampal-parietal Network for Reference Frame Coordination</a></h4>

              
                Navigating space and forming memories based on spatial experience are crucial for survival, including storing memories in an allocentric (map-like) framework and conversion into body-centered action. The hippocampus and parietal cortex (PC) comprise a network for coordinating these reference frames, though the mechanism remains unclear. We used a task requiring remembering previous spatial locations to make correct future action and observed that hippocampus can encode the allocentric place, while PC encodes upcoming actions and relays this to hippocampus. Transformation from location to action unfolds gradually, with 'Came From' signals diminishing and future action representations strengthening. PC sometimes encodes previous spatial locations in a route-based reference frame and conveys this to hippocampus. The signal for the future location appears first in PC, and then in hippocampus, in the form of an egocentric direction of future goal locations, suggesting egocentric encoding recently observed in hippocampus may originate in PC (or another "upstream" structure). Bidirectional signaling suggests a coordinated mechanism for integrating map-like, route-centered, and person-centered spatial reference frames at the network level during navigation.

">Grin1Y647S/+ Mice: A Preclinical Model of GRIN1-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Objective: GRIN1-related neurodevelopmental disorder (GRIN1-NDD) is characterized by clinically significant variation in the GRIN1 gene, which encodes the obligatory GluN1 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). The identified p.Tyr647Ser (Y647S) variant carried by a 33-year-old female with seizures and intellectual disability is located in the M3 helix in the GluN1 transmembrane domain. This study builds upon initial in vitro investigations of the functional impacts of the GRIN1 Y647S variant and examines its in vivo consequences in a mouse model. Methods: To investigate in vitro functional impacts of NMDARs containing GluN1-Y647S variant subunits, GluN1-Y647S was co-expressed with wildtype GluN2A or GluN2B subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK cells. Grin1Y647S/+ mice were created by CRISPR-Cas9 endonuclease-mediated transgenesis and the molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioural consequences of the variant were examined. Results: In vitro, NMDARs containing GluN1-Y647S show altered sensitivity to endogenous agonists and negative allosteric modulators, and reduced cell surface trafficking. Grin1Y647S/+ mice displayed a reduction in whole brain GluN1 levels and deficiency in NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Behaviourally, Grin1Y647S/+ mice exhibited spontaneous seizures, altered vocalizations, muscle strength, sociability, and problem-solving. Interpretation: The Y647S variant confers a complex in vivo phenotype, which reflects largely diminished properties of NMDAR function. As a result, Grin1Y647S/+ mice display atypical behaviour in domains relevant to the clinical characteristics of GRIN1-NDD and the individual carrying the variant. Ultimately, the characterization of Grin1Y647S/+ mice accomplished in the present work expands our understanding of the mechanisms underlying GRIN1-NDD and provides a foundation for the development of novel therapeutics.

">Differentiable simulation enables large-scale training of detailed biophysical models of neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Biophysical neuron models provide insights into cellular mechanisms underlying neural computations. However, a central challenge has been the question of how to identify the parameters of detailed biophysical models such that they match physiological measurements at scale or such that they perform computational tasks. Here, we describe a framework for simulation of detailed biophysical models in neuroscience---Jaxley---which addresses this challenge. By making use of automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration, Jaxley opens up the possibility to efficiently optimize large-scale biophysical models with gradient descent. We show that Jaxley can learn parameters of biophysical neuron models with several hundreds of parameters to match voltage or two photon calcium recordings, sometimes orders of magnitude more efficiently than previous methods. We then demonstrate that Jaxley makes it possible to train biophysical neuron models to perform computational tasks. We train a recurrent neural network to perform working memory tasks, and a feedforward network of morphologically detailed neurons with 100,000 parameters to solve a computer vision task. Our analyses show that Jaxley dramatically improves the ability to build large-scale data- or task-constrained biophysical models, creating unprecedented opportunities for investigating the mechanisms underlying neural computations across multiple scales.

">Spatial and morphological organization of mitochondria across a connectome</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal function depends critically on the cell biological organization of mitochondria, which regulate calcium signals and produce energy, among other roles. However, little is known about how mitochondria are organized within the circuits of neurons that make up each brain. To uncover the systematic rules that govern mitochondria shape and position in a connectome, we analyzed the morphological and spatial organization of more than 100,000 mitochondria in over 1,000 visual projection neurons in the Drosophila connectome. We found that mitochondrial shape and size differ systematically between cell types, and are distinct enough between cell types to serve as an identifying fingerprint. Moreover, we derived three quantitative rules that describe how mitochondria are positioned within neurons relative to synapses and other subcellular features: (1) they are positioned with a precision of 2-3 microns; (2) their relative preference for pre- and postsynaptic sites and other subcellular features differs between axons and dendrites; (3) their positions were specialized to different cell types. These organizing rules correlated with functional and anatomical properties of the cells, including visual responses and input connectivity. We also find that, in the fly's olfactory associative learning circuits, mitochondria are enriched at presynapses to particular postsynaptic cells by accumulating in functional sub-compartments of axons. Overall, our findings reveal a robust set of organizing principles for mitochondria within and between cells, uncovering cell biology that maps onto the organization of the connectome and adding new dimensions for understanding circuit function in the connectome.

                Computational models that predict effects of neural stimulation can be used as a preliminary tool to inform in-vivo research, reducing the costs, time, and ethical considerations involved. However, current models do not support the diverse neural stimulation techniques used in-vivo, including the expanding selection of electrodes, stimulation modalities, and stimulation paradigms. To develop a more comprehensive software, we created several extensions to The Virtual Electrode Recording Tool for EXtracellular Potentials (VERTEX), the MATLAB-based neural stimulation tool from Newcastle University. VERTEX simulates input currents in a large population of multi-compartment neurons within a small cortical slice to model electric field stimulation, while recording local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity. Our extensions to its existing electric field stimulation framework include multiple pairs of parametrically defined electrodes and biphasic, bipolar stimulation delivered at programmable delays. To support the growing use of optogenetic approaches for targeted neural stimulation, we introduced a feature that models optogenetic stimulation through an additional VERTEX input function that converts irradiance to currents at optogenetically responsive neurons. Finally, we added extensions to allow complex stimulation protocols including paired-pulse, spatiotemporal patterned, and closed-loop stimulation. We demonstrated our novel features using VERTEX's built-in functionalities, illustrating how these extensions can be used to efficiently and systematically test diverse, targeted, and individualized stimulation patterns.

">mCLAS adaptively rescues disease-specific sleep and wake phenotypes in neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Sleep alterations are hallmarks of prodromal Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), with fundamental neuropathological processes of both diseases showing susceptibility of change upon deep sleep modulation. However, promising pharmacological deep sleep enhancement results are hindered by specificity and scalability issues, thus advocating for noninvasive slow-wave activity (SWA) boosting methods to investigate the links between deep sleep and neurodegeneration. Accordingly, we have recently introduced mouse closed-loop auditory stimulation (mCLAS), which is able to successfully boost SWA during deep sleep in neurodegeneration models. Here, we aim at further exploring mCLAS' acute effect onto disease-specific sleep and wake alterations in AD (Tg2576) and PD (M83) mice. We found that mCLAS adaptively rescues pathological sleep and wake traits depending on the disease-specific impairments observed at baseline in each model. Notably, in AD mice mCLAS significantly increases NREM long/short bout ratio, decreases vigilance state distances by decreasing transition velocities and increases the percentage of cumulative time spent in NREM sleep in the last three hours of the dark period. Contrastingly, in PD mice mCLAS significantly decreases NREM sleep consolidation, by potentiating faster and more frequent transitions between vigilance states, decreases average EMG muscle tone during REM sleep and increases alpha power in WAKE and NREM sleep. Overall, our results indicate that mCLAS selectively prompts an acute alleviation of neurodegeneration-associated sleep and wake phenotypes, by either potentiating sleep consolidation and vigilance state stability in AD or by rescuing bradysomnia and decreasing cortical hyperexcitability in PD. Further experiments assessing the electrophysiological, neuropathological and behavioural long-term effects of mCLAS in neurodegeneration may majorly impact the clinical establishment of sleep-based therapies.

">Behavioral and neural correlates of diverse conditioned fear responses in male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                Pavlovian fear conditioning is a widely used tool that models associative learning in rodents. For decades the field has used predominantly male rodents and focused on a sole conditioned fear response: freezing. However, recent work from our lab and others has identified darting as a female-biased conditioned response, characterized by an escape-like movement across a fear conditioning chamber. It is also accompanied by a behavioral phenotype: Darters reliably show decreased freezing compared to Non-darters and males and reach higher velocities in response to the foot shock (shock response). However, the relationship between shock response and conditioned darting is not known. This study investigated if this link is due to differences in general processing of aversive stimuli between Darters, Non-darters and males. Across a variety of modalities, including corticosterone measures, the acoustic startle test, and sensitivity to thermal pain, Darters were found not to be more reactive or sensitive to aversive stimuli, and, in some cases, they appear less reactive to Non-darters and males. Analyses of cFos activity in regions involved in pain and fear processing following fear conditioning identified discrete patterns of expression among Darters, Non-darters, and males exposed to low and high intensity foot shocks. The results from these studies further our understanding of the differences between Darters, Non-darters and males and highlight the importance of studying individual differences in fear conditioning as indicators of fear state.

">Transcriptional Dynamics of Sleep Deprivation and Subsequent Recovery Sleep in the Male Mouse Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is an essential, tightly regulated biological function. Sleep is also a homeostatic process, with the need to sleep increasing as a function of being awake. Acute sleep deprivation (SD) increases sleep need, and subsequent recovery sleep (RS) discharges it. SD is known to alter brain gene expression in rodents, but it remains unclear which changes are linked to sleep homeostasis, SD-related impairments, or non-sleep-specific effects. To investigate this question, we analyzed RNA-seq data from adult wild-type male mice subjected to 3 and 5-6 hours of SD and 2 and 6 hours of RS after SD. We hypothesized molecular changes associated with sleep homeostasis mirror sleep pressure dynamics as defined by brain electrical activity, peaking at 5-6 hours of SD, and are no longer differentially expressed after 2 hours of RS. We report 5-6 hours of SD produces the largest effect on gene expression, affecting approximately half of the cortical transcriptome, with most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) downregulated. The majority of DEGs normalize after 2 hours of RS and are involved in redox metabolism, chromatin regulation, and DNA damage/repair. Additionally, RS affects gene expression related to mitochondrial metabolism and Wnt-signaling, potentially contributing to its restorative effects. DEGs associated with cholesterol metabolism and stress response do not normalize within 6 hours and may be non-sleep-specific. Finally, DEGs involved in insulin signaling, MAPK signaling, and RNA-binding may mediate the impairing effects of SD. Overall, our results offer insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis and the broader effects of SD.

">Anti-NMDAR encephalitis alters intrinsic spatiotemporal coding by enhancing neuronal coupling and clustering</a></h4>

              
                Autoimmune anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis is characterized by severe neuropsychiatric symptoms including memory dysfunction and seizures. However, it remains enigmatic what functional changes at the multi-neuronal level mediate network dysfunction. We used two-photon in vivo recording in a passive-transfer mouse model with patient's monoclonal anti-GluN1-autoantibodies during slow-wave sleep-like conditions, a critical phase for memory processing. We find enhanced functional coupling and clustering between hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), which intrinsically expose the network to hypersynchrony. These connectivity changes are associated with a selective preservation of strong excitatory synapses despite overall reduced excitation, thus enhancing hub-like properties of functionally connected PNs. Furthermore, we find abnormal PN firing characteristics, decreased transmission failure, and increased similarity of spontaneous spatiotemporal activity patterns, all affecting CA1 intrinsic neuronal coding. Collectively, the functional rewiring of hippocampal networks and altered intrinsic information processing provide new mechanistic insights into the NMDAR-hypofunction consequences and pathomechanisms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis symptomatology.

">Revisiting equivalent optical properties for cerebrospinal fluid to improve diffusion-based modeling accuracy in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Significance: The diffusion approximation (DA) is used in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies despite its known limitations due to the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Nearly all of these studies rely on a set of empirical CSF optical properties, recommended by a previous simulation study, that were not selected for the purpose of minimizing DA modeling errors. Aim: We aim to directly quantify the accuracy of DA solutions in brain models by comparing those with the gold-standard solutions produced by the mesh-based Monte Carlo (MMC), based on which we derive updated recommendations. Approach: For both a 5-layer head and Colin27 atlas models, we obtain DA solutions by independently sweeping the CSF absorption (a) and reduced scattering ('s) coefficients. Using an MMC solution with literature CSF optical properties as reference, we compute the errors for surface fluence, total brain sensitivity and brain energy-deposition, and identify the optimized settings where the such error is minimized. Results: Our results suggest that previously recommended CSF properties can cause significant errors (8.7% to 52%) in multiple tested metrics. By simultaneously sweeping a and 's, we can identify infinite numbers of solutions that can exactly match DA with MMC solutions for any single tested metric. Furthermore, it is also possible to simultaneously minimize multiple metrics at multiple source/detector separations, leading to our new recommendation of setting 's = 0.15 mm-1 while maintaining physiological a for CSF in DA simulations. Conclusion: Our new recommendation of CSF equivalent optical properties can greatly reduce the model mismatches between DA and MMC solutions at multiple metrics without sacrificing computational speed. We also show that it is possible to eliminate such a mismatch for a single or a pair of metrics of interest.

">Immediate TMS-EEG responses reveal motor cortex excitability</a></h4>

              
                Background: Combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is widely used to probe cortical excitability at the network level, but technical challenges have prevented its application to investigate local excitability of the stimulated area. A recent study revealed immediate TMS-evoked potentials (i-TEPs) after primary motor cortex (M1) stimulation, suggesting that it may represent a local response. Here, we aimed at testing if this activity is physiological in nature and what it represents. Methods: We analyzed a TMS-EEG dataset from 28 healthy participants recorded at 9.6 kHz including two M1 stimulation conditions with opposite biphasic current directions. We localized the brain sources of i-TEPs, calculated the immediate TMS-related power (i-TRP) to distinguish between two oscillatory components that may contribute to i-TEPs, and investigated the relationship between i-TRP and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). In an additional recording, we stimulated a control site evoking a muscular response to understand the contribution of the TMS-related muscle artifact. Results: Results confirmed i-TEPs with similar characteristics as previously described. The i-TRP revealed strong activity in two ranges 600-800 Hz and 100-200 Hz; The former was positively associated with MEPs amplitude for both current direction conditions. Moreover, i-TEPs were localized in the precentral gyrus of the stimulated hemisphere and the muscular response generated by the control stimulation site differed from i-TEPs and i-TRP. Discussion: These findings provide first evidence on the physiological nature of i-TEPs and i-TRP following M1 stimulation and that i-TRP represents a direct measure of excitability of the stimulated cortex.

">Data acquisition strategies to reduce cardiac-induced noise in brain maps of R2* and magnetic susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Cardiac pulsation increases the noise level in brain MR images. Maps of the transverse relaxation rate R2* and magnetic susceptibility (QSM) are particularly affected by cardiac-induced noise as they are computed from gradient-echo data acquired at multiple echo times. Here, we introduce two data acquisition strategies to mitigate the impact of cardiac-induced noise in brain maps of R2* and QSM. Methods: The proposed strategies are based on the higher level of cardiac-induced noise near the k-space centre. Using a pseudo-spiral sampling trajectory, the first strategy allows for the acquisition of a specific number of averages at each k-space location, set from the local level of cardiac-induced noise. The second strategy synchronizes the acquisition with the cardiac cycle in real time. We compared in 10 healthy volunteers, the variability of data acquired across 4 repetitions and in the same session, using both strategies and with a standard linear trajectory. Results: Compared to linear sampling, the pseudo-spiral trajectory reduced the variability of R2* and QSM maps across repetitions by 26/28/22% and 19/18/16% in the brainstem/cerebellum/whole brain, for a 14% increase in scan time. The pseudo-spiral sampling also reduced the level of aliasing artifacts from pulsating blood vessels. The cardiac-triggered trajectory did not reduce the variability of R2* or QSM maps. Conclusion: Pseudo-spiral k-space trajectories can be designed to mitigate cardiac-induced noise in brain maps of the MRI parameters R2* and QSM. Synchronization of the acquisition with the cardiac cycle in real time did not lead to any reduction in cardiac-induced noise.

">Evidence for belief updating in decision-variable space: past decisions with finer granularity attract future ones more strongly</a></h4>

              
                Essential to adaptive intelligence is the ability to create mental spaces where knowledge from past experiences cumulates and integrates with newly acquired information. When engaged in decision- making tasks, humans are known to create such a space and therein form decision variables, which integrate task-essential information from multiple sources in a generalizable form. Much effort has focused on the cognitive and neural processes involved in forming decision variables. However, there is limited understanding of how decision variables, once formed, are utilized to adapt to the environment. Considering the abstract and generalizable nature of decision variables, we reason that decision-makers would benefit from shaping and updating probabilistic knowledge-known as belief-within the decision-variable space. As one such belief updating, we hypothesize that an act of decision commitment restricts the current belief about the decision variable to a range of states corresponding to that decision. This implies that past decisions not only attract future ones but also exert a greater pull when those decisions are made with finer granularity-dubbed the granularity effect. Here, we present the findings of seven psychophysical experiments that consistently confirm these implications while ruling out the stimulus and action space as potential loci of the granularity effect. Further, as a principled and unified account of the granularity effect and other history effects found in various perceptual tasks, we offer a Bayesian model where beliefs are updated separately in the stimulus and decision-variable spaces. Our work demonstrates how humans leverage the abstract and generalizable nature of the decision-variable space to effectively adapt to their surroundings, expanding the gamut of human intellect.

                This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying the axonal localization of the sex peptide receptor, a pivotal G-protein coupled receptor in the Drosophila melanogaster post-mating response cascade. Utilizing transgenic expression, neuronal labeling, and bioinformatics analyses, we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of SPR is indispensable for its axonal targeting in both Drosophila larval ventral nerve cord neurons and mouse hippocampal neurons. Deletion of the N-terminal domain abolished axonal localization, highlighting its critical role in this process. Intriguingly, the C-terminal domain of SPR appears to play a subordinate role in axonal targeting. Bioinformatical analysis revealed a striking homology between the N-terminus of SPR and the Broad-complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger family of proteins. The BTB domain, a conserved protein-protein interaction domain within this family, is implicated in diverse cellular processes and axonal targeting. Further investigation into the role of the BTB domain-like region in SPR could provide valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of axonal targeting and post-mating responses in Drosophila. This research contributes to our understanding of the intricate mechanisms governing GPCR localization and function in the context of reproductive biology and neuronal signaling.

                The dorsal and ventral visual streams play distinct roles in visual processing for action: the dorsal stream is assumed to support real-time actions, while the ventral stream facilitates memory-guided actions. As the recent evidence suggests a more integrated function of these streams, we investigated the neural dynamics and functional connectivity between them during memory-guided actions using intracranial EEG. We tracked neural activity in the inferior parietal lobule in the dorsal stream, and ventral temporal cortex in the ventral stream as well as hippocampus during a delayed action task. We found increased alpha power in both streams during the delay, indicating their role in maintaining visual information. We also observed an increase in theta band synchronization between the inferior parietal lobule and ventral temporal cortex, and between the inferior parietal lobule and hippocampus during the delay. Our study provides unique electrophysiological evidence for close interactions between dorsal and ventral streams, supporting an integrated processing model.

                The current study investigates whether electroencephalographic (EEG) activity reflects age-related memory changes during encoding. We recorded scalp EEG in 151 young adults (aged 18-30) and 37 older adults (aged 60-85) as they memorized lists of words. Subjects studied the word lists either under full attention or while performing a secondary task that required them to make semantic judgments about each word. Although the secondary task reduced recall among all subjects, differences in recall performance between the age groups were smaller when participants performed a secondary task at encoding. Older adults also exhibited distinct neural subsequent memory effects, characterized by less negativity in the alpha frequencies compared to young adults. Multivariate classifiers trained on neural features successfully predicted subsequent memory at the trial level in both young and older adults, and captured the differential effects of task demands on memory performance between young and older adults. The findings indicate that neural biomarkers of successful memory vary with both cognitive aging and task demands.

">Learning and embodied decisions in active inference</a></h4>

              
                Biological organisms constantly face the necessity to act timely in dynamic environments and balance choice accuracy against the risk of missing valid opportunities. As formalized by embodied decision models, this might require brain architectures wherein decision-making and motor control interact reciprocally, in stark contrast to traditional models that view them as serial processes. Previous studies have assessed that embodied decision dynamics emerge naturally under active inference - a computational paradigm that considers action and perception as subject to the same imperative of free energy minimization. In particular, agents can infer their targets by using their own movements (and not only external sensations) as evidence, i.e., via self-evidencing. Such models have shown that under appropriate conditions, action-generated feedback can stabilize and improve decision processes. However, how adaptation of internal models to environmental contingencies influences embodied decisions is yet to be addressed. To shed light on this challenge, in this study we systematically investigate the learning dynamics of an embodied model of decision-making during a two-alternative forced choice task, using a hybrid (discrete and continuous) active inference framework. Our results show that active inference agents can adapt to embodied contexts by learning various statistical regularities of the task - namely, prior preferences for the correct target, cue validity, and response strategies that prioritize faster or slower (but more accurate) decisions. Crucially, these results illustrate the efficacy of learning discrete preferences and strategies using sensorimotor feedback from continuous dynamics.

">Optimization of TMS target engagement: novel evidence based on combined TMS-EEG and dMRI tractography of brain circuitry</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulation is based on the principle that brain stimulation produces plastic changes in cerebral circuitry. Given the intersubject structural and functional variability, neuromodulation has a personalized effect in the brain. Moreover, because of cerebral dominance and interhemispheric functional and structural differences in the same individual, the characterization of specific brain circuitries involved is currently not feasible. This notion is extremely important for neuromodulation treatments applied in neuropsychiatry. Specifically, the efficacy of the neuromodulation treatments is critically dependent on the anatomical precision of the brain target and the circuitry which has been affected. However, a complete understanding of how the brain behaves under stimulation needs a combined characterization of its neurophysiological response. This can be achieved by TMS-EEG guided by current multimodal neuroimaging techniques in real time. Herein, we present novel data based on dMRI tractography-guided TMS-EEG on one healthy young adult volunteer.

">Neither fifty percent slow-wave sleep suppression nor fifty percent rapid eye movement sleep suppression does impair memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Establishing well-defined relationships between sleep features and memory consolidation is essential in comprehending the pathophysiology of cognitive decline commonly seen in patients with insomnia, depression, and other sleep-disrupting conditions. Twenty-eight volunteers participated in two experimental sessions: a session with selective SWS suppression during one night and a session with undisturbed night sleep (as a control condition). Fifteen of them also participated in a third session with REM suppression. Suppression was achieved by presenting an acoustic tone. In the evening and the morning, the participants completed procedural and declarative memory tasks and the Psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). Heart rate variability analysis and salivary cortisol were used to control possible stress reactions to sleep interference. SWS and REM suppression led to more than a 50 percent reduction in the amount of these stages. Neither vigilance nor memory consolidation was impaired after SWS or REM suppression. Unexpectedly, a beneficial effect of selective SWS suppression on PVT performance was found. Similarly, after a night with SWS suppression, the overnight improvement in procedural skills was higher than after a night with REM suppression and after a night with undisturbed sleep. Our data brings into question the extent to which SWS and REM are truly necessary for effective memory consolidation to proceed. Moreover, SWS suppression may even improve the performance of some tasks, possibly by reducing sleep inertia associated with undisturbed sleep.

">GPT-4V shows human-like social perceptual capabilities at phenomenological and neural levels</a></h4>

              
                Humans navigate the social world by rapidly perceiving social features from other people and their interaction. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have achieved high-level visual capabilities for detailed object and scene content recognition and description. This raises the question whether LLMs can perceive nuanced and tacit social information form images and videos, and whether the high-dimensional perceptual structure aligns with that of humans. We collected social perceptual evaluations for 138 social features from GPT-4V for images (N=468) and videos (N=234) that are derived from social movie scenes. These evaluations were compared with human evaluations (N=2254). The comparisons established that GPT-4V can achieve human-like social perceptual capabilities at the level of individual features as well as at the level of high-dimensional perceptual representations. We also modelled hemodynamic responses (N=97) to viewing socioemotional movie clips with feature annotations by human observers and GPT-4V. These results demonstrated that GPT-4V can also reproduce the social perceptual space at the neural level highly similar to reference human evaluations. These human-like social perceptual capabilities of LLMs could have wide range of real-life applications ranging from health care to business and would open exciting new avenues for behavioural and psychological research.

">Boosting Proteasome Activity: A Novel Mechanism of NMDAR Blockers Against Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                NMDAR antagonists, such as memantine and ketamine, have shown efficacy in treating neurodegenerative diseases and major depression. The mechanism by which these drugs correct the aforementioned diseases is still unknown. Our study reveals that these antagonists significantly enhance 20S proteasome activity, crucial for degrading intrinsically disordered, oxidatively damaged, or misfolded proteins, factors pivotal in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In a mouse model, ketamine administration notably altered brain synaptic protein profiles within two hours, downregulating proteins linked to neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, the altered proteins exhibited enrichment in terms related to plasticity and potentiation, including retrograde endocannabinoid signaling-a pivotal pathway in both short- and long-term plasticity that may elucidate the long-lasting effects of ketamine in major depression. Via the ubiquitin-independent 20S proteasome pathway (UIPS), these drugs maintain cellular protein homeostasis, crucial as proteasome activity declines with age leading to protein aggregation and disease symptoms. The elucidation of the mechanistic pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of NMDAR antagonists holds promise for developing new treatment strategies for brain diseases, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's.

">Beta Waves in Action: Context-Dependent Modulations of Subthalamo-Cortical Synchronization during Rapid Reversals of Movement Direction</a></h4>

              
                The role of beta band activity in cortico-basal ganglia interactions during motor control has been studied extensively in resting-state and for simple movements, such as button pressing. However, little is known about how beta oscillations change and interact in more complex situations involving rapid changes of movement in various contexts. To close this knowledge gap, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potential recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinsons disease patients to study beta dynamics during initiation, stopping, and rapid reversal of rotational movements. The action prompts were manipulated to be predictable vs. unpredictable. We observed movement-related beta suppression at motor sequence start, and a beta rebound after motor sequence stop in STN power, motor cortical power, and STN-cortex coherence. Despite involving a brief stop of movement, no clear rebound was observed during reversals of turning direction. On the cortical level, beta power decreased bilaterally following reversals, but more so in the hemisphere ipsilateral to movement, due to a floor effect on the contralateral side. In the STN, power modulations varied across patients, with patients revealing brief increases or decreases of high-beta power. Importantly, cue predictability affected these modulations. Event-related changes of STN-cortex beta coherence were generally stronger in the unpredictable than in the predictable condition. In summary, this study reveals the influence of movement context on beta oscillations in basal ganglia-cortex loops when humans change ongoing movements according to external cues. We find that movement scenarios requiring higher levels of caution involve enhanced modulations of subthalamo-cortical beta synchronization. Further, our results confirm that beta oscillations reflect the start and end of motor sequences better than movement changes within a sequence.

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) and obesity have a complex bidirectional relationship. However, most studies do not assess increased appetite or weight as a depressive symptom due to limitations in rating scales. Here we aimed to analyze frequently employed depressive-symptom scales and discuss the relevance of weight and appetite assessment items. To elaborate this perspective, we searched for validated questionnaires and scales evaluating depressive symptoms in English. We analyzed appetite and weight items from 20 depressive-symptoms rating scales. Only 8 of 20 rating scales assessed for increased weight or appetite. The scales reported in the literature as the most employed in antidepressants efficacy trials do not assess increased appetite or weight. The current use of rating scales limits our understanding of the relationship between MDD, antidepressants, and obesity. It is necessary to improve our weight and appetite measurements in MDD to clarify the respective impact of depressive symptoms and antidepressants on weight change.</p>

	<p>Sensory integration is an essential human function whose decline impacts quality of life, particularly in older adults. Herein, we propose an arm-reaching task based on a virtual reality head-mounted display system to assess sensory integration in daily life, and we examined whether reaching task performance was associated with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the brain regions involved in sensory integration. We hypothesized that declining sensory integration would affect performance during a reaching task with multiple cognitive loads. Using a task in which a young/middle-aged group showed only small individual differences, older adults showed large individual differences in the gap angle between the reaching hand and the target position, which was used to assess sensory integration function. Additionally, rsfMRI data were used to identify correlations between rsFC and performance in older adults, showing that performance was correlated with connectivity between the primary motor area and the left inferior temporal gyrus and temporo-occipital region. Connectivity between areas is related to visuomotor integration; thus, the results suggest the involvement of visuomotor integration in the decline of sensory integration function and the validity of the gap angle during this VR reaching task as an index of functional decline.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy seizure prediction is vital for enhancing the quality of life for individuals with epilepsy. In this study, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning architecture, merging DenseNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) with an attention fusion layer for seizure prediction. DenseNet captures hierarchical features and ensures efficient parameter usage, while ViT offers self-attention mechanisms and global feature representation. The attention fusion layer effectively amalgamates features from both networks, guaranteeing the most relevant information is harnessed for seizure prediction. The raw EEG signals were preprocessed using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to implement time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency analysis and convert EEG signals into time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency matrices. Then, they were fed into the proposed hybrid DenseNet&amp;amp;ndash;ViT network model to achieve end-to-end seizure prediction. The CHB-MIT dataset, including data from 24 patients, was used for evaluation and the leave-one-out cross-validation method was utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Our results demonstrate superior performance in seizure prediction, exhibiting high accuracy and low redundancy, which suggests that combining DenseNet, ViT, and the attention mechanism can significantly enhance prediction capabilities and facilitate more precise therapeutic interventions.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to analyze the effects of systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) in a model of permanent ischemic stroke (focal ischemia due to thermocoagulation of pial vessels) on sensorimotor function (cylinder test and patch removal test), behavioral tasks (novelty habituation memory open field task) and cerebral infarct size in adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) for 42 days after the occurrence of a stroke. We observed that the stroke caused asymmetry in the front paws and delayed adhesive removal. These effects were spontaneously reduced in WKY rats, but not in SHR. Short- and long-term novelty habituation memories were abolished by stroke in WYK and SHR. On the 3rd day after stroke, the size of the focal cerebral infarct was the same in WKY and SHR. However, on the 7th day, the infarct size decreased in WKY rats, but not SHR. These results suggested that SAH impairment of sensorimotor recovery in rats subjected to cerebral ischemia could be related to augmented focal cerebral infarct size. Moreover, the behavioral tasks used in this study were unaffected by Systemic Arterial Hypertension. Our results highlight the need for animal models of comorbidities in stroke research.</p>

                <p>Reverberation, a ubiquitous feature of real-world acoustic environments, exhibits statistical regularities that human listeners leverage to self-orient, facilitate auditory perception, and understand their environment. Despite the extensive research on sound source representation in the auditory system, it remains unclear how the brain represents real-world reverberant environments. Here, we characterized the neural response to reverberation of varying realism by applying multivariate pattern analysis to electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals. Human listeners (12 males and 8 females) heard speech samples convolved with real-world and synthetic reverberant impulse responses and judged whether the speech samples were in a "real" or "fake" environment, focusing on the reverberant background rather than the properties of speech itself. Participants distinguished real from synthetic reverberation with ~75% accuracy; EEG decoding reveals a multistage decoding time course, with dissociable components early in the stimulus presentation and later in the perioffset stage. The early component predominantly occurred in temporal electrode clusters, while the later component was prominent in centroparietal clusters. These findings suggest distinct neural stages in perceiving natural acoustic environments, likely reflecting sensory encoding and higher-level perceptual decision-making processes. Overall, our findings provide evidence that reverberation, rather than being largely suppressed as a noise-like signal, carries relevant environmental information and gains representation along the auditory system. This understanding also offers various applications; it provides insights for including reverberation as a cue to aid navigation for blind and visually impaired people. It also helps to enhance realism perception in immersive virtual reality settings, gaming, music, and film production.</p>

                <p>Adults heard recordings of two spatially separated speakers reading newspaper and magazine articles. They were asked to listen to one of them and ignore the other, and EEG was recorded to assess their neural processing. Machine learning extracted neural sources that tracked the target and distractor speakers at three levels: the acoustic envelope of speech (delta- and theta-band modulations), lexical frequency for individual words, and the contextual predictability of individual words estimated by GPT-4 and earlier lexical models. To provide a broader view of speech perception, half of the subjects completed a simultaneous visual task, and the listeners included both native and non-native English speakers. Distinct neural components were extracted for these levels of auditory and lexical processing, demonstrating that native English speakers had greater target&ndash;distractor separation compared with non-native English speakers on most measures, and that lexical processing was reduced by the visual task. Moreover, there was a novel interaction of lexical predictability and frequency with auditory processing; acoustic tracking was stronger for lexically harder words, suggesting that people listened harder to the acoustics when needed for lexical selection. This demonstrates that speech perception is not simply a feedforward process from acoustic processing to the lexicon. Rather, the adaptable context-sensitive processing long known to occur at a lexical level has broader consequences for perception, coupling with the acoustic tracking of individual speakers in noise.</p>

                Background: Antimicrobial Photodynamic therapy for the treatment of periodontitis is being increasingly gaining attention but at present, very limited data are available on the clinical and microbiological outcomes obtained following Indocyanine Green as the photosensitizer in Maintenance patients. The objective was to evaluate the efficiency of Indocyanine(ICG)-green based photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in patients enrolled in maintenance therapy. Methodology: Using a split mouth study design, 24 participants enrolled in the maintenance therapy, having diagnosed as Periodontitis, were randomly subjected to scaling and root planing(SRP). The test group additionally received ICG-based (Aurogreen®, Aurolabs, Madurai, India,1mg/ml) aPDT with an 810nm diode laser. Clinical assessment of Plaque index, modified Sulcus bleeding index, Probing pocket depth, Clinical loss of attachment and microbiological analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and F.nucleatum were performed at baseline and 3 months after treatment. Results: It was observed that although there was no significant difference between the test and control group at baseline and 3 months, there was a statistically significant reduction in the mean values in both the groups at 3 months. Microbiological analysis showed substantial reduction in detection frequency of the bacteria assessed at 3 months in both the groups. Conclusion: Within the limits of the study, ICG-based aPDT did not show additional advantage over SRP alone at 3 months, though it could be a promising treatment modality in maintenance patients in terms of patient comfort and the treatment time taken. More randomised clinical trials should be employed to understand the exact mode of action of ICG based aPDT and its role in treatment of periodontal disease.

                Background Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare neuroinflammatory disease that affects the cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure, resulting in symptoms of neuropathy. Case presentation We report a case of a 35-year-old male patient with no past medical history who presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of a four-day history of progressively increasing headaches associated with right eye pain and double vision. A physical examination showed findings suggestive of abducens nerve palsy. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed subtle asymmetric thickening of the right cavernous sinus, which prompted further investigation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The MRI scan showed intensely enhanced soft tissue thickening in the right cavernous sinus region, slightly extending to the right orbital apex, which caused enlargement of the cavernous sinus and appeared isointense to the adjacent muscles on T1 and T2. The diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome was made after the exclusion of all other possible pathologies. The patient received prednisolone therapy; his symptoms improved, and he was discharged after three days. Two weeks later, the patient presented again to the ED with the same symptoms and was treated symptomatically. Conclusions This case highlights a very rare etiology for painful ophthalmoplegia, which is Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Thickening of the cavernous sinus on MRI images with a background history of painful ophthalmoplegia and headache should raise clinician’s suspicion towards the disease. In addition, exclusion of other possible causes is very important, as Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion.

                Background: The use of information and communication technology such as telemedicine occupies nowadays a huge place in modern medicine practice all over the world, mainly after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its implementation in Tunisia and other developing countries has achieved little success with low utilization and can be challenging for several reasons. In this study, our aim was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practice of Tunisian medical doctors regarding telemedicine. Methods: This was a cross-sectional web survey, administered to medical doctors in Tunisia in October 2022. Respondents’ level of knowledge of telemedicine was assessed by calculating a knowledge score (0 to 12). Attitude subsections were about perceived telemedicine attributes of relative advantage, compatibility, trial ability and complexity. Results: A total of 243 participants were included. The mean age was 45 ± 9.6 years old, and 57.2% were female, with a mean of 14.3 ± 10.3 years of professional experience. The majority (95.9%) had an average or high level of computer skills. More than half (59.3%) had a poor level of telemedicine knowledge. A good level of knowledge was significantly associated with age category over 50 years (p = 0.02) and with years of experience over 10 (p = 0.03). The majority (89.3%) had a moderate or high score about perceived advantages. The majority (88.5%) accepted use of telemedicine in their future practice. Almost half (46.9%) had practiced telemedicine activities before using a mobile phone (91%) or social media (64%). The principal limitations of applying telemedicine were challenges of organization and implementation, and incomplete patient examination. Conclusions: Although Tunisian doctors’ knowledge and practice of telemedicine were unsatisfactory, their positive attitude and willingness to try it in their future practice were encouraging. There is an urgent need for implementing telemedicine in Tunisia to improve health care coverage in some unprivileged areas.

Protocol for a Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The present protocol is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO under de ID code CRD42023476313, and adheres the PRISMA-P 2015 statement. The complete checklist can be consulted in the extended data section. Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is the most common chronic disease in children worldwide. According to many guidelines topical nasal steroids (TNS) are the first-line treatment for moderate/severe AR in children, nevertheless there is no conclusive evidence about which of them is superior in terms of efficacy and safety, including their impact on child’s growth. Methods We will conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating TNS in the treatment of children with moderate/severe AR. The primary outcome is the efficacy measured with the Total Nasal Symptom Severity Score (TNSS). Secondary outcomes are quality of life, adverse events (AE), and growth velocity. We will search Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, WHO trials database and grey literature resources. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract information, and assess the risk of bias and the confidence in the estimate (with the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation [GRADE] approach). We will conduct a random-effects NMA to combine the pooled direct and indirect treatment effect estimates for each outcome if adequate data is available and transitivity and coherence assumptions are considered justifiable. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses are planned to evaluate the impact of some potential effect modifiers such as doses, co-intervention with oral antihistamines, the type of AR (intermittent or persistent), sponsorship of the study, the time of outcomes measurement and the risk of bias. We will use GRADE approach to draw conclusions from NMA. Discussion This systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to determine the relative efficacy and safety of the TNS for treatment of children with moderate/severe AR. The results will provide valuable information to assist clinicians, guideline developers, patients, and policy makers about the management of these patients, based on the best available evidence. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO number: CRD42023476313.

                Objectives new-onset relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) has rarely been communicated as a side effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (SC2V). Here we report a patient with new-onset RRMS shortly after the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose, which was diagnosed only after a relapse after the third vaccine dose. Case report the patient is a 31 year-old male who developed eye problems 48 days after the second dose of BNT162b2. The symptoms were attributed to eye strain and gradually disappeared without treatment. Further workup was negative. Three months after the third BNT162b2 dose, urinary urgency developed. Eleven months after the third BNT162b2 dose, he developed sensory and visual disturbances that were noticeable post-exercise and progressed and worsened with alcohol and heat. MRI showed typical lesions that met the Barkhof/Tintore criteria for RRMS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies revealed elevated kappa free light chains and positive oligoclonal bands. Because the revised McDonalds criteria were met, RRMS was diagnosed and ocrelizumab was started. Conclusions this case shows that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can trigger new-onset RRMS, the clinical presentation of SC2V-induced multiple sclerosis is similar to multiple sclerosis due to other triggers, and the severity of the relapses may increase with the number of boosters given. Although, rare, a neurologist should be aware of the presumably rare event in which SC2V triggers new-onset multiple sclerosis.

                Introduction This research is a systematic review aimed at synthesizing scientific evidence on the causes of university dropout, focusing on the subcategories of vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects between 2020 and June 2024. Methods Only articles addressing university dropout were considered, analyzing dimensions such as vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects. Articles published in indexed scientific journals with double-blind, double-blind peer, or open reviews between 2020 and June 2024 were included. The main databases used were Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. To assess the risk of bias in qualitative studies, the criteria from the article “Validity criteria for qualitative research: three epistemological strands for the same purpose” were used. For quantitative studies, the criteria from the article “Evaluating survey research in articles published in Library Science journals” were followed. For mixed-method studies, both sets of criteria were combined. Results A total of 23 studies were included: 15 quantitative (65.22%), 3 qualitative (13.04%), and 5 mixed-method (21.74%). All studies (100%) addressed the subcategories of socioeconomic status and institutional aspects. Regarding the academic performance subcategory, 86% of the studies addressed it, while the vocational guidance subcategory was covered by 73.91% of the studies. Conclusions Vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects are crucial for reducing university dropout. Providing adequate professional guidance, academic support, financial assistance, and strong institutional support is fundamental to improving student retention and academic success.

                Abstract* Background Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a novel treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) that is considered to be a cost-effective option. It has demonstrated positive outcomes and minimal adverse effects. By injecting PRP into the intracavernous tissue, it has the potential to promote angiogenesis and neuroregeneration, leading to a potential permanent improvement in erectile performance. The potency and safety as well as the variety of PRP administration protocols in the treatment of ED are the objectives of this paper. Method Using certain terms, a systematic search was done on three different databases: Science Directs, Scielo, and PubMed. Papers about PRP therapy for EDs within the last decade, be randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and be original studies with freely available full-text content were included in this study. This article omitted letters to the editor, reviews, and editorials regarding PRP and ED. Results Three RCT were included in this studies. The improvement is observed at one month, three months, and six months after the treatment, compared to the baseline. PRP group participants met the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) in the International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) at a higher percentage than those in the placebo group at both one month and six months. Injection of PRP leads to a superior enhancement in the IIEF-EF score, compared to a placebo, in patients suffering from ED at one month, three months, six months. Conclusion PRP is a proven therapeutic technique that has been shown to greatly enhance ED. Yet, to establish uniform guidelines for PRP in treating erectile dysfunction, further investigation into PRP, particularly in protocol development, is imperative.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-940/v1?src=rss">Integration of democratic values in natural sciences education: A Literature Review of the last 50 Years [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This study examines how democratic values have been promoted through natural sciences education over the last 50 years, providing a comprehensive analysis based on a systematic review of relevant literature. The central problem addressed is understanding the role of natural science education in fostering democratic values such as equity, participation, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility. This research aims to identify and analyze strategies, methodologies, and transformative experiences that contribute to the promotion of democratic values. This study employs the PRISMA methodology to ensure a rigorous and structured systematic review. Data were collected from multiple databases using detailed Boolean equations. Tools such as ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used for data preprocessing, clustering, and network visualization, followed by qualitative analysis to categorize the findings. Educational programs in natural sciences have increasingly integrated democratic values, fostering a culture of inclusivity and participation; the incorporation of ICT has enhanced equity and participation, while civic education has been fundamental in developing critical and informed citizens; citizen science initiatives have empowered students to engage in democratic deliberation and address epistemic injustice; cooperative learning methods in science classes have effectively promoted gender equity and inclusion; and emphasis on sustainability and environmental justice in science education has promoted democratic values and empowered students to take action on global challenges. In conclusion, natural science education is an effective vehicle for promoting democratic values, but it is an understudied field. By integrating practices that emphasize inclusivity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility, science education not only enhances students’ scientific understanding but also prepares them to be active, informed, and responsible citizens.

                Tropical sprue (TS) is a post-infective disease of the small bowel characterized by a malabsorption syndrome affecting tropics inhabitants and visitors. Diagnosis of TS remains challenging since it can be confused with common diarrheal diseases, especially in non-endemic areas. We report a Tunisian case of latent TS. A 58-year-old male with a history of chronic watery diarrhea, was admitted to the intensive care unit for confusion which was related to a severe metabolic acidosis. Despite the neurological improvement after hydro-electrolytic resuscitation and acid-base disorders correction, the patient continued to have three to five loose stools daily. A nutritional assessment showed a malabsorption syndrome: iron, Vitamin B12and folate deficiencies; normochromic normocytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed duodenal villous atrophy and biopsy confirmed subtotal villous atrophy with increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis and a thickened hyalonalized sub-epithelial basal lamina. Celiac disease was evoked, however the patient did not improve on a gluten-free diet and the celiac serology was negative. On re-interviewing, we discovered that the patient had spent two months in India three years prior. Given the travel history, clinico-biological and histological data TS was highly considered and a good response to a five-month antibiotic course combined to nutritional supplementation supported this diagnosis. Clinico-biological, endoscopic and histological findings were overlapping between TS and other malabsorption diseases, explaining diagnosis difficulties. TS should be systematically discussed in tropics visitors presenting with chronic diarrhea. Improvement after micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies replacement combined to a prolonged antibiotic course supports the diagnosis of TS.

                Background Maternal health care (MHC) is critical for safe motherhood and preventing maternal deaths in Myanmar, but the institutional delivery rates are not yet optimal, increasing preventable maternal deaths. To address this issue, involving men in supporting MHC has been recognized as a strategy to improve MHC outcomes. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of men in maternity health (MiM) intervention on male involvement in MHC and its influence on knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to maternal health and institutional delivery rates in Naypyitaw, Myanmar. Methods This study employed a mixed-methods approach with quantitative surveying of the male partners and qualitative interviewing of both male and female partners and health stakeholders. A 6-month MiM education program on pregnancy complications, antenatal care, delivery care, and birth preparedness was provided to the intervention group. Before and after the intervention, comparisons between intervention and control groups were made. Results The socio-demographic characteristics of male partners were comparable between the intervention and control groups during the pre-intervention assessment. Before MiM intervention, notable differences in male partners’ knowledge, attitudes, birth preparedness and complication readiness practices regarding MHC were not evident between these two groups. After completing the MiM, significant score improvement, including higher ID rates compared to the control group (p<0.001), was observed. The acceptability and feasibility of the MiM program were contributed by positive responses from qualitative findings, highlighting remarkable changes in the perspectives of male partners in supporting MHC. However, challenges, including financial limitations, cultural influences and a shortage of trained personnel, were encountered. Conclusion The MiM program effectively promotes male involvement in MHC, leading to improved MHC outcomes. The MiM intervention offers a promising, evidence-based model to enhance ID rates in Myanmar, requiring tailored approaches to address cultural and financial factors.

                Background There are a variety of published standard methods and water chemistry recommendations for zebrafish (Danio rerio) husbandry, but empirical evidence for their justification is often lacking, as is information on some variables that have important biological effects on fish. Importantly, these different recommendations could contribute to variability in results and fish welfare between or within institutions. Methods Here we document the current range of water chemistry used by various research institutions around the world and report initial findings on their effects on the development and growth of zebrafish. Over 40 institutes responded to a survey that revealed a large variation in water chemistry used for zebrafish husbandry including differences in the set-points and acceptable ranges for temperature, pH and conductivity. In subsequent experiments, zebrafish (D. rerio, WIK) embryos/larvae exposed to a large range of salt concentrations (50μM to 10mM Na+ or 30 – 2500 μS/cm) and CO2 levels (400 – 8,000 μatm). Results Larvae exposed to the lowest salt concentration (5 μM Na+ or < 30μS/cm) had a slower response to touch and their swim bladders were not inflated. Larvae exposed to 5-100 μM Na+ were 5 % shorter in total body length than those exposed to higher salt concentrations (>100 μM Na+). Zebrafish embryo/larvae exposed to intermediate pCO2 values (~2000 μatm) were 1 to 3.5% longer than those exposed to either ambient (400 μatm) or higher (4000 μatm) pCO2, but pCO2 did not affect developmental endpoints up to 4 dpf. Conclusions Overall, we highlight the magnitude of variation in water chemistry used within zebrafish research and provide some empirical evidence to show that not all of these water conditions might be optimal for developing zebrafish and reproducibility of research, although further research is necessary to determine longer-term effects of water chemistry on older larvae, juveniles and adults.

                Purpose This study examines the key factors affecting consumers’ purchases of environmentally friendly products in Malaysia. Originality Although the Malaysian government has put in effort and assistance to promote the use of environmentally friendly products, the purchase of environmentally friendly products remains low, as the costs of environmentally friendly products are still more expensive than those of non-energy efficient products. This study is one of the pioneering studies in developing countries that examined the purchase of environmentally friendly products after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology Three hundred participants from four developed states in Malaysia with the highest awareness of environmental protection and environmentally friendly products were approached. The survey was administered to the respondents in public places. Findings Malaysians’ purchase intentions towards environmentally friendly products are affected by confidence, family income, and attitude. In contrast, this study found no significant positive effect of financial subsidies on purchase intention towards environmentally friendly products.

                Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are substantial contributors to the global disease burden and mortality. The ANRIL gene polymorphism rs1333040 has been implicated in susceptibility to cardiovascular disease; however, its role in the Vietnamese population remains unclear. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 185 Vietnamese patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and clinical data, medical history, and biochemical parameters were recorded. ANRIL SNP rs1333040 was genotyped using PCR-RFLP. Genotype frequencies were assessed for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and their association with cardiovascular risk factors. Results The ‘Normal’ BMI (Body Mass Index) category was the largest segment, comprising 77.84% of the sample. Key cardiovascular risk factors identified among patients with AMI included hypertension (83.8%), dyslipidemia (80.0%), smoking (50.0%), and diabetes mellitus (33.8%). Clinical presentation showed that 55.0% of patients had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and 45.0% had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Lipid profile abnormalities were significant; 60.0% had decreased High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C), 53.8% had elevated triglycerides, 37.5% had elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C), and 36.3% had elevated total cholesterol levels. Genetic analysis focused on the rs1333040 polymorphism of the ANRIL gene, with the most common genotype being TT (58.8%), followed by CT (33.7%) and CC (7.5%). Allele frequencies were 75.6% for T and 24.4% for C. This study is the clinical implications of ANRIL polymorphisms in Vietnamese patients with CAD and AMI. Significant genotype-phenotype associations were observed, underscoring the importance of incorporating genetic screening for enhanced prognostic capabilities and personalized therapeutic decisions. Further research focused on delineating the precise genetic underpinnings of complex cardiovascular diseases in diverse populations is warranted.

                Background The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD. Methods This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60–90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions. Results FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001). Conclusions The eight-week combined pectoral muscles self-stretching and serratus anterior and lower trapezius strengthening exercises could be an effective treatment and/or prevention strategy for FSP reduction, leading to improved respiratory function in male COPD patients.

                Background The influenza virus is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes seasonal outbreaks and occasionally, unpredictable pandemics with high morbidity and mortality rates. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of drugs with potential antiviral activity against all types of influenza strains, including resistant strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel antiviral agents. Methods The synthesis of new oseltamivir carboxamides with amino acids and the subsequent synthesis of hybrid molecules with hydroxamic acid were considered. Two series are presented as series one; oseltamivir carboxamides with L-serine, L-isoleucine, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine and series two included hydroxamates of series one. This approach may provide promising candidates with potential anti-influenza activity. The in vitro cytotoxic activity against Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), type (NBL-2) - CCL-34 cells using the MTT ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the investigated compounds. The percent inhibition of neuraminidase was plotted against concentrations and the IC50 values were calculated by non-linear logistic curve fitting. Results The compounds were subjected to molecular docking using the GOLD suite (version 5.7.1) to predict the binding affinities for neuraminidase (3CL0). The docking scores are presented as PLP fitness and are comparable to those of oseltamivir. Oseltamivir-Phenylalanine recorded the highest docking score (72.23 kcal/mol), while, oseltamivir acid was recorded (56.24 kcal/mol). The ADMET parameters were generated using the Swiss ADME server to predict successful candidates with reasonable oral absorption and safety margins. All compounds are safer than oseltamivir and their IC50 values for neuraminidase inhibition were variable. The hybrids showed a lower percentage of viable cells. Oseltamivir-phenylalanine had the highest inhibitory activity against neuraminidase (3.03 μM), when compared with oseltamivir (67.22 μM). Conclusion Oseltamivir-phenylalanine showed remarkable and very significant activity, and the hybrid molecules were surprisingly less effective on neuraminidase than oseltamivir carboxamides.

                Background Technology has completely transformed healthcare, starting with X-ray machines and MRIs to telehealth and robotic surgeries to e-health records. The launch of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) serves as a milestone in medical history, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it a preferred surgical option. This study mainly explores patients’ willingness to adopt robot-assisted surgery (RAS) technology in a surgical intervention and is assessed in the backdrop of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods This research project employs a post-positivist research philosophy and a cross-sectional research design. A structured, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 280 respondents. Results The results revealed that trust had a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.099) and Perceived Ease of Use (β = .157), and eHealth literacy had a significant impact on Perceived Ease of Use (β = 0.438) and Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.454). Additionally, Perceived Usefulness partially influenced behavioral intention (β = 0.123), and attitude had a significant influence on behavioral intention (β = 0.612). The analysis revealed an insignificant impact of eHealth literacy on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.067). The Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value was <0.8. Mediation analysis also revealed partial mediation between the constructs. The SRMR rating of this model is 0.067, indicating that it fits the data well. Conclusion This study revealed that a patient's intention will be high if he or she believes that RAS is beneficial in treating his or her ailment. In comparison, information related to RAS is clearly known, and it does not directly affect selection intention. eHealth literacy is a significant antecedent to patients’ behavioral intention. Hence, the healthcare industry must devise strategies to promote the acceptance of RAS at all levels.

Moreover, COVID-19 forced auditors to introduce a new audit approach, “remote auditing,” which was not common in most audit firms and required the adoption of more advanced technologies. Overall, auditors during COVID-19 needed both cognitive and technical factors to deliver high-quality audits. Despite the challenges, research into how auditors dealt with these issues is limited, presenting an intriguing area of study. Methods This dataset provides insights into the Saudi auditor’s experience and beliefs regarding audit activities during COVID-19. Through an online survey, researchers collected data from 193 out of 417 registered auditors with the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). The survey assessed the auditors’ self-efficacy in conducting audits during the pandemic, exploring its sources and potential moderating factors. Specifically, the dataset includes responses on eight items related to self-efficacy, 19 items covering the four common sources of self-efficacy (mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological/emotional states), and six items assessing virtual audit competency. Additionally, the dataset contains demographic information valuable for researchers analysing the relationship between auditor self-efficacy, its sources, and other influencing factors. Conclusions Overall, the dataset included in this article may serve a broader audience and be useful in improving several stakeholders’ understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on auditors and how auditors assess their ability to adapt to the COVID-19 consequences. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the need for auditors to adapt to new circumstances and adopt innovative approaches during challenging times, thereby ensuring the delivery of high-quality audits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-934/v1?src=rss">Assessment of early neonatal practices to prevent hypothermia ; A comparative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Globally, neonatal deaths are significantly attributed to hypothermia. This is mostly because of its co-morbidity with asphyxia, premature birth and severe neonatal infections. Worldwide, neonatal hypothermia case fatality rates (CFRs) range from 8.5% to 52%. This study aimed to assess how well a video-based training intervention on mothers’ knowledge and practices in preventing neonatal hypothermia worked. Methods The knowledge and practices of two groups of primi-para mothers—one control group and one intervention group—were compared in order to achieve this. A total of 124 primipara mothers took part in the research. Using a video based tool, the intervention group was educated about preventing hypothermia in newborns. Both control and intervention group mothers were interviewed to compare the knowledge and practices. Results Sixty-one of the sixty-two mothers in the control group were unsure of which body area to cover in order to preserve the baby’s body heat. Following the intervention, 61 out of 62 mothers in the group recognised which body part to cover to protect the baby’s body heat. In the post-intervention group, 98.4% of moms wore a cap over their baby’s head, compared to just 35.5% in the control group. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate the significant improvement in mothers’ knowledge and actions about the prevention of neonatal hypothermia resulting from the use of a video-based training tool.

                This research explores the application of quadratic polynomials in Python for advanced data analysis. The study demonstrates how quadratic models can effectively capture nonlinear relationships in complex datasets by leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Pandas. The methodology involves fitting quadratic polynomials to the data using least-squares regression and evaluating the model fit using the coefficient of determination (R-squared). The results highlight the strong performance of the quadratic polynomial fit, as evidenced by high R-squared values, indicating the model’s ability to explain a substantial proportion of the data variability. Comparisons with linear and cubic models further underscore the quadratic model’s balance between simplicity and precision for many practical applications. The study also acknowledges the limitations of quadratic polynomials and proposes future research directions to enhance their accuracy and efficiency for diverse data analysis tasks. This research bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation, providing an accessible Python-based tool for leveraging quadratic polynomials in data analysis.

                Background Heat polymerized acrylic (HPA) resins are known to have high porosity that contributes to increased surface roughness and microcrack formation in stress areas. This facilitates the attachment and growth of polymicrobial biofilms contributing to increased antimicrobial resistance. Many research had been carried out on avocado seeds, but no research that studies the effect of avocado seeds on denture-plaque microorganism biofilm on HPA resin has been found. Methods This study used 144 samples (n=144), namely HPA resin discs covered with mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms consisting of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Staphylococcus aureus. The discs were soaked for 8 hours in the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% avocado seed extract, positive control (alkaline peroxide), and negative control (aquadest). Each disc was shaken with a vortex mixer for 1 minute, and 100 μL was added into 96-well microplates with three times repetition and incubated for 24 hours. The inhibition values were determined from the percentage inhibition value formula which required absorption values from a microplate reader (595 nm). Results In this research, it was found that the MBIC50 of avocado seed extract against the mono-species of C. albicans (5%), C. glabrata (5%), A. odontolyticus (15%), S. gordonii (15%), S. aureus (10%), while against the biofilm was 20%. There was a significant effect of soaking HPA resin in avocado seed extract of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% on the inhibition of mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms of denture-plaque microorganisms with a value of p<0.001 (p<0.05). Conclusion The MBIC50 of avocado seed extract in polymicrobial biofilm group was higher than that in the mono-species biofilm groups. Although alkaline peroxide showed higher inhibition value than that of the MBIC50 in polymicrobial biofilm group, 20% avocado seed extract was effective in inhibiting polymicrobial biofilm because it was able to inhibit more than 50% polymicrobial biofilm.

                Aims There is minimal research on the duration of biofield experiences. This preliminary study used the experiential learning practice of Master Choa Kok Sui's hands sensitisation to determine the duration to experience biofield sensations in between hands and to find the relationship between learning style preferences and biofield sensations. Methods This randomized placebo controlled, single blinded trial included 88 male and female pre-service teachers, aged 22.8±1.2 years. Participants completed a ruler drop test for reaction time, and Six Letter Cancellation test for measuring attention, learning style questionnaire for preferred method of learning, before randomization. The experimental (hands facing each other as introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui) and sham (hands facing opposite) groups practiced hands sensitisation. A semi-structured questionnaire was provided to gather information about biofield sensations and the time it took to experience these sensations between the hands. Results All (N=44) the participants in the experimental group and 13 participants in the sham group reported experiencing biofield sensations. A significant difference was noticed in experiencing magnetic (X2 = 38.247, p ≤ .001), physical sensations of energy (X2 = 12.02, p ≤ .001) and pain (X2 = 62.259, p ≤ .001) among the experimental and sham group . In the experimental group, the average time taken to first experience magnetic sensation, other biofield sensations and temperature variation was 34.84±12.97seconds, 40.28±20.96 seconds and 42.50±19.79 seconds, respectively. Minimum time taken to first experience biofield sensation was 5 seconds and lasted up to study duration of 120 seconds. There was no correlation found between reaction time, sustained attention, and the time needed to experience biofield sensations. Conclusions This study highlights importance of Master Choa Kok Sui hand sensitization in controlled setting revealing differences in experiences of various biofield sensations, showing valuable time-related insights and variability of sensation based on preferred learning.

The ultraviolet (UV) radiation triggers a pigmentation response in human skin, wherein, melanocytes rapidly activate divergent maturation and proliferation programs. Using single-cell sequencing, we demonstrate that these 2 programs are segregated in distinct subpopulations in melanocytes of human and zebrafish skin. The coexistence of these 2 cell states in cultured melanocytes suggests possible cell autonomy. Luria–Delbrück fluctuation test reveals that the initial establishment of these states is stochastic. Tracking of pigmenting cells ascertains that the stochastically acquired state is faithfully propagated in the progeny. A systemic approach combining single-cell multi-omics (RNA+ATAC) coupled to enhancer mapping with H3K27 acetylation successfully identified state-specific transcriptional networks. This comprehensive analysis led to the construction of a gene regulatory network (GRN) that under the influence of noise, establishes a bistable system of pigmentation and proliferation at the population level. This GRN recapitulates melanocyte behaviour in response to external cues that reinforce either of the states. Our work highlights that inherent stochasticity within melanocytes establishes dedicated states, and the mature state is sustained by selective enhancers mark through histone acetylation. While the initial cue triggers a proliferation response, the continued signal activates and maintains the pigmenting subpopulation via epigenetic imprinting. Thereby our study provides the basis of coexistence of distinct populations which ensures effective pigmentation response while preserving the self-renewal capacity.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002768">Slow-wave sleep drives sleep-dependent renormalization of synaptic AMPA receptor levels in the hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jianfeng Liu, Niels Niethard, Yu Lun, Stoyan Dimitrov, Ingrid Ehrlich, Jan Born, Manfred Hallschmid</p>

According to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY), sleep serves to renormalize synaptic connections that have been potentiated during the prior wake phase due to ongoing encoding of information. SHY focuses on glutamatergic synaptic strength and has been supported by numerous studies examining synaptic structure and function in neocortical and hippocampal networks. However, it is unknown whether synaptic down-regulation during sleep occurs in the hypothalamus, i.e., a pivotal center of homeostatic regulation of bodily functions including sleep itself. We show that sleep, in parallel with the synaptic down-regulation in neocortical networks, down-regulates the levels of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the hypothalamus of rats. Most robust decreases after sleep were observed at both sites for AMPARs containing the GluA1 subunit. Comparing the effects of selective rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and total sleep deprivation, we moreover provide experimental evidence that slow-wave sleep (SWS) is the driving force of the down-regulation of AMPARs in hypothalamus and neocortex, with no additional contributions of REM sleep or the circadian rhythm. SWS-dependent synaptic down-regulation was not linked to EEG slow-wave activity. However, spindle density during SWS predicted relatively increased GluA1 subunit levels in hypothalamic synapses, which is consistent with the role of spindles in the consolidation of memory. Our findings identify SWS as the main driver of the renormalization of synaptic strength during sleep and suggest that SWS-dependent synaptic renormalization is also implicated in homeostatic control processes in the hypothalamus.

Cell-to-cell mitochondrial transfer has recently been shown to play a role in maintaining physiological functions of cell. We previously illustrated that mitochondrial transfer within osteocyte dendritic network regulates bone tissue homeostasis. However, the mechanism of triggering this process has not been explored. Here, we showed that stressed osteocytes in mice release adenosine diphosphate (ADP), resulting in triggering mitochondrial transfer from healthy osteocytes to restore the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and to alleviate reactive oxygen species accumulation. Furthermore, we identified that P2Y2 and P2Y6 transduced the ADP signal to regulate osteocyte mitochondrial transfer. We showed that mitochondrial metabolism is impaired in aged osteocytes, and there were more extracellular nucleotides release into the matrix in aged cortical bone due to compromised membrane integrity. Conditioned medium from aged osteocytes triggered mitochondrial transfer between osteocytes to enhance the energy metabolism. Together, using osteocyte as an example, this study showed new insights into how extracellular ADP triggers healthy cells to rescue energy metabolism crisis in stressed cells via mitochondrial transfer in tissue homeostasis.

                Background- Cervical spondylosis is a disease that is caused by the vitiation of only one bodily humor (dosha) (Vataja nanatmaja). The vata bodily humor (dosa) becomes vitiated and settles in the cervical (manya), creating neck pain and stiffness, which ultimately led to cervical spondylosis. Cervical spondylosis can be examined primarily under the generalization of cervical spondylosis because both conditions have many of the same symptoms. A disorder known as cervical spondylosis, which affects the cervical vertebra, is a degenerative condition of the cervical spine. In addition to having negative effects on a person's health, the disease also significantly lowers the quality of life and daily activities. Ayurveda suggested a treatment for cervical spondylosis to avoid and control the condition. There are numerous therapies in Ayurveda, and Oil administration through the nostrils has been given a significant role in upper clavicular disease (Uurdhvajatrugata roga). Oil administration through nostril therapy has been specifically recommended by Acharya Charka for the treatment of cervical spondylosis. The purpose of certain ayurvedic approaches in the management of cervical spondylosis. Methods: - 60 patients will be split into two groups for this investigation. A tinospora cardifolia and a group of drugs (Mashadi oil) will be given to the group through the nostrils for seven days at a dose of eight drops. The same will be used for the other 30 patients, i.e., group B with Ricinus Communis and a group of drugs (Erandadi oil) administered through the nostrils. Expected result: The result will be assessed on the baseline of objective parameters, and data will be compared after the treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95555">Discovery of the 1-naphthylamine biodegradation pathway reveals a broad-substrate-spectrum enzyme catalyzing 1-naphthylamine glutamylation</a></h4>

              
                1-Naphthylamine (1NA), which is harmful to human and aquatic animals, has been used widely in the manufacturing of dyes, pesticides, and rubber antioxidants. Nevertheless, little is known about its environmental behavior and no bacteria have been reported to use it as the growth substrate. Herein, we describe a pathway for 1NA degradation in the isolate <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. strain JS3066, determine the structure and mechanism of the enzyme NpaA1 that catalyzes the initial reaction, and reveal how the pathway evolved. From genetic and enzymatic analysis, a five gene-cluster encoding a dioxygenase system was determined to be responsible for the initial steps in 1NA degradation through glutamylation of 1NA. The γ-glutamylated 1NA was subsequently oxidized to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene which was further degraded by the well-established pathway of naphthalene degradation via catechol. A glutamine synthetase-like (GS-like) enzyme (NpaA1) initiates 1NA glutamylation, and this enzyme exhibits a broad substrate selectivity toward a variety of anilines and naphthylamine derivatives. Structural analysis revealed that the aromatic residues in the 1NA entry tunnel and the V201 site in the large substrate-binding pocket significantly influence NpaA1’s substrate preferences. The findings enhance understanding of degrading polycyclic aromatic amines, and will also enable the application of bioremediation at naphthylamine contaminated sites.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91012">Genetic code expansion, click chemistry, and light-activated PI3K reveal details of membrane protein trafficking downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases</a></h4>

              
                Ligands such as insulin, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and nerve growth factor (NGF) initiate signals at the cell membrane by binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Along with G-protein-coupled receptors, RTKs are the main platforms for transducing extracellular signals into intracellular signals. Studying RTK signaling has been a challenge, however, due to the multiple signaling pathways to which RTKs typically are coupled, including MAP/ERK, PLCγ, and Class 1A phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). The multi-pronged RTK signaling has been a barrier to isolating the effects of any one downstream pathway. Here, we used optogenetic activation of PI3K to decouple its activation from other RTK signaling pathways. In this context, we used genetic code expansion to introduce a click chemistry noncanonical amino acid into the extracellular side of membrane proteins. Applying a cell-impermeant click chemistry fluorophore allowed us to visualize delivery of membrane proteins to the plasma membrane in real time. Using these approaches, we demonstrate that activation of PI3K, without activating other pathways downstream of RTK signaling, is sufficient to traffic the TRPV1 ion channels and insulin receptors to the plasma membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92794">FBXO24 deletion causes abnormal accumulation of membraneless electron-dense granules in sperm flagella and male infertility</a></h4>

              
                Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless electron-dense structures rich in RNAs and proteins, and involved in various cellular processes. Two RNP granules in male germ cells, intermitochondrial cement and the chromatoid body (CB), are associated with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and are required for transposon silencing and spermatogenesis. Other RNP granules in male germ cells, the reticulated body and CB remnants, are also essential for spermiogenesis. In this study, we disrupted FBXO24, a testis-enriched F-box protein, in mice and found numerous membraneless electron-dense granules accumulated in sperm flagella. <i>Fbxo24</i> knockout (KO) mice exhibited malformed flagellar structures, impaired sperm motility, and male infertility, likely due to the accumulation of abnormal granules. The amount and localization of known RNP granule-related proteins were not disrupted in <i>Fbxo24</i> KO mice, suggesting that the accumulated granules were distinct from known RNP granules. Further studies revealed that RNAs and two importins, IPO5 and KPNB1, abnormally accumulated in <i>Fbxo24</i> KO spermatozoa and that FBXO24 could ubiquitinate IPO5. In addition, IPO5 and KPNB1 were recruited to stress granules, RNP complexes, when cells were treated with oxidative stress or a proteasome inhibitor. These results suggest that FBXO24 is involved in the degradation of IPO5, disruption of which may lead to the accumulation of abnormal RNP granules in sperm flagella.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91757">Circulating platelets modulate oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation during remyelination</a></h4>

              
                Revealing unknown cues that regulate oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) function in remyelination is important to optimise the development of regenerative therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS). Platelets are present in chronic non-remyelinated lesions of MS and an increase in circulating platelets has been described in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, an animal model for MS. However, the contribution of platelets to remyelination remains unexplored. Here we show platelet aggregation in proximity to OPCs in areas of experimental demyelination. Partial depletion of circulating platelets impaired OPC differentiation and remyelination, without altering blood-brain barrier stability and neuroinflammation. Transient exposure to platelets enhanced OPC differentiation in vitro, whereas sustained exposure suppressed this effect. In a mouse model of thrombocytosis (<i>Calr<sup>+/-</sup></i>), there was a sustained increase in platelet aggregation together with a reduction of newly-generated oligodendrocytes following toxin-induced demyelination. These findings reveal a complex bimodal contribution of platelet to remyelination and provide insights into remyelination failure in MS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96678">Released bacterial ATP shapes local and systemic inflammation during abdominal sepsis</a></h4>

              
                Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO. Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues, and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP. Using genetic mutant strains of <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>), we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. In addition, impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed <i>E. coli</i> bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. In addition, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84955">Neural population dynamics underlying evidence accumulation in multiple rat brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating evidence to make decisions is a core cognitive function. Previous studies have tended to estimate accumulation using either neural or behavioral data alone. Here we develop a unified framework for modeling stimulus-driven behavior and multi-neuron activity simultaneously. We applied our method to choices and neural recordings from three rat brain regions - the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the frontal orienting fields (FOF), and the anterior-dorsal striatum (ADS) - while subjects performed a pulse-based accumulation task. Each region was best described by a distinct accumulation model, which all differed from the model that best described the animal's choices. FOF activity was consistent with an accumulator where early evidence was favored while the ADS reflected near perfect accumulation. Neural responses within an accumulation framework unveiled a distinct association between each brain region and choice. Choices were better predicted from all regions using a comprehensive, accumulation-based framework and different brain regions were found to differentially reflect choice-related accumulation signals: FOF and ADS both reflected choice but ADS showed more instances of decision vacillation. Previous studies relating neural data to behaviorally-inferred accumulation dynamics have implicitly assumed that individual brain regions reflect the whole-animal level accumulator. Our results suggest that different brain regions represent accumulated evidence in dramatically different ways and that accumulation at the whole-animal level may be constructed from a variety of neural-level accumulators.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97487">Target-specific requirements for RNA interference can arise through restricted RNA amplification despite the lack of specialized pathways</a></h4>

              
                Since double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes, all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference (RNAi). Yet, loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can selectively impair the silencing of some genes. Here, we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene, where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that (1) changing <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, (2) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and (3) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA. Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.

                Cognitive flexibility, the ability to adjust behavioral strategies in response to changing environmental contingencies, requires adaptive processing of internal states and contextual cues to guide goal-oriented behavior, and is dependent on prefrontal cortex (PFC) functions. However, the neurophysiological underpinning of how the PFC supports cognitive flexibility is not well understood and has been under active investigation. We recorded spiking activity from single PFC neurons in mice performing the attentional set-shifting task, where mice learned to associate different contextually relevant sensory stimuli to reward. We identified subgroups of PFC neurons encoding task context, choice and trial outcome. Putative fast-spiking neurons were more involved in representing outcome and choice than putative regular-spiking neurons. Regression model further revealed that task context and trial outcome modulated the activity of choice-encoding neurons in rule-dependent and cell type-dependent manners. Together, our data provide new evidence to elucidate PFC's role in cognitive flexibility, suggesting differential cell type-specific engagement during set shifting, and that both contextual rule representation and trial outcome monitoring underlie PFC's unique capacity to support flexible behavioral switching.

">Dev-Atlas: A reference atlas of functional brain networks for typically developing adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a critical period for neural changes, including maturation of the brain's cognitive networks, but also a period of increased vulnerability to psychopathology. It is well accepted that the brain is functionally organized into multiple interacting networks and extensive literature has demonstrated that the spatial and functional organization of these networks shows major age-related changes across the lifespan, but particularly during adolescence. Yet, there is limited option for a reference functional brain atlas derived from typically developing adolescents, which is especially problematic as the reliable and reproducible identification of functional brain networks crucially depends on the use of such reference functional atlases. In this context, we utilized resting-state functional MRI data from a total of 1,391 typically developing youth between the ages of 8 and 17 years to create a new adolescent-specific reference atlas of functional brain networks. We further investigated the impact of age and sex on these networks. Using a multiscale individual component clustering algorithm (MICCA), we identified 24 reliable functional brain networks, classified within six domains: Default-Mode (5 networks), Control (4 networks), Salience (3 networks), Attention (4 networks), Somatomotor (5 networks), and Visual (3 networks). We identified reliable and large effects of age on the spatial topography of these majority of networks, as well as on the functional network connectivity (FNC) between networks. The DMN showed reduced FNC with the other networks with older age. Sex effects were not as widespread. No significant sex-by-age interactions were detected. Overall, we created a novel brain atlas, named Dev-Atlas, focused on a typically developing sample, with the hope that this atlas can be used in future independent developmental network neuroscience studies. Dev-Atlas is freely available to the research community.

">Nicotine engages a VTA-NAc feedback loop to inhibit amygdala-projecting dopamine neurons and induce anxiety.</a></h4>

              
                Nicotine activates ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic (DA) neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to drive its reinforcing effects. Simultaneously, it inhibits those projecting to the amygdala (Amg) to mediate anxiety through a process that remains unknown. Here we show that NAc- and Amg-projecting DA neurons respond with similar polarities to ethanol and nicotine, suggesting a shared network-based mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of these otherwise pharmacologically-distinct drugs. Selective activation of NAc-projecting DA neurons, using genetic or optogenetic strategies, produced inhibition of Amg-projecting DA neurons, through a GABAergic feedback loop. Furthermore, optogenetically silencing this feedback loop prevented nicotine from inducing both inhibition of DA neurons and anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, nicotine-induced inhibition of the VTA-Amg DA pathway results from a VTA-NAc inhibitory feedback loop, mediating anxiety.

	<p>Brain development from infancy through childhood involves complex structural and functional changes influenced by both internal and external factors. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of event and task-related brain oscillations, focusing on developmental changes across different frequency bands, including delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies highlight that these oscillations serve as functional building blocks for sensory and cognitive processes, with significant variations observed across different developmental stages. Delta oscillations, primarily associated with deep sleep and early cognitive demands, gradually diminish as children age. Theta rhythms, crucial for attention and memory, display a distinct pattern in early childhood, evolving with cognitive maturation. Alpha oscillations, reflecting thalamocortical interactions and cognitive performance, increase in complexity with age. Beta rhythms, linked to active thinking and problem-solving, show developmental differences in motor and cognitive tasks. Gamma oscillations, associated with higher cognitive functions, exhibit notable changes in response to sensory stimuli and cognitive tasks. This review underscores the importance of understanding oscillatory dynamics to elucidate brain development and its implications for sensory and cognitive processing in childhood. The findings provide a foundation for future research on developmental neuroscience and potential clinical applications.</p>

	<p>This work proposes an intrinsically explainable, straightforward method to decode P300 waveforms from electroencephalography (EEG) signals, overcoming the black box nature of deep learning techniques. The proposed method allows convolutional neural networks to decode information from images, an area where they have achieved astonishing performance. By plotting the EEG signal as an image, it can be both visually interpreted by physicians and technicians and detected by the network, offering a straightforward way of explaining the decision. The identification of this pattern is used to implement a P300-based speller device, which can serve as an alternative communication channel for persons affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This method is validated by identifying this signal by performing a brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface simulation on a public dataset from ALS patients. Letter identification rates from the speller on the dataset show that this method can identify the P300 signature on the set of 8 patients. The proposed approach achieves similar performance to other state-of-the-art proposals while providing clinically relevant explainability (XAI).</p>

	<p>This study aimed to clarify the differences between the previously reported mechanisms of sports-related concussion (SRC) injuries without a loss of consciousness in contact and collision sports and the mechanisms of SRC injuries in our cases. Based on two videos of SRC injuries occurring during a men&amp;amp;rsquo;s rhythmic gymnastics competition (three people were injured), the risk of SRC occurrence was estimated from various parameters using a multibody analysis and eight brain injury evaluation criteria. In the present study, the three SRC impacts that occurred in men&amp;amp;rsquo;s rhythmic gymnastics showed significant characteristics in duration compared to previously reported cases in the contact sports. This suggests that the occurrence of SRC may have been caused by a different type of impact from that which causes SRC in contact sports (e.g., tackling). In addition, calculation of the strain indicating the rate of brain deformation suggested a risk of nerve swelling in all cases involving type 2 axonal injuries. Therefore, when reexamining sports-related head injuries, it is important to recognize the characteristics and mechanisms of SRC that occur in each different sport, as well as the symptoms and course of SRC after injury.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior relies on efficient cognitive control. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key node within the executive prefrontal network. The reciprocal connectivity between the locus ceruleus (LC) and ACC is thought to support behavioral reorganization triggered by the detection of an unexpected change. We transduced LC neurons with either excitatory or inhibitory chemogenetic receptors in adult male rats and trained rats on a spatial task. Subsequently, we altered LC activity and confronted rats with an unexpected change of reward locations. In a new spatial context, rats with decreased noradrenaline (NA) in the ACC entered unbaited maze arms more persistently which was indicative of perseveration. In contrast, the suppression of the global NA transmission reduced perseveration. Neither chemogenetic manipulation nor inactivation of the ACC by muscimol affected the rate of learning, possibly due to partial virus transduction of the LC neurons and/or the compensatory engagement of other prefrontal regions. Importantly, we observed behavioral deficits in rats with LC damage caused by virus injection. The latter finding highlights the importance of careful histological assessment of virus-transduced brain tissue as inadvertent damage of the targeted cell population due to virus neurotoxicity or other factors might cause unwanted side effects. Although the specific role of ACC in the flexibility of spatial behavior has not been convincingly demonstrated, our results support the beneficial role of noradrenergic transmission for an optimal function of the ACC. Overall, our findings suggest the LC exerts the projection-specific modulation of neural circuits mediating the flexibility of spatial behavior.</p>

                <p>The integration of spatial information in the mammalian dentate gyrus (DG) is critical to navigation. Indeed, DG granule cells (DGCs) rely upon finely balanced inhibitory neurotransmission in order to respond appropriately to specific spatial inputs. This inhibition arises from a heterogeneous population of local GABAergic interneurons (INs) that activate both fast, ionotropic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) and slow, metabotropic GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R), respectively. GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs in turn inhibit pre- and postsynaptic neuronal compartments via temporally long-lasting G-protein-dependent mechanisms. The relative contribution of each IN subtype to network level GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R signal setting remains unknown. However, within the DG, the somatostatin (SSt) expressing IN subtype is considered crucial in coordinating appropriate feedback inhibition on to DGCs. Therefore, we virally delivered channelrhodopsin 2 to the DG in order to obtain control of this specific SSt IN subpopulation in male and female adult mice. Using a combination of optogenetic activation and pharmacology, we show that SSt INs strongly recruit postsynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs to drive greater inhibition in DGCs than GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs at physiological membrane potentials. Furthermore, we show that in the adult mouse DG, postsynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R signaling is predominantly regulated by neuronal GABA uptake and less so by astrocytic mechanisms. Finally, we confirm that activation of SSt INs can also recruit presynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs, as has been shown in neocortical circuits. Together, these data reveal that GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R signaling allows SSt INs to control DG activity and may constitute a key mechanism for gating spatial information flow within hippocampal circuits.</p>

                <p>by Diogo L. Pires, Mark Broom</p>

Community organisation permeates both social and biological complex systems. To study its interplay with behaviour emergence, we model mobile structured populations with multiplayer interactions. We derive general analytical methods for evolutionary dynamics under high home fidelity when populations self-organise into networks of asymptotically isolated communities. In this limit, community organisation dominates over the network structure and emerging behaviour is independent of network topology. We obtain the rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities for different types of social dilemmas. The success of cooperation is a result of the benefits shared among communal cooperators outperforming the benefits reaped by defectors in mixed communities. Under weak selection, cooperation can evolve and be stable for any size (<i>Q</i>) and number (<i>M</i>) of communities if the reward-to-cost ratio (<i>V</i>/<i>K</i>) of public goods is higher than a critical value. Community organisation is a solid mechanism for sustaining the evolution of cooperation under public goods dilemmas, particularly when populations are organised into a higher number of smaller communities. Contrary to public goods dilemmas relating to production, the multiplayer Hawk-Dove (HD) dilemma is a commons dilemma focusing on the fair consumption of preexisting resources. This game yields mixed results but tends to favour cooperation under larger communities, highlighting that the two types of social dilemmas might lead to solid differences in the behaviour adopted under community structure.

                <p>by Ayooluwa J. Bolaji, Ana T. Duggan</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought molecular biology and genomic sequencing into the public consciousness and lexicon. With an emphasis on rapid turnaround, genomic data informed both diagnostic and surveillance decisions for the current pandemic at a previously unheard-of scale. The surge in the submission of genomic data to publicly available databases proved essential as comparing different genome sequences offers a wealth of knowledge, including phylogenetic links, modes of transmission, rates of evolution, and the impact of mutations on infection and disease severity. However, the scale of the pandemic has meant that sequencing runs are rarely repeated due to limited sample material and/or the availability of sequencing resources, resulting in the upload of some imperfect runs to public repositories. As a result, it is crucial to investigate the data obtained from these imperfect runs to determine whether the results are reliable prior to depositing them in a public database. Numerous studies have identified a variety of sources of contamination in public next-generation sequencing (NGS) data as the number of NGS studies increases along with the diversity of sequencing technologies and procedures. For this study, we conducted an <i>in silico</i> experiment with known SARS-CoV-2 sequences produced from Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing to investigate the effect of contamination on lineage calls and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). A contamination threshold below which runs are expected to generate accurate lineage calls and maintain genome-relatedness and integrity was identified. Together, these findings provide a benchmark below which imperfect runs may be considered robust for reporting results to both stakeholders and public repositories and reduce the need for repeat or wasted runs.

Neutrophils are the first immune cells to reach inflamed sites and contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Yet, little is known about the pattern of neutrophil infiltration in inflamed skin in vivo and the mechanisms mediating their recruitment. Here, we provide insight into the dynamics of neutrophil infiltration in skin in response to acute or repeated inflammatory stress, highlighting a novel keratinocyte- and keratin 17 (K17)-dependent mechanism that regulates neutrophil recruitment to inflamed skin. We used the phorbol ester TPA and UVB, alone or in combination, to induce sterile inflammation in mouse skin. A single TPA treatment results in a neutrophil influx in the dermis that peaks at 12 h and resolves within 24 h. A subsequent TPA treatment or a UVB challenge, when applied 24 h but not 48 h later, accelerates, amplifies, and prolongs neutrophil infiltration. This transient amplification response (TAR) is mediated by local signals in inflamed skin, can be recapitulated in ex vivo culture, and involves the K17-dependent sustainment of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activity and release of chemoattractants by stressed keratinocytes. K17 binds RACK1, a scaffold protein essential for PKCα activity. The N-terminal head domain of K17 is crucial for its association with RACK1 and regulation of PKCα activity. Analysis of RNAseq data reveals a signature consistent with TAR and PKCα activation in inflammatory skin diseases. These findings uncover a novel, keratin-dependent mechanism that amplifies neutrophil recruitment in skin under stress, with direct implications for inflammatory skin disorders.

We report here on the characterisation in mice of a noninvasive bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) skin challenge model for assessing tuberculosis (TB) vaccine efficacy. Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) are valuable tools for assessing the relevant biological activity of vaccine candidates, with the potential to accelerate TB vaccine development into the clinic. TB infection poses significant constraints on the design of a CHIM using the causative agent <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb). A safer alternative is a challenge model using the attenuated vaccine agent <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> BCG as a surrogate for Mtb, and intradermal (skin) challenge as an alternative to pulmonary infection. We have developed a unique noninvasive imaging system based on fluorescent reporters (FluorBCG) to quantitatively measure bacterial load over time, thereby determining a relevant biological vaccine effect. We assessed the utility of this model to measure the effectiveness of 2 TB vaccines: the currently licenced BCG and a novel subunit vaccine candidate. To assess the efficacy of the skin challenge model, a nonlinear mixed effect model was built describing the decline of fluorescence over time. The model-based analysis identified that BCG vaccination reduced the fluorescence readout of both fluorophores compared to unvaccinated mice (<i>p</i> < 0.001). However, vaccination with the novel subunit candidate did not alter the fluorescence decline compared to unvaccinated mice (<i>p</i> > 0.05). BCG-vaccinated mice that showed the reduced fluorescent readout also had a reduced bacterial burden in the lungs when challenged with Mtb. This supports the fluorescence activity in the skin as a reflection of vaccine induced functional pulmonary immune responses. This novel noninvasive approach allows for repeated measurements from the challenge site, providing a dynamic readout of vaccine induced responses over time. This BCG skin challenge model represents an important contribution to the ongoing development of controlled challenge models for TB.

Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are key players in cellular homeostasis and regulation, as they coordinate the exchange of lipids between different cellular organelles. Despite their importance, our mechanistic understanding of how LTPs function at the molecular level is still in its infancy, mostly due to the large number of existing LTPs and to the low degree of conservation at the sequence and structural level. In this work, we use molecular simulations to characterize a representative dataset of lipid transport domains (LTDs) of 12 LTPs that belong to 8 distinct families. We find that despite no sequence homology nor structural conservation, the conformational landscape of LTDs displays common features, characterized by the presence of at least 2 main conformations whose populations are modulated by the presence of the bound lipid. These conformational properties correlate with their mechanistic mode of action, allowing for the interpretation and design of experimental strategies to further dissect their mechanism. Our findings indicate the existence of a conserved, fold-independent mechanism of lipid transfer across LTPs of various families and offer a general framework for understanding their functional mechanism.

Dynamic properties are essential for microtubule (MT) physiology. Current techniques for in vivo imaging of MTs present intrinsic limitations in elucidating the isotype-specific nuances of tubulins, which contribute to their versatile functions. Harnessing the power of the AlphaFold2 pipeline, we engineered a strategy for the minimally invasive fluorescence labeling of endogenous tubulin isotypes or those harboring missense mutations. We demonstrated that a specifically designed 16-amino acid linker, coupled with sfGFP11 from the split-sfGFP system and integration into the H1-S2 loop of tubulin, facilitated tubulin labeling without compromising MT dynamics, embryonic development, or ciliogenesis in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Extending this technique to human cells and murine oocytes, we visualized MTs with the minimal background fluorescence and a pathogenic tubulin isoform with fidelity. The utility of our approach across biological contexts and species set an additional paradigm for studying tubulin dynamics and functional specificity, with implications for understanding tubulin-related diseases known as tubulinopathies.

<p>Disrupted connectivity between the amygdala and the default mode network (DMN) is highlighted in schizophrenia, with significant changes observed in specific amygdala subregions after treatment.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disrupted connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) during resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is well-documented in schizophrenia (SCZ). The amygdala, a key component in the neurobiology of SCZ, comprises distinct subregions that may exert varying effects on the disorder. This study aimed to investigate variations in functional connectivity (FC) between distinct amygdala subregions and the DMN in SCZ individuals and explore the effects of treatment on these connections. Fifty-six SCZ patients and 51 healthy controls underwent FC analysis and questionnaire surveys during resting state. The amygdala was selected as the region of interest (ROI) and subdivided into four parts. Changes in FC were examined, and correlations between questionnaire scores and brain activity were explored. Pre-treatment, SCZ patients exhibited reduced FC between the amygdala and DMN compared to HCs. After treatment, significant differences persisted in the right medial amygdala, while other regions did not differ significantly from controls. In addition, PANSS scores positively correlated with FC between the Right Medial Amygdala and the left SMFC (<i>r</i> = .347, <i>p</i> = .009), while RBANS5A scores showed a positive correlation with FC between the Left Lateral Amygdala and the right MTG (rho = −.347, <i>p</i> = .009). The rsFC between the amygdala and the DMN plays a crucial role in the treatment mechanisms of SCZ. This could provide a promising predictive indicator for understanding the neural mechanisms behind treatment and symptomatic improvement.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Resistance exercise training (RET) is considered an excellent tool for preventing diseases with an inflammatory background. Its neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties are responsible for positively modulating cholinergic and oxidative systems, promoting neurogenesis, and improving memory. However, the mechanisms behind these actions are largely unknown. In order to investigate the pathways related to these effects of exercise, we conducted a 12-week long-term exercise training protocol and used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce damage to the cortex and hippocampus of male Wistar rats. The cholinergic system, oxidative stress, and histochemical parameters were analyzed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and memory tests were also performed. It was observed that LPS: (1) caused memory loss in the novel object recognition (NOR) test; (2) increased the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Iba1 protein density; (3) reduced the protein density of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (CHRM1); (4) elevated the levels of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and reactive species (RS); and (5) caused inflammatory damage to the dentate gyrus. RET, on the other hand, was able to prevent all alterations induced by LPS, as well as increase per se the protein density of the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRα7) and Nestin, and the levels of protein thiols (T-SH). Overall, our study elucidates some mechanisms that support resistance physical exercise as a valuable approach against LPS-induced neuroinflammation and memory loss.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) can result from dominant, gain of function variants of neuronal ion channels. More than 450 de novo missense variants of the sodium channel gene <i>SCN8A</i> have been identified in individuals with DEE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied a mouse model carrying the patient <i>Scn8a</i> variant p.Asn1768Asp. An AAV-PHP.eB virus carrying an allele-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) was administered by intracerebroventricular injection. Cas9 was provided by an inherited transgene.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Allele-specific disruption of the reading frame of the pathogenic transcript generated out-of-frame indels in 1/4 to 1/3 of transcripts throughout the brain. This editing efficiency was sufficient to rescue lethality and seizures. Neuronal hyperexcitability was reduced in cells expressing the virus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The data demonstrate efficient allele-specific editing of a dominant missense variant and support the feasibility of allele-specific therapy for DEE epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94109">Multiple guidance mechanisms control axon growth to generate precise T-shaped bifurcation during dorsal funiculus development in the spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal funiculus in the spinal cord relays somatosensory information to the brain. It is made of T-shaped bifurcation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory axons. Our previous study has shown that Slit signaling is required for proper guidance during bifurcation, but loss of Slit does not affect all DRG axons. Here, we examined the role of the extracellular molecule Netrin-1 (Ntn1). Using wholemount staining with tissue clearing, we showed that mice lacking Ntn1 had axons escaping from the dorsal funiculus at the time of bifurcation. Genetic labeling confirmed that these misprojecting axons come from DRG neurons. Single axon analysis showed that loss of Ntn1 did not affect bifurcation but rather altered turning angles. To distinguish their guidance functions, we examined mice with triple deletion of Ntn1, Slit1, and Slit2 and found a completely disorganized dorsal funiculus. Comparing mice with different genotypes using immunolabeling and single axon tracing revealed additive guidance errors, demonstrating the independent roles of Ntn1 and Slit. Moreover, the same defects were observed in embryos lacking their cognate receptors. These in vivo studies thus demonstrate the presence of multi-factorial guidance mechanisms that ensure proper formation of a common branched axonal structure during spinal cord development.

                The protein dynamical transition at ~200 K, where the biomolecule transforms from a harmonic, non-functional form to an anharmonic, functional state, has been thought to be slaved to the thermal activation of dynamics in its surface hydration water. Here, by selectively probing the dynamics of protein and hydration water using elastic neutron scattering and isotopic labeling, we found that the onset of anharmonicity in the two components around 200 K is decoupled. The one in protein is an intrinsic transition, whose characteristic temperature is independent of the instrumental resolution time, but varies with the biomolecular structure and the amount of hydration, while the one of water is merely a resolution effect.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96216">Artificially inserted strong promoter containing multiple G-quadruplexes induces long-range chromatin modification</a></h4>

              
                Although the role of G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures has been suggested in chromosomal looping this was not tested directly. Here, to test causal function, an array of G4s, or control sequence that does not form G4s, were inserted within chromatin in cells. In vivo G4 formation of the inserted G4 sequence array, and not the control sequence, was confirmed using G4-selective antibody. Compared to the control insert, we observed a remarkable increase in the number of 3D chromatin looping interactions from the inserted G4 array. This was evident within the immediate topologically associated domain (TAD) and throughout the genome. Locally, recruitment of enhancer histone marks and the transcriptional coactivator p300/Acetylated-p300 increased in the G4-array, but not in the control insertion. Resulting promoter-enhancer interactions and gene activation were clear up to 5 Mb away from the insertion site. Together, these show the causal role of G4s in enhancer function and long-range chromatin interactions. Mechanisms of 3D topology are primarily based on DNA-bound architectural proteins that induce/stabilize long-range interactions. Involvement of the underlying intrinsic DNA sequence/structure in 3D looping shown here therefore throws new light on how long-range chromosomal interactions might be induced or maintained.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97027">Iron-sulfur cluster loss in mitochondrial CISD1 mediates PINK1 loss-of-function phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. In this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the Drosophila orthologue of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies. Complete loss of Cisd, in contrast, rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Our results suggest that Cisd, probably iron-depleted Cisd, operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96652">Beyond Haldane’s rule: Sex-biased hybrid dysfunction for all modes of sex determination</a></h4>

              
                Haldane’s rule occupies a special place in biology as one of the few ‘rules’ of speciation, with empirical support from hundreds of species. And yet, its classic purview is restricted taxonomically to the subset of organisms with heteromorphic sex chromosomes. I propose explicit acknowledgement of generalized hypotheses about Haldane’s rule that frame sex bias in hybrid dysfunction broadly and irrespective of the sexual system. The consensus view of classic Haldane’s rule holds that sex-biased hybrid dysfunction across taxa is a composite phenomenon that requires explanations from multiple causes. Testing of the multiple alternative hypotheses for Haldane’s rule is, in many cases, applicable to taxa with homomorphic sex chromosomes, environmental sex determination, haplodiploidy, and hermaphroditism. Integration of a variety of biological phenomena about hybrids across diverse sexual systems, beyond classic Haldane’s rule, will help to derive a more general understanding of the contributing forces and mechanisms that lead to predictable sex biases in evolutionary divergence and speciation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/76940">Fam49b dampens TCR signal strength to regulate survival of positively selected thymocytes and peripheral T cells</a></h4>

              
                The fate of developing T cells is determined by the strength of T cell receptor (TCR) signal they receive in the thymus. This process is finely regulated through the tuning of positive and negative regulators in thymocytes. The Family with sequence similarity 49 member B (Fam49b) protein is a newly discovered negative regulator of TCR signaling that has been shown to suppress Rac-1 activity in vitro in cultured T cell lines. However, the contribution of Fam49b to the thymic development of T cells is unknown. To investigate this important issue, we generated a novel mouse line deficient in Fam49b (Fam49b-KO). We observed that Fam49b-KO double positive (DP) thymocytes underwent excessive negative selection, whereas the positive selection stage was unaffected. Fam49b deficiency impaired the survival of single positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells. This altered development process resulted in significant reductions in CD4 and CD8 single-positive thymocytes as well as peripheral T cells. Interestingly, a large proportion of the TCRγδ<sup>+</sup> and CD8αα<sup>+</sup>TCRαβ<sup>+</sup> gut intraepithelial T lymphocytes were absent in Fam49b-KO mice. Our results demonstrate that Fam49b dampens thymocytes TCR signaling in order to escape negative selection during development, uncovering the function of Fam49b as a critical regulator of the selection process to ensure normal thymocyte development and peripheral T cells survival.

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of overground robot exoskeleton gait training on gait outcomes, balance, and motor function in patients with stroke. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, literature searches were performed in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, Ovid-LWW, and RISS databases. A total of 504 articles were identified, of which 19 were included for analysis after application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included literature was qualitatively evaluated using the PEDro scale, while the Egger&amp;amp;rsquo;s regression, funnel plot, and trim-and-fill methods were applied to assess and adjust for publication bias. Results: The averaged PEDro score was 6.21 points, indicating a high level of methodological quality. In the analysis based on dependent variables, higher effect sizes were observed in the following ascending order: gait speed (g = 0.26), motor function (g = 0.21), gait ability (g = 0.18), Timed Up and Go Test (g = &amp;amp;minus;0.15), gait endurance (g = 0.11), and Berg Balance Scale (g = 0.05). Subgroup analyses further revealed significant differences in Asian populations (g = 0.26), sessions lasting longer than 30 min (g = 0.37), training frequency of three times per week or less (g = 0.38), and training duration of four weeks or less (g = 0.25). Overall, the results of this study indicate that overground robot exoskeleton gait training is effective at improving gait speed in patients with stroke, particularly when the sessions exceed 30 min, are conducted three times or less per week, and last for four weeks or less. Conclusion: our results suggest that training is an effective intervention for patients with stroke, provided that appropriate goal-setting and intensity and overground robot exoskeleton gait are applied.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have validated a close association between inflammatory factors and multiple sclerosis (MS), but their causal relationship is not fully profiled yet. This study used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal effect of circulating inflammatory proteins on MS. Data from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) were analyzed using a two-sample MR method to explore the relationship between 91 circulating inflammatory proteins and MS. The inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) analysis was employed as the main method for evaluating exposures and outcomes. Furthermore, series of the methods of MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode were used to fortify the final results. The results of the IVW method were corrected with Bonferroni (bon) and false discovery rate (fdr) for validating the robustness of results and ensuring the absence of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. The sensitivity analysis was also performed. The results of the forward MR analysis showed that higher levels of CCL25 were found to be associated with an increased risk of MS according to IVW results, OR: 1.085, 95% CI (1.011, 1.165), p = 2.42 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;2, adjusted p_adj_bon = 1, p_adj_fdr = 0.307. Similarly, higher levels of CXCL10 were found to be associated with an increased risk of MS, OR: 1.231, 95% CI (1.057, 1.433), p = 7.49 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;3, adjusted p_adj_bon = 0.682, p_adj_fdr = 0.227. In contrast, elevated levels of neurturin (NRTN) were associated with a decreased risk of MS, OR: 0.815, 95% CI (0.689, 0.964), p = 1.68 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;2, adjusted p_adj_bon = 1, p_adj_fdr = 0.307. Reverse MR analysis showed no causal relationship between MS and the identified circulating inflammatory cytokines. The effects of heterogeneity and level pleiotropy were further excluded by sensitivity analysis. This study provides new insights into the relationship between circulating inflammatory proteins and MS and brings up a new possibility of using these cytokines as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The data in this study show that there are only weak associations between inflammatory molecules and MS risk, which did not survive bon and fdr correction, and the obtained p-values are quite low. Therefore, further studies on larger samples are needed.</p>

	<p>Motor imagery (MI) requires the mental representation of the body, obtained by integrating exteroceptive and interoceptive information. This study aimed to investigate the role of interoceptive sensitivity (IS) in MI performed through visual and kinesthetic modalities by participants with low (lows, N = 26; SHSS: A, M + SD: 1.00 + 1.52), medium (mediums, N = 11; SHSS: A, 6.00 + 0.77) and high hypnotizability scores (highs, N = 16; SHSS:A, 9.75 + 1.24), as measured by the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale: Form A. The three groups displayed different MI abilities and IS levels. The efficacy of MI was measured using the chronometric index and self-reported experience, while IS was measured using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) questionnaire. Alpha and beta power spectrum densities (PSDs) were extracted from the EEG signals acquired during baseline, actual movement and visually and kinesthetically imagined movements. The chronometric indices do not reveal significant differences between groups and imagery modalities. The self-report MI efficacy indicates better kinesthetic imagery in highs and mediums than in lows, and no modality difference among lows. The MAIA dimensions sustain the differences in subjective experience and almost all the EEG differences. The latter are slightly different in highs, mediums and lows. This is the first report of the major role played by IS in MI and strongly supports the theory of embodied cognition.</p>

	<p>Long COVID (Coronavirus disease), affecting millions globally, presents unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems due to its complex, multifaceted nature and the lack of effective treatments. This perspective review explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-guided transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an innovative approach to address the urgent need for effective Long COVID management. The authors examine how AI could optimize tDCS protocols, enhance clinical trial design, and facilitate personalized treatment for the heterogeneous manifestations of Long COVID. Key areas discussed include AI-driven personalization of tDCS parameters based on individual patient characteristics and real-time symptom fluctuations, the use of machine learning for patient stratification, and the development of more sensitive outcome measures in clinical trials. This perspective addresses ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and equitable access to AI-enhanced treatments. It also explores challenges and opportunities for implementing AI-guided tDCS across diverse healthcare settings globally. Future research directions are outlined, including the need for large-scale validation studies and investigations of long-term efficacy and safety. The authors argue that while AI-guided tDCS shows promise for addressing the complex nature of Long COVID, significant technical, ethical, and practical challenges remain. They emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, patient-centered approaches, and a commitment to global health equity in realizing the potential of this technology. This perspective article provides a roadmap for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers involved in developing and implementing AI-guided neuromodulation therapies for Long COVID and potentially other neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p>

	<p>Calcium imaging, especially two-photon imaging, has become essential in neuroscience for studying neuronal and astrocytic activity under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Current advances in the development of calcium sensors as well as imaging hardware enable high-frequency measurements of calcium signals in hundreds of cells simultaneously. The analysis of these large datasets requires special tools and usually a certain level of programming experience. Despite advancements in calcium imaging analysis software development, significant gaps remain, particularly for data acquired at a high sampling rate that would allow for the spectral analysis of calcium signals. The FluoAnalysis MATLAB toolbox addresses these gaps by offering a comprehensive solution for analyzing simultaneously measured calcium imaging and electrophysiological data.

	<p>Current pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are often only partially effective, with many patients experiencing no significant benefit, leading to treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Psilocybin, a classical serotonergic psychedelic, has emerged as a notable emerging treatment for such disorders. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize and discuss the most recent evidence about the therapeutic effects of single-dose and two-dose psilocybin administration on the severity of depressive symptoms, as well as compare the efficacy of these interventions among patients with a primary diagnosis of MDD or TRD. Articles were collected from EBSCOhost and PubMed following the PRISMA guidelines, yielding 425 articles with 138 duplicates. After screening 287 records, 12 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. A quantitative analysis of the studies indicates that psilocybin is highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms severity among patients with primary MDD or TRD. Both single-dose and two-dose psilocybin treatments significantly reduced depressive symptoms severity, with two-dose administration sometimes yielding more pronounced and lasting effects. However, it is unclear if this was solely due to dosage or other factors. Future research should include standardized trials comparing these dosing strategies to better inform clinical practice.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. The clinical continuum of AD spans from preclinical disease to subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages (mild, moderate, and severe). Neuropathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) into extracellular plaques in the brain parenchyma and in the cerebral vasculature, and by abnormally phosphorylated tau that accumulates intraneuronally forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Development of treatment approaches that prevent or even reduce the cognitive decline because of AD has been slow compared to other major causes of death. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to 2 different Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibodies. However, this breakthrough disease modifying approach only applies to a limited subset of patients in the AD continuum and there are stringent eligibility criteria. Furthermore, these approaches do not prevent progression of disease, because other AD-related pathologies, such as NFTs, are not directly targeted. A non-mutually exclusive alternative is to address lifestyle interventions that can help reduce the risk of AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). It is estimated that addressing such modifiable risk factors could potentially delay up to 40% of AD/ADRD cases. In this review, we discuss some of the many modifiable risk factors that may be associated with prevention of AD/ADRD and/or increasing brain resilience, as well as other factors that may interact with these modifiable risk factors to influence AD/ADRD progression.

	<p>(1) Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) utilizing multi-echo gradient echo-planar imaging (ME-GE-EPI) has demonstrated higher sensitivity and stability compared to utilizing single-echo gradient echo-planar imaging (SE-GE-EPI). The direct derivation of T2* maps from fitting multi-echo data enables accurate recording of dynamic functional changes in the brain, exhibiting higher sensitivity than echo combination maps. However, the widely employed voxel-wise log-linear fitting is susceptible to inevitable noise accumulation during image acquisition. (2) Methods: This work introduced a synthetic data-driven deep learning (SD-DL) method to obtain T2* maps for multi-echo (ME) fMRI analysis. (3) Results: The experimental results showed the efficient enhancement of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), improved task-based blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) percentage signal change, and enhanced performance in multi-echo independent component analysis (MEICA) using the proposed method. (4) Conclusion: T2* maps derived from ME-fMRI data using the proposed SD-DL method exhibit enhanced BOLD sensitivity in comparison to T2* maps derived from the LLF method.</p>

	<p>In recent years, sports-related concussion (SRC) in soccer has been extensively researched worldwide. However, there have been no reports of large-scale SRC studies among soccer players in Japan. The purpose of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of SRC among university soccer players in Japan. This descriptive epidemiological study collected data on the history of SRC and details of SRC injuries during soccer. The participants were university male soccer players belonging to the Japan University Football Association. SRC rates were calculated per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs). A total of 5953 students participated in this study. The SRC rate was 0.10/1000 AE during total activities. The SRC rate during competition (0.42/1000 AE) was higher than in practice (0.04/1000 AE). The most frequent mechanism of SRC was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (26.9%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (24.2%). During competition, the most frequent mechanism was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (30.8%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ground&amp;amp;rdquo; (23.8%), and &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (19.3%) followed, while in practice, it was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (34.8%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ground&amp;amp;rdquo; (23.8%), and &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (17.2%). Thus, there was a difference in the mechanism of injury between competition and practice. In this study, among Japanese university soccer players, the SRC rate was to be approximately ten times higher in competition than in practice.</p>

	<p>The current descriptive study reports the sleep, diet, and exercise patterns among 114 dementia caregivers, whose mean age was 55.7 (SD: 10.4) years, with 83 (72.8%) being women. The results indicate significant sleep dysfunction: 37.2% of caregivers reported rarely or never feeling rested upon waking, and 46.5% did not get enough sleep, with 45.6% sleeping only 5 to 5.5 h on average. Sleep latency was also prevalent, as 33.3% required 16 to 30 min to fall asleep. Dietary habits showed reliance on coffee, with 69.4% consuming it daily. Meat consumption was reported by 75%, and 60.9% ate pasta, indicating common dietary preferences. While 86.2% had one to three meals per day, 100% of the caregivers supplemented their diets with vitamins. The physical activity level was low, with 62.3% of respondents reporting no exercise in the past week. These findings underscore significant health concerns among dementia caregivers, including sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and physical inactivity. The report emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to promote self-care practices that can enhance caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; health, including better sleep hygiene, balanced nutrition, and regular exercise.</p>

	<p>Fatigue is one of the most frequent complaints of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), one of the 30 available fatigue questionnaires, is commonly applied because it evaluates multidimensional aspects of fatigue. The chief objectives of this study were to validate FIS and evaluate the psychometric properties of MS patients in Serbia. One hundred and twenty-one (121) MS patients and one hundred and twenty-two (122) age-, gender- and education-matched healthy control (HC) subjects completed the FIS and the Beck Depression Inventory. Internal consistency of the FIS subscales was determined using Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha Coefficient. Test/retest reliability with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for each FIS subscale was performed. The total FIS score and subscale scores showed statistically significant differences between the MS patients and the HC subjects in both FIS sessions. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha was 0.966. All ICCs were statistically significant (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The Serbian version of this instrument may be useful as a clinical measure for fatigue and functionality in patients with MS.</p>

                <p>by Catherine M Byrne, Ana Citlali Márquez, Bing Cai, Daniel Coombs, Soren Gantt</p>

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection. Several HCMV vaccines are in development, but none have yet been approved. An understanding of the kinetics of CMV replication and transmission may inform the rational design of vaccines to prevent this infection. The salivary glands (SG) are an important site of sustained CMV replication following primary infection and during viral reactivation from latency. As such, the strength of the immune response in the SG likely influences viral dissemination within and between hosts. To study the relationship between the immune response and viral replication in the SG, and viral dissemination from the SG to other tissues, mice were infected with low doses of murine CMV (MCMV). Following intra-SG inoculation, we characterized the viral and immunological dynamics in the SG, blood, and spleen, and identified organ-specific immune correlates of protection. Using these data, we constructed compartmental mathematical models of MCMV infection. Model fitting to data and analysis indicate the importance of cellular immune responses in different organs and point to a threshold of infection within the SG necessary for the establishment and spread of infection.

                <p>by Ao Liu, Andrea Mair, Juliana L. Matos, Macy Vollbrecht, Shou-Ling Xu, Dominique C. Bergmann</p>

The development of multicellular organisms requires coordinated changes in gene expression that are often mediated by the interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (CREs). During development and differentiation, the accessibility of CREs is dynamically modulated by the epigenome. How the epigenome, CREs, and TFs together exert control over cell fate commitment remains to be fully understood. In the <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaf epidermis, meristemoids undergo a series of stereotyped cell divisions, then switch fate to commit to stomatal differentiation. Newly created or reanalyzed scRNA-seq and ChIP-seq data confirm that stomatal development involves distinctive phases of transcriptional regulation and that differentially regulated genes are bound by the stomatal basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) TFs. Targets of the bHLHs often reside in repressive chromatin before activation. MNase-seq evidence further suggests that the repressive state can be overcome and remodeled upon activation by specific stomatal bHLHs. We propose that chromatin remodeling is mediated through the recruitment of a set of physical interactors that we identified through proximity labeling—the ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. The bHLHs and chromatin remodelers localize to overlapping genomic regions in a hierarchical order. Furthermore, plants with stage-specific knockdown of the SWI/SNF components or HAC1 fail to activate specific bHLH targets and display stomatal development defects. Together, these data converge on a model for how stomatal TFs and epigenetic machinery cooperatively regulate transcription and chromatin remodeling during progressive fate specification.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23621?af=R">17β‐Estradiol reduces inhibitory synaptic currents in entorhinal cortex neurons through G protein‐coupled estrogen receptor‐1 activation of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens are believed to modulate cognitive functions in part through the modulation of synaptic transmission in the cortex and hippocampus. Administration of 17β-estradiol (E2) can rapidly enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission in rat lateral entorhinal cortex via activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1). To assess the mechanisms through which GPER1 activation facilitates synaptic transmission, we assessed the effects of acute 10 nM E2 administration on pharmacologically isolated evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in layer II/III entorhinal neurons. Female Long-Evans rats were ovariectomized between postnatal day (PD) 63 and 74 and implanted with a subdermal E2 capsule to maintain continuous low levels of E2. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained between 7 and 20 days after ovariectomy. Application of E2 for 20 min did not significantly affect AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic currents. However, GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) were markedly reduced by E2 and returned towards baseline levels during the 20-min washout period. The inhibition of GABA-mediated IPSCs was blocked in the presence of the GPER1 receptor antagonist G15. GPER1 can modulate protein kinase A (PKA), but blocking PKA with intracellular KT5720 did not prevent the E2-induced reduction in IPSCs. GPER1 can also stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a negative modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and blocking activation of ERK with PD90859 prevented the E2-induced reduction of IPSCs. E2 can therefore result in a rapid GPER1 and ERK signaling-mediated reduction in GABA-mediated IPSCs. This provides a novel mechanism through which E2 can rapidly modulate synaptic excitability in entorhinal layer II/III neurons and may also contribute to E2 and ERK-dependent alterations in synaptic transmission in other brain areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23622?af=R">Cholinergic and behavior‐dependent beta and gamma waves are coupled between olfactory bulb and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory oscillations may enhance cognitive processing through coupling with beta (β, 15–30 Hz) and gamma (γ, 30–160 Hz) activity in the hippocampus (HPC). We hypothesize that coupling between olfactory bulb (OB) and HPC oscillations is increased by cholinergic activation in control rats and is reduced in kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. OB γ2 (63–100 Hz) power was higher during walking and immobility-awake (IMM) compared to sleep, while γ1 (30–57 Hz) power was higher during grooming than other behavioral states. Muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (25 mg/kg ip) with peripheral muscarinic blockade increased OB power and OB-HPC coherence at β and γ1 frequency bands. A similar effect was found after physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg ip) but not scopolamine (10 mg/kg ip). Pilocarpine increased bicoherence and cross-frequency coherence (CFC) between OB slow waves (SW, 1–5 Hz) and hippocampal β, γ1 and γ2 waves, with stronger coherence at CA1 alveus and CA3c than CA1 stratum radiatum. Bicoherence further revealed a nonlinear interaction of β waves in OB with β waves at the CA1-alveus. Beta and γ1 waves in OB or HPC were segregated at one phase of the OB-SW, opposite to the phase of γ2 and γ3 (100–160 Hz) waves, suggesting independent temporal processing of β/γ1 versus γ2/γ3 waves. At CA1 radiatum, kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats compared to control rats showed decreased theta power, theta-β and theta-γ2 CFC during baseline walking, decreased CFC of HPC SW with γ2 and γ3 waves during baseline IMM, and decreased coupling of OB SW with β and γ2 waves at CA1 alveus after pilocarpine. It is concluded that β and γ waves in the OB and HPC are modulated by a slow respiratory rhythm, in a cholinergic and behavior-dependent manner, and OB-HPC functional connectivity at β and γ frequencies may enhance cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23625?af=R">Nogo‐A‐mediated constraints on activity‐dependent synaptic plasticity and associativity in rat hippocampal CA2 synapses</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal area CA2 has garnered attention in recent times owing to its significant involvement in social memory and distinctive plasticity characteristics. Research has revealed that the CA2 region demonstrates a remarkable resistance to plasticity, particularly in the Schaffer Collateral (SC)-CA2 pathway. In this study we investigated the role of Nogo-A, a well-known axon growth inhibitor and more recently discovered plasticity regulator, in modulating plasticity within the CA2 region. The findings demonstrate that blocking Nogo-A in male rat hippocampal slices facilitates the establishment of both short-term and long-term plasticity in the SC-CA2 pathway, while having no impact on the Entorhinal Cortical (EC)-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the study reveals that inhibiting Nogo-A enables association between the SC and EC pathways. Mechanistically, we confirm that Nogo-A operates through its well-known co-receptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), and its downstream signaling factor such as Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), as their inhibition also allows plasticity induction in the SC-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in both the EC and SC-CA2 pathways led to persistent LTD, which was not affected by Nogo-A inhibition. Our study demonstrates the involvement of Nogo-A mediated signaling mechanisms in limiting synaptic plasticity within the CA2 region.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23632?af=R">Spatial memory encoding is associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampus: An fMRI activation likelihood estimation meta‐analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It has been hypothesized that differential processing occurs along the longitudinal (anterior–posterior) axis of the hippocampus. One hypothesis is that spatial memory (during both encoding and retrieval) is associated with the posterior hippocampus. An alternative hypothesis is that memory encoding (either spatial or nonspatial) is associated with the anterior hippocampus and memory retrieval is associated with the posterior hippocampus. Of importance, during spatial memory encoding, the spatial–posterior hypothesis predicts posterior hippocampal involvement, whereas the encoding–retrieval hypothesis predicts anterior hippocampal involvement. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we conducted a coordinate-based fMRI activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 26 studies (with a total of 435 participants) that reported hippocampal activity during spatial memory encoding and/or spatial memory retrieval. Both spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced extensive activity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus as well as the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and the parahippocampal cortex. Critically, the contrast of spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced activations in both the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus. That spatial memory encoding produced activity in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus can be taken to reject strict forms of the spatial–posterior hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of spatial memory produce activity in the posterior hippocampus, and the encoding–retrieval hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of encoding versus retrieval produce activity in only the anterior hippocampus. Our results indicate that spatial memory encoding can involve the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-402/v2?src=rss">Anticancer activities of tocotrienols: A Systematic Scoping Review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The increasing number of cancer cases requires developing newer approaches to treat this disease. One approach uses natural compounds with known anticancer effects, such as tocotrienols. Many cell-based and animal-model studies found that tocotrienols possess potent anticancer activities. However, the exact molecular regulatory mechanism through which tocotrienols exert anticancer actions remains unclear. Methods: This scoping review analysed data from original research articles reporting on the anticancer effects of tocotrienols on human cancer cell lines published in the last seven years (January 2015 and September 2021) using a systematic scoping review approach. From the initial 619 research papers [ProQuest (n= 61), PubMed (n= 84), Embase (n = 148), Ovid Medline (n =53), Scopus (n = 137), Web of Science (n =136)] identified using pre-defined keywords, only 37 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this review. Human cancers commonly studied in the 37 research articles include breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer cell lines. Results: The analysis showed that exposing human cancer cell lines to tocotrienols triggered common anticancer mechanisms such as activation of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation, angiogenesis and cell migration through regulation of key regulatory genes and proteins involved in these pathways. Conclusions: The findings show that tocotrienols regulate a number of biomarkers that induce cell death and regulate cell cycle in various types of human cancer cells. Further targeted studies are required to map the definite pathways by which T3 exerts their action and to better understand the cellular actions and the regulatory pathways.

                Alternative splicing critically regulates brain development. Yang et al. found that spliceosomal factor Eftud2 is essential for Purkinje cell (PC) development, survival, and cerebellar integrity by preventing ferroptosis. Inhibition of ferroptosis efficiently rescues PC death in Eftud2-deficient mice. These findings provide a promising therapeutic strategy for EFTUD2 deficiency-induced diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92826">Hyperglycemia induced cathepsin L maturation linked to diabetic comorbidities and COVID-19 mortality</a></h4>

              
                Diabetes, a prevalent chronic condition, significantly increases the risk of mortality from COVID-19, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Emerging evidence implicates Cathepsin L (CTSL) in diabetic complications, including nephropathy and retinopathy. Our previous research identified CTSL as a pivotal protease promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate elevated blood CTSL levels in individuals with diabetes, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic hyperglycemia correlates positively with CTSL concentration and activity in diabetic patients, while acute hyperglycemia augments CTSL activity in healthy individuals. In vitro studies reveal high glucose, but not insulin, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells, with <i>CTSL</i> knockout cells displaying reduced susceptibility. Utilizing lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, alongside <i>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></i>mice and <i>Lepr<sup>db/+</sup></i>mice, we illustrate increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hyperglycemia-induced CTSL maturation in diabetic comorbidities and complications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91568">Biocalcification in porcelaneous foraminifera</a></h4>

              
                Living organisms control the formation of mineral skeletons and other structures through biomineralization. Major phylogenetic groups usually consistently follow a single biomineralization pathway. Foraminifera, which are very efficient marine calcifiers, making a substantial contribution to global carbonate production and global carbon sequestration, are regarded as an exception. This phylum has been commonly thought to follow two contrasting models of either <i>in situ</i> ‘mineralization of extracellular matrix’ attributed to hyaline rotaliid shells, or ‘mineralization within intracellular vesicles’ attributed to porcelaneous miliolid shells. Our previous results on rotaliids along with those on miliolids in this paper question such a wide divergence of biomineralization pathways within the same phylum of Foraminifera. We have found under a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that precipitation of high-Mg calcitic mesocrystals in porcelaneous shells takes place <i>in situ</i> and form a dense, chaotic meshwork of needle-like crystallites. We have not observed calcified needles that already precipitated in the transported vesicles, what challenges the previous model of miliolid mineralization. Hence, Foraminifera probably utilize less divergent calcification pathways, following the recently discovered biomineralization principles. Mesocrystalline chamber walls in both models are therefore most likely created by intravesicular accumulation of pre-formed liquid amorphous mineral phase deposited and crystallized within the extracellular organic matrix enclosed in a biologically controlled privileged space by active pseudopodial structures. Both calcification pathways evolved independently in the Paleozoic and are well conserved in two clades that represent different chamber formation modes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81571">Membrane curvature sensing and symmetry breaking of the M2 proton channel from Influenza A</a></h4>

              
                The M2 proton channel aids in the exit of mature influenza viral particles from the host plasma membrane through its ability to stabilize regions of high negative gaussian curvature (NGC) that occur at the neck of budding virions. The channels are homo-tetramers that contain a cytoplasm-facing amphipathic helix (AH) that is necessary and sufficient for NGC generation; however, constructs containing the transmembrane spanning helix, which facilitates tetramerization, exhibit enhanced curvature generation. Here we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the conformational dynamics of M2 channels in lipid bilayers revealing that the AH is dynamic, quickly breaking the 4-fold symmetry observed in most structures. Next, we carried out MD simulations with the protein restrained in 4-fold and 2-fold symmetric conformations to determine the impact on the membrane shape. While each pattern was distinct, all configurations induced pronounced curvature in the outer leaflet, while conversely, the inner leaflets showed minimal curvature and significant lipid tilt around the AHs. The MD-generated profiles at the protein-membrane interface were then extracted and used as boundary conditions in a continuum elastic membrane model to calculate the membrane bending energy of each conformation embedded in different membrane surfaces characteristic of a budding virus. The calculations show that all three M2 conformations are stabilized in inward-budding, concave spherical caps and destabilized in outward-budding, convex spherical caps, the latter reminiscent of a budding virus. One of the C2-broken symmetry conformations is stabilized by 4 kT in NGC surfaces with the minimum energy conformation occurring at a curvature corresponding to 33 nm radii. In total, our work provides atomistic insight into the curvature sensing capabilities of M2 channels and how enrichment in the nascent viral particle depends on protein shape and membrane geometry.

	<p>Objectives: Hypersensitive acupoints in specific body areas are associated with corresponding internal or visceral disorders. Back-shu points are clinically significant for the diagnosis of visceral organ disease, according to the biomechanical characteristics of the acupoints. In this study, we assessed the biomechanical characteristics and pain sensitivities of five back-shu points linked to five visceral organs in healthy participants. Methods: The study included 48 volunteer participants. A myotonometry was used to assess muscle tone and muscle stiffness at five back-shu points associated with visceral organs. Pressure was monitored using a microcontroller and a force sensor. Pain sensitivity was assessed in response to deep pressure pain produced by a constant force. Results: Substantial differences in muscle tone and stiffness were observed at the five back-shu points; muscle tone was highest at BL15, whereas muscle tone and muscle stiffness were lowest at BL23. Moreover, pain sensitivity was significantly different among the acupoints; pain sensitivity was highest at BL23. There was a significant negative correlation between muscle tone and pain sensitivity. Conclusions: We found significant differences in muscle tone, muscle stiffness, and pain sensitivity among five back-shu points associated with visceral organs, which may be attributable to anatomical variations at each point. Our findings suggest that differences at back-shu points should be considered to ensure the accurate diagnosis of visceral disease.</p>

	<p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered one of the most effective treatments for psychiatric disorders. ECT has proven effective in the treatment of depression, mania, catatonia and psychosis. It is presumed that seizures induced during ECT administration cause toxicity and potentially neuronal and glial cell death. A broad range of neurological disorders increase cerebrospinal fluid and serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S-100b protein. This study aims to investigate the effect of ECT on NSE and S-100b levels, which, together, serve as a proxy for neuronal cell damage. Serum concentrations of S-100b and NSE of adult patients who received ECT were measured by immunoluminometric analysis before and after treatment. A two-way ANOVA test was used to estimate the statistical differences in marker concentrations between the subgroups of the study population. Results: A total of 55 patients were included in the analysis: 52.73% (n = 29) were diagnosed with depression, 21.82% (n = 12) with schizophrenia or other psychosis, 16.36% (n = 9) with mania and 9.09% (n = 5) with catatonia. There were no statistically significant changes in NSE (p = 0.288) and S-100b (p = 0.243) levels. We found no evidence that ECT induced neuronal damage based on NSE and S-100b protein levels measured in the serum of patients before and after treatment.</p>

	<p>Tracheostomy ventilation (TV) can increase survival time for people living with motor neurone disease (MND); however, the use of TV varies between countries. Concerns regarding anticipated quality of life (QoL) are among the reasons given by healthcare professionals for not recommending this intervention, yet little is known about QoL in this context. This scoping review was conducted to examine the evidence on QoL for those with MND who use TV and family members involved in their care. Using the methodological guidance of the Joanna Briggs Institute, 23 papers were identified for inclusion, and findings were inductively analysed to identify key themes. We found that people living with MND tend to rate QoL post TV more positively than anticipated by healthcare professionals or family members. QoL was found to be related to positive relationships and activities the person could maintain. Feeling able to make a choice and an adequate level of financial resources were also important factors. Family members tended to experience lower QoL, associated with the uncertainty surrounding an emergency procedure and the complexity of subsequently required care. More evidence on QoL from the perspectives of people with MND who use TV is needed to support decision making and inform guidance.</p>

	<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can objectively reflect a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional state and have been widely studied in emotion recognition. However, the effective feature fusion and discriminative feature learning from EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS data is challenging. In order to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition, a graph convolution and capsule attention network model (GCN-CA-CapsNet) is proposed. Firstly, EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS signals are collected from 50 subjects induced by emotional video clips. And then, the features of the EEG and fNIRS are extracted; the EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS features are fused to generate higher-quality primary capsules by graph convolution with the Pearson correlation adjacency matrix. Finally, the capsule attention module is introduced to assign different weights to the primary capsules, and higher-quality primary capsules are selected to generate better classification capsules in the dynamic routing mechanism. We validate the efficacy of the proposed method on our emotional EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS dataset with an ablation study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GCN-CA-CapsNet method achieves a more satisfactory performance against the state-of-the-art methods, and the average accuracy can increase by 3&amp;amp;ndash;11%.</p>

	<p>This study investigated relations between a measure of early-stage visual function and self-reported visual anomalies in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Eleven individuals at CHR identified via the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS) were recruited from a CHR-P research program in NYC. The sample was ~36% female, ranging from 16 to 33 years old (M = 23.90, SD = 6.14). Participants completed a contrast sensitivity task on an iPad with five spatial frequencies (0.41&amp;amp;ndash;13 cycles/degree) and completed the self-report Audio-Visual Abnormalities Questionnaire. Higher contrast sensitivity (better performance) to low spatial frequencies was associated with higher perceptual (r = 0.616, p = 0.044) and visual disturbances (r = 0.667, p = 0.025); lower contrast sensitivity to a middle spatial frequency was also associated with higher perceptual (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.604, p = 0.049) and visual disturbances (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.606, p = 0.048). This relation between the questionnaire and contrast sensitivity to low spatial frequency may be indicative of a reduction in lateral inhibition and &amp;amp;ldquo;flooding&amp;amp;rdquo; of environmental stimuli. The association with middle spatial frequencies, which play a critical role in face processing, may result in a range of perceptual abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that self-reported perceptual anomalies occur in these individuals and are linked to performance on a measure of early visual processing.</p>

                Background In Australia, we are not meeting our goals in relation to breastfeeding overall, and in particular, promoting and supporting breastfeeding rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies especially breastfeeding to at least six months. The WHO has recognised the importance of exclusively breastfeeding a baby for a minimum of six months to ensure a healthy start to life. Breastfeeding has been shown to be a protective factor against asthma and allergy development, ear disease, infections, respiratory illness and gastrointestinal issues. This study aims to improve predominant breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies in the Perth Metropolitan area (Western Australia, Australia). Methods and analysis We will use an interrupted time series design to determine the effectiveness of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program delivered over 6 months by selected community health staff. The intervention will be delivered at two community health regions and the remaining 17 community health regions will be the control group. The primary outcomes will be predominant breastfeeding rates at two and four months, and secondary outcomes will include any breastfeeding at two and four months, and hospital admissions, emergency department presentations and immunisation data at 6 months. Discussion The study will allow us to determine the breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal babies, identify the barriers and enablers to initiating and maintaining breastfeeding and determine whether a CQI program can achieve improvements in breastfeeding rates.

                <p>by Scott L. Nuismer, Andrew J. Basinski, Courtney L. Schreiner, Evan A. Eskew, Elisabeth Fichet-Calvet, Christopher H. Remien</p>

Reducing spillover of zoonotic pathogens is an appealing approach to preventing human disease and minimizing the risk of future epidemics and pandemics. Although the immediate human health benefit of reducing spillover is clear, over time, spillover reduction could lead to counterintuitive negative consequences for human health. Here, we use mathematical models and computer simulations to explore the conditions under which unanticipated consequences of spillover reduction can occur in systems where the severity of disease increases with age at infection. Our results demonstrate that, because the average age at infection increases as spillover is reduced, programs that reduce spillover can actually increase population-level disease burden if the clinical severity of infection increases sufficiently rapidly with age. If, however, immunity wanes over time and reinfection is possible, our results reveal that negative health impacts of spillover reduction become substantially less likely. When our model is parameterized using published data on Lassa virus in West Africa, it predicts that negative health outcomes are possible, but likely to be restricted to a small subset of populations where spillover is unusually intense. Together, our results suggest that adverse consequences of spillover reduction programs are unlikely but that the public health gains observed immediately after spillover reduction may fade over time as the age structure of immunity gradually re-equilibrates to a reduced force of infection.

                <p>by Rachael Stentiford, James C. Knight, Thomas Nowotny, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

The central complex of insects contains cells, organised as a ring attractor, that encode head direction. The ‘bump’ of activity in the ring can be updated by idiothetic cues and external sensory information. Plasticity at the synapses between these cells and the ring neurons, that are responsible for bringing sensory information into the central complex, has been proposed to form a mapping between visual cues and the heading estimate which allows for more accurate tracking of the current heading, than if only idiothetic information were used. In Drosophila, ring neurons have well characterised non-linear receptive fields. In this work we produce synthetic versions of these visual receptive fields using a combination of excitatory inputs and mutual inhibition between ring neurons. We use these receptive fields to bring visual information into a spiking neural network model of the insect central complex based on the recently published Drosophila connectome. Previous modelling work has focused on how this circuit functions as a ring attractor using the same type of simple visual cues commonly used experimentally. While we initially test the model on these simple stimuli, we then go on to apply the model to complex natural scenes containing multiple conflicting cues. We show that this simple visual filtering provided by the ring neurons is sufficient to form a mapping between heading and visual features and maintain the heading estimate in the absence of angular velocity input. The network is successful at tracking heading even when presented with videos of natural scenes containing conflicting information from environmental changes and translation of the camera.

Grassland aridification threatens biodiversity which supports ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF), but the relative roles of biota in maintaining EMF are poorly known. A new study in PLoS Biology finds complementarity of above- and belowground biodiversity and a trade-off between fungal and plant richness in driving EMF with aridity.
