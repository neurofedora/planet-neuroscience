              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Charting brain growth and aging at high spatial precision</a></h4>

              
                Defining reference models for population variation, and the ability to study individual deviations is essential for understanding inter-individual variability and its relation to the onset and progression of medical conditions. In this work, we assembled a reference cohort of neuroimaging data from 82 sites (N=58,836; ages 2-100) and use normative modeling to characterize lifespan trajectories of cortical thickness and subcortical volume. Models are validated against a manually quality checked subset (N=24,354) and we provide an interface for transferring to new data sources. We showcase the clinical value by applying the models to a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (N=1,985), showing they can be used to quantify variability underlying multiple disorders whilst also refining case-control inferences. These models will be augmented with additional samples and imaging modalities as they become available. This provides a common reference platform to bind results from different studies and ultimately paves the way for personalized clinical decision making.

                Neuroinflammation is well known to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that has been implicated in neuroinflammation, but its precise cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in...

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The distribution patterns of a set of conserved brain developmental regulatory transcription factors were analyzed in the forebrain of the basal actinopterygian fish <i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>, consistent with the prosomeric model. In the telencephalon, the pallium was characterized by ventricular expression of <i>Pax6</i>. In the subpallium, the combined expression of <i>Nkx2.1</i>/Islet-1 (<i>Isl1</i>) allowed to propose ventral and dorsal areas, as the septo-pallidal (<i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i>+) and striatal derivatives (<i>Isl1</i>+), respectively, and a dorsal portion of the striatal derivatives, ventricularly rich in <i>Pax6</i> and devoid of <i>Isl1</i> expression. Dispersed Orthopedia (<i>Otp</i>) cells were found in the supracommissural and posterior nuclei of the ventral telencephalon, related to the medial portion of the amygdaloid complex. The preoptic area was identified by the <i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i> expression. In the alar hypothalamus, an <i>Otp</i>-expressing territory, lacking <i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i>, was identified as the paraventricular domain. The adjacent subparaventricular domain (Spa) was subdivided in a rostral territory expressing <i>Nkx2.1</i> and an <i>Isl1</i>+ caudal one. In the basal hypothalamus, the tuberal region was defined by the <i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i> expression and a rostral <i>Otp</i>-expressing domain was identified. Moreover, the <i>Otp</i>/<i>Nkx2.1</i> combination showed an additional zone lacking <i>Isl1</i>, tentatively identified as the mamillary area. In the diencephalon, both <i>Pax6</i> and <i>Isl1</i> defined the prethalamic domain, and within the basal prosomere 3, scattered <i>Pax6</i>- and <i>Isl1</i>-expressing cells were observed in the posterior tubercle. Finally, a small group of <i>Pax6</i> cells was observed in the pretectal area. These results improve the understanding of the forebrain evolution and demonstrate that its basic <i>bauplan</i> is present very early in the vertebrate lineage.</p>

     alt="DARPP-32 distinguishes a subset of adult-born neurons in zebra finch HVC"/>
<p>We have discovered that the phosphoprotein DARPP-32 is expressed in half of all adult-born neurons (HVC NNs) in the songbird premotor brain region HVC (proper name) during their first month post-mitosis. We demonstrate that DARPP-32+ HVC NNs cannot be backfilled from target nucleus RA, receive putative catecholaminergic synaptic contacts, and have transiently larger nuclei than DARPP-32-neg HVC NNs at one month post-mitosis. These data suggest that there are two distinct subtypes of adult-born neurons in songbird HVC.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult male zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) continually incorporate adult-born neurons into HVC, a telencephalic brain region necessary for the production of learned song. These neurons express activity-dependent immediate early genes (e.g., <i>zenk</i> and <i>c-fos</i>) following song production, suggesting that these neurons are active during song production. Half of these adult-born HVC neurons (HVC NNs) can be backfilled from the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and are a part of the vocal motor pathway underlying learned song production, but the other half do not backfill from RA, and they remain to be characterized. Here, we used cell birth-dating, retrograde tract tracing, and immunofluorescence to demonstrate that half of all HVC NNs express the phosphoprotein DARPP-32, a protein associated with dopamine receptor expression. We also demonstrate that DARPP-32+ HVC NNs are contacted by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive fibers, suggesting that they receive catecholaminergic input, have transiently larger nuclei than DARPP-32-neg HVC NNs, and do not backfill from RA. Taken together, these findings help characterize a group of HVC NNs that have no apparent projections to RA and so far have eluded positive identification other than HVC NN status.</p>

     alt="Pretecto- and ponto-cerebellar pathways to the pigeon oculomotor cerebellum follow a zonal organization"/>
<p>Using injections of retrograde tracers, we show that the medial and lateral pontine nucleus (PM and PL, respectively), and the medial and lateral subdivisions of the medial spiriform nucleus (SpMm and SpMl, respectively) project to different parasagittal zones in the oculomotor cerebellum of the pigeon. We discuss how the pathway to zone A1 processes mainly visuo-motor information to spinal premotor areas, whereas the pathways to zone A2/C processes somato-motor and visuo-motor information and may have a feedback/modulatory role.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Both birds and mammals have relatively large forebrains and cerebella. In mammals, there are extensive sensory–motor projections to the cerebellum through the pontine nuclei originating from several parts of the cerebral cortex. Similar forebrain-to-cerebellum pathways exist in birds, but the organization of this circuitry has not been studied extensively. Birds have two nuclei at the base of the brainstem that are thought to be homologous to the pontine nuclei of mammals, the medial and lateral pontine nuclei (PM, PL). Additionally, birds are unique in that they have a pretectal nucleus called the medial spiriform nucleus (SpM) that, like the pontine nuclei, also receives projections from the forebrain and projects to the oculomotor cerebellum (OCb; folia VI to VIII). The OCb also receives input from the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (LM), which analyzes visual optic flow information resulting from self-movement. In this study, we used single or double injections of fluorescent tracers to study the organization of these inputs from PM, PL, SpM and LM to the OCb in pigeons. We found that these inputs follow a zonal organization. The most medial zone in the OCb, zone A1, receives bilateral inputs from the lateral SpM, PL and LM. Zones A2 and C receive a bilateral projection from the medial SpM, and a mostly contralateral projection from PM and LM. We discuss how the pathway to zone A1 processes mainly visuo-motor information to spinal premotor areas, whereas the pathways to zone A2/C processes somato-motor and visuo-motor information and may have a feedback/modulatory role.</p>

     alt="Distribution and daily oscillation of GABA in the circadian system of the cockroach Rhyparobia maderae"/>
<p>GABA is a prominent neurotransmitter in the circadian system of the Madeira cockroach. The GABA-immunoreactive network overlaps with the arborizations of clock networks expressing pigment-dispersing factor. GABA levels show daily fluctuations with maximum concentrations during the inactivity phase of the cockroach during the day, suggesting a sleep promoting role.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter in nervous systems promoting sleep in both mammals and insects. In the Madeira cockroach, sleep-wake cycles are controlled by a circadian clock network in the brain's optic lobes, centered in the accessory medulla (AME) with its innervating pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) expressing clock neurons at the anterior-ventral rim of the medulla. GABA is present in cell clusters that innervate different circuits of the cockroach's AME clock, without colocalizing in PDF clock neurons. Physiological, immunohistochemical, and behavioral assays provided evidence for a role of GABA in light entrainment, possibly via the distal tract that connects the AME's glomeruli to the medulla. Furthermore, GABA was implemented in clock outputs to multiple effector systems in optic lobe and midbrain. Here, GABAergic brain circuits were analyzed further, focusing on the circadian system in search for sleep/wake controlling brain circuits. All GABA-immunoreactive neurons of the cockroach brain were also stained with an antiserum against the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. We found strong overlap of the distribution of GABA-immunoreactive networks with PDF clock networks in optic lobes and midbrain. Neurons in five of the six soma groups that innervate the clock exhibited GABA immunoreactivity. The intensity of GABA immunoreactivity in the distal tract showed daily fluctuations with maximum staining intensity in the middle of the day and weakest staining at the end of the day. Quantification via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, likewise, showed higher GABA levels in the optic lobe during the inactivity phase of the cockroach during the day and lower levels during its activity phase at dusk. Our data further support the hypothesis that light- and PDF-dependently the circadian clock network of the cockroach controls GABA levels and thereby promotes sleep during the day.</p>

<p>We studied the postnatal reorganization of callosal connections linking multiple cortical areas with ferret primary visual cortex during the period from just before eye opening (4 weeks) to 10 weeks of age. Like intrahemispheric circuits there is a significant areal rearrangement of callosal sources, but unlike intrahemispheric circuits there is no laminar reorganization of callosal sources. These results reveal important similarities and differences in the postnatal reorganization of inter- and intrahemispheric projections to primary visual cortex.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corticocortical connections link visual cortical areas in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. We studied the postnatal refinement of callosal connections linking multiple cortical areas with ferret area 17 during the period from just before eye opening (4 weeks) to 10 weeks of age. We aimed to determine (1) whether callosal projections from multiple visual cortical areas to area 17 refine with a similar rate and (2) whether the refinement of callosal projections parallels that of intrahemispheric cortical circuits. We injected the bidirectional tracer CTb into area 17, and mapped the areal and laminar distribution of labeled cells in visual areas of the contralateral hemisphere. Like intrahemispheric projections, callosal inputs to area 17 before eye opening are dominated by Suprasylvian area Ssy (with lesser and comparable input from areas 17, 18, 19, and 21), but within 2 weeks of eye opening are jointly dominated by area 18 and Ssy inputs; however, there are fewer labeled cells in the contralateral hemisphere. Unlike intrahemispheric projections, there is no laminar reorganization of callosal inputs; in all visual areas and at all ages studied, the greatest proportion of callosal projections arises from the infragranular layers. Also, unlike intrahemispheric projections, the peak density of callosal cells in each area projecting to area 17 declines more modestly. These results reveal important similarities and differences in the postnatal reorganization of inter- and intrahemispheric projections to area 17.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The benefits of mindfulness in mental healthcare professionals [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout is a widely reported syndrome consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a lowered sense of accomplishment. Mindfulness practices have been shown to be useful in lowering distress and burnout in clinical and non-clinical cohorts. Our aim was to explore the potential personal and occupational benefits of a structured mindfulness intervention on a cohort of mental health professionals. A mixed-methods approach was utilised in order to enhance the exploratory power of the study. Methods: We conducted a pilot study involving healthcare practitioners employed at a community outpatient mental health clinic. As a pilot, we relied on a single group and implemented a quasi-experimental, simultaneous mixed methods design by incorporating both quantitative pre- and post- testing alongside written qualitative post-test responses. Results: Analysis of the data demonstrated a significant difference between overall mindfulness when comparing post-test (mean=140.8, standard deviation=18.9) with pre-test data (mean=128.3, standard deviation=28.6). Participants also showed a statistically significant difference in three of the subscales: observation, describing, and non-reactivity. A moderate effect size was seen for each of the above differences.  Analysis of the qualitative data revealed a range of potential themes which may be used to explain the differences exhibited across participants’ personal and professional lives, which can be grouped into two thematic overarching groups: emotional reactivity and listening/communicating. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study indicate that a structured, six-week mindfulness program has the potential to benefit clinicians, personally by reducing emotional reactivity and professionally by promoting deep listening and communication.

                A sound analysis of DNA sequencing data is important to extract meaningful information and infer quantities of interest. Sequencing and mapping errors coupled with low and variable coverage hamper the identification of genotypes and variants and the estimation of population genetic parameters. Methods and implementations to estimate population genetic parameters from sequencing data available nowadays either are suitable for the analysis of genomes from model organisms only, require moderate sequencing coverage, or are not easily adaptable to specific applications. To address these issues, we introduce ngsJulia, a collection of templates and functions in Julia language to process short-read sequencing data for population genetic analysis. We further describe two implementations, ngsPool and ngsPloidy, for the analysis of pooled sequencing data and polyploid genomes, respectively. Through simulations, we illustrate the performance of estimating various population genetic parameters using these implementations, using both established and novel statistical methods. These results inform on optimal experimental design and demonstrate the applicabil- ity of methods in ngsJulia to estimate parameters of interest even from low coverage sequencing data. ngsJulia provide users with a flexible and efficient framework for ad hoc analysis of sequencing data.ngsJulia is available from: https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsJulia

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">TRAIT2D: a Software for Quantitative Analysis of Single Particle Diffusion Data [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Single particle tracking (SPT) is one of the most widely used tools in optical microscopy to evaluate particle mobility in a variety of situations, including cellular and model membrane dynamics. Recent technological developments, such as Interferometric Scattering microscopy, have allowed recording of long, uninterrupted single particle trajectories at kilohertz framerates. The resulting data, where particles are continuously detected and do not displace much between observations, thereby do not require complex linking algorithms. Moreover, while these measurements offer more details into the short-term diffusion behaviour of the tracked particles, they are also subject to the influence of localisation uncertainties, which are often underestimated by conventional analysis pipelines. we thus developed a Python library, under the name of TRAIT2D (Tracking Analysis Toolbox – 2D version), in order to track particle diffusion at high sampling rates, and analyse the resulting trajectories with an innovative approach. The data analysis pipeline introduced is more localisation-uncertainty aware, and also selects the most appropriate diffusion model for the data provided on a statistical basis. A trajectory simulation platform also allows the user to handily generate trajectories and even synthetic time-lapses to test alternative tracking algorithms and data analysis approaches. A high degree of customisation for the analysis pipeline, for example with the introduction of different diffusion modes, is possible from the source code. Finally, the presence of graphical user interfaces lowers the access barrier for users with little to no programming experience.

                Background: Caregivers play a central role in post-stroke patients' care. However, the role of and problems managed by caregivers have not been widely studied, particularly in Indonesia. This study aims to explore the roles and problems of caregivers in post- stroke patients’ care. Method: This was a qualitative study. Seven caregivers of post-stroke patients from the homecare clinic of Dr Sardjito General Hospital were purposely selected during January 2017 to June 2018. Focus group discussions were conducted to explore the roles and problems of caregiving. Results: Themes related to caregivers’ roles were: connecting patients with medical personnel and other family members, maintaining patients’ health conditions by fulfilling basic needs and assisting rehabilitation, as well as maintaining patients’ psychological conditions by encouraging conversation, telling jokes, or recreation. On the other hand, themes related to caregivers’ problems were: lack of knowledge caused by education inadequacy, underappreciated and unconcerned family, suboptimal service including limited physiotherapy and pharmacy resource, unthorough administration, lack of communication, physical limitations, and burnout, as well as uncooperative patients. Conclusions: Caregivers play essential roles as communicators and help to maintain patient's health conditions. Common problems are related to a lack of knowledge about strokes and a lack of attention from family. Further research to study the effects of these findings on the quality of life of both patient and their caregiver, as well as how to handle the caregiver issues should be investigated.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The genetic causes of male infertility: a Middle East and North Africa perspective [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Male infertility is attributable to 50% of total infertility cases and about 30% of these cases remain idiopathic. In the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), male infertility affects about 22.6% of men of reproductive age. Male infertility is caused by a variety of factors, including endocrine disruption, exposure to toxins, lifestyle, genetic and epigenetic modifications. Genetic modifications, including chromosomal abnormalities, chromosomal rearrangements, Y chromosome microdeletions and single-gene mutations, explain for about 10-15% of infertility cases. Since genetic aberration is a key player in the pathogenesis of male infertility, it is important to explore the impact in the MENA region due to the high incidence of male infertility. Therefore, the current study aims to systematically analyse the literature regarding the impact and common causes of male infertility in the MENA region. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases. Following the search, a total of 126 articles was retrieved, of which 12 were duplicates and another 69 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria, totaling the exclusion of 81 articles. Studies excluded were those that had patient populations originating outside the MENA region, review articles, non-English written articles, or studies where the patient population was under 18 years of age. Findings showed that the frequent genetic aberration leading to male infertility in these regions include Y chromosome microdeletions, gene polymorphisms or copy number variations, mitochondrial microdeletions and other genetic deletions or mutations. In lieu of this, diverse clinical genetic tests should be made available for the proper diagnosis of male infertility.

                The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program seeks to accelerate the development of therapeutic devices that modulate electrical activity in nerves to improve organ function. SPARC-funded researchers are generating rich datasets from neuromodulation research that are curated and shared according to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) guidelines and are accessible to the public on the SPARC data portal. Keeping track of the utilization of these datasets within the larger research community is a feature that will benefit data-generating researchers in showcasing the impact of their SPARC outcomes. This will also allow the SPARC program to display the impact of the FAIR data curation and sharing practices that have been implemented. This manuscript provides the methods and outcomes of SPARClink, our web tool for visualizing the impact of SPARC, which won the Second prize at the 2021 SPARC FAIR Codeathon. With SPARClink, we built a system that automatically and continuously finds new published SPARC scientific outputs (datasets, publications, protocols) and the external resources referring to them. SPARC datasets and protocols are queried using publicly accessible REST application programming interfaces (APIs, provided by Pennsieve and Protocols.io) and stored in a publicly accessible database. Citation information for these resources is retrieved using the NIH reporter API and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez system. A novel knowledge graph-based structure was created to visualize the results of these queries and showcase the impact that the FAIR data principles can have on the research landscape when they are adopted by a consortium.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A case series of ocular involvement in bullous pemphigoid: clinical features, management, and outcomes [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Ocular involvement in cases of bullous pemphigoid is rare and when present, the signs are usually subtle and in the form of fine tarsal scarring and dry eye disease. The current report aims to describe the clinical features and management protocols in a series of cases with aggressive ocular manifestations at presentation. All cases of bullous pemphigoid seen between 2017 and 2020 were included in this retrospective case series. Data regarding the clinical features, treatment administered, and outcomes was collected. Five cases (n=10 eyes) of bullous pemphigoid disease with ocular involvement were included. All eyes had significant cicatricial conjunctival changes in the form of symblephara, inferior forniceal shortening, and tarsal conjunctival scarring. Conjunctival granulomas were present in 3/10 eyes. Corneal involvement in the form of punctate keratitis was present in all eyes while 4/10 eyes had an epithelial defect as well. The management of these cases involved topical therapy with corticosteroids and lubricants (n=10 eyes) while pulse doses of intravenous methyl prednisolone were administered in 5/5 cases. Pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide was supplemented in 2/5 cases. Adequate control of the disease was noted in 3/5 cases while one case had a recalcitrant form of the disease and developed a dermalised ocular surface in both eyes. The last patient was lost to follow up during the course of therapy. Bullous pemphigoid can present with an aggressive form of cicatrizing conjunctivitis similar to other variants of autoimmune blistering disorders and must be considered as a differential in cases presenting with ocular cicatricial disease. Long-term intensive immunosuppression is required for the management of these cases to preserve the visual function and the integrity of the globe.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Statutory lien: pre- and post- 2016 amendments to the Malaysian National Land Code [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A statutory lien is a non-registrable security dealing under the National Land Code (NLC) in Malaysia. Lien is usually used as a short-term collateral for a repayment of debt by the proprietor. Prior to the 2016 amendments, section 281(1) of the NLC stated that a proprietor may create a lien over his land by depositing the original title with the lender, as security for a loan; and the lender shall enter a lien-holder’s caveat under section 330(1) to protect his interests. Case law has expanded the scope of section 281 to include an equitable proprietor under the definition of “proprietor” and a third-party loan with the proprietor’s consent or authority under the definition of “loan”. The 2016 amendments removed “for a loan” in sections 281(1) and 330(1). This triggers the analysis on the purposes of lien. Methods: The research methodology adopted is doctrinal legal research. Relevant sections and case law together with the Bill and Parliament’s Hansard record are examined to find the intention of the legislature and Parliament. Results: The amendments allow the lien to be used not merely as security for a loan but also for other purposes (Explanation Note 47 to the Bill). Such deletions have created an ambiguous interpretation; and may be manipulated by fraudsters. In contrast, section 241(1) provides specific purposes such as the repayment of debt, non-debt, or payment of annuity or periodic sum, for the creation of statutory charge. Conclusions: This research is only confined to the scope of lien within the Peninsular Malaysia and not the States of Sabah and Sarawak which have their respective Sabah Land Ordinance and Sarawak Land Code. A future comparative study could be made amongst the legislations. The research output may be useful for the draftsman to clear up the ambiguity in the relevant provisions.

                Background Many studies have assessed the quality of news reports about the effects of health interventions, but there has been no systematic review of such studies or meta-analysis of their results. We aimed to fill this gap (PROSPERO ID: CRD42018095032). Methods We included studies that used at least one explicit, prespecified and generic criterion to assess the quality of news reports in print, broadcast, or online news media, and specified the sampling frame, and the selection criteria and technique. We assessed criteria individually for inclusion in the meta-analyses, excluding ineligible criteria and criteria with inadequately reported results. We mapped and grouped criteria to facilitate evidence synthesis. Where possible, we extracted the proportion of news reports meeting the included criterion. We performed meta-analyses using a random effects model to estimate such proportions for individual criteria and some criteria groups, and to characterise heterogeneity across studies.  Results We included 44 primary studies in the review, and 18 studies and 108 quality criteria in the meta-analyses. Many news reports gave an unbalanced and oversimplified picture of the potential consequences of interventions. A limited number mention or adequately address conflicts of interest (22%; 95% CI 7%-49%) (low certainty), alternative interventions (36%; 95% CI 26%-47%) (moderate certainty), potential harms (40%; 95% CI 23%-61%) (low certainty), or costs (18%; 95% CI 12%-28%) (moderate certainty), or quantify effects (53%; 95% CI 36%-69%) (low certainty) or report absolute effects (17%; 95% CI 4%-49%) (low certainty).  Discussion There is room for improving health news, but it is logically more important to improve the public’s ability to critically appraise health information and make judgements for themselves.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) patterns and mortality: a retrospective case-control study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low and medium income countries (LMICs) such as Kenya experience nearly three times more cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to high income countries (HICs). This is primarily exacerbated by weak health systems especially at the pre-hospital care level. Generating local empirical evidence on TBI patterns and its influence on patient mortality outcomes is fundamental in informing the design of trauma-specific emergency medical service (EMS) interventions at the pre-hospital care level. This study determines the influence of TBI patterns and mortality. Methods: This was a case-control study with a sample of 316 TBI patients. Data was abstracted from medical records for the period of January 2017 to March 2019 in three tertiary trauma care facilities in Kenya. Logistic regression was used to assess influence of trauma patterns on TBI mortality, controlling for patient characteristics and other potential confounders. Results: The majority of patients were aged below 40 years (73%) and were male (85%). Road traffic injuries (RTIs) comprised 58% of all forms of trauma. Blunt trauma comprised 71% of the injuries. Trauma mechanism was the only trauma pattern significantly associated with TBI mortality. The risk of dying for patients sustaining RTIs was 2.83 times more likely compared to non-RTI patients [odds ratio (OR) 2.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-4.93, p=0.001]. The type of transfer to hospital was also significantly associated with mortality outcome, with a public hospital having a two times higher risk of death compared to a private hospital [OR 2.18 95%CI 1.21-3.94, p<0.009]. Conclusion: Trauma mechanism (RTI vs non-RTI) and type of tertiary facility patients are transferred to (public vs private) are key factors influencing TBI mortality burden. Strengthening local EMS trauma response systems targeting RTIs augmented by adequately resourced and equipped public facilities to provide quality lifesaving interventions can reduce the burden of TBIs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Criticality enhances the multilevel reliability of stimulus responses in cortical neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Junhao Liang, Changsong Zhou</p>

Cortical neural networks exhibit high internal variability in spontaneous dynamic activities and they can robustly and reliably respond to external stimuli with multilevel features–from microscopic irregular spiking of neurons to macroscopic oscillatory local field potential. A comprehensive study integrating these multilevel features in spontaneous and stimulus–evoked dynamics with seemingly distinct mechanisms is still lacking. Here, we study the stimulus–response dynamics of biologically plausible excitation–inhibition (E–I) balanced networks. We confirm that networks around critical synchronous transition states can maintain strong internal variability but are sensitive to external stimuli. In this dynamical region, applying a stimulus to the network can reduce the trial-to-trial variability and shift the network oscillatory frequency while preserving the dynamical criticality. These multilevel features widely observed in different experiments cannot simultaneously occur in non-critical dynamical states. Furthermore, the dynamical mechanisms underlying these multilevel features are revealed using a semi-analytical mean-field theory that derives the macroscopic network field equations from the microscopic neuronal networks, enabling the analysis by nonlinear dynamics theory and linear noise approximation. The generic dynamical principle revealed here contributes to a more integrative understanding of neural systems and brain functions and incorporates multimodal and multilevel experimental observations. The E–I balanced neural network in combination with the effective mean-field theory can serve as a mechanistic modeling framework to study the multilevel neural dynamics underlying neural information and cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identification of dynamic mass-action biochemical reaction networks using sparse Bayesian methods</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard Jiang, Prashant Singh, Fredrik Wrede, Andreas Hellander, Linda Petzold</p>

Identifying the reactions that govern a dynamical biological system is a crucial but challenging task in systems biology. In this work, we present a data-driven method to infer the underlying biochemical reaction system governing a set of observed species concentrations over time. We formulate the problem as a regression over a large, but limited, mass-action constrained reaction space and utilize sparse Bayesian inference via the regularized horseshoe prior to produce robust, interpretable biochemical reaction networks, along with uncertainty estimates of parameters. The resulting systems of chemical reactions and posteriors inform the biologist of potentially several reaction systems that can be further investigated. We demonstrate the method on two examples of recovering the dynamics of an unknown reaction system, to illustrate the benefits of improved accuracy and information obtained.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analytical kinetic model of native tandem promoters in E. coli</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vatsala Chauhan, Mohamed N. M. Bahrudeen, Cristina S. D. Palma, Ines S. C. Baptista, Bilena L. B. Almeida, Suchintak Dash, Vinodh Kandavalli, Andre S. Ribeiro</p>

Closely spaced promoters in tandem formation are abundant in bacteria. We investigated the evolutionary conservation, biological functions, and the RNA and single-cell protein expression of genes regulated by tandem promoters in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. We also studied the sequence (distance between transcription start sites ‘<i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub><i>’</i>, pause sequences, and distances from oriC) and potential influence of the input transcription factors of these promoters. From this, we propose an analytical model of gene expression based on measured expression dynamics, where RNAP-promoter occupancy times and <i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub> are the key regulators of transcription interference due to TSS occlusion by RNAP at one of the promoters (when <i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub> ≤ 35 bp) and RNAP occupancy of the downstream promoter (when <i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub> > 35 bp). Occlusion and downstream promoter occupancy are modeled as linear functions of occupancy time, while the influence of <i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub> <i>i</i>s implemented by a continuous step function, fit to <i>in vivo</i> data on mean single-cell protein numbers of 30 natural genes controlled by tandem promoters. The best-fitting step is at 35 bp, matching the length of DNA occupied by RNAP in the open complex formation. This model accurately predicts the squared coefficient of variation and skewness of the natural single-cell protein numbers as a function of <i>d</i><sub>TSS</sub>. Additional predictions suggest that promoters in tandem formation can cover a wide range of transcription dynamics within realistic intervals of parameter values. By accurately capturing the dynamics of these promoters, this model can be helpful to predict the dynamics of new promoters and contribute to the expansion of the repertoire of expression dynamics available to synthetic genetic constructs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sparse connectivity for MAP inference in linear models using sister mitral cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sina Tootoonian, Andreas T. Schaefer, Peter E. Latham</p>

Sensory processing is hard because the variables of interest are encoded in spike trains in a relatively complex way. A major goal in studies of sensory processing is to understand how the brain extracts those variables. Here we revisit a common encoding model in which variables are encoded linearly. Although there are typically more variables than neurons, this problem is still solvable because only a small number of variables appear at any one time (sparse prior). However, previous solutions require all-to-all connectivity, inconsistent with the sparse connectivity seen in the brain. Here we propose an algorithm that provably reaches the MAP (maximum <i>a posteriori</i>) inference solution, but does so using sparse connectivity. Our algorithm is inspired by the circuit of the mouse olfactory bulb, but our approach is general enough to apply to other modalities. In addition, it should be possible to extend it to nonlinear encoding models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Nurturing diversity and inclusion in AI in Biomedicine through a virtual summer program for high school students</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomiko Oskotsky, Ruchika Bajaj, Jillian Burchard, Taylor Cavazos, Ina Chen, Will Connell, Stephanie Eaneff, Tianna Grant, Ishan Kanungo, Karla Lindquist, Douglas Myers-Turnbull, Zun Zar Chi Naing, Alice Tang, Bianca Vora, Jon Wang, Isha Karim, Claire Swadling, Janice Yang, AI4ALL Student Cohort 2020 , Bill Lindstaedt, Marina Sirota</p>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the power to improve our lives through a wide variety of applications, many of which fall into the healthcare space; however, a lack of diversity is contributing to limitations in how broadly AI can help people. The UCSF AI4ALL program was established in 2019 to address this issue by targeting high school students from underrepresented backgrounds in AI, giving them a chance to learn about AI with a focus on biomedicine, and promoting diversity and inclusion. In 2020, the UCSF AI4ALL three-week program was held entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, students participated virtually to gain experience with AI, interact with diverse role models in AI, and learn about advancing health through AI. Specifically, they attended lectures in coding and AI, received an in-depth research experience through hands-on projects exploring COVID-19, and engaged in mentoring and personal development sessions with faculty, researchers, industry professionals, and undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom were women and from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds. At the conclusion of the program, the students presented the results of their research projects at our final symposium. Comparison of pre- and post-program survey responses from students demonstrated that after the program, significantly more students were familiar with how to work with data and to evaluate and apply machine learning algorithms. There were also nominally significant increases in the students’ knowing people in AI from historically underrepresented groups, feeling confident in discussing AI, and being aware of careers in AI. We found that we were able to engage young students in AI via our online training program and nurture greater diversity in AI. This work can guide AI training programs aspiring to engage and educate students entirely online, and motivate people in AI to strive towards increasing diversity and inclusion in this field.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fast and accurate influenza forecasting in the United States with Inferno</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dave Osthus</p>

Infectious disease forecasting is an emerging field and has the potential to improve public health through anticipatory resource allocation, situational awareness, and mitigation planning. By way of exploring and operationalizing disease forecasting, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted FluSight since the 2013/14 flu season, an annual flu forecasting challenge. Since FluSight’s onset, forecasters have developed and improved forecasting models in an effort to provide more timely, reliable, and accurate information about the likely progression of the outbreak. While improving the predictive performance of these forecasting models is often the primary objective, it is also important for a forecasting model to run quickly, facilitating further model development and improvement while providing flexibility when deployed in a real-time setting. In this vein I introduce Inferno, a fast and accurate flu forecasting model inspired by Dante, the top performing model in the 2018/19 FluSight challenge. When pseudoprospectively compared to all models that participated in FluSight 2018/19, Inferno would have placed 2nd in the national and regional challenge as well as the state challenge, behind only Dante. Inferno, however, runs in minutes and is trivially parallelizable, while Dante takes hours to run, representing a significant operational improvement with minimal impact to performance. Forecasting challenges like FluSight should continue to monitor and evaluate how they can be modified and expanded to incentivize the development of forecasting models that benefit public health.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Subicular neurons represent multiple variables of a hippocampal-dependent task by using theta rhythm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Su-Min Lee, Jae-Min Seol, Inah Lee</p>

The subiculum is positioned at a critical juncture at the interface of the hippocampus with the rest of the brain. However, the exact roles of the subiculum in most hippocampal-dependent memory tasks remain largely unknown. One obstacle to make comparisons of neural firing patterns between the subiculum and hippocampus is the broad firing fields of the subicular cells. Here, we used spiking phases in relation to theta rhythm to parse the broad firing field of a subicular neuron into multiple subfields to find the unique functional contribution of the subiculum while male rats performed a hippocampal-dependent visual scene memory task. Some of the broad firing fields of the subicular neurons were successfully divided into multiple subfields similar to those in the CA1 by using the theta phase precession cycle. The new paradigm significantly improved the detection of task-relevant information in subicular cells without affecting the information content represented by CA1 cells. Notably, we found that multiple fields of a single subicular neuron, unlike those in the CA1, carried heterogeneous task-related information such as visual context and choice response. Our findings suggest that the subicular cells integrate multiple task-related factors by using theta rhythm to associate environmental context with action.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The product science of electrically heated tobacco products: a narrative review of the scientific literature [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Heated tobacco products represent a novel category of tobacco products in which a tobacco consumable is heated to a temperature that releases nicotine from the tobacco leaf but not to a temperature sufficient to cause combustion. Heated tobacco products may therefore have the potential to be a less harmful alternative for adult smokers that would otherwise continue to smoke conventional cigarettes. Given the rapid development of this product category, the aim of this review was to examine the available peer-reviewed scientific evidence related to heated tobacco products and highlight any research gaps. In recent years, manufacturers of heated tobacco products have published a number of studies on their respective heated tobacco products. Whilst there is limited research that is independent of commercial interests, the available scientific evidence indicates that heated tobacco products produce a much simpler aerosol than conventional cigarette smoke, with fewer and substantially lower levels of harmful toxicants. Toxicology assessments indicate these reductions in aerosol toxicants translate to reduced biological effects. Biomarker and clinical data from studies in which product use is controlled within a clinical setting, indicate changes in biomarker levels and clinical end-points similar to observations in cessation studies, indicating the potential for reduced harm. The scientific evidence also indicates that exposure of non-users to emissions from heated tobacco products in indoor environments is significantly reduced compared to exposure resulting from smoking conventional cigarettes. Overall, the available scientific evidence indicates that heated tobacco products hold promise as a less harmful alternative to conventional cigarettes, but more independent data is required to validate industry findings. As a growing product category, epidemiological studies and independent population modelling studies are outstanding, and empirical data on how dual tobacco product category use by consumers affects their risk profile is lacking.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quantification of the effects of chimerism on read mapping, differential expression and annotation following short-read de novo assembly. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: De novo assembly is often required for analysing short-read RNA sequencing data. An under-characterized aspect of the contigs produced is chimerism, the extent to which affects mapping, differential expression analysis and annotation. Despite long-read sequencing negating this issue, short-reads remain in use through on-going research and archived datasets created during the last two decades. Consequently, there is still a need to quantify chimerism and its effects.    Methods: Effects on mapping were quantified by simulating reads off the Drosophila melanogaster cDNA library and mapping these to related reference sets containing increasing levels of chimerism. Next, ten read datasets were simulated and divided into two conditions where, within one, reads representing 1000 randomly selected transcripts were over-represented across replicates. Differential expression analysis was performed iteratively with increasing chimerism within the reference set. Finally, an expectation of r-squared values describing the relationship between alignment and transcript lengths for matches involving cDNA library transcripts and those within sets containing incrementing chimerism was created. Similar values calculated for contigs produced by three graph-based assemblers, relative to the cDNA library from which input reads were simulated, or sequenced (relative to the species represented), were compared.    Results: At 5% and 95% chimerism within reference sets, 100% and 77% of reads still mapped, making mapping success a poor indicator of chimerism. At 5% chimerism, of the 1000 transcripts selected for over-representation, 953 were identified during differential expression analysis; at 10% 936 were identified, while at 95% it was 510. This indicates that despite mapping success, per-transcript counts are unpredictably altered. R-squared values obtained for the three assemblers suggest that between 5-15% of contigs are chimeric.     Conclusions: Although not evident based on mapping, chimerism had a significant impact on differential expression analysis and megablast identification. This will have consequences for past and present experiments involving short-reads.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of fear, anxiety, obsession and functional impairment of COVID-19 amongst health-care workers and trainees: A cross-sectional study in Nepal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic threw the world into turmoil. The medical community bore the brunt of the pandemic's toll. Long work hours, and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and social support all had an influence on mental health. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among Lumbini Medical College Teaching Hospital students and employees in Palpa, Nepal. Data entailing their demographic details, pre-existing comorbidities, or death in the family due to COVID-19 was collected using a self-administered survey. In addition, the level of fear, anxiety, obsession, and functional impairment due to COVID-19 was recorded using previously validated respective scales. Results: In total, 403 health-care workers and trainees participated in our study. The average age of the study participants was 23±4 years, and more than half of them (n=262, 65%) were females. A significant association was found between fear score with age (p-value=0.04), gender (p-value <0.01) and occupation (p-value<0.001). The participants suffering from chronic diseases (p-value=0.36), and those who had experienced a COVID-19 death in the family (p-value=0.18), were not found to be significantly obsessed with COVID-19. However, for those who had experienced a COVID-19 death in the family (p-value=0.51) and age (p-value=0.34), these factors were not found to be significantly associated with higher anxiety levels. Nursing students suffered from a significantly greater functional impairment than other medical professionals (mean score=269.15, p-value < 0.001). A moderately positive correlation was observed between fear, anxiety, obsession, and functional impairment scales. Conclusion: This study revealed various socio-demographic characteristics as risk factors for psychological stress in the people related to the health-care profession of Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic. A viable answer to this quandary might be adequate psychosocial intervention by health-care authorities, increased social support, and the introduction of better mental health management measures for the front-line medical workers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The implications of Industry 4.0 on supply chains amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions in supply chains. It has increased the demand for products and decreased the supply of raw materials. This has interrupted many production processes. The emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 have the potential to streamline supply chains by improving time-sensitive customized solutions during this emergency. Purpose: The study identifies the core technologies of Industry 4.0 and the role and impact of these technologies in managing the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in strengthening the supply chain resilience. Design/methodology/approach: An extensive literature review using the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” method was carried out on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains and Industry 4.0 technologies. The study was undertaken by selecting keywords validated by experts, and a search was conducted in the Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases. Publications from the leading journals on these topics were selected. The bibliographical search resulted in 1484 articles, followed by multiple layers of filtering. Finally, the most pertinent articles were selected for review, and a total of 42 articles were analyzed. Findings: The findings of the study showed that the majority of the articles emphasized the digitalization of supply chain management, acknowledging the fundamentals, applications, and prospects, revealing the drivers and challenges of Industry 4.0 technologies to manage disruptions. Most of the authors identified IoT, big data, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, and blockchain to maintain the supply chain resilience. Originality/value: Existing literature on epidemics lacks the basics and practices of utilizing Industry 4.0 technologies in the supply chain recovery process. To fill this research gap, the study summarizes the potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to lessen supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19. The study findings are valuable for policymakers and practitioners and contribute to supply chain management studies.

                Cavazzoni et al. show that Tfh and Tfr cells are both essential for optimization of germinal center responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Limiting Tfh cells results in less SARS-CoV-2 GC responses and lower affinity maturation, whereas limiting Tfr cells promotes non-antigen specific GC responses leading to lower affinity maturation. Altered Tfh/Tfr responses in aging result in unique bimodal antibody responses.

                In plants, selfish genetic elements including retrotransposons and DNA viruses are transcriptionally silenced by RNA-directed DNA methylation. Guiding the process are short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) cut by DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3) from double-stranded precursors of ~30 bp that are synthesized by NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol IV) and RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2). We show that Pol IV's choice of initiating nucleotide, RDR2's initiation 1-2 nt internal to Pol IV transcript ends and RDR2's terminal transferase activity collectively yield a code that influences which precursor end is diced and whether 24 or 23 nt siRNAs are produced. By diversifying the size, sequence, and strand specificity of siRNAs derived from a given precursor, alternative patterns of DCL3 dicing allow for maximal siRNA coverage at methylated target loci.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Muscle systems and motility of early animals highlighted by cnidarians from the basal Cambrian</a></h4>

              
                Although fossil evidence suggests that various animal groups were able to move actively through their environment in the early stages of their evolution, virtually no direct information is available on the nature of their muscle systems. The origin of jellyfish swimming, for example, is of great interest to biologists. Exceptionally preserved muscles are described here in benthic peridermal olivooid medusozoans from the basal Cambrian of China (Kuanchuanpu Formation, ca. 535 Ma) that have direct equivalent in modern medusozoans. They consist of circular fibers distributed over the bell surface (subumbrella) and most probably have a myoepithelial origin. This is the oldest record of a muscle system in cnidarians and more generally in animals. This basic system was probably co-opted by early Cambrian jellyfish to develop capacities for jet-propelled swimming within the water column. Additional lines of fossil evidence obtained from ecdysozoans (worms and panarthropods) show that the muscle systems of early animals underwent a rapid diversification through the early Cambrian and increased their capacity to colonize a wide range of habitats both within the water column and sediment at a critical time of their evolutionary radiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pathogen infection and cholesterol deficiency activate the C. elegans p38 immune pathway through a TIR-1/SARM1 phase transition</a></h4>

              
                Intracellular signaling regulators can be concentrated into membrane-free, higher-ordered protein assemblies to initiate protective responses during stress - a process known as phase transition. Here, we show that a phase transition of the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain protein (TIR-1), an NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase homologous to mammalian sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing 1 (SARM1), underlies p38 PMK-1 immune pathway activation in <i>C. elegans </i>intestinal epithelial cells. Through visualization of fluorescently labeled TIR-1/SARM1 protein, we demonstrate that physiologic stresses, both pathogen and non-pathogen, induce multimerization of TIR-1/SARM1 into visible puncta within intestinal epithelial cells. <i>In vitro</i> enzyme kinetic analyses revealed that, like mammalian SARM1, the NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity of <i>C. elegans</i> TIR-1 is dramatically potentiated by protein oligomerization and a phase transition. Accordingly, <i>C. elegans</i> with genetic mutations that specifically block either multimerization or the NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity of TIR-1/SARM1 fail to induce p38 PMK phosphorylation, are unable to increase immune effector expression, and are dramatically susceptible to bacterial infection. Finally, we demonstrate that a loss-of-function mutation in <i>nhr-8</i>, which alters cholesterol metabolism and is used to study conditions of sterol deficiency, causes TIR-1/SARM1 to oligomerize into puncta in intestinal epithelial cells. Cholesterol scarcity increases p38 PMK-1 phosphorylation, primes immune effector induction in a manner that requires TIR-1/SARM1 oligomerization and its intrinsic NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity, and reduces pathogen accumulation in the intestine during a subsequent infection. These data reveal a new adaptive response that allows a metazoan host to anticipate pathogen threats during cholesterol deprivation, a time of relative susceptibility to infection. Thus, a phase transition of TIR-1/SARM1 as a prerequisite for its NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolase activity is strongly conserved across millions of years of evolution and is essential for diverse physiological processes in multiple cell types.

Here, we demonstrate APEX2 proximity labeling within genetically targeted neurons in the mouse brain, enabling subcellular proteomics with cell type-specificity. By combining APEX2 biotinylation with mass spectrometry, we mapped the somatodendritic and axonal proteomes of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Our dataset reveals the proteomic architecture underlying proteostasis, axonal metabolism, and neurotransmission in these neurons. We identify numerous proteins encoded by dopamine neuron-enriched genes in striatal dopaminergic axons, including ion channels with previously undescribed axonal localization. These proteomic datasets provide a resource for neuronal cell biology, and this approach can be readily adapted for study of other neural cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inter-tissue convergence of gene expression during ageing suggests age-related loss of tissue and cellular identity</a></h4>

              
                Developmental trajectories of gene expression may reverse in their direction during ageing, a phenomenon previously linked to cellular identity loss. Our analysis of cerebral cortex, lung, liver and muscle transcriptomes of 16 mice, covering development and ageing intervals, revealed widespread but tissue-specific ageing-associated expression reversals. Cumulatively, these reversals create a unique phenomenon: mammalian tissue transcriptomes diverge from each other during postnatal development, but during ageing, they tend to converge towards similar expression levels, a process we term Divergence followed by Convergence, or DiCo. We found that DiCo was most prevalent among tissue-specific genes and associated with loss of tissue identity, which is confirmed using data from independent mouse and human datasets. Further, using publicly available single-cell transcriptome data, we showed that DiCo could be driven both by alterations in tissue cell type composition and also by cell-autonomous expression changes within particular cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">m6A modifications regulate intestinal immunity and rotavirus infection</a></h4>

              
                N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant mRNA modification and affects many biological processes. However, how m6A levels are regulated during physiological or pathological processes such as virus infections, and the <i>in vivo</i> function of m6A in the intestinal immune defense against virus infections are largely unknown. Here, we uncover a novel antiviral function of m6A modification during rotavirus (RV) infection in small bowel intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We found that rotavirus infection induced global m6A modifications on mRNA transcripts by down-regulating the m6a eraser ALKBH5. Mice lacking the m<sup>6</sup>A writer enzymes METTL3 in IECs (<i>Mettl3</i>ΔIEC) were resistant to RV infection and showed increased expression of interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Using RNA-sequencing and m6A RNA immuno-precipitation (RIP)-sequencing, we identified IRF7, a master regulator of IFN responses, as one of the primary m6A targets during virus infection. In the absence of METTL3, IECs showed increased <i>Irf7</i> mRNA stability and enhanced type I and III IFN expression. Deficiency in IRF7 attenuated the elevated expression of IFNs and ISGs and restored susceptibility to RV infection in <i>Mettl3</i>ΔIEC mice. Moreover, the global m6A modification on mRNA transcripts declined with age in mice, with a significant drop from 2 weeks to 3 weeks post birth, which likely has broad implications for the development of intestinal immune system against enteric viruses early in life. Collectively, we demonstrated a novel host m6A-IRF7-IFN antiviral signaling cascade that restricts rotavirus infection <i>in vivo</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differences in pathways contributing to thyroid hormone effects on postnatal cartilage calcification versus secondary ossification center development</a></h4>

              
                The proximal and distal femur epiphysis of mice are both weight bearing structures derived from chondrocytes but differ in development. Mineralization at the distal epiphysis occurs in an osteoblast rich secondary ossification center (SOC), while the chondrocytes of the proximal femur head (FH) in particular, are directly mineralized. Thyroid hormone (TH) plays important roles in distal knee SOC formation, but whether TH also affects proximal FH development remains unexplored. Here, we found that TH controls chondrocyte maturation and mineralization at the FH <i>in vivo</i> through studies in <i>Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor</i> (<i>Tshr<sup>-/-</sup></i>) hypothyroid mice by X-ray, histology, transcriptional profiling, and immunofluorescence staining. Both <i>in vivo,</i> and <i>in vitro </i>studies conducted in ATDC5 chondrocyte progenitors concur that TH regulates expression of genes that modulate mineralization (<i>Ibsp</i>, <i>Bglap2</i>, <i>Dmp1</i>, <i>Spp1</i>, and <i>Alpl).</i> Our work also delineates differences in prominent transcription factor regulation of genes involved in the different mechanisms leading to proximal FH cartilage calcification and endochondral ossification at the distal femur. The information on the molecular pathways contributing to postnatal cartilage calcification can provide insights on therapeutic strategies to treat pathological calcification that occurs in soft tissues such as aorta, kidney, and articular cartilage.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Crowding-induced phase separation of nuclear transport receptors in FG nucleoporin assemblies</a></h4>

              
                The rapid (&lt; 1 ms) transport of biological material to and from the cell nucleus is regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC). At the core of the NPC is a permeability barrier consisting of intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) nucleoporins (FG Nups). Various types of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) facilitate transport by partitioning in the FG Nup assembly, overcoming the barrier by their affinity to the FG Nups, and comprise a significant fraction of proteins in the NPC barrier. In previous work Zahn et al. (2016), we revealed a universal physical behaviour in the experimentally observed binding of two well-characterized NTRs, NTF2 and the larger Importin-<i>β</i>, to different planar assemblies of FG Nups, with the binding behaviour defined by negative cooperativity. This was further validated by a minimal physical model that treated the FG Nups as flexible homopolymers and the NTRs as uniformly cohesive spheres. Here, we build upon our original study by first parametrizing our model to experimental data, and next predicting the effects of crowding by different types of NTRs. We show how varying the amounts of one type of NTR modulates how the other NTR penetrates the FG Nup assembly. Notably, at similar and physiologically relevant NTR concentrations, our model predicts demixed phases of NTF2 and Imp-<i>β</i> within the FG Nup assembly. The functional implication of NTR phase separation is that NPCs may sustain separate transport pathways that are determined by inter-NTR competition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A model of preferential pairing between epithelial and dendritic cells in thymic antigen transfer</a></h4>

              
                Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which produce and present self-antigens, are essential for the establishment of central tolerance. Since mTEC numbers are limited, their function is complemented by thymic dendritic cells (DCs), which transfer mTEC-produced self-antigens via cooperative antigen transfer (CAT). While CAT is required for effective T cell selection, many aspects remain enigmatic. Given the recently described heterogeneity of mTECs and DCs, it is unclear whether the antigen acquisition from a particular TEC subset is mediated by preferential pairing with a specific subset of DCs. Using several relevant <i>Cre</i>-based mouse models that control for the expression of fluorescent proteins, we have found that, in regards to CAT, each subset of thymic DCs preferentially targets a distinct mTEC subset(s). Importantly, XCR1<sup>+</sup>-activated DC subset represented the most potent subset in CAT. Interestingly, thymic DCs can also acquire antigens from more than one mTEC, and of these, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) were determined to be the most efficient. moDCs also represented the most potent DC subset in the acquisition of antigen from other DCs. These findings suggest a preferential pairing model for the distribution of mTEC-derived antigens among distinct populations of thymic DCs.

                In this study we describe egfp expression induced by two techniques: in vivo electroporation and viral transduction in several cell types of the adult honeybee brain. Non-neuronal and neuronal cell types were identified and the expression persisted at least during three days. Kenyon cells, optic lobe neurons and protocerebral lobe neurons were electroporated. Astrocyte-like glia cells, fibrous lamellar glia cells and cortex glia cells were identified. Viral transduction targeted one specific type of glia cells that could not be identified.  EGFP positive cells were rather variable after electroporation, and viral transduction resulted in more homogenous groups of positive cells. We propose that these techniques remain a good alternative to transgenic animals because they potentially target only somatic cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Orexin action on the dopaminergic system modulates theta during REM sleep and wakefulness</a></h4>

              
                Both dopaminergic (DA) and orexinergic (OX) systems establish brain-wide neuromodulatory circuits that profoundly influence brain states and behavioral outputs. To unravel their interactions, we inactivated OX-to-DA neurotransmission by selective disruption of HcrtR1/OxR1, or HcrtR2/OxR2, or both receptors, in DA neurons. Chronic loss of OXR2 in DA neurons (OxR2Dat-CKO mice) dramatically increased electrocorticographic (EcoG) theta rhythms in wakefulness and REM sleep. Episode duration and total times spent in active wakefulness and REMS were prolonged, and theta/fast-gamma wave coupling was enhanced in both states. Increased theta in OxR2DatCKO mice baseline wake was accompanied by diminished infra-theta and increased fast-gamma activities, i.e. the mice exhibited signs of constitutive electrocortical hyperarousal, albeit uncoupled with locomotor activity. These effects were not seen in OxR1-ablated dopaminergic mutants, which tended to show opposite phenotypes, resembling those caused by the loss of both receptors. Our data establish a clear, genetically-defined link between monosynaptic orexin-to-dopaminergic connectivity and the power of theta oscillations, with a differential role of OXR2 in cross-frequency wave coupling and attentional processes.

                Modulation of physical activity represents an important intervention that may delay, slow, or prevent mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). One mechanism proposed to underlie the beneficial effect of physical exercise involves the apparent stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). BCI-838 is a pro-drug whose active metabolite BCI-632 is an antagonist at the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2/3). We previously demonstrated that administration of BCI-838 to a mouse model of cerebrovascular accumulation of oligomeric A{beta}E693Q (APPE693Q = "Dutch APP") reduced learning behavior impairment and anxiety, both of which are associated with the phenotype of the Dutch APP mice. Here we show that (i) administration of BCI-838, physical exercise, or a combination of BCI-838 and physical exercise enhanced AHN in a four-month old mouse model of AD amyloid pathology (APPKM670/671NL/ PSEN1{Delta}exon9 = APP/PS1), (ii) administration of BCI-838 alone or associated with physical exercise led to stimulation of AHN and improvement in both spatial and recognition memory, (iii) significantly, the hippocampal dentate gyrus transcriptome of APP/PS1 mice following BCI-838 treatment up-regulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), PIK3C2A of the PI3K-MTOR pathway, and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and down-regulated EIF5A of ketamine-modulating mTOR activity, and finally (iv) qPCR findings validate a significantly strong association between increased BDNF levels and BCI-838 treatment. Our study points to BCI-838 as a safe and orally active compound capable of mimicking the beneficial effect of exercise on AHN, learning behavior, and anxiety in a mouse model of AD neuropathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Common signatures of differential microRNA expression in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease brains</a></h4>

              
                Background: Dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis and course of many neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the functionally relevant miRNAs remain largely unknown. Previous meta-analyses on differential miRNA expression data in post-mortem PD brains have highlighted several miRNAs showing consistent and statistically significant effects. However, these meta-analyses were based on exceedingly small sample sizes. Methods: In this study, we quantified the expression of the four most compelling PD candidate miRNAs from these meta-analyses in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) of one of the largest case-control post-mortem brain datasets available (261 samples), thereby quadruplicating previously investigated sample sizes. Furthermore, we probed for common differential miRNA expression signatures with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by also analyzing these miRNAs in post-mortem STG of 190 AD patients and controls and by testing six top AD miRNAs in the PD brains. Results: Of all ten analyzed miRNAs, PD candidate miRNA homo sapiens (hsa-) miR-132-3p showed evidence for differential expression in both PD (p=4.89E-06) and AD (p=3.20E-24), and AD miRNAs hsa-miR-132-5p (p=4.52E-06) and hsa-miR-129-5p (p=0.0379) showed evidence for differential expression in PD. Combining these novel data with previously published data substantially improved the statistical support (=3.85E-03 using Bonferroni correction) of the corresponding meta-analyses clearly and compellingly implicating these miRNAs in both PD and AD. Furthermore, hsa-miR-132-3p/-5p (but not hsa-miR-129-5p) showed association with neuropathological Braak PD staging (p=3.51E-03/p=0.0117), suggesting that these miRNAs may play a role in -synuclein aggregation beyond the early disease phase. Conclusions: Our study represents the largest independent assessment of recently highlighted candidate brain miRNAs in PD and AD post-mortem brain samples, to date. Our results implicate hsa-miR-132-3p/-5p and hsa-miR-129-5p to be differentially expressed in both PD and AD brains, potentially pinpointing shared pathogenic mechanisms across these neurodegenerative diseases.

                The feeding related hormone, acyl ghrelin, protects dopamine neurones in murine 1 methyl 4 phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-based models of experimental Parkinsons disease (PD). However, the potential protective effect of acyl ghrelin on substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopaminergic neurones and consequent behavioural correlates in the more widely used 6 hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) rat medial forebrain bundle (MFB) lesion model of PD are unknown. To address this question, acyl ghrelin levels were raised directly by minipump infusion for 7-days prior to unilateral injection of 6OHDA into the MFB with assessment of amphetamine induced rotations on days 27 and 35, and immunohistochemical analysis of dopaminergic neurone survival. While acyl ghrelin treatment was insufficient to elevate food intake or body weight, it attenuated amphetamine induced circling behaviour and SNpc dopamine neurone loss induced by 6OHDA. These data support the notion that elevating circulating acyl ghrelin may be a valuable approach to slow or impair progression of neurone loss in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Do place cells dream of deceptive moves in a signaling game?</a></h4>

              
                We consider the possibility of applying game theory to analysis and modeling of neurobiological systems. Specifically, the basic properties and features of information asymmetric signal games are considered and discussed as having potential to explain diverse neurobiological phenomena at levels of biological function that include gene regulation, molecular and biochemical signaling, cellular and metabolic function, as well as neuronal action potential discharge to represent cognitive variables that may underlie memory and behavior. We begin by arguing that there is a pressing need for conceptual frameworks that can permit analysis and integration of information and explanations across the many scales of diverse levels of biological function if we are to understand cognitive functions like learning, memory, and perception. The present work focuses on systems level neuroscience organized around the connected brain regions of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. These areas are intensely studied in rodent subjects as model neuronal systems that undergo activity-dependent synaptic plasticity to form and represent memories and spatial knowledge used for purposeful navigation. Examples of cognition-related spatial information in the observed neuronal discharge of hippocampal place cell populations and medial entorhinal head-direction cell populations are used to illustrate possible challenges to information maximization concepts that may be natural to explain using the ideas and features of information asymmetric signaling games.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impact of APOE e3 and e4 genotypes on plasma proteome signatures in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a high-risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, approximately 25% to 40% of patients with AD do not carry the APOE e4 allele, and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD are less evident in these individuals. The main objective of this study was to understand better the changes in plasma that may contribute to disease pathogenesis in AD and how APOE e3 and APOE e4 contribute to biomarker profiles in AD. We conducted an in-depth plasma proteomics analysis using intensive depletion of high-abundant plasma proteins using the Agilent multiple affinity removal liquid chromatography (LC) column- Human 14 (Hu14) followed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) technique. In this study, we identified a high number of protein expression alterations in plasma which were found uniquely in APOE e3 and APOE e4 carriers. These differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were associated with several molecular functions, including complement cascade, glycolysis, metabolism, plasma lipoprotein assembly, remodelling, and clearance. In addition to unique changes in both APOE genotypes, many proteins were also dysregulated in the presence of both APOE e3 and APOE e4 genotypes depicting the involvement of these proteins in the pathogenesis of AD regardless of the APOE genotypes. We also compared the plasma proteomes of e4 and e3 carriers in normal controls, which provided insight into factors that may provide protection from progression to AD despite the presence of the e4 allele. Furthermore, our findings also identified some proteins previously discovered in AD CSF and brain proteomics signatures that could provide clinically meaningful information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glia of C. elegans coordinate the heat shock response independent of the neuronal thermosensory circuit and serotonin</a></h4>

              
                As organisms age, they lose the ability to induce appropriate stress responses, becoming vulnerable to protein toxicity and tissue damage. Neurons can signal to peripheral tissues to induce protective organelle-specific stress responses. Recent work has demonstrated a novel and independent role of glia in inducing such responses. Here, we show that overexpression of heat shock factor 1 (hsf-1) in the four astrocyte-like cephalic sheath cells of C. elegans is sufficient to induce a non-cell autonomous cytosolic unfolded protein response (UPR), also known as the heat shock response (HSR), in distal cells. These animals upregulate the HSR in peripheral cells and have increased lifespan and resistance to heat stress. This glial HSR regulation is independent of the canonical neuronal thermosensory circuit and of known neurotransmitters but is dependent on the small clear vesicle release protein UNC-13. Additionally, HSF-1 and the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 are partially required in the peripheral tissues for increase of non-autonomous HSR, lifespan, and thermotolerance. We find that cephalic sheath glial hsf-1 over-expression leads to increased pathogen resistance, which suggests a role for this signaling pathway in immune function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Origin of hexagonal metric of grid cells in navigating spaces</a></h4>

              
                To achieve the computational goal of navigating both natural and mental spaces, the brain adopts a hexagonal metric of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex (ERC) to chart the spaces. However, little is known about how and why the hexagonal metric emerges. Here we designed an object matching task where participants adjusted two parts of object variants to match their prototype in fMRI scanner. Unbeknownst to the participants, the object variants were arranged on a ring centering on the prototype in an object space constructed by the object parts. When the participants navigated from a location in the ring to the center in the space, we observed hexagonal signals in the ERC, and more importantly, a spatial rhythm of 3Hz in the hippocampus (HPC). Accordingly, we built a computational model depicting the spatial rhythm of 3Hz as scaffolds to transform discrete spatial locations into structured states of cognitive map that allows continuous updates of location estimates with each movement made. The formal proof shows that to support the cognitive map in the HPC, the spatial input from the ERC must be in a hexagonal pattern. To further examine the biological plausibility of the model, we built various forms of neural networks in their simplest architecture to transform locations in space into structured states of cognitive map, and units with hexagonal patterns emerge ubiquitously. In short, with empirical experiments, formal proof, and neural network simulation, our study reveals the origin of the hexagonal metric of grid cells mechanistically.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation disrupts neuroplasticity of intracortical motor circuits.</a></h4>

              
                While previous research using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) suggest that cerebellum (CB) influences the neuroplastic response of primary motor cortex (M1), the role of different indirect (I) wave inputs in M1 mediating this interaction remains unclear. The aim of this study was therefore to assess how CB influences neuroplasticity of early and late I-wave circuits. 22 young adults (22 {+/-} 2.7 years) participated in 3 sessions in which I-wave periodicity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTMS) was applied over M1 during concurrent application of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over CB (tDCSCB). In each session, iTMS either targeted early I-waves (1.5 ms interval; iTMS1.5), late I-waves (4.5 ms interval; iTMS4.5), or had no effect (variable interval; iTMSSham). Changes due to the intervention were examined with motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude using TMS protocols measuring corticospinal excitability (MEP1mV) and the strength of CB-M1 connections (CBI). In addition, we indexed I-wave activity using short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) and low-intensity single-pulse TMS applied with posterior-anterior (MEPPA) and anterior-posterior (MEPAP) current directions. Following both active iTMS sessions, there was no change in MEP1mV, CBI or SICF (all P > 0.05), suggesting that tDCSCB broadly disrupted the excitatory response that is normally seen following iTMS. However, although MEPAP also failed to facilitate after the intervention (P > 0.05), MEPPA potentiated following both active iTMS sessions (both P < 0.05). This differential response between current directions suggests that the disruptive effects of CB modulation on M1 plasticity may be selectively mediated by AP-sensitive circuits (also likely recruited with MEP1mV, CBI, and SICF).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of perceived emotions in human insula and amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The emotional status of a speaker is an important non-linguistic cue carried by human voice and can be perceived by a listener in vocal communication. Understanding the neural circuits involved in processing emotions carried by human voice is crucial for understanding the neural basis of social interaction. Previous studies have shown that human insula and amygdala responded more selectively to emotional sounds than non-emotional sounds. However, it is not clear whether the neural selectivity to emotional sounds in these brain structures is determined by the emotion presented by a speaker or by the emotion perceived by a listener. In this study, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) responses to emotional human voices while subjects performed emotion recognition tasks. We found that the iEEG responses of Heschl's gyrus (HG) and posterior insula were determined by the presented emotion, whereas the iEEG responses of anterior insula and amygdala were driven by the perceived emotion. These results suggest that the anterior insula and amygdala play a crucial role in representing subjectively perceived emotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An actionable map of arm and hand muscle responses to electrical stimulation of the dorsal cervical spinal cord in humans</a></h4>

              
                While epidural stimulation of the lumbar spinal cord has emerged as a powerful modality for recovery of movement, how it should be targeted to the cervical spinal cord to activate arm and hand muscles is not well-understood, particularly in humans. We sought to map muscle responses to posterior epidural cervical spinal cord stimulation in humans. We hypothesized that lateral stimulation over the dorsal root entry zone would be most effective, and responses would be strongest in the muscles innervated by the stimulated segment. Eighteen people undergoing clinically indicated cervical spine surgery were enrolled. During surgery, stimulation was performed in midline and lateral positions at multiple exposed segments; eight arm and three leg muscles were recorded on each side of the body. Across all segments and muscles tested, lateral stimulation produced stronger muscle responses than midline. These stronger responses were due to a combination of a decreased response threshold and steeper recruitment slope. Muscles innervated at a cervical segment had the largest responses from stimulation at that segment, but responses were also observed in muscles innervated at other cervical segments and in leg muscles. The cervical responses were clustered in rostral (C4-C6) and caudal (C7-T1) cervical segments. Strong responses to lateral stimulation are likely due to the proximity of stimulation to afferent axons. Small changes in responses to stimulation of adjacent cervical segments argues for local circuit integration, and distant muscle responses suggest activation of long propriospinal connections. This map can help guide cervical stimulation to improve arm and hand function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vamos en bici: Study protocol of an investigation of cognitive and neural changes following language training, physical exercise training, or a combination of both</a></h4>

              
                As the relative number of elderly people as well as the average life expectancy increases, identifying potential means to alter the ongoing trajectory of aging and specifically the trajectory of cognitive performance is of great importance. Some modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical and cognitive activity, have shown positive effects on cognition and brain structure, and the combination of the two might even show a boosted, interactive effect. In this study protocol, we describe in detail our data which was acquired to explore how cognitive stimulation in the form of acquiring a new language, physical exercise on stationary bikes or the combination of the two interventions affect brain structure, cognitive performance, and psychosocial functioning. One-hundred and forty-two older healthy adults (63-78 years) were randomly assigned to one of four six-month intervention programs, comprising (a) foreign language learning, (b) physical exercise training on a bicycle ergometer, (c) a combination of language learning and physical exercise, or (d) a book club (serving as an active control condition). We collected a rich neuroimaging data set, comprising T1-weighted structural, resting state functional, high resolution hippocampal, myelin water fraction, diffusion-weighted, arterial spin labeling, and multi-parameter images. Using a cognitive battery, we collected data from the domains of episodic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and fluid intelligence. We performed comprehensive physical assessments including cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and additionally collected data on psychosocial functioning (e.g., well-being, perceived stress, control beliefs). We assume that physical activity boosts brain plasticity per se by inducing structural and neurochemical changes in brain regions that are important for learning and memory and therefore may facilitate the effects of cognitive training.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A critical test of deep convolutional neural networks ability to capture recurrent processing in the brain using visual masking</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent processing is a crucial feature in human visual processing supporting perceptual grouping, figure-ground segmentation, and recognition under challenging conditions. There is a clear need to incorporate recurrent processing in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) but the computations underlying recurrent processing remain unclear. In this paper, we tested a form of recurrence in deep residual networks (ResNets) to capture recurrent processing signals in the human brain. Though ResNets are feedforward networks, they approximate an excitatory additive form of recurrence. Essentially, this form of recurrence consists of repeating excitatory activations in response to a static stimulus. Here, we used ResNets of varying depths (reflecting varying levels of recurrent processing) to explain electroencephalography (EEG) activity within a visual masking paradigm. Sixty-two humans and fifty artificial agents (10 ResNet models of depths - 4, 6, 10, 18 and 34) completed an object categorization task. We show that deeper networks (ResNet-10, 18 and 34) explained more variance in brain activity compared to shallower networks (ResNet-4 and 6). Furthermore, all ResNets captured differences in brain activity between unmasked and masked trials, with differences starting at ~98ms (from stimulus onset). These early differences indicated that EEG activity reflected pure feedforward signals only briefly (up to ~98ms). After ~98ms, deeper networks showed a significant increase in explained variance which peaks at ~200ms, but only within unmasked trials, not masked trials. In summary, we provided clear evidence that excitatory additive recurrent processing in ResNets captures some of the recurrent processing in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduction of layer 5 mediated long-range cortical communication by antipsychotic drugs</a></h4>

              
                Psychosis is characterized by a diminished ability of the brain to distinguish externally driven activity patterns from self-generated activity patterns. Antipsychotic drugs are a class of small molecules with relatively broad binding affinity for a variety of neuromodulator receptors that, in humans, can prevent or ameliorate psychosis. How these drugs influence the function of cortical circuits and in particular their ability to identify self-generated activity patterns is still largely unclear. Here we used widefield calcium imaging to determine the cell type specific functional effects of antipsychotic drugs in mouse dorsal cortex during visuomotor integration. By comparing cell type specific activation patterns between locomotion onsets that were experimentally coupled to self-generated visual feedback and locomotion onsets that were not coupled, we show that deep cortical layers were differentially activated in these two conditions. We then show that the antipsychotic drug clozapine disrupted visuomotor integration at locomotion onsets also primarily in deep cortical layers. Given that one of the key components of visuomotor integration in cortex are long-range cortico-cortical connections, we tested whether the effect of clozapine was detectable in the correlation structure of activity patterns across dorsal cortex. We found that clozapine, as well as two other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole and haloperidol, resulted in a strong reduction in correlations of layer 5 activity between cortical areas and impaired the spread of visuomotor prediction errors generated in visual cortex. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that a major functional effect of antipsychotic drugs is an alteration of the activation of internal representations as a consequence of reduced long-range layer 5 mediated communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enrichment of specific GABAergic neuronal types in the mouse perirhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                GABAergic neurons represent 10-15% of the neuronal population of the cortex but exert a powerful control over information flow in cortical circuits. GABAergic neurons show an extraordinary diversity in their morphology, physiology, molecular markers and connectivity. This diversity allows GABAergic neurons to participate in a wide variety of microcircuit motifs. The diversity of GABAergic neuron has been shown to be conserved across cortical regions. The GABAergic population can be broadly divided in three major classes parvalbumin, somatostatin and 5HT3aR groups. The largest GABAergic class in the cortex is represented by the parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking neurons, which provide powerful somatic inhibition to their postsynaptic targets. Recently, the density of parvalbumin-expressing neurons has been shown to be lower in associative areas of the mouse cortex, including the perirhinal cortex, as compared to sensory and motor areas. In the present study we investigated whether this reduction in parvalbumin-expressing neuron leads to a decreased GABAergic population, or to an enrichment of other GABAergic cell-types. We found that the GABAergic population of the perirhinal cortex is comparable to that of a primary sensory area, and it is enriched of neurons belonging to the 5HT3aR group. We also demonstrate that, despite the low density of parvalbumin-expressing neurons, the perirhinal cortex contains a comparable population of fast-spiking neurons, most of which do not express parvalbumin. Our results demonstrate a yet uncharacterized diversity within the fast-spiking population across cortical regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Real-time neurofeedback to alter interpretations of a naturalistic narrative</a></h4>

              
                We explored the potential of using real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback training to bias interpretations of naturalistic narrative stimuli. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two possible conditions, each corresponding to a different interpretation of an ambiguous spoken story. While participants listened to the story in the scanner, neurofeedback was used to reward neural activity corresponding to the assigned interpretation. After scanning, final interpretations were assessed. While neurofeedback did not change story interpretations on average, participants with higher levels of decoding accuracy during the neurofeedback procedure were more likely to adopt the assigned interpretation. Thus, we believe that individualized neurofeedback shaped interpretations successfully when the signal was accurate, although more work is needed to improve this method and validate the result. While naturalistic stimuli introduce a unique set of challenges in providing effective and individualized neurofeedback, we believe that this technique holds promise for individualized cognitive therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Elevated photic response is followed by a rapid decay and depressed state in ictogenic networks</a></h4>

              
                The switch between non-seizure and seizure states involves profound alterations in network excitability and synchrony. Both increased and decreased excitability may underlie the state transitions, as shown in epilepsy patients and animal models. Inspired by video-electroencephalography recordings in patients, we developed a framework to study spontaneous and photic-evoked neural and locomotor activity in zebrafish larvae. We combined high-throughput behavioral tracking and whole-brain in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to perform side-by-side comparison of multiple zebrafish seizure and epilepsy models. Our setup allowed us to dissect behavioral and physiological features that are divergent or convergent across multiple seizure models. We observed that locomotor and neural activity during interictal and spontaneous ictal periods exhibit great diversity across seizure models. Yet, during photic stimulation, hyperexcitability and rapid response dynamics was well conserved across multiple seizure models, highlighting the reliability of photic-evoked seizure activity for high-throughput assays. Intriguingly, in several seizure models, we observed that the initial elevated photic response is often followed by fast decay of neural activity and a prominent depressed state. We argue that such depressed states are likely due to homeostatic mechanisms triggered by excessive neural activity. An improved understanding of the interplay between elevated and depressed excitability states might suggest tailored epilepsy therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proximity of astrocyte leaflets to the synapse determines memory strength</a></h4>

              
                Astrocyte distal processes, known as leaflets or perisynaptic astrocyte processes (PAPs), fine-tune synaptic activity by clearing neurotransmitters and limiting extrasynaptic glutamate diffusion. While learning and memory depends on orchestrated synaptic activity of neuronal ensembles within the hippocampus, it is becoming increasingly evident that astrocytes residing in the environment of these synapses play a central role in shaping memories. However, how astroglial synaptic coverage contributes to mnemonic processing remains largely unknown. Here, we targeted astrocyte leaflet structure in vivo by depleting Ezrin, an integral leaflet-structural protein, in astrocytes of the adult hippocampal CA1 using a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic approach. This resulted in significantly smaller astrocyte territories and reduced astroglial synaptic coverage. In addition, using genetically encoded glutamate sensors and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from pyramidal neurons, we found that Ezrin deletion and the resultant manipulation of leaflet structure boosted extrasynaptic glutamate diffusion and NMDA-receptor activation. Importantly, these cellular phenotypes translated to enhanced fear memory expression that was accompanied by increased activation of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the days after learning occurred. We show that Ezrin is critical for astrocyte morphology as well as for adult hippocampal synapse integrity and function. Our data show that astrocyte leaflet structure gates memory strength by regulating glutamate spillover in the vicinity of memory-related synaptic activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stress resilience is established during development and is regulated by complement factors</a></h4>

              
                Individuals in a population respond differently to stressful situations. While resilient individuals recover efficiently, others are susceptible to the same stressors. However, it remains challenging to identify resilience in mammalian embryos to determine if stress resilience is established as a trait during development or acquired later in life. Using a new behavioural paradigm in zebrafish larvae, we show that resilience is a trait that is determined and exhibited early in life. Resilient and susceptible individuals retained these traits throughout life and passed them on to the next generation. Resilient larvae showed higher expression of resilience-associated genes and larvae lacking neuropeptide Y and miR218 were significantly under-represented in the resilient population. Unbiased transcriptome analysis revealed that multiple factors of the innate immune complement cascade were downregulated in resilient larvae in response to stressors. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockouts of critical complement factors led to an increase in resilience. We conclude that resilience is established early during development as a stable trait, and that neuropeptides and the complement pathway play positive and negative roles in determining resilience respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic brain functional ultrasound imaging in freely moving rodents performing cognitive tasks</a></h4>

              
                Functional ultrasound imaging (fUS) is an emerging imaging technique that indirectly measures neural activity via changes in blood volume. To date it has not been used to image chronically during cognitive tasks in freely moving animals. Performing those experiments faces a number of exceptional challenges: performing large durable craniotomies with chronic implants, designing behavioural experiments matching the hemodynamic timescale, stabilizing the ultrasound probe during freely moving behavior, accurately assessing motion artifacts and validating that the animal can perform cognitive tasks at high performance while tethered. In this study, we provide validated solutions for those technical challenges. In addition, we present standardized step-by-step reproducible protocols, procedures and data processing pipelines that open up the opportunity to perform fUS in freely moving rodents performing complex cognitive tasks. Moreover, we present proof-of-concept analysis of brain dynamics during a decision making task. We obtain stable recordings from which we can robustly decode task variables from fUS data over multiple months. Moreover, we find that brain wide imaging through hemodynamic response is nonlinearly related to cognitive variables, such as task difficulty, as compared to sensory responses previously explored.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic Cilium in SCN Neuron is a Gatekeeper for the Intrinsic Circadian Clock</a></h4>

              
                The internal circadian rhythm is controlled by the central pacemaker in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). SCN drives coherent and synchronized circadian oscillations via intercellular coupling, which are resistant to environmental perturbations. Here we report that primary cilium is a critical device for intercellular coupling among SCN neurons and acts as a gatekeeper to maintain the internal clock in mice. A subset of SCN neurons, namely neuromedin S-producing (NMS) neurons, exhibit cilia dynamics with a pronounced circadian rhythmicity. Genetic ablation of ciliogenesis in NMS neurons enables a rapid phase shift of the internal clock under experimental jet lag conditions. The circadian rhythms of individual neurons in cilia deficient SCN slices lose their coherence following external perturbations. Rhythmic cilia dynamics drive oscillations of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling and oscillated expressions of multiple circadian genes in SCN neurons. Genetic and chemical inactivation of Shh signaling in NMS neurons phenocopies the effect of cilia ablation. Our findings establish ciliary signaling as a novel interneuronal coupling mechanism in the SCN and may lead to novel therapy of circadian disruption-linked diseases.

	<p>The effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) frequency on brain oscillations and cortical excitability are still controversial. Therefore, this study investigated how different tACS frequencies differentially modulate cortical oscillation and inhibition. To do so, we first determined the optimal positioning of tACS electrodes through an electric field simulation constructed from magnetic resonance images. Seven electrode configurations were tested on the electric field of the precentral gyrus (hand motor area). We determined that the Cz-CP1 configuration was optimal, as it resulted in higher electric field values and minimized the intra-individual differences in the electric field. Therefore, tACS was delivered to the hand motor area through this arrangement at a fixed frequency of 10 Hz (alpha-tACS) or 20 Hz (beta-tACS) with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.6 mA for 20 min. We found that alpha- and beta-tACS resulted in larger alpha and beta oscillations, respectively, compared with the oscillations observed after sham-tACS. In addition, alpha- and beta-tACS decreased the amplitudes of conditioned motor evoked potentials and increased alpha and beta activity, respectively. Correspondingly, alpha- and beta-tACSs enhanced cortical inhibition. These results show that tACS frequency differentially affects motor cortex oscillation and inhibition.</p>

	<p>Understanding the role of the noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) in cognition and behavior is critical: It is involved in several key behavioral functions such as stress and vigilance, as well as in cognitive processes such as attention and decision making. In recent years, the development of viral tools has provided a clear insight into numerous aspects of brain functions in rodents. However, given the specificity of primate brains and the key benefit of monkey research for translational applications, developing viral tools to study the LC in monkeys is essential for understanding its function and exploring potential clinical strategies. Here, we describe a pharmacogenetics approach that allows to selectively and reversibly inactivate LC neurons using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD). We show that the expression of the hM4Di DREADD can be restricted to noradrenergic LC neurons and that the amount of LC inhibition can be adjusted by adapting the dose of the specific DREADD activator deschloroclozapine (DCZ). Indeed, even if high doses (&amp;amp;gt;0.3 mg/kg) induce a massive inhibition of LC neurons and a clear decrease in vigilance, smaller doses (&amp;amp;lt;0.3 mg/kg) induce a more moderate decrease in LC activity, but it does not affect vigilance, which is more compatible with an assessment of subtle cognitive functions such as decision making and attention.</p>

	<p>The cochlear implant (CI) is the most successful neuroprosthesis allowing thousands of patients with profound hearing loss to recover speech understanding. Recently, cochlear implants have been proposed to subjects with residual hearing and, in these cases, shorter CIs were implanted. To be successful, it is crucial to preserve the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s remaining hearing abilities after the implantation. Here, we quantified the effects of CI insertion on the responses of auditory cortex neurons in anesthetized guinea pigs. The responses of auditory cortex neurons were determined before and after the insertion of a 300 &amp;amp;micro;m diameter CI (six stimulating electrodes, length 6 mm). Immediately after CI insertion there was a 5 to 15 dB increase in the threshold for cortical neurons from the middle to the high frequencies, accompanied by a decrease in the evoked firing rate. Analyzing the characteristic frequency (CF) values revealed that in large number of cases, the CFs obtained after insertion were lower than before. These effects were not detected in the control animals. These results indicate that there is a small but immediate cortical hearing loss after CI insertion, even with short length CIs. Therefore, efforts should be made to minimize the damages during CI insertion to preserve the cortical responses to acoustic stimuli.</p>

	<p>Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a rare neurodegenerative condition characterized by four-repeat tau aggregation in the cortical and subcortical brain regions and accompanied by severe atrophy. The aim of this study was to evaluate partial volume effect correction (PVEC) in patients with CBS compared to a control cohort imaged with the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [18F]GE-180. Eighteen patients with CBS and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent [18F]GE-180 PET. The cortical and subcortical regions were delineated by deep nuclei parcellation (DNP) of a 3D-T1 MRI. Region-specific subcortical volumes and standardized uptake values and ratios (SUV and SUVr) were extracted before and after region-based voxel-wise PVEC. Regional volumes were compared between patients with CBS and controls. The % group differences and effect sizes (CBS vs. controls) of uncorrected and PVE-corrected SUVr data were compared. Single-region positivity in patients with CBS was assessed by a &amp;amp;gt;2 SD threshold vs. controls and compared between uncorrected and PVE-corrected data. Smaller regional volumes were detected in patients with CBS compared to controls in the right ventral striatum (p = 0.041), the left putamen (p = 0.005), the right putamen (p = 0.038) and the left pallidum (p = 0.015). After applying PVEC, the % group differences were distinctly higher, but the effect sizes of TSPO uptake were only slightly stronger due to the higher variance after PVEC. The single-region positivity of TSPO PET increased in patients with CBS after PVEC (100 vs. 83 regions). PVEC in the cortical and subcortical regions is valuable for TSPO imaging of patients with CBS, leading to the improved detection of elevated [18F]GE-180 uptake, although the effect sizes in the comparison against the controls did not improve strongly.</p>

	<p>We investigated the association between the Magnetic Resonance Parkinsonism Index (MRPI) and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). We included 226 de novo PD patients (82 PD-RBD and 144 PD-noRBD) and 19 idiopathic RBD patients. Furthermore, 3T T1-weighted MR images were used for automated brainstem calculations. MRPI values were higher in the PD-RBD (p = 0.004) compared to PD-noRBD patients. Moreover, MRPI proved to be a significant predictor of REM Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire scores in PD (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.195, p = 0.007) and iRBD patients (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.582, p = 0.003). MRPI can be used as an imaging marker of RBD in patients with de novo PD and iRBD.</p>

	<p>Background: Personalization of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for tinnitus might be capable to overcome the heterogeneity of treatment responses. The assessment of loudness changes after short rTMS protocols in test sessions has been proposed as a strategy to identify the best protocol for the daily treatment application. However, the therapeutic advantages of this approach are currently not clear. The present study was designed to further investigate the feasibility and clinical efficacy of personalized rTMS as compared to a standardized rTMS protocol used for tinnitus. Methods: RTMS personalization was conducted via test sessions and reliable, sham-superior responses respectively short-term reductions in tinnitus loudness following active rTMS protocols (1, 10, 20 Hz, each 200 pulses) applied over the left and right temporal cortex. Twenty pulses at a frequency of 0.1 Hz served as a control condition (sham). In case of a response, patients were randomly allocated to ten treatment sessions of either personalized rTMS (2000 pulses with the site and frequency producing the most pronounced loudness reduction during test sessions) or standard rTMS (1 Hz, 2000 pulses left temporal cortex). Those participants who did not show a response during the test sessions received the standard protocol as well. Results: The study was terminated prematurely after 22 patients (instead of 50 planned) as the number of test session responders was much lower than expected (27% instead of 50%). Statistical evaluation of changes in metric tinnitus variables and treatment responses indicated only numerical, but not statistical superiority for personalized rTMS compared to standard treatment. Conclusions: The current stage of investigation does not allow for a clear conclusion about the therapeutic advantages of personalized rTMS for tinnitus based on test session responses. The feasibility of this approach is primarily limited by the low test session response rate.</p>

	<p>The uncontrolled use of specific Internet applications is increasingly recognized as a mental health issue. Gaming disorder, which is one subtype of specific Internet-use disorders (sIUDs), has been included in the ICD-11 as disorder due to addictive behaviors. Addictive disorders are assumed to be accompanied by cognitive deficits as indicated by weaker performance in executive function and risky decision-making tasks. This study investigates risky decision-making in individuals with tendencies towards sIUDs including gaming, online buying-shopping, and social-networks-use disorders. A total of 293 individuals participated in the study. Based on specific screening instruments, the participants were assigned to a group with tendencies towards sIUD or a control group. Participants completed a risky decision-making task and questionnaires assessing risk-taking propensity, impulsivity, psychopathology, and perceived stress. The group with sIUD tendencies showed higher attentional impulsivity and higher levels of depression and anxiety compared to the control group. The groups did not differ in decision making and risk propensity. Decision making did not have significant effects on sIUD symptoms. Risk for developing sIUDs does not appear to be accompanied by altered general decision-making tendencies. Rather, psychological (pre-)load and attentional deficits appear to be relevant features in uncontrolled use of the Internet.</p>

	<p>Aggressive behaviour is at the basis of many harms in society, such as violent crime. The efforts to explain, study, and possibly reduce aggression span various disciplines, including neuroscience. The specific brain networks which are involved in the modulation of aggressive behaviour include cortical asymmetry and brain areas such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Recent non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) research suggests that both transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) can play a role in the modulation of aggressive behaviour by directly changing brain activity. In this review, we systematically explore and discuss 11 experimental studies that aimed to modulate aggressive behaviour or self-reported aggression using NIBS. Out of these 11 studies, nine significantly up- or downregulated aggression by using tDCS or cTBS targeting the DLPFC, VLPFC or VMPFC. The potential applications of these findings span both the clinical and the forensic psychological domains. However, the results are limited by the methodological heterogeneity in the aggression measures used across the studies, and by their generally small sample sizes. Future research should consider improving the localization and specificity of NIBS by employing neuro-navigational instruments and standardized scoring methods.</p>

	<p>Background: There is growing interest in identifying individuals who are in the prodromal phase of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), as these individuals are potentially suitable for inclusion in intervention trials to prevent clinically manifest PD. However, it is less clear whether&amp;amp;mdash;and to what extent&amp;amp;mdash;cognitive deficits are present in prodromal PD. Methods: A systematic query was conducted through PubMed and Embase for prospective observational cohort studies that (a) assessed cognitive performance in individuals free of manifest PD at baseline and (b) subsequently followed up participants for incident PD. We grouped the results by cognitive domain, and for domains that had been reported in at least three separate studies, we performed random-effects, inverse variance meta-analyses based on summary statistics. Results: We identified nine articles suitable for inclusion, with a total of 215 patients with phenoconversion and 13,524 individuals remaining disease-free at follow-up. The studies were highly heterogeneous in study design, study population, and cognitive test batteries. Studies that included only cognitive screening measures such as MMSE or MoCA reported no association between worse cognitive performance and onset of manifest PD (combined odds ratio 1.08; 95% confidence interval 0.66&amp;amp;ndash;1.77). By contrast, studies that used extensive cognitive testing batteries found that global cognitive deficits were associated with an increased risk of manifest PD. In domain-specific analyses, there was evidence for an association between worse executive functioning (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.10&amp;amp;ndash;1.92), but not memory (OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.85&amp;amp;ndash;1.70) or attention (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.23&amp;amp;ndash;4.26), and clinically manifest PD. Conclusion: Although some caution due to high heterogeneity among published studies is warranted, the available evidence suggests that global and executive cognitive deficits are prodromal features of PD. Collaborative prospective studies with extensive cognitive test batteries are required to shed light on domain-specific deficits, temporal relations, and subgroup differences in prodromal cognitive deficits in PD.</p>

	<p>The number of paediatric patients living with a prolonged Disorder of Consciousness (DoC) is growing in high-income countries, thanks to substantial improvement in intensive care. Life expectancy is extending due to the clinical and nursing management achievements of chronic phase needs, including infections. However, long-known pharmacological therapies such as amantadine and zolpidem, as well as novel instrumental approaches using direct current stimulation and, more recently, stem cell transplantation, are applied in the absence of large paediatric clinical trials and rigorous age-balanced and dose-escalated validations. With evidence building up mainly through case reports and observational studies, there is a need for well-designed paediatric clinical trials and specific research on 0&amp;amp;ndash;4-year-old children. At such an early age, assessing residual and recovered abilities is most challenging due to the early developmental stage, incompletely learnt motor and cognitive skills, and unreliable communication; treatment options are also less explored in early age. In middle-income countries, the lack of rehabilitation services and professionals focusing on paediatric age hampers the overall good assistance provision. Young and fast-evolving health insurance systems prevent universal access to chronic care in some countries. In low-income countries, rescue networks are often inadequate, and there is a lack of specialised and intensive care, difficulty in providing specific pharmaceuticals, and lower compliance to intensive care hygiene standards. Despite this, paediatric cases with DoC are reported, albeit in fewer numbers than in countries with better-resourced healthcare systems. For patients with a poor prospect of recovery, withdrawal of care is inhomogeneous across countries and still heavily conditioned by treatment costs as well as ethical and cultural factors, rather than reliant on protocols for assessment and standardised treatments. In summary, there is a strong call for multicentric, international, and global health initiatives on DoC to devote resources to the paediatric age, as there is now scope for funders to invest in themes specific to DoC affecting the early years of the life course.</p>

	<p>This study evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of a telerehabilitation adaptation of the Be Clear speech treatment program for adults with non-progressive dysarthria to determine clinical delivery viability and future research directions. Treatment effects on speech clarity, intelligibility, communication effectiveness, and participation, as well as psychosocial outcomes in 15 participants with non-progressive dysarthria, were explored. Intervention involved daily 1-h online sessions (4 days per week for 4 weeks, totalling 16 sessions) and daily home practice. Outcome measures were obtained at baseline (PRE), post-treatment (POST), and 12 weeks following treatment (FUP). Feasibility measures targeting participant satisfaction, treatment adherence and fidelity, and technical viability were also employed. The programme was feasible concerning technical viability and implementation, treatment adherence and fidelity. High levels of participant satisfaction were reported. Increases in overall ratings of communication participation and effectiveness were identified at POST and FUP. Reductions in speech rate were identified at FUP. Improvements in aspects of lingual and laryngeal function were also noted after treatment. Over time, improvements relating to the negative impact of dysarthria were identified. Na&amp;amp;iuml;ve listeners perceived negligible changes in speech clarity following treatment. Online delivery of the Be Clear speech treatment program was feasible, and some positive speech benefits were observed. Due to the small sample size included in this research, statistically significant findings related to speech outcomes must be interpreted with caution. An adequately powered randomised controlled trial of Be Clear online is warranted to evaluate treatment efficacy.</p>

	<p>Background: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) may present different motor subtypes depending on the predominant symptoms (tremor or rigidity/bradykinesia). Slower disease progression and cognitive decline were observed in tremor-dominant (TD) patients compared to those with the akinetic-rigid dominant (ARD) subtype. Although olfactory dysfunctions are well-known disturbances in PD patients, correlations among PD different subtypes and olfactory impairment were not clearly studied. Thus, we investigated the possible olfactory impairment in PD patients with TD and ARD subtypes as compared to healthy controls. Methods: A sample of 132 participants were enrolled: 62 PD patients divided into ARD (n = 42) and TD (n = 20) subgroups using tremor/rigidity ratio, and 70 healthy controls. Olfactory function was assessed with the Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks Test. Results: Odor threshold was significantly lower in the ARD than in the TD subtype, while odor identification, discrimination scores, and their sum (TDI score) were not significantly different. On multivariate linear regression analysis, the tremor/rigidity ratio was a significant predictor of odor threshold. Conclusions: Our pilot study showed a significant olfactory dysfunction in PD patients with the ARD subtype. This evidence confirms the biological relevance of clinical subgroups in PD patients, suggesting the existence of a different pathophysiological mechanism between the ARD and TD clinical subtypes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Leigh syndrome: a study of 209 patients at the Beijing Children's Hospital</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Leigh syndrome (LS) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease and the most frequent pediatric manifestation of mitochondrial disease. In the largest patient collection to date, this study aimed to provide new insights into the clinical and genetic spectrum of LS, defect-specific associations, and predictors of disease course and survival.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, metabolic, neuroimaging, onset, and survival data were collected from the medical records of 209 patients referred to the Beijing Children's Hospital with symmetrical basal ganglia and/or brainstem neuroimaging changes indicative of LS by 30 centers from the Chinese network of mitochondrial disease (mitoC-NET) between January 2013 and July 2021 for exploratory analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Pathogenic variants were identified in 52 genes, most frequently <i>MT-ATP6</i>, <i>SURF1,</i> and <i>PDHA1</i>. Maternally inherited variants accounted for 42% (heteroplasmy level ≥ 90% in 64%). Phenotypes spanned 92 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Elevated serum lactate (144/195), global developmental delay (142/209), and developmental regression (103/209) were most frequent. Discriminating neuroimaging and/or clinical features were identified for <i>MT-ATP6</i> (m.9176 T &gt; C)<i>, MT-ND5, PDHA1, SUCLG1,</i> and <i>SURF1</i>. Poorest survival was associated with <i>MT-ND5, MT-ATP6</i> (m.8993 T &gt; C and m.9176 T &gt; C), <i>SURF1</i>, and <i>ALDH5A1</i> (≤50% 3 year survival), in contrast to milder defects with specific treatment (<i>ECHS1</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i>, 100% 3 year survival).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data define phenotype, onset, and survival of LS in a defect-specific manner, identifying features discriminating between genetic defects and predictive of disease outcome. These findings are essential to early diagnosis, in optimizing family counselling, and to the design and monitoring of future clinical trials, the next frontier of LS research.</p>

                Invasive electromyography opened a new window to explore motoneuron behaviour in vivo. However, the technique is limited by the small fraction of active motoneurons that can be concurrently detected, precluding a population analysis in natural tasks. Here, we developed a high-density intramuscular electrode for in vivo human recordings along with a fully automatic methodology that could detect the discharges of action potentials of up to 67 concurrently active motoneurons with 99% accuracy. These data revealed that motoneurons of the same pool receive common synaptic input at frequencies up to 75 Hz and that late recruited motoneurons inhibit the discharges of those recruited earlier. These results constitute an important step in the population coding analysis of the human motor system in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evolution of neural activity in circuits bridging sensory and abstract knowledge</a></h4>

              
                The ability to associate sensory stimuli with abstract classes is critical for survival. How are these associations implemented in brain circuits? And what governs how neural activity evolves during abstract knowledge acquisition? To investigate these questions, we consider a circuit model that learns to map sensory inputs into abstract classes via gradient descent synaptic plasticity. We focus on typical neuroscience tasks (simple, and context-dependent, categorization), and study how both synaptic connectivity and neural activity evolve during learning. To make contact with the current generation of experiments we focus on the latter, and analyze activity via standard measures such as selectivity, correlations, and tuning symmetry. We find that the model is able to capture experimental observations, including seemingly disparate ones. We determine how, in the model, the behaviour of these activity measures depends on details of the circuit and the task. These dependencies make experimentally-testable predictions about the circuitry supporting abstract knowledge acquisition in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal membrane proteasomes homeostatically regulate neural circuit activity in vivo and are required for learning-induced behavioral plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Protein degradation is critical for brain function through processes that remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the in vivo function of a recently reported neuronal membrane-associated proteasome (NMP) in the brain of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. We demonstrated that NMPs are present in the tadpole brain with biochemistry and electron microscopy, and showed that they actively degrade neuronal activity-induced nascent proteins. Using in vivo calcium imaging in the optic tectum, we showed that acute inhibition of NMP function rapidly increased spontaneous neuronal activity, resulting in hyper-synchronization among tectal neurons. At the circuit level, inhibiting NMPs abolished learning-dependent improvement in a visuomotor behavior paradigm in live animals. Our data provide the first in vivo characterization of NMP functions in the vertebrate nervous system and suggest that NMP-mediated degradation of activity-induced nascent proteins may serve as a homeostatic modulatory mechanism in neurons that is critical for regulating neuronal activity and experience-dependent circuit plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabinoid receptor 1 is required for neurodevelopment of striosome-dendron bouquets</a></h4>

              
                Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) has strong effects on neurogenesis and axon pathfinding in the prenatal brain. Endocannabinoids that activate CB1R are abundant in the early postnatal brain and in mothers milk, but few studies have investigated their function in newborns. We examined postnatal CB1R expression in the major striatonigral circuit from striosomes of the striatum to the dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra. CB1R enrichment was first detectable between postnatal days 5 and 7, and this timing coincided with the formation of striosome-dendron bouquets, the elaborate anatomical structures by which striosomal neurons control dopaminergic cell activity through inhibitory synapses. In Cnr1 knockouts lacking CB1R expression, striosome-dendron bouquets were markedly disorganized by postnatal day 11 and at adulthood, suggesting a postnatal pathfinding connectivity function for CB1R in connecting striosomal axons and dopaminergic neurons analogous to CB1Rs prenatal function in other brain regions. Our finding that CB1R plays a major role in postnatal wiring of the striatonigral dopamine system, with lasting consequences at least in mice, points to a crucial need to determine whether lactating mothers use of CB1R agonists (e.g., in marijuana) or antagonists (e.g., type 2 diabetes therapies) can disrupt brain development in nursing offspring.

                Objective CRISPR-Cas9-generated zebrafish carrying a 12 base-pair deletion in stxbpb1b, a paralog sharing 79% amino acid sequence identity with human, exhibit spontaneous electrographic seizures during larval stages of development. Zebrafish stxbp1b mutants provide an efficient preclinical platform to test antiseizure therapeutics. The present study was designed to test prototype antiepileptic drugs approved for clinical use and two recently identified repurposed drugs with antiseizure activity. Methods Larval homozygous stxbp1b zebrafish (4 days post-fertilization) were agarose-embedded and monitored for electrographic seizure activity using a local field recording electrode placed in midbrain. Frequency of ictal-like events was evaluated at baseline and following 45 min of continuous drug exposure (1 mM, bath application). Analysis was performed on coded files by an experimenter blinded to drug treatment and genotype. Results Phenytoin, valproate, ethosuximide, levetiracetam, and diazepam had no effect on ictal-like event frequency in stxbp1b mutant zebrafish. Clemizole and trazodone decreased ictal-like event frequency in stxbp1b mutant zebrafish by 80% and 83%, respectively. These results suggest that repurposed drugs with serotonin receptor binding affinities could be effective antiseizure treatments. Significance Clemizole and trazodone were identified in a larval zebrafish model for Dravet syndrome. Based primarily on these preclinical zebrafish studies, compassionate-use and double-blind clinical trials with both drugs have progressed. The present study extends this approach to a preclinical zebrafish model representing STXBP1-related disorders, and suggests that future clinical studies may be warranted.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The NAD+ precursor NMN activates dSarm to trigger axon degeneration in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Axon degeneration contributes to the disruption of neuronal circuit function in diseased and injured nervous systems. Severed axons degenerate following the activation of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway, which culminates in the activation of SARM1 in mammals to execute the pathological depletion of the metabolite NAD+. SARM1 NADase activity is activated by the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). In mammals, keeping NMN levels low potently preserves axons after injury, however, it remains unclear whether NMN is also a key mediator of axon degeneration, and dSarm activation, in flies. Here, we demonstrate that lowering NMN levels in Drosophila through the expression of a newly generated prokaryotic NMN-Deamidase (NMN-D) preserves severed axons for months and keeps them circuit-integrated for weeks. NMN-D alters the NAD+ metabolic flux by lowering NMN, while NAD+ remains unchanged in vivo. Increased NMN synthesis, by the expression of mouse nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (mNAMPT), leads to faster axon degeneration after injury. We also show that NMN-induced activation of dSarm mediates axon degeneration in vivo. Finally, NMN-D delays neurodegeneration caused by loss of the sole NMN-consuming and NAD+-synthesizing enzyme dNmnat. Our results reveal a critical role for NMN in neurodegeneration in Drosophila, which extends beyond axonal injury. The potent neuroprotection by reducing NMN levels is similar or even stronger than the interference with other essential mediators of axon degeneration in Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interplay between rule learning and rule switching in a perceptual categorization task</a></h4>

              
                When performing a task in a changing world, sometimes we switch between rules already learned; at other times we must learn rules anew. Often we must do both, switching between known rules while also constantly re-estimating them. Here, we show these two processes, rule switching and rule learning, rely on distinct but intertwined computations, namely fast inference and slower incremental learning. To this end, we studied how monkeys switched between three rules. Each rule was compositional, requiring the animal to discriminate one of two features of a stimulus and then respond with an associated eye movement along one of two different response axes. By modeling behavior we found the animals learned the axis of response using fast inference (rule switching) while continuously re-estimating the stimulus-response associations within an axis (rule learning). Our results shed light on the computational interactions between rule switching and rule learning, and make testable neural predictions for these interactions.

	<p>Nervous system involvement in patients with SLE, termed neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE), constitutes a diagnostic challenge, and its management is still poorly optimised. This review summarises recent insights over the past decade in laboratory biomarkers of diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis of NPSLE. An initial systematic search in the Medline and Web of Science was conducted to guide the selection of articles. Emerging diagnostic biomarkers in NPSLE that displayed satisfactory ability to discriminate between NPSLE and controls include serum interleukin (IL)-6, microRNA (miR)-23a, miR-155, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) &amp;amp;alpha;-Klotho. CSF lipocalin-2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and immunoglobulin (Ig)M also displayed such ability in two ethnically diverse cohorts. Serum interferon (IFN)-&amp;amp;alpha; and neuron specific enolase (NSE) were recently reported to moderately correlate with disease activity in patients with active NPSLE. CSF IL-8, IL-13, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) exhibited excellent sensitivity, yet poorer specificity, as predictors of response to therapy in patients with NPSLE. The overall lack of validation studies across multiple and diverse cohorts necessitates further and well-concerted investigations. Nevertheless, we propound CSF lipocalin 2 among molecules that hold promise as reliable diagnostic biomarkers in NPSLE.</p>

	<p>Gelsemine is an active principle and a major alkaloid found in Gelsemium genus of plants belonging to the Loganiaceae family. The aim of the present study was to explore whether gelsemine exerts anxiolytic effects on a mouse model of chronic-unpredictable-mild-stress (CUMS)-induced anxiety-like behaviors. NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, downregulated cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were also evaluated as potential mechanisms. First, gelsemine reversed a CUMS-induced decrease in body-weight gain in mice. Next, gelsemine alleviated CUMS-induced anxiety-like behaviors, as evidenced by the increased distance traveled in the central zone of the open-field test, both the increased percentage of time spent and distance traveled in the light compartment, the increased number of transitions between compartments in the light/dark-transition test, and the increased percentage of entries and time spent in the open arm of the elevated plus-maze. In addition, gelsemine decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1&amp;amp;beta; and IL-6, in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of CUMS mice. Interestingly, further investigations revealed that gelsemine inhibited the CUMS-induced activation of NLRP3-inflammasome pathways and downregulated CREB and BDNF overexpression in the hypothalamus. In summary, gelsemine alleviated anxiety-like behaviors in the CUMS-induced mouse model. Gelsemine exerted its anxiolytic effects by modulating the NLRP3 and CREB/BDNF pathways.</p>

	<p>Ever since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus-induced disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has become an enigma of sorts with ever expanding reports of direct and indirect effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on almost all the vital organ systems. Along with inciting acute pulmonary complications, the virus attacks the cardiac, renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal systems as well as the central nervous system (CNS). The person-to-person variability in susceptibility of individuals to disease severity still remains a puzzle, although the comorbidities and the age/gender of a person are believed to play a key role. SARS-CoV-2 needs angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for its infectivity, and the association between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 leads to a decline in ACE2 activity and its neuroprotective effects. Acute respiratory distress may also induce hypoxia, leading to increased oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Infection of the neurons along with peripheral leukocytes&amp;amp;rsquo; activation results in proinflammatory cytokine release, rendering the brain more susceptible to neurodegenerative changes. Due to the advancement in molecular biology techniques and vaccine development programs, the world now has hope to relatively quickly study and combat the deadly virus. On the other side, however, the virus seems to be still evolving with new variants being discovered periodically. In keeping up with the pace of this virus, there has been an avalanche of studies. This review provides an update on the recent progress in adjudicating the CNS-related mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential to incite or accelerate neurodegeneration in surviving patients. Current as well as emerging therapeutic opportunities and biomarker development are highlighted.</p>

	<p>Mephedrone belongs to the &amp;amp;ldquo;party drugs&amp;amp;rdquo; thanks to its psychostimulant effects, similar to the ones observed after amphetamines. Though mephedrone is used worldwide by humans and in laboratory animals, not all properties of this drug have been discovered yet. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to expand the knowledge about mephedrone&amp;amp;rsquo;s activity in living organisms. A set of behavioral tests (i.e., measurement of the spontaneous locomotor activity, rotarod, chimney, elevated plus maze with its modification, novel object recognition, and pentylenetetrazol seizure tests) were carried out in male albino Swiss mice. Different dose ranges of mephedrone (0.05&amp;amp;ndash;5 mg/kg) were administered. We demonstrated that mephedrone at a dose of 5 mg/kg rapidly increased the spontaneous locomotor activity of the tested mice and its repeated administration led to the development of tolerance to these effects. Mephedrone showed the anxiolytic-like potential and improved spatial memory, but it did not affect recognition memory. Moreover, the drug seemed not to have any anticonvulsant or proconvulsant activity. In conclusion, mephedrone induces many central effects. It easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and peaks in the brain quickly after exposure. Our experiment on inducing a hyperlocomotion effect showed that mephedrone&amp;amp;lsquo;s effects are transient and lasted for a relatively short time.</p>

	<p>Asian Americans are disproportionately affected by chronic hepatitis B (CHB), with incidence and mortality rates well above those experienced by non-Hispanic white populations. The goal of this study was to examine the association between depression and modifiable lifestyle behaviors among Asian Americans with CHB, with a comparison between those on hepatitis medication and those not on medication. In total, 313 Asian Americans with CHB were recruited through outpatient clinics and community-based organizations to participate in an in-person baseline assessment. We collected data on participants&amp;amp;rsquo; sociodemographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, depression symptoms, and modifiable lifestyle behaviors. Bivariate analyses (two sample t-test and chi-square test of independence) and multivariable logistic regression were conducted. We found a high prevalence of depression among individuals living with CHB (41.81% among those not on antiviral medication and 39.71% among those on medication). Multivariate logistic regression results showed that Chinese ethnicity (vs. Vietnamese) and lack of physical activity were significantly associated with a higher risk of mild/severe depression, regardless of medication status. However, the protective effect of physical activity was strong for those on antiviral medication. Furthermore, being employed was significantly associated with a lower risk for depression among Asian Americans on medication, while younger age and being currently married were significantly associated with lower risk of depression among those not on medication. Our findings highlight the significance of physical activity among Asian Americans with CHB, especially for those on antiviral medication. Future prospective research efforts are needed to better identify the potential behavioral mechanisms of depression and provide insights for the psychopharmacological management in this vulnerable population.</p>

	<p>Background: Gray matter (GM) density and cortical thickness (CT) obtained from structural magnetic resonance imaging are representative GM morphological measures that have been commonly used in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) subtype research. However, how the two measures affect the definition of AD subtypes remains unclear. Methods: A total of 180 AD patients from the ADNI database were used to identify AD subgroups. The subtypes were identified via a data-driven strategy based on the density features and CT features, respectively. Then, the similarity between the two features in AD subtype definition was analyzed. Results: Four distinct subtypes were discovered by both density and CT features: diffuse atrophy AD, minimal atrophy AD (MAD), left temporal dominant atrophy AD (LTAD), and occipital sparing AD. The matched subtypes exhibited relatively high similarity in atrophy patterns and neuropsychological and neuropathological characteristics. They differed only in MAD and LTAD regarding the carrying of apolipoprotein E &amp;amp;epsilon;2. Conclusions: The results verified that different representative morphological GM measurement methods could produce similar AD subtypes. Meanwhile, the influences of apolipoprotein E genotype, asymmetric disease progression, and their interactions should be considered and included in the AD subtype definition. This study provides a valuable reference for selecting features in future studies of AD subtypes.</p>

	<p>Motor imagery (MI) refers to the mental rehearsal of movement in the absence of overt motor action, which can activate or inhibit cortical excitability. EEG mu/beta oscillations recorded over the human motor cortex have been shown to be consistently suppressed during both the imagination and performance of movements, although the specific effect on brain function remains to be confirmed. In this study, Granger causality (GC) was used to construct the brain functional network of subjects during motor imagery and resting state based on EEG in order to explore the effects of motor imagery on brain function. Parameters of the brain functional network were compared and analyzed, including degree, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and global efficiency of EEG mu/beta rhythm in different states. The results showed that the clustering coefficient and efficiency of EEG mu/beta rhythm decreased significantly during motor imagery (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), while degree distribution and characteristic path length increased significantly (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), mainly concentrated in the frontal lobe and sensorimotor area. For the resting state after motor imagery, the changes of brain functional characteristics were roughly similar to those of the task state. Therefore, it is concluded that motor imagery plays an important role in activation of cortical excitability.</p>

	<p>We aimed to search whether neurological symptoms or signs (NSS) and the MEWS (Modified Early Warning Score) score were associated with in-hospital mortality or oxygen requirement during the first 14 days of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients recruited at the University Hospital in Krakow, Poland. The detailed clinical questionnaires on twenty NSS were either filled out by patients prospectively or retrospectively assessed by neurologists based on daily medical records. NSS were considered high or low-risk if they were associated with increased or decreased mortality in the univariable analysis. This cohort study included 349 patients with COVID-19 (median age 64, interquartile range (51&amp;amp;ndash;77), women 54.72%). The presence of high-risk NSS (decreased level of consciousness, delirium, seizures, and symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack) or its combination with the absence of low-risk NSS (headache, dizziness, decreased mood, and fatigue) increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection 3.13 and 7.67-fold, respectively. The presence of low-risk NSS decreased the risk of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients more than 6-fold. Death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, apart from NSS, was predicted by older age, neoplasm, and higher MEWS scores on admission. High-risk NSS or their combination with the absence of low-risk NSS increased the risk of oxygen requirement during hospitalization in COVID-19 patients 4.48 and 1.86-fold, respectively. Independent predictors of oxygen therapy during hospitalization in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were also older age, male sex, neoplasm, and higher MEWS score on admission.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The propensity to sign-track is associated with externalizing behaviour and distinct patterns of reward-related brain activation in youth</a></h4>

              
                Externalizing behaviours in childhood often predict impulse control disorders in adulthood; however, the underlying biobehavioural risk factors are incompletely understood. In animals, the propensity to sign-track, or the degree to which incentive motivational value is attributed to reward cues, is associated with externalizing-type behaviours and deficits in executive control. Using a Pavlovian conditioned approach paradigm, we quantified sign-tracking in healthy 9-12-year-olds. We also measured parent-reported externalizing behaviours and anticipatory neural activations to outcome-predicting cues using the monetary incentive delay fMRI task. Sign-tracking was associated with attentional and inhibitory control deficits and the degree of amygdala, but not cortical, activation during reward anticipation. These findings support the hypothesis that youth with a propensity to sign-track are prone to externalizing tendencies, with an over-reliance on subcortical cue-reactive brain systems. This research highlights sign-tracking as a promising experimental approach delineating the behavioural and neural circuitry of individuals at risk for externalizing disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nonlinear super-resolution signal processing for subcellular analysis of calcium dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Optical (fluorescence) imaging of ionic dynamics has revolutionized neuroscience as it allows the study of neural activity across spatially identified populations. Quantification of fluorescence signals is commonly performed using ratiometric measures, like the {Delta}F/F. Although these measures are robust and easy to implement, they do not take advantage of the temporal information available in time-varying signals. Moreover, since a baseline (reference) period needs to be selected, their application is often limited to the quantification of stimulus-evoked activity. Here, we present a new approach, called ARES, based on the quantification of residuals after linear autoregression. We demonstrate the utility of ARES to quantify the functional dynamics of stimulus representation in cortical networks and show that it improves the spatial and temporal resolution with respect to {Delta}F/F. We further show that ARES can be used to study subcellular calcium dynamics and exemplify its utility to describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcium signal localization in compartmental network recordings. ARES offers a novel method for quantitative analysis of optical imaging data

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GABABR agonist baclofen promotes central nervous system remyelination</a></h4>

              
                Promoting remyelination - the endogenous response by which lost myelin sheaths are regenerated - is considered as a potential neuroprotective strategy to prevent/limit the development of permanent neurological disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). To this end, a number of clinical trials are investigating the potential of existing drugs to enhance oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation, the process that fails in chronic MS lesions. As we previously reported that oligodendroglia lineage cells express GABAB receptors (GABABRs) both in vitro and in vivo, and that GABABR-mediated signaling enhances OPC differentiation and myelination in vitro, here we focused on the remyelinating potential of the best-known GABABR agonist baclofen (Bac), already approved to treat spasticity in MS. We demonstrated that Bac increases myelin protein production following lysolecithin (LPC)-induced demyelination in cerebellar ex vivo slices. In addition, Bac administration enhanced OPC differentiation and remyelination in LPC-induced spinal cord lesions in adult mice. Thus, our results suggest that Bac should be considered as a potential therapeutic agent, not only to treat spasticity, but also to improve remyelination in patients with MS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Categorization and discrimination of human and non-human primate affective vocalizations: investigation of the frontal cortex activity through fNIRS.</a></h4>

              
                Many species, including humans and non-human primates, react differently to threatening or pleasant situations. Because of its adaptiveness, recognizing affective signals is likely to be reflected in a capability of modern humans to recognize other closely related species call content. However, at both behavioural and neural levels, only few studies have used a comparative approach to understand affective decoding processes in humans, particularly with respect to affective vocalizations. Previous research in neuroscience about the recognition of human affective vocalizations has shown the critical involvement of temporal and frontal regions. In particular, frontal regions have been reported as crucial in the explicit decoding of vocal emotions especially in different task complexity such as discrimination or categorization. The aim of this study using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was to specifically investigate the neural activity of the inferior frontal cortex pars triangularis (IFGtri) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlying categorization (A versus B) and discrimination (A versus non-A) mechanisms of positive and negative affects in human, great apes (chimpanzee and bonobo), and monkey (rhesus macaque) vocalizations. We also analysed participants behavioural responses and correlated them with the recorded frontal activations. While performing the tasks, fNIRS data revealed a clear distinction between the two frontal regions, with a general positive activation of IFGtri compared to a decrease of PFC activity. We also found a modulation of IFGtri and PFC activations depending on both the species considered and on task complexity; with generally more activity in the IFGtri during discrimination compared to categorization, and a more intense decrease of the PFC in categorization compared to discrimination. Behaviourally, participants recognized almost all affective cues in all species vocalizations at above chance levels in the discrimination task (except for threatening bonobo calls). For categorization, they mostly correctly identified at levels significantly above chance affective contents in human and great ape vocalizations but not in macaque calls. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis of a pre-human origin of affective recognition processing inherited from our common ancestor with other great apes and processed in the frontal cortex. Our results also highlight behavioural differences related to task complexity, i.e. between categorization and discrimination processes, and the differential involvement of the PFC and the IFGtri, which seems necessary to explicitly decode affects in all primate vocalizations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning the Vector Coding of Egocentric Boundary Cells from Visual Data</a></h4>

              
                The use of spatial maps to navigate through the world requires a complex ongoing transformation of egocentric views of the environment into position within the allocentric map. Recent research has discovered neurons in retrosplenial cortex and other structures that could mediate the transformation from egocentric views to allocentric views. These egocentric boundary cells (EBCs) respond to the egocentric direction and distance of barriers relative to an animals point of view. This egocentric coding based on the visual features of barriers would seem to require complex dynamics of cortical interactions. However, computational models presented here show that egocentric boundary cells can be generated with a remarkably simple synaptic learning rule that forms a sparse representation of visual input as an animal explores the environment. Simulation of this simple sparse synaptic modification generates a population of egocentric boundary cells with distributions of direction and distance coding that strikingly resemble those observed within the retrosplenial cortex. This provides a framework for understanding the properties of neuronal populations in the retrosplenial cortex that may be essential for interfacing egocentric sensory information with allocentric spatial maps of the world formed by neurons in downstream areas including the grid cells in entorhinal cortex and place cells in the hippocampus.

                The representation of the surrounding world emerges through integration of sensory information and actions. We present a novel neural model which implements non-local, parallel information processing on a neocolumnar architecture with lateral interconnections. Information is integrated into a holographic wave interference pattern. We compare the simulated in silico pattern with observed in vivo invasive and non-invasive electrophysiological data in human and non-human primates. Our model replicates the modulation of neural high-frequency activity during visual perception showing that phase-locked low and high-frequency oscillations self-organize efficiently and carry high information content. The simulation further models how criticality (high content) of information processing emerges given a sufficiently high number of correlated neurons. Non-local information processing, forming one holographic wave pattern, suggests a platform for emergence of conscious perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circadian volume changes in hippocampal glia studied by label-free interferometric imaging</a></h4>

              
                Complex brain functions, including learning and memory, arise in part from the modulatory role of astrocytes on neuronal circuits. Functionally, the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits differences in the acquisition of long-term potentiation (LTP) between day and night. We hypothesize that the dynamic nature of astrocyte morphology plays an important role in the functional circuitry of hippocampal learning and memory, specifically in the DG. Standard microscopy techniques, such as differential interference contrast (DIC), present insufficient contrast for detecting changes in astrocyte structure and function and are unable to inform on the intrinsic structure of the sample in a quantitative manner. Recently, gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM) has been developed to upgrade a DIC microscope with quantitative capabilities such as single-cell dry mass and volume characterization. Here, we present a methodology for combining GLIM and electrophysiology to quantify the astrocyte morphological behavior over the day-night cycle. Co-localized measurements of GLIM and fluorescence allowed us to quantify the dry masses and volumes of hundreds of astrocytes. Our results indicate that, on average, there is a 25% cell volume reduction during the nocturnal cycle. Remarkably, this cell volume change takes place at constant dry mass, which suggests that the volume regulation occurs primarily through aqueous medium exchange with the environment.

                Animals live in highly dynamic worlds, utilising sensorimotor circuits to rapidly process information and drive behaviours. For example, dragonflies are aerial predators which react to movements of prey within tens of milliseconds. These pursuits are likely controlled by identified neurons in the dragonfly, which have well-characterized physiological responses to moving targets. Predominantly, neural activity in these circuits are interpreted in the context of a rate code, where information is conveyed by changes in the number of spikes over a given time. However, such a description of neuronal activity is difficult to achieve in real-world, real-time scenarios. Here, we contrast a neuroscientists post-hoc view of spiking activity with the information available to the animal in real-time. We describe how performance of a rate code is readily overestimated and outline a rate codes significant limitations in driving rapid behaviours.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons accompanied by the accumulation of the morphologically and functionally altered glial cells. Reactive astrocytes and microglia secrete pro-inflammatory mediators and contribute to disease progression. Notably, oligodendrocyte functions are disrupted in ALS, including trophic support, myelination, and oligodendrocyte differentiation. ALS patients and mutant SOD1 mice models display reduced levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) contributing to impairment of oligodendrocyte function. Lactate, an active metabolite capable of moving into or out of cells, acts as a signaling molecule, transported exclusively by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) .We showed previously, that AMD3100 increases the lactate transporter MCT1 in an animal models of Alzheimers disease (AD) and ALS. AMD3100 is a reversible antagonist of CXCR4, and therefore inhibits the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. AMD3100 was shown to have beneficial effects on extension of SOD1G93A mice life-span and enabling migration of hematopoietic stem cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow to periphery. The low content of lactate and transporters in SOD1G93A mice model led us to propose a novel combined treatment with AMD3100 and exogeneous L-lactate. The combined treatment attenuated neuroinflammation and remyelination but did not have a significant extension of SOD1G93A mice life-span compared with AMD3100 treatment alone.

	<p>One growing area of multitasking research involves a focus on performing cognitive and motor tasks in tandem. In these situations, increasing either cognitive or motor demands has implications for performance in both tasks, an effect which is thought to be due to competing neural resources. Separate research suggests that non-invasive brain stimulation may offer a means to mitigate performance decrements experienced during multitasking. In the present study, we investigated the degree to which a commercially available non-invasive brain stimulation device (Halo Sport) alters balance performance in the presence of different types of cognitive demands. Specifically, we tested if performing a secondary cognitive task impacts postural sway in healthy young adults and if we could mitigate this impact using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the primary motor cortex. Furthermore, we included conditions of unstable and stable surfaces and found that lower surface stability increased postural sway. In addition, we found that cognitive load impacted postural sway but in the opposite pattern we had anticipated, with higher sway found in the single-task control condition compared to executive function conditions. Finally, we found a small but significant effect of tDCS on balance with decreased sway for active (compared to sham) tDCS.</p>

	<p>Number sense is the ability to estimate the number of items, and it is common to many species. Despite the numerous studies dedicated to unveiling how numerosity is processed in the human brain, to date, it is not clear whether the representation of numerosity is supported by a single general mechanism or by multiple mechanisms. Since it is known that deafness entails a selective impairment in the processing of temporal information, we assessed the approximate numerical abilities of deaf individuals to disentangle these two hypotheses. We used a numerosity discrimination task (2AFC) and an estimation task, in both cases using sequential (temporal) or simultaneous (spatial) stimuli. The results showed a selective impairment of the deaf participants compared with the controls (hearing) in the temporal numerosity discrimination task, while no difference was found to discriminate spatial numerosity. Interestingly, the deaf and hearing participants did not differ in spatial or temporal numerosity estimation. Overall, our results suggest that the deficit in temporal processing induced by deafness also impacts perception in other domains such as numerosity, where sensory information is conveyed in a temporal format, which further suggests the existence of separate mechanisms subserving the processing of temporal and spatial numerosity.</p>

	<p>The study of the contribution of spatial transformation skills to driving behavior is a research topic substantiated by scarce evidence. In previous studies, we found that mental rotation and perspective-taking skills have an influence on performance in driving tasks by conveying the distal effects of the general cognitive efficiency on the execution of driving maneuvers. Studies have provided evidence on the relevance of the cognitive processes of encoding, imagined rotation, and spatial orientation in the accuracy of both the vehicle management during stressful driving situations and the acquisition of visual information on the traffic scenario. Results can find applications in both the training and the assessment of fitness to drive, as well as in the study of interaction between the drivers and in-vehicle devices. The lack of cross-validations in path analysis models cannot be assumed, a priori, to be capitalizing on chance and as an example of bad science. The non-replicability of a study should be demonstrated before it is proclaimed. The purpose of this reply was to address the questions raised by Kelly et al. (2022)&amp;amp;mdash;that is, &amp;amp;ldquo;Do these results seem replicable?&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;How do these results advance our understanding of brain function and/or human behavior?&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;mdash;by providing additional information on the study in question.</p>

	<p>Acute aerobic high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) has demonstrated positive effects on inhibitory control and P3 event-related potential (ERP) in young adults. However, the evidence is not well established regarding the effects of different HIIE modalities that incorporate aerobic-resistance training on these cognitive and neurocognitive outcomes. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the transient effects of HIIE-aerobic and HIIE-aerobic/resistance on P3 and Flanker task performance. Participants (n = 24; 18&amp;amp;ndash;25 years old) completed the Flanker task at two time points (30 min and 85 min) following 9 min of HIIE-aerobic (intermittent bouts of walking and running at 90% of maximal heart rate), HIIE-aerobic/resistance (intermittent bouts of walking and high-intensity calisthenics), and seated rest on three separate counterbalanced days. Results revealed no changes in Flanker performance (i.e., reaction time and response accuracy) or P3 (latency and mean amplitude) following either HIIE conditions compared to seated rest. Together, these data suggest inhibitory control and neuroelectric underpinnings are not affected by different modalities of HIIE at 30 min and 85 min post-exercise. Such findings reveal that engaging in short bouts of different HIIE modalities for overall health neither improves nor diminishes inhibitory control and brain function for an extended period throughout the day.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive deficits are common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and affect patients at all stages of the disease, regardless of phenotype. Aims: This literature review focuses the cognitive deficits observed in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). It is mainly based on studies that compared the frequency and main characteristics of cognitive deficits in SPMS with other phenotypes. Methods: A bibliographic search was carried out using the PubMed database with the following keywords: multiple sclerosis, secondary-progressive, cognition. Results: Thirteen studies were initially selected that were published in English, reporting the neuropsychological data of a sample of at least 30 patients with SPMS, comparing them with patients with other phenotypes. Studies suggest that there is an association between the duration of the disease and the frequency and extent of the cognitive disorders. Studies also showed that the SP form is associated with an increased frequency of cognitive impairment and with an increased severity as compared to relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Compared to RRMS, progressive forms of MS are associated with more severe impairment in certain cognitive areas, such as episodic verbal memory, information processing speed, working memory, or verbal fluency. Two studies showed that cognitive performances decline overtime in SPMS. Conclusion: Cognitive disorders are more frequent and more severe in the SP form than in relapsing course of MS. The profile of cognitive impairment encountered in the SP form also appears to be different from those found in the other phenotypes.</p>

	<p>Early life trauma has a negative impact on the developing brain, and this can lead to a wide range of mental illnesses later in life. Childhood trauma is associated with increased psychotic symptoms and negative emotions such as depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in adulthood. Childhood trauma has also been shown to influence sub-clinical &amp;amp;lsquo;schizotypy&amp;amp;rsquo; characteristics of psychosis in the general population. As it has been reported that mental health outcomes after early life trauma exposure are influenced by gender, the current study aimed to investigate the gender differences in the relationship between childhood trauma, schizotypy and negative emotions. Sixty-one non-clinical participants (33 men and 28 women) aged between 18 and 45 completed self-report questionnaires to measure early life trauma, schizotypy and negative emotions. Despite similar levels of childhood trauma in men and women, early life trauma in women was associated with increased schizotypy personality characteristics (Cognitive Disorganisation) and increased depression, anxiety and stress later in life, but no correlations were observed in men. Our findings suggest that the sociocultural and biological processes affected by early life adversities may differ between the genders. Women may be more vulnerable to the influence of childhood trauma, which may be associated with increased psychopathology later in life.</p>

	<p>Recessive hereditary methemoglobinemia (RHM) due to NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency is a rare disease caused by pathogenic variants in CYB5R3. Unlike type I, in RHM type II (RHM2), the enzymatic defect affects erythrocytes and all body tissues, thus resulting in cyanosis and neurological impairment. Although the first description of RHM2 dates back to the mid-1950s, detailed clinical and neuroimaging information are available for only a few patients. Here, we describe a new patient with RHM2 that harbors an unreported homozygous 31 Kb deletion involving part of CYB5R3, and showing a peculiar neuroimaging pattern resembling a ponto-cerebellar hypoplasia-like condition. A careful review of the available literature was performed with the aim of better delineating neurological and neuroimaging as well as the genotypic spectra of this extremely rare disease.</p>

	<p>Prominent cortical vessels on susceptibility-weighted imaging (PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI) correlate with poor leptomeningeal collaterals. However, little is known about PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI in recanalization therapy-treated patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions (LVO). We investigated PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI-based assessment of leptomeningeal collaterals and outcome predictions in 100 such patients in an observational study. We assessed PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score and evaluated leptomeningeal collaterals on multiphase CT angiography (mCTA). Predictive abilities were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression and area of receiver operating curves (AUCs). The extent of PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI correlated with leptomeningeal collaterals on mCTA (Spearman test, r = 0.77; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); their presence was associated with worse functional outcomes and a lower successful recanalization rate (adjusted odds ratios = 0.24 and 0.23, 95% CIs = 0.08&amp;amp;ndash;0.65 and 0.08&amp;amp;ndash;0.65, respectively). The presence of PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI predicted outcomes better than good collaterals on mCTA did (C-statistic = 0.84 vs. 0.80; 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0&amp;amp;ndash;2 = 0.75 vs. 0.67 for successful recanalization). Comparison of AUCs showed that they had similar abilities for predicting outcomes (p = 0.68 for 3-month mRS 0&amp;amp;ndash;2; p = 0.23 for successful recanalization). These results suggest that PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI is a useful feature for assessing leptomeningeal collaterals in acute ischemic stroke patients with anterior circulation LVO and predicting outcomes after recanalization therapy.</p>

	<p>Background: Emerging molecular and genetic biomarkers have been introduced to classify gliomas in the past decades. Here, we introduced a risk signature based on the cellular response to the IL-4 gene set through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis. Methods: In this study, we provide a bioinformatic profiling of our risk signature for the malignancy, prognosis and immune phenotype of glioma. A cohort of 325 patients with whole genome RNA-seq expression data from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) dataset was used as the training set, while another cohort of 667 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was used as the validating set. The LASSO model identified a 10-gene signature which was considered as the optimal model. Results: The signature was confirmed to be a good predictor of clinical and molecular features involved in the malignancy of gliomas. We also identified that our risk signature could serve as an independently prognostic biomarker in patients with gliomas (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Correlation analysis showed that our risk signature was strongly correlated with the Tregs, M0 macrophages and NK cells infiltrated in the microenvironment of glioma, which might be a supplement to the existing incomplete innate immune mechanism of glioma phenotypes. Conclusions: Our IL-4-related gene signature was associated with more aggressive and immunosuppressive phenotypes of gliomas. The risk score could predict prognosis independently in glioma, which might provide a new insight for understanding the IL-4 involved mechanism of gliomas.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Humans rely on precise proprioceptive feedback from our muscles, which is important in both the acquisition and execution of movements, to perform daily activities. Somatosensory input from the body shapes motor learning through central processes, as demonstrated for tasks using the arm, under active (self-generated) and passive conditions. Presently, we investigated whether passive movement training of the ankle increased proprioceptive acuity (psychophysical experiment) and whether it changed the peripheral proprioceptive afferent signal (microneurography experiment). In the psychophysical experiment, the ankle of 32 healthy human participants was moved passively using pairs of ramp-and-hold movements in different directions. In a pretraining test, participants made judgements about the movement direction in a two-alternative forced choice paradigm. Participants then underwent passive movement training, but only half were cued for learning, where a reference position was signaled by a sound and the participant had to learn to recognize this position; they then completed a post-training test. In a paradigm using the same setup, nine healthy participants underwent microneurography recordings of Ia muscle afferents from the peroneal nerve, where all were cued during training. In the psychophysical experiment, proprioceptive acuity improved with training only in the cued group. In the microneurography experiment, we found that muscle afferent firing was modulated, via an increase in the dynamic index, after training. We suggest that changes in muscle afferent input from the periphery can contribute to and support central perceptual and motor learning, as shown under passive conditions using ankle movements, which may be exploited for movement rehabilitation.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Exposure of the fetus to alcohol (ethanol) via maternal consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), hallmarked by long-term physical, behavioral, and intellectual abnormalities. In our preclinical mouse model of FASD, prenatal ethanol exposure disrupts tangential migration of corticopetal GABAergic interneurons (GINs) in the embryonic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We postulated that ethanol perturbed the normal pattern of tangential migration via enhancing GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated membrane depolarization that prevails during embryonic development in GABAergic cortical interneurons. However, beyond this, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is incomplete. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the ethanol-enhanced depolarization triggers downstream an increase in high-voltage-activated nifedipine-sensitive L-type calcium channel (LTCC) activity and provide evidence implicating calcium dynamics in the signaling scheme underlying the migration of embryonic GINs and its aberrance. Tangentially migrating Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> GINs expressed immunoreactivity to Cav1.2, the canonical neuronal isoform of the L-type calcium channel. Prenatal ethanol exposure did not alter its protein expression profile in the embryonic mPFC. However, exposing ethanol concomitantly with the LTCC blocker nifedipine prevented the ethanol-induced aberrant migration both <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. In addition, whole-cell patch clamp recording of LTCCs in GINs migrating in embryonic mPFC slices revealed that acutely applied ethanol potentiated LTCC activity in migrating GINs. Based on evidence reported in the present study, we conclude that calcium is an important intracellular intermediary downstream of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated depolarization in the mechanistic scheme of an ethanol-induced aberrant tangential migration of embryonic GABAergic cortical interneurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Applications of GIS and geospatial analyses in COVID-19 research: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Geographic information science (GIS) has established itself as a distinct domain and incredibly useful whenever the research is related to geography, space, and other spatio-temporal dimensions. However, the scientific landscape on the integration of GIS in COVID-related studies is largely unknown. In this systematic review, we assessed the current evidence on the implementation of GIS and other geospatial tools in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We systematically retrieved and reviewed 79 research articles that either directly used GIS or other geospatial tools as part of their analysis. We grouped the identified papers under six broader thematic groups based on the objectives and research questions of the study- environmental, socio-economic, and cultural, public health, spatial transmission, computer-aided modeling, and data mining. Results: The interdisciplinary nature of how geographic and spatial analysis was used in COVID-19 research was notable among the reviewed papers. Geospatial techniques, especially WebGIS, have even been widely used to visualize the data on a map and were critical to informing the public regarding the spread of the virus, especially during the early days of the pandemic. This review not only provided an overarching view on how GIS has been used in COVID-19 research so far but also concluded that geospatial analysis and technologies could be used in future public health emergencies along with statistical and other socio-economic modeling techniques. Our review also highlighted how scientific communities and policymakers could leverage GIS to extract useful information to make an informed decision in the future. Conclusions:  Despite the limited applications of GIS in identifying the nature and spatio-temporal pattern of this raging pandemic, there are opportunities to utilize these techniques in handling the pandemic. The use of spatial analysis and GIS could significantly improve how we understand the pandemic as well as address the underserviced demographic groups and communities.

                Background: Research Software is a concept that has been only recently clarified. In this paper we address the need for a similar enlightenment concerning the Research Data concept. Methods: Our contribution begins by reviewing the Research Software definition, which includes the analysis of software as a legal concept, followed by the study of its production in the research environment and within the Open Science framework. Then we explore the challenges of a data definition and some of the Research Data definitions proposed in the literature. Results: We propose a Research Data concept featuring three characteristics: the data should be produced (collected, processed, analyzed, shared & disseminated) to answer a scientific question, by a scientific team, and has yield a result published or disseminated in some article or scientific contribution of any kind. Conclusions: The analysis of this definition and the context in which it is proposed provides some answers to the Borgman’s conundrum challenges, that is, which Research Data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what conditions, why, and to what effects. They are completed with answers to the questions: how? and where?

                Background: Open Science seeks to render research outputs visible, accessible and reusable. In this context, Research Data and Research Software sharing and dissemination issues provide real challenges to the scientific community, as consequence of recent progress in political, legal and funding requirements. Methods: We take advantage from the approach we have developed in a precedent publication, in which we have highlighted the similarities between the Research Data and Research Software definitions. Results: The similarities between Research Data and Research Software definitions can be extended to propose protocols for Research Data dissemination and evaluation derived from those already proposed for Research Software dissemination and evaluation. We also analyze FAIR principles for these outputs. Conclusions: Our proposals here provide concrete instructions for Research Data and Research Software producers to make them more findable and accessible, as well as arguments to choose suitable dissemination platforms to complete the FAIR framework. Future work could analyze the potential extension of this parallelism to other kinds of research outputs that are disseminated under similar conditions to those of Research Data and Research Software, that is, without widely accepted publication procedures involving editors or other external actors and where the dissemination is usually restricted through the hands of the production team.

                Background: Investigating the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) associated with maternal health is important since OOPE directly affects the affordability of health services. Global evidence suggests the importance of capturing the productivity cost during pregnancy in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism. Furthermore, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the household economy needs to be further evaluated as pregnant women are one of the most vulnerable groups. This study aims at determining the economic burden of OOPE, productivity cost, and COVID-19 impact on pregnant women's household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka. Methods: The study setting is all 22 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. The study has three components; a follow-up study of a cohort of pregnant women to assess the magnitude and associated factors of OOPE and to assess the productivity cost (Component 1), a qualitative case study to explore the impact and causes of the OOPE under free health services (Component 2) and a cross-sectional study to describe the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on household economy (Component 3). The study samples consist of 1,393 and 1,460 participants for components one and three, respectively, and 25 pregnant women will be recruited for component two. The data will be analyzed using descriptive, parametric, and non-parametric statistics for the first and third components and thematic analysis for the second component. Discussion: With the lack of evidence on OOPE, productivity loss/cost in terms of maternal health, and COVID-19 impact on household economy in Sri Lanka, the evidence generated from this study would be valuable for policymakers, health care administrators, and health care practitioners globally, regionally, and locally to plan for future measures for reducing the OOPE, productivity loss/cost, and minimizing the economic hardship of the COVID-19 outbreak during pregnancy.

                Background: The overall objective of any health professional curriculum is to ensure that the knowledge, skills and attitudes of the students are influenced by the curriculum and to instil these attributes into the students, to help them become capable, compassionate and inquisitive health professionals. Therefore, there is the need for medical educators to align their learning objectives with the core competencies needed to achieve this. Currently, in interprofessional education, it is not always clear which activities may be used to facilitate the development of interprofessional core competencies. However, if health professional students are exposed to the interprofessional core competencies effectively, it may result in health  care professionals who have an improved understanding of interprofessional practices, thus improving these practices within their specific professions. The objective of this study was to identify teaching strategies and activities that aim to develop interprofessional competencies in undergraduate health care students at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa. Methods: In this study the Delphi method was used to reach a consensus on the most appropriate activities and assessment methods to use in an interprofessional curriculum that would assist in instilling interprofessional core competencies in undergraduate health care students. Results: 19 experts out of 69 invited participants took part in this Delphi study. The activities highlighted were case studies, joint clinical placements, simulations, role plays and workshops/discussions. The assessment forms highlighted by participants were portfolios, reflection and rubrics. Conclusion: It was evident from this study that such activities can be used to instil more than one core competency in undergraduate health care students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge, attitude, and practices associated with avian influenza among undergraduate university students of East Java Indonesia: A cross-sectional survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several public health strategic actions are required for effective avian influenza (AI) prevention and control, as well as the development of a communication plan to keep undergraduate students sufficiently informed on how to avoid or reduce exposure. The aim of the survey was to measure the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) toward AI among undergraduate university students in East Java, Indonesia, and observe the correlation between KAPs and the factors associated with the control and prevention of AI.  Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate students to collect information about AI-related KAPs. Students were selected from three faculties of Universitas Airlangga Surabaya Indonesia (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Fisheries and Marine, and Faculty of Science and Technology). Students voluntarily responded to a pre-designed questionnaire. Results: A total of 425 students (222 female; and 203 male), of ages ranging from 18 years (n=240) to 20-30 years (n=185), responded to the survey. This cohort consisted of 157 students from the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine, 149 from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and 119 from the Faculty of Science and Technology. The results indicated that appropriate knowledge was obtained by 76.94% of students; significantly higher levels were seen in Faculty of Veterinary Medicine students as compared to the other two faculties (p<0.05). 72.89% of students documented positive attitudes; veterinary medicine students had significantly more positive attitudes than other faculties (p<0.05). Proactive behaviors were observed in 56.90% of students. The aggregate scores for KAPs were 6.93 ± 0.77 (range: 0-9) for knowledge, 7.6 ± 1.25 (range: 0-10) for attitude, and 9.1 ± 1.5 (range: 0-12) for practice.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Tailored PRISMA 2020 flow diagrams for living systematic reviews: a methodological survey and a proposal [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While the PRISMA flow diagram is widely used for reporting standard systematic reviews (SRs), it was not designed for capturing the results of continual searches for studies in living systematic reviews (LSRs). The objectives of this study are (1) to assess how published LSRs report on the flow of studies through the different phases of the review for the different updates; (2) to propose an approach to reporting on that flow. Methods: For objective 1, we identified all LSRs published up to April 2021. We abstracted information regarding their general characteristics and how they reported on search results. For objective 2, we based our proposal for tailored PRISMA approaches on the findings from objective 1, as well as on our experience with conducting Cochrane LSRs. Results: We identified 279 living publications relating to 76 LSRs. Of the 279 publications, 11% were protocols, 23% were base versions (i.e., the first version), 50% were partial updates (i.e., does not include all typical sections of an SR), and 16% were full updates (i.e., includes all typical sections of an SR). We identified six ways to reporting the study flow: base separately, each update separately (38%); numbers not reported (32%); latest update separately, all previous versions combined (20%); base separately, all updates combined (7%); latest update version only (3%); all versions combined (0%). We propose recording in detail the results of the searches to keep track of all identified records. For structuring the flow diagram, we propose using one of four approaches. Conclusion: We identified six ways for reporting the study flow through the different phases of the review for the different update versions. We propose to document in detail the study flow for the different search updates and select one of our four tailored PRISMA diagram approaches to present that study flow.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A three-dimensional multiscale model for the prediction of thrombus growth under flow with single-platelet resolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kaushik N. Shankar, Yiyuan Zhang, Talid Sinno, Scott L. Diamond</p>

Modeling thrombus growth in pathological flows allows evaluation of risk under patient-specific pharmacological, hematological, and hemodynamical conditions. We have developed a 3D multiscale framework for the prediction of thrombus growth under flow on a spatially resolved surface presenting collagen and tissue factor (TF). The multiscale framework is composed of four coupled modules: a Neural Network (NN) that accounts for platelet signaling, a Lattice Kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC) simulation for tracking platelet positions, a Finite Volume Method (FVM) simulator for solving convection-diffusion-reaction equations describing agonist release and transport, and a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) flow solver for computing the blood flow field over the growing thrombus. A reduced model of the coagulation cascade was embedded into the framework to account for TF-driven thrombin production. The 3D model was first tested against in vitro microfluidics experiments of whole blood perfusion with various antiplatelet agents targeting COX-1, P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>, or the IP receptor. The model was able to accurately capture the evolution and morphology of the growing thrombus. Certain problems of 2D models for thrombus growth (artifactual dendritic growth) were naturally avoided with realistic trajectories of platelets in 3D flow. The generalizability of the 3D multiscale solver enabled simulations of important clinical situations, such as cylindrical blood vessels and acute flow narrowing (stenosis). Enhanced platelet-platelet bonding at pathologically high shear rates (e.g., von Willebrand factor unfolding) was required for accurately describing thrombus growth in stenotic flows. Overall, the approach allows consideration of patient-specific platelet signaling and vascular geometry for the prediction of thrombotic episodes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling the temporal dynamics of master regulators and CtrA proteolysis in Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chunrui Xu, Layne T. Watson, Henry Hollis, Michelle Dai, Xiangyu Yao, Yang Cao, Minghan Chen</p>

The cell cycle of <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> involves the polar morphogenesis and an asymmetric cell division driven by precise interactions and regulations of proteins, which makes <i>Caulobacter</i> an ideal model organism for investigating bacterial cell development and differentiation. The abundance of molecular data accumulated on <i>Caulobacter</i> motivates system biologists to analyze the complex regulatory network of cell cycle via quantitative modeling. In this paper, We propose a comprehensive model to accurately characterize the underlying mechanisms of cell cycle regulation based on the study of: a) chromosome replication and methylation; b) interactive pathways of five master regulatory proteins including DnaA, GcrA, CcrM, CtrA, and SciP, as well as novel consideration of their corresponding mRNAs; c) cell cycle-dependent proteolysis of CtrA through hierarchical protease complexes. The temporal dynamics of our simulation results are able to closely replicate an extensive set of experimental observations and capture the main phenotype of seven mutant strains of <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. Collectively, the proposed model can be used to predict phenotypes of other mutant cases, especially for nonviable strains which are hard to cultivate and observe. Moreover, the module of cyclic proteolysis is an efficient tool to study the metabolism of proteins with similar mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Traveling waves in the prefrontal cortex during working memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sayak Bhattacharya, Scott L. Brincat, Mikael Lundqvist, Earl K. Miller</p>

Neural oscillations are evident across cortex but their spatial structure is not well- explored. Are oscillations stationary or do they form “traveling waves”, i.e., spatially organized patterns whose peaks and troughs move sequentially across cortex? Here, we show that oscillations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) organized as traveling waves in the theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (12-30Hz) bands. Some traveling waves were planar but most rotated. The waves were modulated during performance of a working memory task. During baseline conditions, waves flowed bidirectionally along a specific axis of orientation. Waves in different frequency bands could travel in different directions. During task performance, there was an increase in waves in one direction over the other, especially in the beta band.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">From complete cross-docking to partners identification and binding sites predictions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chloé Dequeker, Yasser Mohseni Behbahani, Laurent David, Elodie Laine, Alessandra Carbone</p>

Proteins ensure their biological functions by interacting with each other. Hence, characterising protein interactions is fundamental for our understanding of the cellular machinery, and for improving medicine and bioengineering. Over the past years, a large body of experimental data has been accumulated on who interacts with whom and in what manner. However, these data are highly heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory, noisy, and biased. <i>Ab initio</i> methods provide a means to a “blind” protein-protein interaction network reconstruction. Here, we report on a molecular cross-docking-based approach for the identification of protein partners. The docking algorithm uses a coarse-grained representation of the protein structures and treats them as rigid bodies. We applied the approach to a few hundred of proteins, in the unbound conformations, and we systematically investigated the influence of several key ingredients, such as the size and quality of the interfaces, and the scoring function. We achieved some significant improvement compared to previous works, and a very high discriminative power on some specific functional classes. We provide a readout of the contributions of shape and physico-chemical complementarity, interface matching, and specificity, in the predictions. In addition, we assessed the ability of the approach to account for protein surface multiple usages, and we compared it with a sequence-based deep learning method. This work may contribute to guiding the exploitation of the large amounts of protein structural models now available toward the discovery of unexpected partners and their complex structure characterisation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adhesion-regulated junction slippage controls cell intercalation dynamics in an Apposed-Cortex Adhesion Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Nestor-Bergmann, Guy B. Blanchard, Nathan Hervieux, Alexander G. Fletcher, Jocelyn Étienne, Bénédicte Sanson</p>

Cell intercalation is a key cell behaviour of morphogenesis and wound healing, where local cell neighbour exchanges can cause dramatic tissue deformations such as body axis extension. Substantial experimental work has identified the key molecular players facilitating intercalation, but there remains a lack of consensus and understanding of their physical roles. Existing biophysical models that represent cell-cell contacts with single edges cannot study cell neighbour exchange as a continuous process, where neighbouring cell cortices must uncouple. Here, we develop an Apposed-Cortex Adhesion Model (ACAM) to understand active cell intercalation behaviours in the context of a 2D epithelial tissue. The junctional actomyosin cortex of every cell is modelled as a continuous viscoelastic rope-loop, explicitly representing cortices facing each other at bicellular junctions and the adhesion molecules that couple them. The model parameters relate directly to the properties of the key subcellular players that drive dynamics, providing a multi-scale understanding of cell behaviours. We show that active cell neighbour exchanges can be driven by purely junctional mechanisms. Active contractility and cortical turnover in a single bicellular junction are sufficient to shrink and remove a junction. Next, a new, orthogonal junction extends passively. The ACAM reveals how the turnover of adhesion molecules regulates tension transmission and junction deformation rates by controlling slippage between apposed cell cortices. The model additionally predicts that rosettes, which form when a vertex becomes common to many cells, are more likely to occur in actively intercalating tissues with strong friction from adhesion molecules.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Parametric Copula-GP model for analyzing multidimensional neuronal and behavioral relationships</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nina Kudryashova, Theoklitos Amvrosiadis, Nathalie Dupuy, Nathalie Rochefort, Arno Onken</p>

One of the main goals of current systems neuroscience is to understand how neuronal populations integrate sensory information to inform behavior. However, estimating stimulus or behavioral information that is encoded in high-dimensional neuronal populations is challenging. We propose a method based on parametric copulas which allows modeling joint distributions of neuronal and behavioral variables characterized by different statistics and timescales. To account for temporal or spatial changes in dependencies between variables, we model varying copula parameters by means of Gaussian Processes (GP). We validate the resulting Copula-GP framework on synthetic data and on neuronal and behavioral recordings obtained in awake mice. We show that the use of a parametric description of the high-dimensional dependence structure in our method provides better accuracy in mutual information estimation in higher dimensions compared to other non-parametric methods. Moreover, by quantifying the redundancy between neuronal and behavioral variables, our model exposed the location of the reward zone in an unsupervised manner (i.e., without using any explicit cues about the task structure). These results demonstrate that the Copula-GP framework is particularly useful for the analysis of complex multidimensional relationships between neuronal, sensory and behavioral variables.
