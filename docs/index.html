                <p><i>SCN3B</i> encodes the β3 auxiliary subunit, essential for voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Nav) channel trafficking and gating. Although <i>SCN3B</i> has been associated with cardiac disorders, a link with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) has not been established. Using a genotype-first approach, we identified homozygous truncating variants (c.281G&gt;A-β3<sup>W94*</sup>, c.584 + 1G&gt;A-β3<sup>S196*</sup>) in 2 consanguineous Pakistani families, leading to global developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism, with severe cognitive impairment, ataxia, and seizures in the case of β3<sup>W94*</sup>. Electrophysiological analysis revealed subtype-specific gating alterations on multiple brain Nav channel subtypes. This is the first report linking <i>SCN3B</i> mutations to NDD, expanding our understanding of Nav channelopathies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

">Adjudicating competing theories of semantic representation with 7T-fMRI and multivariate decoding</a></h4>

              
                Theories of semantic representation in the brain are numerous and contradictory and are supported by an equally contradictory literature of multivariate neuroimaging studies. Equipped with two pioneering tools - (1) a 7T-fMRI acquisition sequence capable of capturing signal in crucial ventral temporal regions, and (2) four innovative decoding methods that are designed to probe specific hypotheses about the nature of the semantic code - we resolve this confusion. Evidence best supports the hypothesis that the ventral anterior temporal lobe represents complex, multidimensional semantic information via an interdependent, dynamic code similar to that observed in neural networks. Similar representations - highly variable across individuals - were discovered in posterior temporal and occipitotemporal cortex. In summary, this work adjudicates competing theories of semantic cognition, thereby reconciling the discrepancy in results between multivariate imaging and other sources of evidence - neuropsyschology, noninvasive brain stimulation, intracranial electrophysiology, and neural network modelling.

">Developmental relationships between the human alpha rhythm and intrinsic neural timescales are dependent on neural hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                Maturation of human brain structure has been well-studied, but developmental changes to brain physiology are not as well understood. One consistent finding is that the peak alpha rhythm frequency (PAF) increases throughout childhood. Another is that resting-state functional connectivity shifts from sensorimotor regions in children to association regions in adolescents, a reorganization along a hierarchy called the sensorimotor-to-association (S-A) axis. In mature brains, the S-A axis has been parcellated physiologically using the duration of persistent neural activity, known as the intrinsic neural timescale (INT), which increases along the hierarchy. Here we studied the development of PAF and INT in a cohort of epilepsy patients 3 to 33 years of age undergoing intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) monitoring. Given the well-known developmental trajectory of PAF, and the ability to delineate hierarchy using INT, we hypothesized that changes to PAF and INT would correlate across development, but that their relationship may be influenced by hierarchy. Consequently, we predicted that age-dependent PAF increases would accompany INT decreases, and we tested whether their relationship varied between sensorimotor and association regions. We found that PAF increased significantly with age in both sensorimotor and association regions, while age-dependent INT decreases were only significant in association regions. Supporting this finding, we found a strong negative relationship between PAF and INT that was specific to association regions. Together, our results suggest that developmental divisions across the S-A axis manifest in the relationships between neurophysiological measures, providing further evidence that asynchronous development along the S-A axis depends on maturation of brain function.

">Inner speech and the neurobiology of psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Aberrations of inner speech have been linked to psychotic symptoms such as thought insertion and auditory verbal hallucinations. These symptoms may reflect failures of prediction and source monitoring. Normally, efference copies of speech motor commands are sent to auditory cortices and suppressed, helping distinguish self-generated from external input. If suppression malfunctions, predicted auditory input may become perceptually salient. Further, if self-monitoring or error detection-related regions are also impaired (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, ACC), inner speech may be misattributed as external. We tested this proposal using neuroimaging meta-analyses, examining how the brain systems in overt and inner speech production in neurotypical participants overlap with findings from psychosis-spectrum participants performing a range of tasks. They showed increased activity in motor-related regions associated with inner speech (e.g., ventral premotor cortices) and decreased grey matter in bilateral auditory cortices and ACC, in regions specific to overt speech. Coactivation-based network analyses revealed that these ventral premotor and auditory regions form distinct, inversely coupled audiomotor networks. Classification suggests the ventral premotor network supports 'higher-level' language processing, while the audiomotor network supports 'lower-level' speech and self-referential processing. Overall, results accord with the proposal that psychotic symptoms like auditory verbal hallucinations derive from phenotypic hyperactivation in inner speech-related regions that yield affectively salient efference copy signals that are insufficiently suppressed and monitored as self-produced. In line with a hierarchical predictive-processing account, disruption of a distributed recurrent system distorts self-awareness and conscious experience.

                <p>The interface barrier between the brain surface and the adjacent meninges is important for regulating exchanges of fluid, protein, and immune cells between the CNS and periphery. However, the cell types that form this important interface are not yet fully defined. To address this limitation, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell spatial transcriptomics together with morphological lineage tracing and immunostaining to describe the cell types forming the interface barrier of the adult murine cortex. We show that the cortical interface is composed of three major cell types, leptomeningeal cells, border astrocytes, and tissue-resident macrophages. On the nonparenchymal side, the interface is composed of transcriptionally distinct PDGFR&alpha;-positive leptomeningeal cells that are intermingled with macrophages. This leptomeningeal layer is lined by a population of transcriptionally distinct border astrocytes. The interface neighborhood is rich in growth factor mRNAs, including many leptomeningeal ligands predicted to act on both the border astrocytes and macrophages. On the CNS side of the interface is the relatively cell-sparse cortical layer 1 containing interneurons, microglia, parenchymal astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and oligodendrocytes. Except for the border astrocytes, layer 1 cells are not closely associated with the interface, suggesting that secreted ligands may be the major way the brain interface communicates with the underlying cortical parenchyma. Thus, our data provide a molecular/cellular resource describing the brain interface cell types and their interactions, thereby enabling future studies investigating how this distinct cellular compartment regulates CNS:periphery interactions.</p>

                <p>Autonomic imbalance&mdash;particularly reduced activity from brainstem parasympathetic cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs)&mdash;is a major characteristic of many cardiorespiratory diseases. Therapeutic approaches to selectively enhance CVN activity have been limited by the lack of defined, translationally relevant targets. Previous studies have identified an important excitatory synaptic pathway from oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus to brainstem CVNs, suggesting that OXT could provide a key selective excitation of CVNs. In clinical studies, intranasal OXT has been shown to increase parasympathetic cardiac activity, improve autonomic balance, and reduce obstructive event durations and oxygen desaturations in obstructive sleep apnea patients. However, the mechanisms by which activation of hypothalamic OXT neurons, or intranasal OXT, enhance brainstem parasympathetic cardiac activity remain unclear. CVNs are located in two cholinergic brainstem nuclei: nucleus ambiguus (NA) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX). In this study, we characterize the colocalization of OXT receptors (OXTRs) in both CVNs and non-CVN cholinergic neurons in the male and female mouse NA and DMNX nuclei. We found that OXT receptors are highly expressed in CVNs in the DMNX, but not in the NA. OXT increases the firing of DMNX CVN, with no effect on NA CVNs. Selective chemogenetic excitation of OXTR+ CVNs in the DMNX&mdash;achieved by a combination of Cre- and flp-dependent DREADD expression&mdash;evoked a rapid and sustained bradycardia. These findings suggest that activation of DMNX CVNs expressing OXTR with oxytocin may represent a novel translational therapeutic target for restoring autonomic balance in cardiorespiratory disorders.</p>

Mathematical theory that accounts for the stochastic character of spike sequences of IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling calculates the probability distributions of the features of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> time course, their moments and correlations. Including slow feedback from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to components of the pathway poses a challenge to stochastic modelling. Here, we present a stochastic model that takes this feedback into account, allows for a non-linear dependency of the open probability of the Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor channel (IP<sub>3</sub>R) on the feedback variable and the inclusion of more than one feedback with different relaxation time scales. We use this novel modelling approach to describe the effect of ER depletion by non-linear rate expressions for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) and the measured non-linear IP<sub>3</sub>-dependency of the open probability as part of the dynamic feedback. Our theory can calculate spike amplitude distributions, correlation coefficients (C<sub>c</sub>) of interspike intervals (ISIs) and amplitudes, simulate ISI distributions and calculate their moments. We apply it to experiments with HEK293 cells. We find very good agreement between theoretical ISI distributions and their moments with experimental results. Many measured C<sub>c</sub>s show positive values in accordance with the ideas formulated by our theory. Surprisingly, most ISI-amplitude correlations are weak despite the decay of negative feedback during the ISI, which affects spike probability. We even find negative values of C<sub>c</sub>s, which indicate feedback that decreases the open probability of IP<sub>3</sub>R with increasing ISI. The components of the pathway causing this anticorrelation have not yet been identified. Our data suggest that they involve components that are subject to cell variability.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003333">Attractive serial dependence arises during decision-making</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiangang Shan, Jasper E. Hajonides, Nicholas E. Myers</p>

Recall of stimuli is biased by stimulus history, variously manifested as an attractive bias toward or repulsive bias from previous stimuli (i.e., serial dependence). It is unclear when attractive versus repulsive biases arise and if they share neural mechanisms. A recent model of attractive serial dependence proposes a two-stage process in which adaptation causes a repulsive bias during encoding that is later counteracted by an attractive bias at the decision-making stage in a Bayesian-inference-like manner. Neural evidence exists for a repulsive bias at encoding, but evidence for the attractive bias during the response period has been more elusive. We recently (Hajonides et al., J Neurosci 43:2730–40, 2023) showed in a working memory task that while different stimuli in trial history exerted different (attractive or repulsive) serial biases on behavioral reports, during encoding the neural representation of the current item was always repulsively biased. Here, we assessed whether this discrepancy between neural and behavioral effects is resolved during subsequent decision-making. Multivariate decoding of human magnetoencephalography data during working memory recall showed a neural distinction between attractive and repulsive biases that is consistent with the two-stage model: an attractive neural bias was found in recall period. And stimuli that created a repulsive bias on behavior led to an early repulsive neural bias that is likely to have already been incorporated during the encoding phase. The neural attractive bias late in the trial was replicated in an independent electroencephalogram experiment. Our results suggest that attractive (but not repulsive) serial dependence arises during decision-making, and that priors that influence post-perceptual decision-making are updated by the previous trial’s target, but not by other stimuli.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors have shown promising results in treatment of plexiform neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients, but data in adults are limited. The aim of this phase 2 study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of trametinib in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty patients with a diagnosis of generalized or mosaic neurofibromatosis type 1 and a symptomatic inoperable plexiform neurofibroma were treated with 2mg trametinib per day. Primary outcome measures were partial response rate on tumor volume at cycle 12 and overall partial response rate. Partial response was defined as ≥20% decrease in tumor volume compared to baseline as measured with 3-dimensional volumetric analysis on magnetic resonance imaging every sixth cycle. Secondary outcome measures were pain, pain interference, quality of life, and toxicity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Partial response rate after cycle 12 was 47% (n = 14/30). Overall partial response rate was 50% (n = 15/30). Median best response was −22% decrease of tumor volume (range: −63 to +7%), and median time until best response was 12 cycles (range: 6–42 cycles). Pain score and pain interference were significantly decreased after 12 cycles of treatment. No change in quality of life was reported. Acneiform rash and fatigue were the most reported adverse events. Overall rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was 40%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We observed a positive effect of trametinib on tumor volume and significant pain reduction in adults with plexiform neurofibromas. However, adverse events are common and frequently led to early termination of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Lueg et al. discovered that deregulated MYC increases cancer cell sensitivity to N-myristoyltransferase inhibitors (NMTis). Mitochondrial dysfunction upon NMTi occurs selectively in high-MYC contexts through impaired complex I via effects on the NMT substrate and complex I assembly factor NDUFAF4. An approach for targeting MYC-driven cancers is revealed.

They highlight therapeutic strategies targeting the matrix-nucleus axis by tuning matrix properties, mechano-priming cells, and targeting mechanosensitive molecules, providing a promising paradigm for disease treatment and tissue regeneration.

                Hahn et al. use male rhesus macaques as a model to characterize the immunological consequences of cross-sex estrogen therapy in primates. 17β-estradiol suppresses endogenous testosterone production, induces female physical traits, and following mRNA vaccination, leads to increased T cell activation and modulation of immune gene expression.

                Gancedo-Verdejo et al. reveal age-associated molecular changes in mouse hippocampus and an age-dependent effect of environmental enrichment, focusing on 3D chromatin structure and gene expression. Environmental enrichment promotes aging-like changes in young mice, likely related to brain maturation; conversely, it reverts age-related alterations in old mice, suggesting neuronal rejuvenation.

                Ablation of lysosomal polyamine transporter ATP13A2 causes lysosome dysfunction, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Samaddar et al. demonstrate that ATP13A2 loss causes lysosomal accumulation of polyamines, which, in turn, disrupts Parkinson’s disease-linked lipid hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase via lysosome deacidification and reduced enzyme-membrane electrostatic interactions in lysosomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97860">The gut contractile organoid for studying the gut motility regulated by coordinating signals between interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscles</a></h4>

              
                The gut undergoes peristaltic movements regulated by intricate cellular interactions. How these interactions emerge in the developing gut remains poorly explored due to a lack of model system. We here developed a novel contractile organoid that is derived from the muscle layer of chicken embryonic hindgut. The organoid contained smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs; pacemaker) with few enteric neurons and underwent periodic contractions. The organoid was formed by self-organization with morphological arrangements of ICCs (internal) and SMCs (peripheral), allowing identification of these cells in live. GCaMP-Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analyses revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients between ICC-ICC, SMC-SMC, or SMC-ICC were markedly coordinated. Pharmacological studies further suggested a role of gap junctions in ICC-to-SMC signaling, and also possible mechanical feedback from SMC’s contraction to ICC’s pace-making activities. In addition, two organoids with different rhythms became synchronized when mediated by SMCs, unveiling a novel contribution of SMCs to ICC’s pace-making. The gut contractile organoid developed in this study offers a useful model to understand how the rhythm coordination between/among ICCs and SMCs is regulated and maintained during gut development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107093">Risk-taking incentives predict aggression heuristics in female gorillas</a></h4>

              
                Competition is commonly reflected in aggressive interactions among groupmates as individuals try to attain or maintain higher social ranks that can offer them better access to critical resources. In this study, we investigate the factors that can shift competitive incentives against higher- or lower-ranking groupmates, that is, more or less powerful individuals. We use a long-term behavioural data set on five wild groups of the two gorilla species starting in 1998, and we show that most aggression is directed from higher- to lower-ranking adult females close in rank, highlighting rank-reinforcement incentives. Yet, females directed 42% of aggression to higher-ranking females than themselves. Females targeted groupmates of higher rank with increasing number of males in the group, suggesting that males might buffer female–female aggression risk. Contrarily, they targeted females of lower rank with increasing number of females in the group, potentially because this is a low-risk option that females prefer when they have access to a larger pool of competitors to choose from. Lactating and pregnant females, especially those in the latest stage of pregnancy, targeted groupmates of higher rank than the groupmates that cycling females targeted, suggesting that energetic needs may motivate females to risk confrontation with more powerful rivals. Our study provides critical insights into the evolution of competitive behaviour, showing that aggression heuristics, the simple rules that animals use to guide their aggressive interactions, are not merely species-specific but also dependent on the conditions that populations and individuals experience.

">A common representational code for event and object concepts in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Events and objects are two fundamental ways in which humans conceptualize their experience of the world. Despite the significance of this distinction for human cognition, it remains unclear whether the neural representations of object and event concepts are categorically distinct or, instead, can be explained in terms of a shared representational code. We investigated this question by analyzing fMRI data acquired from human participants (males and females) while they rated their familiarity with the meanings of individual words (all nouns) denoting object and event concepts. Multivoxel pattern analyses indicated that both categories of lexical concepts are represented in overlapping fashion throughout the association cortex, even in the areas that showed the strongest selectivity for one or the other type in univariate contrasts. Crucially, in these areas, a feature-based model trained on neural responses to individual event concepts successfully decoded object concepts from their corresponding activation patterns (and vice versa), showing that these two categories share a common representational code. This code was effectively modeled by a set of experiential feature ratings, which also accounted for the mean activation differences between these two categories. These results indicate that neuroanatomical dissociations between events and objects emerge from quantitative differences in the cortical distribution of more fundamental features of experience. Characterizing this representational code is an important step in the development of theory-driven brain-computer interface technologies capable of decoding conceptual content directly from brain activity.

">The Role of the Basal Ganglia in the Human Cognitive Architecture: A Dynamic Causal Modeling Comparison Across Tasks and Individuals</a></h4>

              
                Researchers agree input from the basal ganglia (BG) to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in cognition, but they disagree on its computational properties. Theoretical models characterize the majority of BG input as either direct (directly transmitting information to the PFC), or modulatory (indirectly influencing PFC activity through the gating of signals from other cortical areas). To determine the computational nature of these BG-PFC inputs in cognition, we tested three alternative connectivity configurations (Direct, Modulatory, and Mixed) within a large-scale cognitive architecture. This architecture, the Common Model of Cognition, has been independently validated using fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The Direct model reflected the standard CMC configuration, featuring a bidirectional, direct connection between the BG and PFC modules. The Modulatory model removed this direct link, instead incorporating a unidirectional connection from the PFC to the BG and two modulatory pathways from the BG to the PFC that passed through other cortical modules. The Mixed model included both direct and modulatory connections. Using fMRI data from 200 HCP participants performing six cognitive tasks and one resting-state session, we applied Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to estimate and compare the influence of these different BG-PFC connectivity patterns. Here, we show that for each of the six cognitive tasks and resting state, the Mixed model consistently outperformed the Direct and Modulatory models. The next best model depended on the specific cognitive task, suggesting the ability for the BG to flexibly adapt to various task demands. Taken together, the current data provide evidence for a likely set of core computations that the BG uses to differentially regulate cortical activity.

">The Microglial Trem2 R47H Alzheimer's Disease Risk Variant Impairs Early Hippocampal Synaptic Remodeling</a></h4>

              
                The rare R47H variant of the microglial TREM2 gene increases Alzheimers disease (AD) risk, but its effects on early hippocampal circuitry remain unclear. We examined basal synaptic transmission and synaptic density in 3-week-old Trem2 R47H knockin mice using in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recordings and immunohistochemistry. R47H mice displayed increased synaptic density in CA1 and CA3 regions, consistent with a trend towards increased spontaneous excitatory current frequency. Evoked synaptic currents, miniature EPSCs and spontaneous inhibitory current frequency were unaltered. Microglia shape synaptic circuits in early development by removing inactive synapses. Thus, inhibition of this role due to the Trem2 R47H mutation decreases the microglial reshaping of hippocampal connectivity during early postnatal development, without overtly altering basal synaptic activity. With ongoing synaptic plasticity, such early structural changes may predispose neural circuits to later dysfunction, particularly in the context of AD pathology, highlighting the importance of microglial TREM2 in developmental synaptic refinement.

">Evolution of Cajal-Retzius Cells in Vertebrates from an Ancient Class of Tp73+ Neurons</a></h4>

              
                In the developing cerebral cortex, Cajal Retzius (CR) cells are early-born neurons that orchestrate the development of mammalian-specific cortical features. However, this cell type has not been conclusively identified in non-mammalian species. Here we studied neurons expressing Tp73, a transcription factor specifically expressed in most mammalian CR cells. Comparisons of chicken, salamander, zebrafish, and little skate data indicate that Tp73-expressing neurons have conserved spatial distribution and transcriptomic signatures in vertebrates. Among the conserved Tp73-expressing cell types we find CR cells andTp73+ external tufted cells (ETCs) in the olfactory bulb of jawed vertebrates. ETCs and CR cells share the expression of most "canonical" CR cell transcription factors, such as Tp73, Lhx1, Lhx5, Ebf3, and Nr2f2, indicating that they are sister cell types. Our findings suggest that CR and ETCs evolved in stem vertebrates from cells involved in olfactory processing, with CR cells progressively acquiring new specialized roles in developmental signaling.

">Adaptive generalization and efficient learning under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                People often use recognizable features to infer the value of novel consumables. This "generalization" strategy is known to be beneficial in stable environments, such that individuals can use previously learned rules and values in efficiently exploring new situations. However, it remains unclear whether and how individuals adjust their generalization strategy in volatile environments where previously learned information becomes obsolete. We hypothesized that individuals adaptively use generalization by continuously updating their beliefs about the credibility of the feature-based reward generalization model at each state. Our data showed that participants used generalization more when the novel environment remained consistent with the previously learned monotonic association between feature and reward, suggesting efficient utilization of prior knowledge. Against other accounts, we found that individuals incorporated an arbitration mechanism between feature-based value generalization and model-based learning based on volatility tracking. Notably, our suggested model captured differential impacts of generalization dependent on the context-volatility, such that individuals who were biased the most toward generalization showed the lowest learning errors when the value of stimuli are generalized along the recognizable feature, but showed the highest errors in a volatile environment. This work provides novel insights into the adaptive usage of generalization, orchestrating two distinctive learning mechanisms through monitoring their credibility, and highlights the potential adverse effects of overgeneralization in volatile contexts.

">Voltage Imaging of CA1 Pyramidal Cells and SST+ Interneurons Reveals Stability and Plasticity Mechanisms of Spatial Firing</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells (PCs) are important for spatial coding and episodic memory. PCs' representations are modulated upon transitioning between environments (global remapping) but also change with repeated exposure to familiar spaces (representational drift). To gain insights into the mechanistic basis for this unique balance between circuit plasticity and stability, we used voltage imaging to longitudinally record the subthreshold and spiking activity of pyramidal neurons (PNs) and somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons in CA1 during virtual navigation. A fraction of cells from both populations showed spatial representations, but many SSTs were speed-tuned or fired uniformly across space. Intracellular recordings revealed increased theta power and asymmetric ramp-like depolarization in PN place fields, while SSTs exhibited symmetric depolarization with no theta increase. Longitudinal recordings across weeks demonstrated representational drifts in both populations, although SSTs exhibited remarkably stable firing and subthreshold properties. Transition to a novel environment induced remapping in both populations, accompanied by increase in SST activity and reduction in PNs. These results provide new insights into how hippocampal circuits balance representational stability with experience-dependent plasticity.

">Connectivity of serotonin neurons reveals a constrained inhibitory subnetwork within the olfactory system.</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory local interneurons (LNs) play an essential role in sensory processing by refining stimulus representations via a diverse collection of mechanisms. The morphological and physiological traits of individual LN types, as well as their connectivity within sensory networks, enable each LN type to support different computations such as lateral inhibition or gain control and are therefore ideal targets for modulatory neurons to have widespread impacts on network activity. In this study, we combined detailed connectivity analyses, serotonin receptor expression, neurophysiology, and computational modeling to demonstrate the functional impact of serotonin on a constrained LN network in the olfactory system of Drosophila. This subnetwork is composed of three LN types and we describe each of their distinctive morphology, connectivity, biophysical properties and odor response properties. We demonstrate that each LN type expresses different combinations of serotonin receptors and that serotonin differentially impacts the excitability of each LN type. Finally, by applying these serotonin induced changes in excitability to a computational model that simulates the impact of inhibition exerted by each LN-type, we predict a role for serotonin in adjusting the dynamic range of antennal lobe output neurons and in noise reduction in odor representations. Thus, a single modulatory system can differentially impact LN types that subserve distinct roles within the olfactory system.

">Neuron morphological physicality and variability define the non-random structure of connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Connectivity in neuronal networks is characterized by high complexity that is required for the correct function of the circuitry. Our attempts to capture it has thus far been limited to the addition of individual features of complexity to stochastic models, leading to limited insights into its origin. Based on the idea that the morphologies of neurons underlies the network structure, we developed an intuitive explanation for the mechanisms leading to structured, non-random connectivity. While a class of neurons on average innervates its entire surroundings, each individual one can only cover a small part of the space. That part is different for each neuron, but in a way that is not completely random, as it must be spatially continuous due to the physicality of neurites. We tested predictions from our hypothesis successfully in biophysically-detailed models and an electron-microscopic (EM) reconstruction of cortical connectivity. We distilled it into a simple stochastic algorithm that generates networks, which accurately match the EM reconstruction in basic network statistics as well as functionally relevant metrics of complexity. Our work may improve the understanding of the impact of neuron malformations and enable the study of the functional role of non-random network structure in simplified models.

">Individual differences shape conceptual representation in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Each person experiences the world through a unique conceptual lens, shaped by personal experiences, natural variations, or disease. These individual differences have remained largely inaccessible to cognitive neuroscience and clinical neurology, limiting the development of precision medicine approaches to cognitive disorders. To overcome this limitation, here we develop a new statistical framework to measure and interpret individual differences in functional brain representations. We apply this framework to characterize how different individuals represent the same concepts. Twenty-four participants listened to narrative stories while their brain activity was measured with functional MRI (fMRI). Encoding models were used to recover how hundreds of concepts were represented in each person's brain. Despite listening to identical stories, participants showed systematic individual differences in conceptual representations. These differences reveal person-specific biases in how concepts are represented in the brain. Individual variability was highest in regions that represent social information. Because these regions are thought to integrate sensory information with personal beliefs and experiences, the observed individual differences may reflect cognitive traits unique to each person. Our work reveals that individual differences are a systematic, measurable principle of conceptual representations in the human brain. By enabling researchers to measure and interpret differences in person-specific functional brain representations, our work establishes a new paradigm for precision neuroscience. This paradigm provides a rigorous foundation for developing fMRI applications in precision medicine to diagnose and monitor cognitive disorders.

                Humans extract regularities from the environment to form expectations that guide perception and optimize behavior. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is central to this process, the relative contributions of orbitofrontal (OFC) and lateral PFC (LPFC) remain unclear. Here, we show that the brain tracks sound regularities in an auditory deviance detection task to predict when a target deviant will occur. Intracranial EEG in epilepsy patients reveals prefrontal engagement, with earlier expectancy-related modulation in OFC and later modulation in LPFC. Connectivity analyses indicate bidirectional but asymmetrical expectancy-related information exchange between the two areas with a first lead by OFC, consistent with its role in initiating predictive encoding. Converging causal evidence shows that OFC lesions abolish sensitivity to expectancy, whereas LPFC lesions yield only modest effects not significantly different from controls. Together, these results provide electrophysiological and causal evidence for distinct, temporally organized contributions of prefrontal subregions to predictive processing.

">The rhythmic bimodal sensory stimulation in synchronous manner entrains the network oscillation in basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The state of neural oscillation is important for various brain functions. In the basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BA), the oscillation frequency is accelerated in retrieval of conditioned fear memory. The amygdala receives sensory inputs from associated cortex and thalamus. Therefore, we tried to apply the bimodal sensory stimulation at slow frequency (5 Hz, functional frequency in behavioral context) for the entrainment of the BA oscillation. Young adult rats (P24-30) were stimulated by LED illuminator and acoustic speaker at 1 or 5 Hz for 1 hour. Immediately after the stimulus was finished, BA slices were prepared and whole-cell recording was applied to projection neuron. The slow (0.5-2 Hz) rhythmic IPSCs obtained from the pyramidal neuron was accelerated at ~4 Hz by synchronous opto-acoustic stimulation at 5 Hz. However, the frequency of the neuron at the later recording did not change in the same slice, suggesting that this induced entrainment is transient and reversible phenomenon. As a result, the power distribution was shifted from 0.1-2 to 2-6 Hz by synchronous bimodal 5 Hz stimulation. The regularity of the interval between IPSCs, quantified by rhythm index and the concentration of power around peak frequency in the power spectrum, was not changed by rhythmic sensory stimulation. These results suggest that synchronous bimodal sensory stimuli control the neuronal oscillation frequency by applying with rhythmicity.

">REM Sleep Misfires: Intruding Delta Waves Forecast Tau, Amyloid, and Forgetting in Aging</a></h4>

              
                Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep degrades with age, and more severely in Alzheimer's disease (AD). REM sleep comprises about twenty percent of adult sleep, alternates between phasic and tonic periods, and includes delta waves (1-4Hz) in two forms: fast sawtooth waves and slower, NREM-like waves, whose expression dynamically varies across REM periods. Yet, the functional relevance of these REM sleep delta waves remains unknown. Here, using two independent cohorts, we show that aging is associated with a shift from fast sawtooth to slow NREM-like delta waves, particularly during phasic REM sleep, a period typically marked by high cortical activation. Beyond chronological age, this shift is associated with amyloid-beta and tau burden, suggesting that AD pathology disrupts REM-specific oscillatory patterns. Furthermore, this shift in REM oscillations is linked to impaired overnight memory consolidation, independent of NREM sleep quality. Moreover, variation in ApoE alleles, a major genetic risk factor for AD, was independently associated with a reduction in fast sawtooth wave density, thereby linking a genetic predisposition for AD to these specific REM microstructural changes. These findings identify a novel signature of memory decline in aging and implicate REM sleep as a distinct vulnerable substrate through which AD pathology may impair brain function.

">Thinging Through Modelling. Active Inference Meets Material Engagement</a></h4>

              
                In this simulation study, we adopt the comprehensive neurocomputational approach of Active Inference (AIF) to illustrate some key concepts of Material Engagement Theory (MET) [1]. MET posits that craftwork does not require, or rely on, rich internal 'pre-planning', i.e., complex and highly detailed representations that occur mainly in the maker's head. Instead, the maker engages materiality through 'thinging', where the human agent (the maker) is guided by and leverages the materiality of the artefact (such as a spinning of clay or a chunk of marble). MET assigns a crucial co-participatory role to materiality, attributing agency to it. We investigate MET's claims through the widely adopted theory of AIF [2]. Our first aim is to simulate the plausibility of the (creative) thinging, adopting a simple modelling scenario. Then, we also discuss its applicability to other, more complex cases, which seem to require greater levels of 'pre-thinking' (e.g., planning, imagining and conceptualising outcomes). We highlight how these cases, too, align with the general principle of thinging. With our AIF neurocomputational understanding, we explain that even in these situations, the predictive brains involved in the creative process attempt to minimise the complexity of their internal model. The upshot of this is that, always and everywhere, our human minds engage the materiality to make the most of the characteristic dynamics of the world surrounding us - things and processes alike.

">Frequency bands EEG Biomarkers for Dementia using Graph Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                We introduce a simple and interpretable model for classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Our focus essentially is on using deep learning to study how connectivity patterns that are integrated to classify the EEG signals and highlight the important discriminative features used by the model in predictions. In this study, we utilize the connectivity features across different frequency bands in multi edge Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and showed that edge features are complimentary. We use a simple GNN model to predict Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) in EEG. Our model is capable of achieving average accuracy of approximately 76% using Leave-One-Subject-Out-subject for FTD predictions which are better than the baselines and comparable to State of the arts models. In this article, we study the importance of the connectivity edges, nodes and frequency bands in the prediction of the model, focusing in explainable AI methods through saliency maps to interpret the model both locally and globally. The Saliency maps highlight the importance of Occipital and anterior temporal regions in the prediction of FTD. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of Alpha and Theta bands in the prediction of FTD. Our observations align with previous research done using classical statistical methods. We argue that there are complimentary information in each each connectivity feature and frequency band brain networks. The impacts of each connectivity metrics on the prediction of the model are quantified to highlight the complimentary information in each connectivity measure.

">Direct Generation of Images from EEG using Schrödinger Bridge</a></h4>

              
                Real-world data is often noisy, making it challenging to extract true signals. Non-invasively recorded neural activities are among the most difficult data, yet its precise signal reconstruction is highly anticipated by communities developing non-invasive brain-machine interfaces. Several noise sources contribute to this challenge, including unrelated neuronal activity, non-brain bioelectricity, attenuation by the skull and scalp, and environmental noises. Additionally, the accumulation of noise varies significantly across subjects and recording sessions, resulting in widely diverging distributions of degraded observations. In this study, we propose modeling the noise accumulation process as a Schrodinger bridge and decoding the true signal by reversing this process. Compared to conventional guided Diffusion approach, our Schrodinger bridge approach effectively models diverse noise processes within a single framework, exhibiting greater robustness to inter-subject variability. Also, our approach doesn't require pre-aligning brain and image representations, which is an additional compute cost in the conventional approach.

">Identifiability-Guided Assessment of Digital Twins in Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Research and Care</a></h4>

              
                Digital twins -- personalized, data-driven computational models -- are emerging as a powerful paradigm for representing and predicting disease trajectories at the individual level. These models have the potential to support diagnosis, monitor disease evolution, and evaluate therapeutic interventions in virtual settings in the context of clinical trials and patient care. Rigorous model assessment is thus critical for its implementation, but medical data are often sparse, noisy, and vary significantly across individuals, making it challenging to determine whether a digital twin optimized on such data is valid. In such settings, identifiability analysis becomes essential for evaluating whether model parameters can be reliably estimated and interpreted. To address this, we investigate how identifiability can support the clinical application of a computational causal digital twin model for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where data sparsity and variability are particularly pronounced. Our results show that the magnitude and distribution of biomarker data influence the parameter practical identifiability, and that constraints on the model structure and parameters can significantly affect identifiability. We also observe differences in identifiability across diagnostic groups, with several parameters showing significantly different values between individuals with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Uncertainty quantification for identifiable parameters and their corresponding model trajectories provides visual insight into variability in disease progression and reveals mild trends related to biomarker data spread. This study represents a first step toward incorporating identifiability techniques into clinical digital twin frameworks, using a data-driven, interpretable example based on a previously published AD model.

">Connectome-guided personalization of optimal tDCS intervention selection in Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is being investigated as a clinical intervention in Alzheimers disease (AD) with the goal of reducing its neurophysiological effects (i.e. oscillatory slowing and loss of functional connectivity). However, progress is hampered by variable outcomes across studies, likely related to both methodological and individual differences. We recently described a virtual brain network simulation method for optimizing tDCS interventions and now propose a novel methodology for further personalizing this approach. While the general model of the AD brain we used for our previous study was based on an average human connectome and brain anatomy, we now created new personalized models for 10 biomarker-confirmed AD patients. We used individual, amplitude envelope correlation (AEC)-based connectivity matrices extracted from magnetoencephalography (MEG) scans and implemented individual structural MRI data for current flow modeling of the tDCS effects. We then assessed a set of previously established stimulation strategies based on their ability to restore relevant neurophysiological outcome parameters in each personalized model, while undergoing AD damage. Personalized tDCS strategies were able to delay neurophysiological deterioration, but in dissimilar ways compared to our previous results. While the general model favored posterior anodal stimulation targeting the precuneus region, the personalized models favored frontal anodal stimulation targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) region in 90% of the cases. This may be explained by higher connectivity levels of frontal regions in the personalized connectivity matrices, as anodal stimulation of highly connected regions produced more beneficial effects. In this methodological study we propose several ways to improve personalized computational tDCS stimulation prediction modeling. We conclude that connectome-guided personalization of tDCS effects lead to different strategies with potentially better intervention outcomes. For external validation of this model-guided tDCS approach, personalized and general model predictions are currently being tested and compared in a clinical tDCS-MEG trial in AD patients.

">Spectral patterns of MEG oscillatory coupling emerge from meta-stable dynamics with small coupling delays</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) is a fundamental mechanism of communication in the brain, connecting distinct oscillating neuronal populations. Oscillatory networks exhibit heterogeneity across frequencies and coupling modes whose origins are not well understood, but have been suggested to involve a complex interplay of critical-like dynamics and structure-function coupling. We here utilized structural connectivity (SC) to tune a whole-brain computational model of delay-coupled damped oscillators near a Hopf bifurcation to match oscillations and FC as observed in resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We assessed two forms of oscillation-based FC from empirical and model data, namely phase synchronization (PS) and amplitude coupling (AC). We found that both oscillations and FC best matched with empirical observations in a meta-stable regime which was characterized by small delays, realistic oscillation lifetimes, and FC with intermediate strength and high variability. How well MEG FC patterns were matched by the model varied between frequency bands and best fits were observed for high-alpha and beta band networks. These fits could partially, but not fully, be explained by correlations with SC, implicating that both structure-function coupling and critical-like metastable dynamics underlie empirical FC, and their contributions vary between different frequency bands.

">Closed-Loop Connectivity Best Supports Angular Tuning and Sleep Dynamics in a Biophysical Thalamocortical Circuit Model</a></h4>

              
                Despite recent advancements in mapping thalamic and cortical projections, the specific organization of intrathalamic and corticothalamic connectivity remains elusive. Current experimental approaches cannot definitively determine whether these connections are arranged in reciprocal (closed-) or non-reciprocal (open-loop) circuits. We developed a biophysically detailed multi-compartmental model of the mouse whisker pathway, built on anatomical and physiological data. We showed that closed-loop intrathalamic projections between the thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons in the ventral posteromedial nucleus and the inhibitory neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) best reproduce thalamic spiking and local field potential responses across awake and sleep states. Increasing the percentage of closed-loop projections regulates the angular tuning in the awake state, while also supporting spindle oscillations during sleep. We also showed that direct activation of closed-loop corticothalamic feedback (CT[-&gt;]TC and CT[-&gt;]TRN) simulating TC inputs sharpens the angular tuning in the thalamus. These results contribute to resolving a long-standing question regarding the organization of intrathalamic projections, offering mechanistic insights into how thalamo-cortical circuits balance precise sensory tuning with robust oscillatory rhythms across behavioral states.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently leads to chronic neurovascular dysfunction, yet mechanistic insights into human-specific responses have been limited by the absence of long-term, multicellular in vitro models. Here, we report a five-cell-type human neurovascular culture system, comprising endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes, microglia, and neurons, engineered within a 3D scaffold to study injury-induced remodeling over multiple weeks. This PENTA-culture platform recapitulates hallmark features of the neurovascular unit and enables dissection of cell-specific contributions to vascular repair and degeneration. Upon mechanical trauma, cultures exhibit a biphasic response marked by acute endothelial disintegration, mitochondrial stress, and glial activation, followed by a delayed and incomplete repair. Confocal and proteomic analyses reveal persistent disruptions in tight junction organization, elevated TDP-43 and APP expression, and altered angiogenic and immunomodulatory signaling involving Tie2 and JAK/STAT pathways. Compared to simpler culture systems, the inclusion of microglia and neurons enhances post-injury cytokine resolution and junctional recovery, underscoring the importance of neuroimmune crosstalk. This system offers a mechanistically rich, human-relevant model for studying chronic neurovascular dysfunction and therapeutic revascularization.

">Artificial Intelligence-driven Whole-brain Cell Mapping with Highly Multiplexed In Situ Hybridization</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in three-dimensional single-cell-resolution imaging have begun to link organ-wide and cellular level research in development and disease research. Harnessing the power of whole-mount cell staining and tissue-clearing, it became possible to quantify the cell populations throughout an intact organ. While powerful, whole-organ imaging remains limited by the inability to stain a broad range of molecular markers simultaneously and by the lack of an analytical scheme to precisely quantify the cell population. Here, we present a highly multiplexed whole-mount staining technique, utilizing the repeated application of fluorescent in situ hybridization. This technique, termed mFISH3D, was designed by extensively dissecting the chemical basis of hybridization reactions in fixed tissue. mFISH3D enabled the visualization of 10 types of mRNAs in an intact mouse brain and has been demonstrated in various biological specimens including the human brain. To achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy in spatial cell mapping, we developed artificial intelligence (AI)-driven workflow using self-supervised learning, significantly reducing the need for extensive manual annotations. The integration of mFISH3D with our AI solution sets a standard for high-dimensional tissue analysis, provides a new systematic framework for analyzing complex cellular ecosystems and enables comprehensive investigation of selective cellular vulnerabilities in diseases.

">The claudin-like molecule CLC-3 regulates neuromuscular function in Caenorhabditis elegans by modulating cholinergic signalling</a></h4>

              
                Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs play important roles in neurons, contributing to nervous system development, synapse formation, and activity-dependent plasticity. Claudins, the cell-adhesion molecules known for their roles at tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells, remain underexplored in neurons, particularly in vertebrates. In contrast, emerging studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have begun to reveal neuronal functions of claudin-like proteins. However, a systematic analysis of their neuronal expression has not been performed. We conducted a transcriptional reporter screen of all claudin-like genes in C. elegans and identified several candidates with previously unreported neuronal expression, highlighting a broader role of this family in the nervous system. One candidate, clc-3, showed robust expression in head, tail, and ventral cord neurons, with no detectable expression in non-neuronal tissues. Functional analyses of clc-3 mutants revealed increased body-bend amplitude and elevated evoked postsynaptic currents at the cholinergic neuromuscular synapses. Imaging and molecular interaction studies demonstrated that CLC-3 localises to the presynaptic membranes in cholinergic neurons, where it interacts with the actin-binding protein NAB-1 and regulates cholinergic signalling. This presynaptic role of CLC-3 likely contributes to the regulation of sinusoidal movement in C. elegans. Our findings identify CLC-3 as a neuronally expressed claudin that regulates motor system output by influencing synaptic vesicle organization and illustrate how changes in synaptic organization are coupled to whole-animal behaviour.

">Context-dependent structurally informed effective connectivity under psilocybin</a></h4>

              
                The extent to which anatomical connectivity constrains pharmacologically altered brain dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we combined psilocybin administration with a structurally informed effective-connectivity model to examine how structural connectivity shapes directed inter-regional influences across experiential contexts. Using dynamic causal modeling embedded in a hierarchical empirical Bayes framework, we analyzed fMRI data acquired from a hippocampo--thalamo--cortical network during rest, guided meditation, music listening and movie viewing. Across contexts, psilocybin reorganized directed interactions while preserving structure-based scaling. Effects converged on efferents (outgoing influences) from the left hippocampus--a hub interfacing mnemonic and associative systems with the default-mode network and thalamus. Notably, the left-hippocampus-to-thalamus pathway showed a sign-reversed association with mystical-experience scores (downregulation during guided meditation and upregulation during music listening). In model-based leave-one-out cross-validation, left-hippocampal efferents predicted individual differences in mystical-experience intensity. A minimal model-free benchmark (hippocampal signal variability) also showed modest associations with mystical experience. Together, these findings link context-specific, structurally informed effective connectivity to individual differences in the acute psychedelic experience, providing a mechanistic bridge between anatomy, neurodynamics, and phenomenology.

">Streamline Density Normalization: A Robust Approach to Mitigate Bundle Variability in Multi-Site Diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                Tractometry enables quantitative analysis of tissue microstructure is sensitive to variability introduced during tractography and bundle segmentation. Differences in processing parameters and bundle geometry can lead to inconsistent streamline reconstructions and sampling, ultimately affecting the reproducibility of tractometry analysis. In this study, we introduce Streamline Density Normalization (SDNorm), a supervised two-step method designed to reduce variability in bundle reconstructions. SDNorm first computes streamline weights using linear regression to match a subject's bundle to a template streamline density map, then iteratively prunes streamlines to achieve a target density using a novel metric called effective Streamline Point Density (eSPD). We evaluate SDNorm across multiple bundles and acquisition protocols in dMRI data from a subset of subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and demonstrate that it can significantly reduce variability in streamline density, improve consistency in along-tract microstructure profiles, and provide useful metrics for automated bundle quality control. These results suggest that SDNorm can help enhance the reproducibility and robustness of bundle reconstruction across heterogeneous image acquisition protocols and tractography settings, making it well-suited for large-scale and multi-site neuroimaging studies.

">High-Throughput Screening and Initial SAR Studies Identify a Novel Sub-micromolar Potent Human cGAS Inhibitor</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target of several human diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. As a cytosolic DNA sensor, cGAS generates an innate immune response to promote neuroinflammation by producing an endogenous agonist of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates the cGAS-STING pathway. We have performed a high-throughput screening of a chemical library containing over 300K small molecules at the Fisher Drug Discovery Resource Center (DDRC), Rockefeller University (RU), to identify multiple hit inhibitors of human (h)-cGAS. We used a modified Kinase Glo(R) Luminescent Kinase assay, which was earlier developed at RU and later used by multiple groups, including ours, to perform primary screening of the library using h-cGAS. The hit candidates bearing novel scaffolds are structurally diverse and exhibited in vitro activity in the low micromolar range. RU-0610270 or compound (cpd) 1, a sulfonamide derivative, is one of the most potent hits (IC<50>=1.88 M), selected for hit expansion and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis. We synthesized new analogs of cpd 1 and evaluated them in vitro against h-cGAS to identify cpd 6 (IC<50>=0.66 M) as the most potent hit analog. We further profiled cpd 6 and found that it modestly inhibited cGAMP levels by 29% at 30 M in THP1 cells without detectable toxicity, and by 76% at 100 M, albeit with a moderate decrease (~20%) in cell viability. These results highlight a novel chemical series with promising in vitro activity, providing a starting point for the development of selective and potent human cGAS inhibitors for clinical use.

">Global search metaheuristics for neural mass model calibration</a></h4>

              
                Neural mass models (NMMs) are often used to help understand the circuitry that underpins observed brain dynamics in basic and clinical research. A key step is to fuse models with data so that model parameter values can be inferred for a given data set, a process called model fitting or model calibration. This can shed light on putative physiological mechanisms underlying the observed signals. Calibration is notoriously challenging in biology since models are often non-identifiable, high-dimensional, and nonlinear. Established methods such as dynamic causal modelling (DCM) circumvent some of these issues, for example, by incorporating prior information and employing fast local search methods in the space of feasible parameter values ("parameter space"). However, it is pertinent to better understand the potential limitations of these methods so that we can increase our confidence in the use of models to interpret brain activity, and to develop new approaches as required. Here we use tools from dynamical systems theory to illustrate some of the complexities of model calibration in an archetypal NMM. We use this information to motivate the use of calibration methods that work across large regions of parameter space, rather than focusing on informative priors or localised search methods. We subsequently evaluate the performance of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and evolutionary search metaheuristics (ESMs) for mapping feasible sets of parameters for which an NMM can recreate electroencephalographic recordings during an eyes-closed resting state. Our results demonstrate the superiority of ESMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, we elucidate potential reasons why ESMs are able to perform better than ABC, i.e. that they are less susceptible to biases induced by the complexity of underlying cost landscapes. These results highlight the importance of incorporating ESMs in future efforts to model brain dynamics.

">Temperature-Induced Bifurcations and Timescale Warping in the Hodgkin-Huxley Model: Dynamical Systems Insights into Temperature Modulation of Neuronal Excitability and Action Potential Morphology</a></h4>

              
                Temperature fluctuations can have detrimental effects on the firing pattern and electrical activity of biological neurons, eliciting diverse responses depending on the neuronal cell types and the underlying ion channels exhibited. Using the classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, we performed a comprehensive dynamical systems analysis to determine how temperature fluctuations alter neuronal excitability, spike morphology, and bifurcation structure. We first relied on experimentally-derived temperature coefficients, or Q10 values, associated with gating kinetics and conductances, and examined codimension-1 and codimension-2 bifurcations across a range of temperatures and standard HH parameters governing the intrinsic properties (firing frequency, spike amplitude, spike width, afterhyperpolarization (AHP), time-to-peak AHP, etc...) of the model HH neuron. Our analysis revealed that increasing temperature accelerates gating dynamics, leading to narrower and higher-frequency spikes but reduced amplitudes, and ultimately to a loss of sustained firing via temperature-induced depolarization block. We identified generalized Hopf (Bautin) bifurcations as critical boundaries beyond which the system becomes strictly monostable. Extending the model to independently scale sodium activation, sodium inactivation, and potassium activation kinetics showed that excitability is particularly sensitive to potassium gating dynamics. Our findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding temperature modulations of neuronal activity, highlighting how temperature reshapes the excitability landscape, unveiling the intricate interplays between the activation/inactivation kinetics of ion channels, and identifying key parameters governing temperature robustness in neuronal models.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The strength of neural reinstatement, a correlate of episodic memory retrieval, reportedly reflects the amount and fidelity of mnemonic content and is weaker in older than younger adults, especially for scene memoranda. Based on evidence that age-related declines in cortical thickness and volume contribute to age-related cognitive decline, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from healthy young and older adults to examine relationships between cortical thickness, cortical volume, age, and scene-related reinstatement in 3 cortical regions implicated in scene processing: the parahippocampal place area, medial place area, and occipital place area. A “reinstatement index” was estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected during tests of source memory for scene images, and multiple regression analyses were employed to examine the effects of the variables of interest on scene reinstatement. There were robust age differences in reinstatement, cortical thickness, and cortical volume. In the parahippocampal place area and medial place area, cortical volume fully mediated the effects of age on reinstatement. Additionally, parahippocampal place area reinstatement strength predicted source memory performance independently of cortical volume or age. These findings suggest that age differences in scene reinstatement are mediated by cortical volume and that memory performance and cortical volume are associated with unique components of variance in reinstatement strength.</span>

                <p>Adolescent nicotine use is particularly concerning due to increased susceptibility to long-term effects and dependence during this critical developmental period. This study investigates the therapeutic effects of thiamine on nicotine withdrawal-induced anxiety, anhedonia, and depression in rats. Adolescent rats received nicotine (2&nbsp;mg/kg, s.c.) for 21&nbsp;d, followed by 21&nbsp;d of withdrawal. Thiamine (25 or 50&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.) was administered during exposure and withdrawal. Behavioral assessments were used to evaluate anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms, and biochemical analyses measured oxidative stress markers, serotonin levels, MAO activity, BDNF, and GFAP as indicators of neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex. Nicotine withdrawal significantly elevated anxiety-, depression-, and anhedonia-like behaviors, increased oxidative stress, and upregulated MAO-A activity and GFAP expression, indicating neuroinflammatory effects. Notably, thiamine administration during both nicotine exposure and withdrawal effectively alleviated these behavioral impairments, restored serotonin levels, reduced oxidative stress markers, and mitigated the increase in GFAP expression. Additionally, thiamine alone has been shown to alleviate anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. This study highlights thiamine's potential as a promising intervention for managing psychological distress associated with nicotine withdrawal. Given the high prevalence of adolescent nicotine use and its associated mental health challenges, further research on thiamine's mechanisms and therapeutic potential is warranted to improve treatment strategies during this critical developmental stage.</p>

                <p>Every neuron contains the same genomic information, but its complement of proteins is the product of countless neuron-specific steps including pre-mRNA splicing. Despite advances in RNA sequencing techniques, pre-mRNA splicing biases that favor one isoform over another are largely inscrutable in live neurons in situ. Here, in <I>Drosophila</I>, we developed bichromatic fluorescent reporters to investigate alternative splicing of <I>cacophony</I> (<I>cac</I>)&mdash;a gene that codes the pore-forming &alpha;<SUB>1</SUB> subunit of the primary neuronal voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (VGCC). These reporters revealed a neuron-specific pattern of exon biases, highly consistent from one animal to the next, suggesting that each neuron splices a unique and consistent portfolio of VGCC isoforms. Stereotypical patterns were observed within motor neurons and multidendritic sensory neurons of female larvae and also within mushroom body Kenyon cells of female adults. In a validation step, we demonstrated that exon splice bias reporting was not dependent on the choice of fluorophores. Additionally, functional properties of the female larval motor neuron terminals could be generally reconciled with the functional properties predicted for the reported exon bias. The application of this technology to a large gene such as <I>cac</I> provides a precedence for effective exon-reporter design for other <I>Drosophila</I> genes.</p>

                <p>by Haoran Chen, Yangyuan Zhang, Robert F. Murphy</p>

Recent advances in multiplexed fluorescence imaging have provided new opportunities for deciphering the complex spatial relationships among various cell types across diverse tissues. We introduce CytoSpatio, open-source software that constructs generative, multirange, and multitype point process models that capture interactions among multiple cell types at various distances simultaneously. On analyzing five cell types across five tissues, our software showed consistent spatial relationships within the same tissue type, with certain cell types like proliferating T cells consistently clustering across tissue types. It also revealed that the attraction-repulsion relationships between cell types like B cells and CD4-positive T cells vary with tissue type. Models for a published dataset demonstrated consistency with prior findings. CytoSpatio can also generate synthetic tissue patterns from learned models, a capability not provided by previous descriptive, motif-based approaches. This potentially allows spatially realistic simulations of how cell relationships affect tissue biochemistry.

                <p>by Amirmahdi Mostofinejad, David A. Romero, Dana Brinson, Thomas K. Waddell, Golnaz Karoubi, Cristina H. Amon</p>

Differentiation of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into endoderm derivatives, including thyroid, thymus, lungs, liver, and pancreas, has broad implications for disease modeling and therapy. We utilize and expand a model development approach previously outlined by the authors to construct a model for the directed differentiation of iPSCs into definitive endoderm (DE). Assuming discrete intermediate stages in the differentiation process with a homogeneous population in each stage, three lineage models with two, three, and four populations and three growth models are constructed. Additionally, three models for error distribution are defined, resulting in a total of 27 models. Experimental data obtained <i>in vitro</i> are used for model calibration, model selection, and final validation. Model selection suggests that no transitory state during differentiation expresses the DE biomarkers CD117 and CD184, a finding corroborated by existing literature. Additionally, space-limited growth models, such as logistic and Gompertz growth, outperform exponential growth. Validation of the inferred model with leave-out data results in prediction errors of 26.4%. Using the inferred model, it is predicted that the optimal differentiation period is between 1.9 and 2.4 days, plating populations closer to 300 000 cells per well result in the highest yield efficiency, and that iPSC differentiation outpaces the DE proliferation as the main driver of the population dynamics. We also demonstrate that the model can predict the effect of growth modulators on cell population dynamics. Our model serves as a valuable tool for optimizing differentiation protocols, providing insights into developmental biology.

                <p>by John Robertson, Shorya Consul, Haris Vikalo</p>

Motivation: Oncoviruses, pathogens known to cause or increase the risk of cancer, include both common viruses such as human papillomaviruses and rarer pathogens such as human T-lymphotropic viruses. Computational methods for detecting viral DNA from data acquired by modern DNA sequencing technologies have enabled studies of the association between oncoviruses and cancers. Those studies are rendered particularly challenging when multiple species of oncovirus are present in a tumor sample. In such scenarios, merely detecting the presence of a sequencing read of viral origin is insufficiently informative—instead, a more precise characterization of the viral content in the sample is required.
Results: We address this need with NextVir, to our knowledge the first multi-class viral classification framework that adapts genomic foundation models to detecting and classifying sequencing reads of oncoviral origin. Specifically, NextVir explores several foundation models—DNABERT-S, Nucelotide Transformer, and HyenaDNA—and efficiently fine-tunes them to enable accurate identification of the sequencing reads’ origin. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework over existing deep learning methods and suggest downstream potential for foundational models in genomics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013354">Improving cell-type composition inference in spatial transcriptomics with SpaDAMA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lin Huang, Xiaofei Liu, Fangfang Zhu, Wenwen Min</p>

Accurate determination of cell-type composition in disease-relevant tissues is essential for identifying potential disease targets and understanding tissue heterogeneity. Most current spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies lack single-cell resolution, which makes precise cell-type composition identification challenging. Several deconvolution methods have been developed to address this limitation by relying on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to estimate the cell type composition in ST data spots. However, these methods often overlook the inherent differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Domain-Adversarial Masked Autoencoder (SpaDAMA) method. SpaDAMA leverages Domain-Adversarial Learning (DAL) to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from the source domain (pseudo-ST data generated from scRNA-seq) to the target domain (real ST data). Through adversarial training, SpaDAMA harmonizes the distributions of both datasets and maps them onto a unified latent representation, thereby reducing discrepancies in data modalities. Furthermore, to strengthen the model’s capability in extracting reliable features from real ST data, SpaDAMA employs masking strategies that effectively minimize noise and mitigate spatial artifacts. We validated SpaDAMA on 32 simulated datasets and 4 real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in cell-type deconvolution and providing a promising tool for spatial transcriptomic analyses.

                <p>by Emily R. Bozich, Xiaolu Guo, Jennifer L. Wilson, Alexander Hoffmann</p>

Single-cell studies of signal transduction have revealed complex temporal dynamics that determine downstream biological function. For example, the stimulus-specific dynamics of the transcription factor NFκB specify stimulus-specific gene expression programs, and loss of specificity leads to disease. Thus, it is intriguing to consider drugs that may restore signaling specificity in disease contexts, or reduce activity but maintain signaling specificity to avoid unwanted side effects. However, while steady-state dose-response relationships have been the focus of pharmacological studies, there are no established methods for quantifying drug impact on stimulus-response signaling dynamics. Here we evaluated how drug treatments affect the stimulus-specificity of NFκB activation dynamics and its ability to accurately code ligand identity and dose. Specifically, we simulated the dynamic NFκB trajectories in response to 15 stimuli representing various immune threats under treatment of 10 representative drugs across 20 dosage levels. To quantify the effects on coding capacity, we introduced a Stimulus Response Specificity (SRS) score and a stimulus confusion score. We constructed stimulus confusion maps by employing epsilon network clustering in the trajectory space and in various dimensionally reduced spaces: canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), functional principal component analysis (fPCA), and NFκB signaling codons (i.e., established, informative dynamic features). Our results indicated that the SRS score and the stimulus confusion map based on signaling codons are best-suited to quantify stimulus-specific NFκB dynamics confusion under pharmacological perturbations. Using these tools we found that temporal coding capacity of the NFκB signaling network is generally robust to a variety of pharmacological perturbations, thereby enabling the targeting of stimulus-specific dynamics without causing broad side-effects.

                <p>by Yuhang Zhang, Tao Sun, Boyang Zang, Sen Wan</p>

Decoding animal decision-making behavior from neural spike data emerges as a particularly challenging problem in neuroscience. To address this, we have devised a decision-making decoding model, incorporating a channel attention bi-directional long short-term memory network (CA-BiLSTM), with the aim of effectively parsing sparse neural spike data across multiple brain regions. Notably, the attention mechanism embedded within this model serves the crucial purpose of adeptly localizing neurons integral to decision-making stability within the task at hand. Specifically, when applied to the reproducible electrophysiology dataset from the International Brain Laboratory (IBL), our proposed model has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for accurately forecasting decision-making behavior in mice. Consequently, this investigation furnishes a novel perspective for unraveling the intricacies of neural decision-making mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003315">Early epidemiological characteristics explain the chance of population-level virus persistence following spillover events</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Clara L. Shaw, David A. Kennedy</p>

Spillover of viruses into novel host species occurs frequently. Often, spillover results in dead-end infections in novel hosts, sometimes, in stuttering transmission chains that die out, and rarely, in large epidemics with sustained transmission. If we could identify early which outcome will occur following a spillover event, we could more appropriately invest in efforts to surveil, respond to, or prevent disease emergence. Our goal was to identify early epidemiological characteristics that correlate with these outcomes, including those predictive of population-level virus persistence in novel hosts. To identify these characteristics, we experimentally induced spillover in the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> nematode-Orsay virus system and measured infection prevalence in exposed populations and virus shedding and infection intensity from infected hosts in replicate populations of eight strains belonging to seven non-native host species. We then passaged 20 adult nematodes from exposed populations to virus-free plates where they reproduced, initiating new populations to which they had the potential to transmit virus. We used quantitative PCR to track virus presence in passaged host populations for 10 passages or until virus was undetectable, indicating its loss. We then used a correlative modeling and a mechanistic modeling approach to understand which epidemiological characteristics were associated with population-level viral persistence. In our correlative models, we found that the number of passages until virus loss was associated with early epidemiological characteristics in the spillover host populations, including infection prevalence in the initially exposed population, the ability of hosts to detectably shed the virus, and the relative susceptibility of the host species, but not infection intensity. When all these characteristics were included simultaneously in a correlative model, only infection prevalence and shedding were significantly associated with virus maintenance, and the model explained over half of the variation in the data. We then developed a mechanistic model that attempts to explain virus passage success by using our epidemiological characteristics data to calculate the probability that at least one worm infectious enough to infect a conspecific is transferred during passage. This mechanistic model explained 38% of the variation in the data on its own. With the goal of understanding how our mechanistic model falls short, we used model selection to test a suite of larger models that included or excluded each epidemiological characteristic and included random effects of strain, experimental line, passage number, and block while the mechanistic prediction was included as an offset. We found that 66% of the variation in our data could be explained by a model that included our mechanistic prediction in addition to infection prevalence, infection intensity, and random effects. Altogether, our study demonstrates that early epidemiological characteristics can play a substantial role in explaining the ultimate outcome of a spillover event.

<p>Monosynaptic rabies tracing shows that the ventral subiculum and thalamic paraventricular nucleus are sources of input to a nucleus accumbens shell- ventral pallidum pathway involved in modulating dopamine neuron activity.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAcSh) regulates motivation and reward via its dense projection to the ventral pallidum (VP). This ventral striatopallidal system has also been shown to regulate the activity of midbrain dopamine neurons and the release of dopamine in the NAcSh. The present study applied monosynaptic rabies tracing in the rat to quantify the brain-wide sources of synaptic input to neurons in the medial NAcSh that project to the ventromedial VP. The ventral subiculum of the hippocampus (vSub) was the largest source of input cells to the NAcSh-VP projection neurons. Anterograde tracing of vSub-NAcSh projection neurons demonstrated that their fibers terminated densely in the NAcSh largely avoiding other regions of the striatum. Another relatively strong source of input cells included the anterior part of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT). The CA1, lateral septal nucleus, VP, paratenial thalamic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral preoptic area and dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus were moderately strong sources of input neurons. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala were found to be relatively weak sources of input. A lack of sex differences for all the sources of input identified indicates that there is no apparent sexual dimorphism in the afferents to the striatopallidal system. In summary, the vSub and the aPVT are the major sources of cortical and thalamic monosynaptic inputs to the NAcSh-VP projection neurons where these inputs converge to regulate behavior and dopamine release in the NAcSh.</p>

                Guo et al. perform a systematic assessment of genetic dependencies and cell surface targets in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, identifying biomarkers, mapping interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneity, and nominating combination strategies. Experimental validation of dependencies associated with mesenchymal/EMT gene expression signatures identified the CDS2 enzyme as a mesenchymal state selective dependency.

                Ren et al. demonstrate that TCF25 enhances lysosomal acidification via V-ATPase during glucose starvation, promoting autophagy to maintain energy balance. However, prolonged starvation makes TCF25-mediated lysosomal-autophagic activity crucial for ferritinophagy, ultimately causing lysosome-dependent cell death.

                Kim et al. develop a consensus definition for layer 6b (L6b) excitatory neurons in adult mouse neocortex, enabling comparisons of their synaptic organization and function across studies. These neurons project to layer 1; express CTGF, Cplx3, and Nxph4; and project locally and between ipsilateral cortical areas but not to the thalamus.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00944-1?rss=yes">Astrocytes in the medial entorhinal cortex are required for spatial exploration</a></h4>

              
                Huang et al. show that spatial exploration activates astrocytes in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MECII). Visual inputs contribute to this process. They further demonstrate that in vivo suppression of MECII astrocytic activities is sufficient to suppress spatial exploration and MECII neuronal activities.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104856">Multi-omics single-cell analysis reveals key regulators of HIV-1 persistence and aberrant host immune responses in early infection</a></h4>

              
                The clearance of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) remains a significant public health challenge due to impaired cellular immune responses and HIV-1 maintenance during acute infection. However, the genetic and epigenetic changes influencing the immune response on host infected cells remain unclear. Here, this study analyzes HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people living with HIV-1 during early infection (&lt;6 months) using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing. It is observed that HIV-1 hinders the antiviral response, particularly by interfering with the interferon signaling pathway. Multimodal analysis identifies KLF2 as a key transcription factor in infected CD4+ T cells. Moreover, cells harboring HIV-1 provirus are predominantly identified as Th17 cells, which exhibit elevated KLF2 activity. This suggests an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and a constrained immune response due to the quiescent characteristics of these cells. The finding provides insights into the immune mechanisms and key regulators of HIV-1 maintenance in CD4+ T cells during the early stages of infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107622">Response to comment on ‘Criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of consciousness’</a></h4>

              
                In Fahrenfort et al., 2025 we show the influence of non-perceptual criterion shifts on neural measures of consciousness. We fully agree (and point out in our article) that it was already known that subjective measures are sensitive to criterion confounds, and we are happy to read that this is acknowledged by Sandberg and Overgaard in their comment (Sandberg and Overgaard, 2025). However, we contest that the main findings of our simulations and empirical studies had already been demonstrated. Several findings from our studies are novel, such as the fact that criterion effects reveal themselves as over- (or under-) estimations of both conscious and unconscious processing in tandem, and that this has tangible implications when analyzing real neural data. We also challenge the suggestion that our experimental manipulations are (too) radical compared to signal-to-noise variations that occur naturally between experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84749">Migrating mesoderm cells self-organize into a dynamic meshwork structure during chick gastrulation</a></h4>

              
                Migration of cell populations is a fundamental process in morphogenesis and disease. The mechanisms of collective cell migration of epithelial cell populations have been well studied. It remains unclear, however, how the highly motile mesenchymal cells, which migrate extensively throughout the embryo, are connected with each other and coordinated as a collective. During chick gastrulation, cells emerging from the primitive streak and migrating in the 3D space between ectoderm and endoderm (mesoderm region) exhibit a novel form of collective migration. Using live imaging and quantitative analysis, such as topological data analysis (TDA), we found that these cells undergo a novel form of collective migration, in which they form a meshwork structure while moving away from the primitive streak. Overexpressing a mutant form of N-cadherin was associated with reduced speed of tissue progression and directionality of the collective cell movement, whereas the speed of individual cells remains unchanged. To investigate how this meshwork arises, we utilized an agent-based theoretical model, which suggests that cell elongation, cell-cell adhesion, and cell density are the key parameters for the meshwork formation. These data provide novel insights into how a supracellular structure of migrating mesenchymal cells may arise in loosely connected cell populations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105264">A Commander-independent function of COMMD3 in endosomal trafficking</a></h4>

              
                Endosomal recycling is a branch of intracellular membrane trafficking that retrieves endocytosed cargo proteins from early and late endosomes to prevent their degradation in lysosomes. A key player in endosomal recycling is the Commander complex, a 16-subunit protein assembly that cooperates with other endosomal factors to recruit cargo proteins and facilitate the formation of tubulo-vesicular carriers. While the crucial role of Commander in endosomal recycling is well established, its molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we genetically dissected the Commander complex using unbiased genetic screens and comparative targeted mutations. Unexpectedly, our findings revealed a Commander-independent function for COMMD3, a subunit of the Commander complex, in endosomal recycling. COMMD3 regulates a subset of cargo proteins independently of the other Commander subunits. The Commander-independent function of COMMD3 is mediated by its N-terminal domain (NTD), which binds and stabilizes ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTPase regulating endosomal recycling. Mutations disrupting the COMMD3-ARF1 interaction diminish ARF1 expression and impair COMMD3-dependent cargo recycling. These data provide direct evidence that Commander subunits can function outside the holo-complex and raise the intriguing possibility that components of other membrane trafficking complexes may also possess functions beyond their respective complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106963">Comment on ‘Criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of consciousness’</a></h4>

              
                In a recent article Fahrenfort and colleagues demonstrate that auditory and monetary punishment change the criteria that participants use to rate the clarity of perception (Fahrenfort et al., 2025). This leads them to conclude that “subjective measures do not reliably measure the construct they intend to measure” and that their construct validity is threatened. Here, we argue that the main findings had already been demonstrated in other experiments, and the general limitations of subjective measures has been known for decades without the field dismissing their usefulness. We further argue that the experimental manipulations of Fahrenfort and colleagues are so radical that they could be used to invalidate essentially any psychological/cognitive test. In our view, both of the above-mentioned conclusions are thus inappropriate considering the evidence presented, and we believe that the take-home message both before and after the study of Fahrenfort and colleagues is to acknowledge the limitations of subjective reports when they are used.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Brain commissures are antiparallel white matter fiber bundles that connect both hemispheres across the midsagittal plane at different anatomical levels. In the mammalian brain, the best-known commissures are the corpus callosum, the anterior and the posterior commissures. Recent studies have identified a new white matter pathway, the thalamic commissures (TCs), that connect the cortex to the contralateral thalamus in rodents and primates. However, the specific cortical regions that project via the TCs and their target thalamic nuclei are still unknown. To thoroughly and accurately map this projectome, we utilized the mouse Allen Brain Institute connectivity atlas. Our results indicate that not all cortical regions project via the TCs, with most of these regions concentrated in the rostral portion of the brain. In addition, our data suggest that the TCs projections are very numerous, although less robust than the ipsilateral counterpart. Furthermore, these projections had a high degree of bilateral symmetry. We did not find any projections from the thalamus to the contralateral cortex, suggesting that the TCs are not reciprocal. Our findings reinforce the concept of the thalamus as an interhemispheric connectivity hub and suggest that the TCs might play a role in interhemispheric functional modulation.</span>

                <p>Cognitive, social behavior, speech, and motor skills are known challenges for people with trisomy 21/Down syndrome (DS), but the precise mechanisms that lead to these impactful changes have not yet been described. Data from human and mouse model fetal brains indicate that alterations in prenatal neurogenesis might account for the neurological phenotypes that manifest after birth. Here, we evaluated key features of cortical neurogenesis in the humanized mouse model of DS (TcMAC21 of undetermined sex) to test whether and how the presence of the human HSA21q transchromosome impacts cortical development. Brain growth measurements throughout the second half of gestation and at several periods of postnatal development show overall that the TcMAC21 brain phenotype is less severe than in other DS mouse models that have less genetic similarity to humans with DS. However, despite the lack of gross changes in brain growth, we uncovered a significant temporally limited neurogenesis defect at midgestation that correlates with long-lasting effects on neuronal dispersion and neuronal function in the neocortex. Using Cre/Lox-mediated genetic fate mapping, we discovered a transient reduction in neocortical basal intermediate progenitor cells (bIPCs) and that bIPC neuronal progeny are underrepresented in the superficial layers of the neocortex. This change in neuronal production is associated with cortical activity changes after birth. Altogether, our data isolate the cell types associated with a very specific temporal change in cortical formation that, due to the high levels of excitability of bIPC-derived neurons, creates lasting effects on network activity and circuit development in trisomic brains.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/34/e0050252025?rss=1">Isolating Brain Mechanisms of Expectancy Effects on Pain: Cue-Based Stimulus Expectancies versus Placebo-Based Treatment Expectancies</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clinical trials, laboratory experiments, and neuroimaging studies provide converging evidence that pain is highly sensitive to expectations, whether based on the psychosocial context surrounding treatment (e.g., placebo analgesia) or transient cues that provide information about painful events (e.g., pain-predictive cues). We asked whether placebo analgesia and pain-predictive cues modulate pain through the same mechanisms or dissociable brain pathways. Forty healthy volunteers of both sexes rated pain in response to noxious heat during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We crossed pain-predictive cues, which induce expectations for high or low pain on a trial-by-trial basis, with administration of an inert placebo cream or a control cream. Behavioral analyses revealed a significant interaction, such that predictive cues had weaker effects on pain during placebo blocks than control blocks. This interaction was accompanied by interactions in the insula, pons, and other brain regions. We also observed distinct neural substrates when we compared pure cue effects with pure placebo effects, and only predictive cues modulated responses in nociceptive regions and the neurologic pain signature (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B49">Wager et al., 2013</cross-ref>). The only regions that were influenced similarly by both types of expectations were the rostral anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that cue-based expectations about stimulus intensity and placebo-based expectations about treatment outcomes are distinct and that pain researchers should differentiate between sources of expectations. Furthermore, cue-based expectations were associated with more consistent effects than treatment-based expectations, suggesting that clinicians should be particularly mindful of how they present information about impending pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/34/e0089252025?rss=1">Locally Induced Traveling Waves Generate Globally Observable Traveling Waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical traveling waves have been proposed as a fundamental mechanism for neural communication and computation. Methodological uncertainties currently limit the interpretability of noninvasive, extracranial traveling wave data, sparking debates about their cortical origin. Studies using EEG or MEG typically report waves that cover large portions of the sensor array which are often interpreted as reflecting long range cortical waves. Meanwhile, invasive, intracranial recordings in humans and animals routinely find both local, mesoscopic waves and large-scale, macroscopic waves in cortex. Whether the global sensor array waves found with EEG/MEG necessarily correspond to macroscopic cortical waves or whether they are merely projections of local dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we made use of the well-established retinotopic organization of early visual cortex to generate traveling waves with known properties in human participants (<I>N</I> = 19, 10 female, 9 male) via targeted visual stimulation, while simultaneously recording MEG and EEG. The inducer stimuli were designed to elicit waves whose traveling direction in mesoscopic retinotopic visual areas depends on stimulus direction, while leaving macroscopic activation patterns along the visual hierarchy largely unchanged. We observed that the preferred direction of traveling waves across the sensor array was influenced by that of the visual stimulus, but only at the stimulation frequency. Comparison between single-trial and trial-averaged responses further showed considerable temporal variation in traveling wave patterns across trials. Our results highlight that under tight experimental control, noninvasive, extracranial recordings can recover mesoscopic traveling wave activity, thus making them viable tools for the investigation of spatially constrained wave dynamics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/34/e0179252025?rss=1">Neural Sensitivity to Radial Frequency Patterns in the Visual Cortex of Developing Macaques</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual resolution, contrast sensitivity, and form perception improve gradually with age. In nonhuman primates, the sensitivity and resolution of cells in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, and primary visual cortex (V1) also improve, but not enough to account for the perceptual changes. So, what aspects of visual system development limit visual sensitivity in infants? Improvements in behavioral sensitivity might arise from maturation of regions downstream of V1 such as V2, V4, and IT, which are thought to support increasingly complex perceptual abilities. We recorded the responses of populations of neurons in areas V1, V2, V4, and PIT to radial frequency patterns&mdash;a type of global form stimulus. Subjects were three young monkeys (two female, one male) between the ages of 19 and 54&nbsp;weeks and a single adult animal (male). We found that neurons and neural populations in V4 reliably encoded global form in radial frequency stimuli at the earliest ages we studied, while V1 neurons do not. V2 and PIT populations also showed some degree of selectivity for these patterns at early ages, especially at higher radial frequency values. We did not find significant, systematic changes in neural decoding performance that could account for the improvement in behavioral performance over the same age range in an overlapping group of animals (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B68">Rodriguez Deliz et al., 2024</cross-ref>). Finally, consistent with our prior behavioral results, neural populations in V4 show highest sensitivity for the higher radial frequency values, which contain the highest concentration of curvature and orientation cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/34/e0381252025?rss=1">Increased Sleep Spindles in Regions Engaged during Motor Learning Predict Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sleep spindles play a critical role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Although spindles can occur widely across the cortex, they are often focal. Focal spindles may promote plasticity in distinct circuits to consolidate specific memory types. In this study, we simultaneously acquired EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 25 healthy adults (six females) during daytime naps to investigate whether learning the finger tapping motor sequence task (MST) preferentially increases spindle density (#/min) within cortical regions engaged during task performance and whether these task-related spindle increases predict performance improvement measured after the nap. We employed a novel algorithm to project EEG/MEG signals into source space using anatomical constraints from MRI and detected spindles in cortical regions. Compared with a baseline nap, MST training preferentially increased spindle density in regions engaged while learning, which in turn predicted postnap performance improvement. Learning during training and postnap improvement were not correlated, suggesting that they reflect discrete processes. They also had different neural correlates. Whereas learning during training correlated with spindle density increases in motor execution regions, postnap improvement correlated with increases in motor planning regions. We speculate that spindles in motor execution regions represent the memory, while those in planning regions enhance future performance. Our findings demonstrate that spindle expression is influenced by prior learning and support the theory that spindles in task-related regions promote the neural plasticity necessary for motor memory consolidation. We propose that spindles in task-related regions may be more sensitive biomarkers of learning and sleep-dependent memory consolidation than those occurring elsewhere.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/34/e0593252025?rss=1">Cell Type-Dependent Short-Term Plasticity and Dopaminergic Modulation of Sensory Synapses onto Mouse Superficial Dorsal Horn Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>While transient changes in synaptic strength occurring during the repetitive firing of primary afferent inputs to the spinal superficial dorsal horn (SDH) are predicted to strongly influence the fidelity with which nociceptive signals are transmitted through the SDH network, little is known about whether the properties of short-term plasticity (STP) at sensory synapses depend on the identity of the postsynaptic target or whether STP is under the control of neuromodulators such as dopamine. Here we investigate these issues using ex vivo patch-clamp recordings from identified lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons, inhibitory interneurons (VGAT+), and putative excitatory interneurons (VGAT&ndash;) in spinal cord slices from adult mice of both sexes. Repeated activation of A-fiber inputs to the SDH evoked short-term depression (STD) across all major subtypes of SDH neurons, although the magnitude of STD was greatest in projection neurons with high-frequency stimulation. Meanwhile, repetitive activation of C-fiber synapses onto GABAergic interneurons evoked more pronounced STD compared with excitatory neurons across a range of stimulation frequencies. Both A-fiber and C-fiber synapses recovered from STD at a similar rate across the different SDH cell types examined. Dopamine (20&nbsp;&micro;M) significantly depressed the overall glutamatergic drive, and reduced afferent-evoked firing, selectively in spinoparabrachial neurons and excitatory interneurons without changes in the properties of STP. Collectively, these findings reveal novel potential mechanisms by which the efficacy of the spinal inhibitory "gate," and thus the gain of ascending nociceptive transmission to the brain, may be rapidly altered during periods of strong sensory input to the SDH network.</p>
