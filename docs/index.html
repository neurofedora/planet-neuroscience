	<p>Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disease characterized by joint swelling, pain, damage to the cartilage, and disability. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory properties of Quantum Health Accelerator&amp;amp;reg; as water enriched with vital bio-quantum information/energy (EW) following complete Freund&amp;amp;rsquo;s adjuvant (CFA)-induced RA in rats. Methods: Forty adult male Wistar rats (180&amp;amp;ndash;220 g) were divided into five groups. Arthritis was induced on day one using a single subcutaneous injection of CFA into the left hind footpad of the rat. Rats were assigned to receive methotrexate (MTX, 2 mg/kg/week, intraperitoneally), EW (orally, instead of normal water ad libitum), or their combination for 29 days. The anti-RA activities were determined by paw edema, joint diameter, arthritis score, and several nociceptive behavioral tests (thermal hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, and tactile allodynia). The levels of inflammatory (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, CRP, RF, and anti-CCP), anti-inflammatory (IL-10), and oxidative stress (NO, MDA, and GSH) markers were measured in serum. In addition, the levels of IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;, IL-4, IL-17, and TGF-&amp;amp;beta; were assessed in the spleen-isolated lymphocytes. Results: We found that treatment with MTX, EW, and their combination remarkably ameliorated thermal hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, and tactile allodynia results following CFA-induced RA in rats. In addition, EW also notably attenuated arthritis score, joint diameter, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative markers while propagating anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative mediators. Conclusions: We reveal that EW possesses anti-arthritic effects, possibly through anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Collectively, EW may be a promising therapeutic agent for treating RA.</p>

                You et al. resolved structures of the motilin receptor (MTLR) with azithromycin and DS-3801b, revealing distinct ligand recognition modes and signaling bias mechanisms. Their findings show how structural features regulate G-protein and β-arrestin pathways, providing insights for the design of next-generation gastrointestinal prokinetic drugs and macrolide antibiotics.

">Indigenous gut microbes modulate neural cell state and neurodegenerative disease susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                The native microbiome influences a plethora of host processes, including neurological function. However, its impacts on diverse brain cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing on hippocampi from wildtype, germ-free mice and reveal the microbiome-dependent transcriptional landscape across all major neural cell types. We found conserved impacts on key adaptive immune and neurodegenerative transcriptional pathways, underscoring the microbiome's contributions to disease-relevant processes. Mono-colonization with select indigenous microbes identified species-specific effects on the transcriptional state of brain myeloid cells. Colonization by Escherichia coli induced a distinct adaptive immune and neurogenerative disease-associated cell state, suggesting increased disease susceptibility. Indeed, E. coli exposure in the 5xFAD mouse model resulted in exacerbated cognitive decline and amyloid pathology, demonstrating its sufficiency to worsen Alzheimer's disease-relevant outcomes. Together, these results emphasize the broad, species-specific, microbiome-dependent consequences on neurological transcriptional state and highlight the capacity of specific microbes to modulate disease susceptibility.

">Accounting for Edge Uncertainty in Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models for Dynamic Network Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) were designed in the social network setting to capture network dynamics representing a variety of influences on network change. The standard framework assumes the observed networks are free of false positive and false negative edges, which may be an unrealistic assumption. We propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) extension to these models, consisting of two components: 1) a latent model, which assumes that the unobserved, true networks evolve according to a Markov process as they do in the SAOM framework; and 2) a measurement model, which describes the conditional distribution of the observed networks given the true networks. An expectation-maximization algorithm is developed for parameter estimation. We address the computational challenge posed by a massive discrete state space, of a size exponentially increasing in the number of vertices, through the use of the missing information principle and particle filtering. We present results from a simulation study, demonstrating our approach offers improvement in accuracy of estimation, in contrast to the standard SAOM, when the underlying networks are observed with noise. We apply our method to functional brain networks inferred from electroencephalogram data, revealing larger effect sizes when compared to the naive approach of fitting the standard SAOM.

	<p>Background and objectives: This study aimed to investigate whether perceptual sensitivity to tactile stimulus is affected by awareness of who controls the stimulus intensity. Methods: Thirteen healthy participants took part in this study. A participant held a dial and an experimenter held the other dial. One dial was to control the intensity of the tactile stimulus while the other (dummy dial) was inactive. The intensity of the tactile stimulus to the participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s index finger providing each 1 s was increased by the participant or by someone else with or without the participants viewing a dial controlling the stimulus intensity. Results and conclusions: The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold, when controlled by the participant, was significantly lower compared to when controlled by someone else, regardless of visual availability. This indicates that awareness of the self-control of the tactile stimulus intensity enhances tactile sensitivity. The electrodermal level immediately preceding the stimulus at the perceptual threshold was significantly lower when the participant controlled the stimulus intensity compared to when it was controlled by someone else, with eyes closed. The electrodermal levels immediately before the perceptual threshold stimulus, when triggered by another person, were significantly higher with the eyes closed. These electrodermal findings suggest that cognitive stress is greater when the timing of the initial tactile perception is difficult to predict.</p>

	<p>Recent studies applying machine learning (ML) to saccade and vergence eye movements have demonstrated the ability to distinguish individuals with dyslexia, learning disorders, or attention disorders from healthy individuals or those with other pathologies. Stroke patients are known to exhibit visual deficits and eye movement disorders. This study focused on saccade and vergence measurements using REMOBI technology V3 and the Pupil Core eye tracker. Eye movement data were automatically analyzed with the AIDEAL V3 (Artificial Intelligence Eye Movement Analysis) cloud software developed by Orasis-Ear. This software computes multiple parameters for each type of eye movement, including the latency, accuracy, velocity, duration, and disconjugacy. Three ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest) were applied to the saccade and vergence eye movement features provided by AIDEAL to identify stroke patients from other groups: a population of children with learning disorders and a population with a broader spectrum of dysfunctions or pathologies (including children and adults). The different classifiers achieved macro F1 scores of up to 75.9% in identifying stroke patients based on the saccade and vergence parameters. An additional ML analysis using age-matched groups of stroke patients and adults or seniors reduced the influence of large age differences. This analysis resulted in even higher F1 scores across all three ML models, as the comparison group predominantly included healthy individuals, including some with presbycusis. In conclusion, ML applied to saccade and vergence eye movement parameters, as measured by the REMOBI and AIDEAL technology, is a sensitive method for the detection of stroke-related sequelae. This approach could be further developed as a clinical tool to evaluate recovery, compensation, and the evolution of neurological deficits in stroke patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between risk-taking behaviors, vestibular symptoms/impairment and perception&amp;amp;ndash;action coupling behavior in recently concussed adolescents. Methods: This study utilized a cross-sectional design to evaluate the early effects of concussion on 12&amp;amp;ndash;18-year-old adolescents (n = 47) recruited from a concussion specialty clinic at their presenting clinical appointment. The Perception&amp;amp;ndash;Action Coupling Task (PACT) was used to assess action boundary perception by evaluating the participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to quickly and accurately determine whether a virtual &amp;amp;ldquo;ball&amp;amp;rdquo; fits in a virtual &amp;amp;ldquo;hole&amp;amp;rdquo;. Accuracy, response time and inverse efficiency were evaluated at the 0.8 and 1.2 ratios of ball&amp;amp;ndash;hole pairings, where 0.8 indicates the ball was slightly smaller than the hole and 1.2 indicates the ball was slightly larger than the hole. The Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) is a computerized test which measures risk-taking behavior by &amp;amp;ldquo;pumping&amp;amp;rdquo; up a balloon. Each pump provides a small amount of virtual money into their bank; the goal is to make as much money as possible without popping the virtual balloon. The Vestibular Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) tool is a brief screening tool designed to identify ocular or vestibular dysfunction following sport-related concussion, where horizontal/vertical vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) and visual motion sensitivity (VMS) are the primary vestibular outcomes. Pearson correlation matrices were developed to evaluate the association between BART, VOMS and PACT outcomes within the study cohort of concussed adolescents. Results: PACT inverse efficiency at the 1.2 ball&amp;amp;ndash;hole ratio was significantly correlated with all three VOMS outcomes (r = 0.33&amp;amp;ndash;0.37). The standard deviation of pump reaction time during BART was significantly correlated with accuracy (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.47) and inverse efficiency (r = 0.42) at the 1.2 ratio. The standard deviation of the total number of pumps during BART was significantly correlated with PACT response time at the 1.2 ratio (r = 0.34). Horizontal VOR correlated with balloons collected (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.30) and balloons popped (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.30). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that risk-taking behaviors and vestibular symptoms/impairment are associated with worse action boundary perception in adolescents following concussion. This relationship is more pronounced in male adolescents than females.</p>

	<p>Background: Embodied cognition is an emerging concept in cognitive science that emphasizes the integral role of perception, action, and bodily experience in shaping human thought and understanding. Recently, a new instrument has been developed called the Automated Test of Embodied Cognition (ATEC), which provides a comprehensive measure of eight domains of embodied cognition. Method: An embodied cognition in an alcohol use disorder (AUD) sample (N = 49) was assessed using ATEC, which employs cognitively demanding physical tasks, like an exercise video, to measure executive functions (EFs), memory, and other cognitive processes &amp;amp;ldquo;in action&amp;amp;rdquo;. Results: Embodied delayed recall was the most frequent impairment (84%), and EF impairments were also common. Among the EF domains, self-regulation was the most frequently impaired at 43%. Using the ATEC total score, 43% of the sample were rated as having a mild or greater level of overall impairment. Strong support for concurrent validity was found for ATEC EF and memory domains when correlated with neurocognitive assessments conceptually related to them. Significant categorical agreement (impaired/not impaired) was also found between neurocognitive testing and ATEC total score. Using the ATEC total score, younger age, higher education, and better premorbid IQ were found to be potential protective factors against cognitive decline. Conclusions: Findings support ATEC&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential for future studies related to AUD and other disorders that may lead to cognitive decline. Embodied cognition may provide new insights into how AUD affects cognition and functioning and be useful to determine what interventions may improve recovery.</p>

Development and association with symptoms of depression and anxiety. [version 1; peer review: awaiting </a></h4>

              
                Background There is a need to go beyond mere measures of time used on social media. Existing tools inadequately capture the multidimensional nature of social media use, leaving a gap for concise yet comprehensive assessment tools. Aims This study aimed to develop a short questionnaire addressing three critical dimensions of social media use: self-presentation, negative experiences, and problematic use. The association between these dimensions and symptoms of anxiety and depression was also investigated. Methods This study uses two independent datasets of adolescents aged 16+ years in Norway. Using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) analyses, a pool of 31 social media items was analyzed to investigate factor structure and associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression. For model development, the “LifeOnSoMe”-study was employed (>3,500 participants), and data from a pilot study (~500 participants) was used for external validation. Results Based on ACO-analyses, a 20-item six-factor model was identified, encompassing social comparison and self-presentation (five items), and three items for each of the following domains: negative experiences (Negative acts and Unwanted attention from others) and problematic use (Subjective overuse, Social obligations, and Source of concern). Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated very good to excellent fit in both datasets, and consistent associations between the six different domains and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Discussion The suggested 20-item questionnaire provides a robust and succinct tool for evaluating social media’s impact on mental health, offering substantial explanatory power for variance in anxiety and depression symptoms. This can serve as meaningful tool for assessing the potential impact of social media use for mental health and related outcomes.

                A growing amount of research is shedding light on nutrient-rich foods and nutritional supplements’ potential health and disease-preventative advantages. Black cumin (Nigella sativa L.), an esteemed nutraceutical herb, is well-known for its multiple health advantages among health-conscious individuals, researchers, and pharmaceutical businesses. Black cumin and its principal bioactive ingredient, thymoquinone (TQ), have been found to lower oxidative stress and inflammation, while also enhancing immunological function, cellular viability, and energy metabolism. They protect against metabolic, cardiovascular, digestive, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, reproductive, and neurological diseases, as well as cancer. Black cumin works as a countermeasure to minimize the toxicity and side effects of pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the possible effects of black cumin on prostate health and disorders like benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are not well understood. This narrative review seeks to reveal knowledge gaps. This study intends to guide future research into the possible uses of black cumin and TQ in prostate health and illness.

Background <p>Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis, adding to strain on healthcare systems. Diagnostic test reporting of norovirus is often delayed, resulting in incomplete data for real-time surveillance.</p> Methods <p>To nowcast the real-time case burden of norovirus a generalised additive model (GAM), semi-mechanistic Bayesian joint process and delay model “epinowcast”, and Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model including syndromic surveillance data were developed. These models were evaluated over weekly nowcasts using a probabilistic scoring framework.</p> Results <p>Using the weighted interval score (WIS) we show a heuristic approach is outperformed by models harnessing time delay corrections, with daily mean WIS = 7.73, 3.03, 2.29 for the baseline, “epinowcast”, and GAM, respectively. Forecasting approaches were reliable in the event of temporally changing reporting values, with WIS = 4.57 for the BSTS model. However, the syndromic surveillance (111 online pathways) did not improve the BSTS model, WIS = 10.28, potentially indicating poor correspondence between surveillance indicators.</p> Interpretation <p>Analysis of surveillance data enhanced by nowcasting delayed reporting improves understanding over simple model assumptions, important for real-time decision making. The modelling approach needs to be informed by the patterns of the reporting delay and can have large impacts on operational performance and insights produced.</p>

Motivated by the spatiotemporal waves of MAPK/ERK activity, crucial for long-range communication in regenerating tissues, we investigated stochastic homoclinic fronts propagating through channels formed by directly interacting cells. We evaluated the efficiency of long-range communication in these channels by examining the rate of information transmission. Our study identified the stochastic phenomena that reduce this rate: front propagation failure, new front spawning, and variability in the front velocity. We found that a trade-off between the frequencies of propagation failures and new front spawning determines the optimal channel width (which geometrically determines the front length). The optimal frequency of initiating new waves is determined by a trade-off between the input information rate (higher with more frequent initiation) and the fidelity of information transmission (lower with more frequent initiation). Our analysis provides insight into the relative timescales of intra- and intercellular processes necessary for successful wave propagation.

                <p>by Gayathri Samarasekera, Nancy E. Go, Courtney Choutka, Jing Xu, Yuka Takemon, Jennifer Chan, Michelle Chan, Shivani Perera, Samuel Aparicio, Gregg B. Morin, Marco A. Marra, Suganthi Chittaranjan, Sharon M. Gorski</p>

Cell stress adaptation plays a key role in normal development and in various diseases including cancer. Caspases are activated in response to cell stress, and growing evidence supports their function in non-apoptotic cellular processes. A role for effector caspases in promoting stress-induced cytoprotective autophagy was demonstrated in <i>Drosophila</i>, but has not been explored in the context of human cells. We found a functionally conserved role for effector caspase 3 (CASP3) and caspase 7 (CASP7) in promoting starvation or proteasome inhibition-induced cytoprotective autophagy in human breast cancer cells. The loss of CASP3 and CASP7 resulted in an increase in PARP1 cleavage, reduction in LC3B and ATG7 transcript levels, and a reduction in H2AX phosphorylation, consistent with a block in autophagy and DNA damage-induced stress response pathways. Surprisingly, in non-lethal cell stress conditions, CASP7 underwent non-canonical processing at two calpain cleavage sites flanking a PARP1 exosite, resulting in stable CASP7-p29/p30 fragments. Expression of CASP7-p29/p30 fragment(s) could rescue H2AX phosphorylation in the CASP3 and CASP7 double knockout background. Strikingly, yet consistent with these phenotypes, the loss of CASP3 and CASP7 exhibited synthetic lethality with BRCA1 loss. These findings support a role for human caspases in stress adaptation through PARP1 modulation and reveal new therapeutic avenues for investigation.

                <p>by Oluwamuyiwa T. Amusan, Shuqi Wang, Chaoran Yin, Heather S. Koehler, Yixun Li, Tencho Tenev, Rebecca Wilson, Benjamin Bellenie, Ting Zhang, Jian Wang, Chang Liu, Kim Seong, Seyedeh L. Poorbaghi, Joseph Yates, Yuchen Shen, Jason W. Upton, Pascal Meier, Siddharth Balachandran, Hongyan Guo</p>

Necroptosis initiated by the host sensor Z-NA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is essential for host defense against a growing number of viruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Studies with HSV-1 and other necroptogenic stimuli in murine settings have suggested that ZBP1 triggers necroptosis by directly complexing with the kinase RIPK3. Whether this is also the case in human cells, or whether additional co-factors are needed for ZBP1-mediated necroptosis, is unclear. Here, we show that ZBP1-induced necroptosis in human cells requires RIPK1. We have found that RIPK1 is essential for forming a stable and functional ZBP1-RIPK3 complex in human cells, but is dispensable for the formation of the equivalent murine complex. The receptor-interacting protein (RIP) homology interaction motif (RHIM) in RIPK3 is responsible for this difference between the 2 species, because replacing the RHIM in human RIPK3 with the RHIM from murine RIPK3 is sufficient to overcome the requirement for RIPK1 in human cells. These observations describe a critical mechanistic difference between mice and humans in how ZBP1 engages in necroptosis, with important implications for treating human diseases.

                Background The study examines the impact of mobile phones on the socioeconomic development of rural women in Peru, using data from the National Household Survey from 2016 to 2022. Previous studies have highlighted the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in empowering rural women and reducing the digital gender gap. Method A quantitative approach and a correlational design were applied. The Mincer equation adjusted with the Heckman method was used to estimate the effect of mobile phone use on the income of rural women, considering socioeconomic and demographic variables. The sample included between 1,436 and 1,568 rural Peruvian women per year. Results The results indicate a positive correlation between owning a personal mobile phone and the income of rural women in the period 2016-2019. In 2018, owning a mobile phone was associated with a 39.3% increase in income levels. In 2022, this effect was 49.9%. Conclusions It is concluded that the income of rural women in Peru is positively linked to the possession of a mobile phone, but also depends on factors such as years of education, work experience, marital status, household headship, and labor market participation. The findings support the implementation of public policies to reduce the digital gender gap and promote sustainable development.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Investigate the immune system's role in cluster headache by analyzing cytokines in people with cluster headache and headache-free controls, and explore if certain cytokines could predict a specific phenotype.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured 45 cytokines in adult participants from the Danish Cluster Headache Biobank in a prospective case–control setup. People with cluster headache were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders third-edition. Controls were matched for age and sex.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 412 were analyzed deriving from 99 with chronic cluster headache, 108 with episodic cluster headache (ECH) in bout, 105 with ECH in remission, and 100 successfully matched controls. Compared with controls, 13 cytokines were altered for ECH in bout (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), 3 in remission (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and 10 for chronic cluster headache (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Oncostatin m was significantly elevated in all 3 disease states compared with controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Overall, the investigated cytokines showed distinct patterns of alterations between chronic cluster headache and episodic cluster headache in bout and, interestingly, IL-1β was significantly associated with having chronic cluster headache rather than episodic in bout in a logistic regression model adjusting for potential confounders (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Findings show that the immune system is altered in all 3 states of cluster headache compared with controls. Oncostatin m was elevated, constituting a promising target for future studies. The distinct alterations between episodic and chronic cluster headache are striking and urges further research of the immune system in cluster headache to better understand its potential role in prediction of disease activity and treatment response.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gain-of-function (GoF) variants in <i>KCNT1</i> encoding for potassium channels are associated with different epilepsy phenotypes, including epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS), other early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, and focal epilepsy. Fluoxetine blocks currents from both wild-type (WT) and mutant KCNT1 channels with GoF in vitro features. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with fluoxetine might improve clinical outcome in patients with EIMFS carrying GoF variants in KCNT1 channels showing in vitro sensitivity to fluoxetine blockade.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled three pediatric patients carring de novo KCNT1 genetic variants linked to EIMFS. Functional and pharmacological studies to assess fluoxetine's ability to counteract in vitro variant-induced functional effects were performed with patch-clamp electrophysiology on heterologous channel expression in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells. Neuropsychological assessment, electroencephalogram and seizure diary were evaluated at baseline and every 3 months during the study. Electrocardiography and blood levels of medications were monitored for safety.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All 3 <i>KCNT1</i> variants displayed GoF effects in vitro. Exposure to fluoxetine (10μM) blocked both WT and mutant KCNT1 channels, therefore, counteracting variant-induced functional effects. Treatment with fluoxetine caused a variable reduction of seizure frequency (25–75%). Improvement in visual attention, participation, and muscle tone was also reported. No adverse events were reported except for transient dyskinesia in 1 patient, which was probably related to an increase in fluoxetine plasma level.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fluoxetine may be a potential targeted medication in EIMFS caused by <i>KCNT1</i> GoF variants. Further research is needed to assess its long-term efficacy and safety. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) metrics, a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep physiological rhythm, among recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and individuals at high and low risk for developing PD based on genetic and prodromal risk.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cross-sectional exploratory study, participants underwent clinical, cognitive, and motor evaluation to compute risk based on the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) prodromal criteria and a standard overnight polysomnography. CAP rate, CAP index, A index subtypes, number of CAP sequences, and CAP sequence duration were computed from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 30 patients with early PD (mean age = 62.80 ± 7.69, disease duration = 1.10 ± 1.09), 26 participants at risk for PD (age = 64.88 ± 10.09), and 36 participants with low risk for PD (age = 56.83 ± 7.41). Despite comparable macrosleep architecture, most CAP measures were significantly lower in patients with PD compared with the low-risk group, whereas the at-risk group showed transitional values between PD and the low-risk group. The A2 index was significantly lower in both the at-risk and PD groups from the low-risk group (at risk = 7.59 ± 4.59; PD = 7.71 ± 5.83; and low risk = 12.85 ± 8.63; <i>p</i> = 0.010). Lower CAP rate and lower CAP index were associated with greater disease severity (<i>r</i> = −0.23 and − 0.24, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with early clinical PD exhibit alterations in CAP dynamics despite having comparable macrosleep architecture. Alterations of the NREM microsleep structure may occur early in the neurodegenerative process and the A2 index may be an early event in the evolution of the disease with the potential to serve as an early marker for disease progression.

                Background According to “Data Bridge Market Research”, tiny houses are increasingly popular, encouraging people globally to downsize and minimize their ecological footprint. Egypt ranks as one of the nations listed in the worldwide tiny house industry, with a notable increase in interest from 2022 to 2029. This can be developed using sustainable, energy-efficient materials that enhance insulation and thermal comfort, making them an affordable and environmentally friendly option. The study aims to demonstrate how applying insulation to walls and roofs can facilitate a transition from unsustainable lifestyles to more sustainable, economical living, ultimately benefiting both individuals and the environment. Methods This study focuses on the concept of tiny housing, environmental sustainability, and guidelines that are applicable during any step of the design procedure. Four thermal insulation materials will be assessed with a passive design approach on a 40 square metre tiny house, with the help of “Design Builder” software, applied to the walls and roof to discover which material possesses the greatest energy efficiency while lowering the energy consumptions. Results Results showed that the base case scenario achieved 30.96% of the total hours feeling discomfort, and after applying the four insulative materials on a 40 square meters tiny housing, the cellulose insulation has proved to be the most effective one among the others in Faiyum, Egypt, experiencing 24.49% of the total hours being discomfort, with 20.92% highest reduction. PPD% has been examined as well for all four scenarios, proving that the cellulose insulation with a 52.36 PPD% showed a 12.28 PPD% reduction. Conclusion Given Egypt’s financial challenges, architects must prioritize thermal considerations and insulative materials in construction. This study evaluates thermal performance between a no-insulation case and four scenarios using common insulative materials to enhance thermal comfort in Fayium housing, Egypt.

                Robot-assisted therapy is a promising approach to enhance stroke rehabilitation, particularly in improving upper-limb function through intensive and repetitive training. Successful integration of technology into clinical practice relies on therapists’ acceptance and endorsement. Our purpose is to share the perspectives of the occupational therapists who facilitate robot-assisted therapy and the benefits and challenges of practical implementation of the robot. Clinicians who worked with stroke survivors to research the usability, feasibility, and efficacy of the Harmony exoskeleton discuss their impressions of the technology on stroke rehabilitation. Overall, therapists expressed positive views on the therapeutic and adjunctive use of robot-assisted technology, emphasizing patient engagement, objective evaluations of progress, and ease of certain aspects of their role. Additional feedback highlighted the Harmony exoskeleton’s ability to promote neuromuscular re-education and foster neuroplasticity. Barriers to implementation include physical capabilities, patient suitability, technical difficulties, and the need for advanced quantitative feedback and data analysis. To maximize the impact of robot-assisted therapy in stroke rehabilitation, ongoing research and development are necessary to address identified challenges. Improved limb support, quantitative feedback, equipment reliability, and more levels of weight support for patients with higher levels of function may improve therapist acceptance of this device and may inform exoskeleton development.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ability to navigate spatially in the physical world is a fundamental cognitive skill. This study examines the anatomical correlates of map-assisted wayfinding in an unfamiliar virtual environment using structural magnetic resonance magining (MRI). Thirty-three participants were required to reach up to seven different locations represented on a navigational map in a simulated environment, while their gazing behavior was recorded, and, in close temporal proximity, the anatomical MRI of their brain was acquired. Significant predictors of wayfinding performance were the volumes of the right hippocampus, left retrosplenial cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex—left inferior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, and right cerebellar lobule VIIB. Detailed analyses revealed a dissociation between two clusters of gray matter density in the right hippocampus. Compared with the poorest wayfinders, the best wayfinders exhibited more gray matter density in a cluster located in the right posterior hippocampus but less gray matter density in a cluster located in the anterior section of the hippocampus. In addition, top performers spent more time gazing at the map, highlighting the benefit of using external aids during navigation tasks. Altogether, these results underscore how structural adaptations are associated with spatial navigation performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70004?af=R">The Modulation by the Locus Coeruleus of Recent and Remote Memory Retrieval is Activity‐Dependent</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus plays a crucial role in acquiring, storing, and retrieving associative experience. Whereas neuromodulatory control of the hippocampus by the locus coeruleus (LC) enhances memory acquisition and consolidation, less is known about its influence on memory retrieval. The LC fires at tonic (0.5–8 Hz) and phasic frequencies (10–25 Hz), relative to arousal and affective states. Here, we explored to what extent LC stimulation at different frequencies (2–100 Hz) and respective stimulation patterns, before retrieval of recently acquired or remote spatial memory, alter working memory (WM) or reference memory (RM) in male rats. Here, animals learned a spatial memory task in an eight-arm radial maze over a period of 15 days. LC stimulation before recent memory testing did not affect WM. However, LC stimulation at 20 or 100 Hz, but not 5–10 Hz, impaired retrieval of recently consolidated RM. These frequency-dependent impairments were abolished by intracerebral β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR), but not D1/D5 receptor, antagonism. When memory retrieval was assessed 4 weeks after initial consolidation (Day 34), RM was significantly impaired compared to the final day of recent memory testing (on Day 6). RM was not altered by LC stimulation before remote memory retrieval. However, LC stimulation at 2–100 Hz improved WM. Taken together, these data suggest that frequency-dependent NA release from the LC disrupts retrieval of recently acquired RM via activation of β-AR. Strikingly, increasing LC activity <i>in general</i> improves WM of a remotely acquired spatial learning task, assessed 4 weeks after the recent memory testing, suggesting that the increased effort of sustaining WM of a task learned in the past requires higher LC engagement.</p>

                Guo et al. demonstrate that the spatial segregation of EPI/PrE precursors during the second cell fate decision of mammalian embryos is driven by blastocyst cavity oscillation. By combining experiments and computational simulations, they show that cavity oscillation promotes cell-cell contact fluctuations and convergent cell flows, leading to EPI/PrE precursor segregation.

                Schulz et al. demonstrate how neural encoding and decoding can be cast as computing conditional distributions and how to modify variational autoencoders (VAEs) to calculate such distributions. The proposed VAE-masking scheme allows for joint dimensionality reduction of neural and behavioral data and conditional generation of one modality given the other.

">Reward-based prosocial choices in mice</a></h4>

              
                Prosocial behaviors, actions that benefit others, are an essential part of the social life of humans and other animals, by promoting bonding and cohesion among individuals and groups. Here we present a new behavioural paradigm to assess prosociality in food foraging contexts in laboratory mice, based in our paradigm previously developed for rats. In this task, the decision-maker can choose between two options, one that will only provide rewards to itself (selfish choice) or one that will reward both itself and its cagemate (prosocial choice). Our work reveals that prosocial choices in male mice are not widespread and are only observed in a small proportion of animals. Using detailed analysis of behavior, we describe that recipients of help express different social cues in prosocial and selfish trials, but decision makers do not take them into account to guide their choices. Furthermore, we assess how the level of individual training and the physical layout of the paradigm might affect the performance in this social task. Only those mice with increased social attention (16% of the animals) display prosocial preferences, suggesting these to be rooted in similar behavioural factors and social interactions that we previously described in other work with rats.

">DMC-BrainMap - an open-source, end-to-end tool for multi-feature brain mapping across species</a></h4>

              
                A central goal of current neuroscience research is to understand how behavior emerges from neuronal circuit activity. For this, cellular and circuit components in intact brains need to be identified and studied using e.g. viral tracing, electrophysiology, imaging, activity perturbations, and behavior. A commonality of these approaches is the need to establish the anatomical locations of both experimental parameters (e.g. recording/injection sites) and circuit components (e.g. cell bodies/projections). The development of standardized coordinate systems, i.e. reference brain atlases, has proven essential for reproducible, cross-laboratory mapping of anatomical data. However, the process of mapping, analyzing, and visualizing anatomical data remains challenging, especially for users lacking programming expertise. Here, we introduce DMC-BrainMap, an open-source napari plugin designed as a user-friendly tool for streamlined processing and whole-brain analysis of anatomical data. The working principle and core functionalities include all steps after image acquisition, i.e., preprocessing of images, registration of images to a reference atlas, segmentation of different anatomical features, and data analysis/visualization. DMC-BrainMap can be applied to histological data obtained from a variety of model organisms at different developmental stages, including mouse, rat, and zebrafish. We demonstrate the utility of DMC-BrainMap by mapping and quantifying cell bodies, axonal densities, injection sites as well as placement of optical fibers and Neuropixels probes. Further, we show how spatial transcriptomics data can be integrated into the DMC-BrainMap workflow. By eliminating the need for programming by the user, DMC-BrainMap provides an easy-to-use tool for increased rigor, reproducibility, and data sharing in neuroscientific research involving animal models.

">A Myosin Nanomotor Essential for Stereocilia Maintenance Expands the Etiology of Hereditary Hearing Loss DFNB3</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear hair cells transduce sound using stereocilia, and disruption to these delicate mechanosensors is a significant cause of hearing loss. Stereocilia architecture is dependent upon the nanomotor myosin 15. A short isoform (MYO15A-2) drives stereocilia development by delivering an elongation-promoting complex (EC) to stereocilia tips, and an alternatively spliced long isoform (MYO15A-1) tunes postnatal size in shorter stereocilia, which possess mechanosensitive ion channels. Disruption of these functions causes two distinct stereocilia pathologies, which underly human autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss DFNB3. Here, we characterize a new isoform, MYO15A-3, that increases expression in postnatal hair cells as the developmental MYO15A-2 isoform wanes reciprocally. We show the critical EC complex is initially delivered by MYO15A-2, followed by a postnatal handover to MYO15A-3, which continues to deliver the EC. In a Myo15a-3 mutant mouse, stereocilia develop normally with correct EC targeting, but lack the EC postnatally and do not maintain their adult architecture, leading to progressive hearing loss. We conclude MYO15A-3 delivers the EC in postnatal hair cells and that the EC and MYO15A-3 are both required to maintain stereocilia integrity. Our results add to the spectrum of stereocilia pathology underlying DFNB3 hearing loss and reveal new molecular mechanisms necessary for resilient hearing during adult life.

">The impact of testosterone on paraventricular nucleus gene expression in male and female spontaneously hypertensive rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hypertension is a polygenic, complex disease that impacts men and women differently; whilst the incidence of high blood pressure (BP) is roughly equal over a lifetime, men typically are at higher risk of developing the disease earlier in life, before 50 years of age. There is adequate evidence that the brain is critical for the BP setpoint. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is an integrative structure that can influence not only neurohumoral responses to blood pressure changes, but also sympathetic drive. Here we manipulate the androgenic status of both male and female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) to determine how this changes gene expression within the PVN of these animals. Methods: SHR (8-weeks old) were either sham-operated or orchiectomized, whereas all females were oophorectomized, half of which received 10mg testosterone propionate subcutaneously. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and testosterone (T) were measured by carotid cannulation and ELISA respectively. Sequencing was performed on hand-punched PVN sections and subjected to robust bioinformatic analysis. Results: in total, 6,571 differentially regulated genes (DRGs) are regulated in the PVN of male and female rats. High T (endogenous or replaced) correlates with higher MAP in both sexes. Orchidectomy-induced T depletion resulted in the significant regulation of 2,104 genes, involved in thousands of biological roles, including ones related to hormone and sex-hormone signalling. In the female SHR, testosterone replacement in oophorectomized animals induced the regulation of 1,727 genes, sharing many biological functions with those in the high T males. We validated key genes by qPCR to determine false discovery rate. Conclusions: T status in hypertensive rats correlates with MAP, and consistent changes in PVN transcriptome

">Disentangling value, arousal and valence systems in approach-avoidance behaviors in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging</a></h4>

              
                Appetitive and aversive stimuli evoke approach and avoidance behaviors essential for survival and well-being. While affective processing has been extensively examined in terms of arousal and valence, the extent to which value processing is independent from arousal and valence processing in naturalistic contexts remains unclear. We addressed this gap using a naturalistic approach-avoidance task. Ninety-one human participants underwent functional MRI scanning while engaging in approach-avoidance tasks involving two levels of threat (mild or aversive electrical stimulation) and reward (monetary gains). We estimated effect sizes (Cohen's D) across subjects for increasing levels of threat, reward and arousal; for valence (negative vs positive); and for valence-arousal interactions. Effect sizes for threat and reward were strongly positively correlated across brain voxels (r = 0.82), suggesting a strong influence of a shared factor. Spatial independent component analysis decomposed these effect sizes into two independent latent factors, one that represented arousal processing and another that exhibited characteristics of value processing. Importantly, we predicted that valence-arousal interaction effects would increase with latent value effects across voxels, since both valence and arousal contribute to our overall valuation process. We indeed found this to be true. Furthermore, sizable latent value effects were observed in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, areas also involved in attention and executive control. Thus, our findings revealed a value system in the human brain that could operate independently of arousal and valence systems during naturalistic approach-avoidance behaviors, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of affective processing.

">In vitro cellular phenotypes of cortical neurons from R255X MECP2 knock-in mice are improved by either expression of wildtype MeCP2 or read-through with G418</a></h4>

              
                Approximately 60% of individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) carry a nonsense variant in the MECP2 gene; thus, there is an unmet need to identify novel nonsense suppression compound(s) that can restore full length MeCP2 protein levels and function. Here, we characterized neuronal phenotypes in cultured cortical neurons from newborn knock-in mice harboring the MECP2 R255X variant. After 2 weeks in vitro, R255X mutant neurons showed smaller cell bodies, shorter dendrites, fewer dendritic branches, and a lower density of excitatory synapses when compared to wildtype (WT) neurons. Transduction of AAV9-MeCP2-GFP in R255X mutant neurons made these cellular phenotypes similar to those in WT neurons, including soma size, dendritic length and branching, and excitatory synapse density. As proof of principle for the potential clinical use of read-through compounds, cultured R255X mutant neurons treated with the aminoglycoside G418 for 72h in vitro showed cell body size and excitatory synapse density similar to WT neurons. We expect these combined approaches will identify effective compounds to suppress translation termination at a premature termination codon, which can be moved to further preclinical functional and behavioral studies in R255X MECP2 knock-in mice.

">Environmentally Relevant Lead Exposure Alters Cell Morphology and Expression of Neural Hallmarks During SH-SY5Y Neuronal Differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Lead (Pb) continues to be a public health burden, in the US and around the world, and yet the effects of historical and current exposure levels on neurogenesis are not fully understood. Here we examine the effects of a range of environmentally relevant Pb concentrations (0.16uM, 1.26uM, and 10uM Pb) relative to control on neural differentiation in the SH-SY5Y cell model. Pb exposure began on Day 5 and continued throughout differentiation at Day 18. We assessed morphological measures related to neurogenesis at several time points during this process, including the expression of proteins key in neural differentiation (B-tubulin III and GAP43), cell number and size, as well as the development of neurites. The bulk of detectable changes occurred with 10uM Pb exposure, most notably that of B-tubulin III and GAP43 expression. Effects with the 0.16uM and 1.26uM Pb exposure conditions increased as differentiation progressed, with significant reductions in cell and nuclear size as well as the number and length of neural projections by Day 18. Best benchmark concentration (BMC) analysis revealed many of these metrics to be susceptible to levels of Pb at or below historically relevant levels. This work highlights the disruption of neurite formation and protein expression as potential new mechanisms by which environmentally relevant Pb exposure impacts neurogenesis and morphology and perturb cognitive health throughout the life course.

">FMRP Regulates Neuronal RNA Granules Containing Stalled Ribosomes, Not Where Ribosomes Stall</a></h4>

              
                Local protein synthesis is a crucial process that maintains synaptic proteostasis. A large percentage of mRNAs translated in developing neurons are associated with stalled ribosomes. FMRP, the protein lost in Fragile X syndrome, is highly enriched in RNA granules that contain stalled ribosomes. Previous examination of ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) from stalled neuronal ribosomes has identified motifs that match those found in mRNAs associated with FMRP, as recognized by FMRP cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) (Anadolu et al, 2023, Journal of Neuroscience doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1002-22.2023). To investigate whether FMRP recognition of these sequences is important for determining where ribosomes are stalled on mRNAs, we examined stalled ribosomes RPFs isolated from P5 mice of both sexes lacking the FMRP protein. We found that the loss of FMRP had no effect on the proteins associated with neuronal stalled ribosomes, the structure of the ribosomes, or the stalling sites (locations where RPFs accumulated). However, we observed a significant decrease in the amount of mRNAs previously shown to be associated with FMRP by CLIP in stalled ribosomes. Additionally, the number of neuronal RNA granules containing stalled ribosomes, as assayed by ribopuromycylation in distal neurites, decreased. Unlike neuronal RNA granules in WT neurons, the remaining distal neuronal RNA granules were resistant to reactivation by stimuli that induce mGLuR-LTD. These results highlight important roles of FMRP in regulating neuronal RNA granules that contain stalled ribosomes, though it does not influence where ribosomes are stalled and is not directly involved in stalled ribosome formation.

">Rationally Designed PKD1 Activator Protects Against Neurodegeneration in Pre-clinical Models of Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Oxidative stress leads to degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). The key signal transduction and regulatory networks that are involved during this degenerative process in PD are currently being investigated for novel neuro-protective strategies. We recently discovered that the activation of Protein Kinase D1 (PKD1) acts as a novel compensatory mechanism in PD models and positive modulation of PKD1 can be a therapeutic strategy. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to take a translational approach by developing a PKD1 activator and characterizing the protective function in pre-clinical models of PD. Positive genetic modulation of PKD1 by overexpression of constitutively active PKD1 protected against MPP+ induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Pharmacological activation by Rosiglitazone protected, whereas inhibition by kb NB 142-70 exacerbated against MPP+ and 6-OHDA toxicity in cell culture PD models. Importantly, peptides were rationally designed and screened for their ability to activate PKD1 using our screening methods. Peptide AK-P4 was identified to activate PKD1 specifically and protect against MPP+ and 6-OHDA in both N27 cells and primary mesencephalic neurons. Further AK-P4 tagged with TAT sequence (AK-P4T) delivered using intra-venous injections activated PKD1 in mice. The neuro-protective effects of AK-P4T were tested using the sub-chronic MPTP mice model. Co-treatment with AK-P4T significantly restored the neurotransmitter levels and the behavioral and locomotory activities of the MPTP mouse model of PD. Collectively, our results demonstrate that rationally designed PKD1 activator peptide AK-P4T positively modulated PKD1 and protected against neurodegeneration in the pre-clinical models of PD. Our results suggest that positive modulation of the PKD1 using AK-P4T shows promise as a potential therapeutic agent against PD.

">Cholesterol taste avoidance in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                The question as to whether animals taste cholesterol taste is not resolved. This study investigates whether the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is capable of detecting cholesterol through their gustatory system. We found that flies are indifferent to low levels of cholesterol and avoid higher levels. The avoidance is mediated by gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), demonstrating that flies can taste cholesterol. The cholesterol responsive GRNs comprise a subset that also respond to bitter substances. Cholesterol detection depends on five ionotropic receptor (IR) family members, and disrupting any of these genes impairs the flies' ability to avoid cholesterol. Ectopic expressions of these IRs in GRNs reveals two classes of cholesterol receptors, each with three shared IRs and one unique subunit. Additionally, expressing cholesterol receptors in sugar-responsive GRNs confers attraction to cholesterol. This study reveals that flies can taste cholesterol, and that the detection depends on IRs in GRNs.

">China Autism Brain Imaging Consortium: Charting Brain Growth in Chinese Children with Autism</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition characterized by atypical brain growth. While advances in neuroimaging and openly sharing large-sample datasets such as the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) have improved understanding of ASD, most studies focus on adolescents and adults, with early brain development-critical for diagnosis and intervention-remaining underexplored. Existing research predominantly involves Western samples, offering limited insight and generalizability into non-Caucasian populations. We introduce the China Autism Brain Imaging Consortium (CABIC) (https://php.bdnilab.com/resources/), a grassroots effort by researchers across the country to aggregate previously collected multi-site structural MRI datasets and phenotypic information from 1,451 autistic children and 1,119 typically developing children, covering an age range from early childhood to school age (1.0 - 12.92 years). Here, we present this resource and depict brain growth charts to push forward a more comprehensive understanding of the brain development in Chinese autism children. We constructed brain growth charts that reveal a developmental shift in autistic children, transitioning from early overgrowth to delayed maturation. Regional analyses identified distinct atypical trajectories across specific brain regions. Individual deviation scores quantified inter-subject variability, characterizing the heterogeneity of brain development in ASD. Comparative analyses between CABIC and ABIDE highlighted differences potentially attributable to ethnicity and culture, advancing our understanding of cross-population neurodevelopmental diversity. CABIC MRI datasets will be shared publicly to foster investigation of the potential neural mechanisms underlying ASD in non-Western populations and support efforts toward precision medicine for autistic individuals across diverse backgrounds.

">Saturation kinetics and specificity of transporters for L-arginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) at the blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers.</a></h4>

              
                Nitric oxide synthases (NOS) synthesize nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine in endothelial and neuronal cells.  Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a homologue of arginine and an endogenous inhibitor of NOS.  As NO is a critical signalling molecule and influences physiological pathways in health and disease, the transfer of arginine and ADMA across the blood-CNS barriers is of interest.  Our research group have previously demonstrated the presence of saturable transporters for [3H]-L-arginine and [3H]-ADMA at the blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers using in vitro and in situ methods.  In this study, we determine the identity and kinetic characteristics of these transporters by means of the in situ brain/choroid plexus perfusion technique in anaesthetised mice.  Results indicated that [3H]-arginine and [3H]-ADMA could be transported across blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers by the cationic amino acid transporter, system-y+.  In contrast to the results obtained with arginine where transport was predominately by a single transport system (system-y+), ADMA delivery to the CNS was more complex and involved multiple transport systems (system y+, B0,+, y+L and b0,+) suggesting its concentration is tightly regulated.  System y+ and system y+L transporters could be involved in the CNS to blood efflux of ADMA that we have previously observed.  The half-saturation constant (Km) and maximal influx rate of the saturable component (Vmax) for [3H]-ADMA transport into the frontal cortex was 29.07{+/-}7.19 mM and 0.307{+/-}0.017 nmol.min-1.g-1, respectively, and into the CSF was 30.59{+/-}25.41 M and 2.07{+/-}0.38 nmol.min-1.g-1, respectively.  This information could help explain the arginine paradox providing evidence that ADMA interacts with transporters that can remove ADMA from cells.  These removal mechanisms could be stimulated by excess arginine in the plasma resulting in increased NO production.  It remains to be seen if arginine supplementation could be used to increase NO production and improve hypoperfusion observed in disease states such as Alzheimers and stroke.

                This study developed a Bayesian integration model to explore individual differences in the sense of agency, particularly when multiple sensory cues influence action perception. Behavioral results showed that individuals consistently integrate sensory cues in agency judgments, though cue weighting varies significantly across individuals. The estimated parameters of our model successfully captured these differences, reflecting individual sensitivities and criteria for agency. Higher sensitivity to sensory inputs was associated with lower variance in the likelihood distribution under the assumption of control. Our model provides critical insights into the mechanisms of the sense of agency and its variability, highlighting the model's potential for understanding both typical and disordered agency experiences.

">Short-term monocular deprivation in adult humans: a meta-analysis and new perspectives</a></h4>

              
                Starting from the early 2010s [1, 2], several studies have shown that a short period of monocular deprivation in adult volunteers transiently shifts ocular dominance in favor of the deprived eye. We compiled a meta-analysis of 73 such studies that measured the effects of monocular deprivation and related manipulations, using a diverse set of techniques [1-73]. The ocular dominance shift elicited by monocular deprivation was comparable across studies where deprivation was achieved with an opaque or translucent patch and irrespectively of whether the dominant or non-dominant eye was deprived. Effects were larger and longer lasting after longer periods of deprivation. Qualitatively similar effects were produced by monocular manipulations that did not reduce the strength of the stimulus: filtering or distorting the image in one eye, suppressing it from awareness or merely making it task irrelevant. We discuss the available evidence in the light of current models and a new perspective inspired by predictive coding.

">Cerebellar and Subcortical Contributions to Working Memory Manipulation</a></h4>

              
                Working memory enables us to temporarily store and manipulate information, a crucial function for problem-solving. However, most working memory models emphasize cortical interactions ignoring contributions from subcortical and cerebellar regions. Given the dense connectivity between the cerebellum, subcortex, and cortex, we hypothesize that these regions provide unique contributions during working memory manipulation. We tested this hypothesis using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity during a mental rotation task, where participants judged whether rotated pairs of three-dimensional stimuli were identical. Our results revealed a distributed network spanning the cortex, subcortex, and cerebellum that differentiates rotated from non-rotated stimuli and correct from incorrect responses. BOLD recruitment in these regions increased with larger angles of rotation. We observed delayed responses in premotor, subcortical, and cerebellar regions during incorrect trials. These findings suggest that cerebellar and subcortical regions support working memory manipulation, highlighting a broader mechanism by which distributed brain regions interact to coordinate higher cognitive functions.

">Neuronal development shapes activity-dependent gene expression in a stimulus-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity-dependent gene expression is fundamental to a wide variety of brain functions. However, how development progress and stimulation modalities specifically affect neuron transcription is not fully understood. In this work, we first investigate the influence of development on neuronal firing and activity-driven transcription. We used an RNA sequencing approach over 7 days in vitro (DIV) or mature 21 DIV neurons, comparing neuronal depolarization with potassium chloride (KCl) versus Biccuculine application, a synaptic modality to induce neuronal activity. To further investigate how different activity patterns influence gene transcription in mature neurons, we compared global gene expression in neurons treated with three different and extensively used activation protocols: KCl, Bicuculine (Bic), and TTX withdrawal (TTXw). Our results demonstrate a strong influence of development on activity-dependent gene expression, and showed that different patterns of neuronal activity induce different transcriptional profiles and exhibit distinct temporal dynamics for the same genes. These findings offer novel insights into the complex relationship between neuronal activity and gene expression, shedding light on the context-dependent nature of activity-dependent transcriptional responses.

">Characterization of neurite and soma organization in the brain and spinal cord with diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                The central nervous system (CNS), comprised of both the brain and spinal cord, and is a complex network of white and gray matter responsible for sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. Advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI) techniques offer a promising mechanism to non-invasively characterize CNS architecture, however, most studies focus on the brain or spinal cord in isolation. Here, we implemented a clinically feasible dMRI protocol on a 3T scanner to simultaneously characterize neurite and soma microstructure of both the brain and spinal cord. The protocol enabled the use of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Standard Model Imaging (SMI), and Soma and Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI), representing the first time SMI and SANDI have been evaluated in the cord, and in the cord and brain simultaneously. Our results demonstrate high image quality even at high diffusion weightings, reproducibility of SMI and SANDI derived metrics similar to those of DTI with few exceptions, and biologically feasible contrasts between and within white and gray matter regions. Reproducibility and contrasts were decreased in the cord compared to that of the brain, revealing challenges due to partial volume effects and image preprocessing. This study establishes a harmonized approach for brain and cord microstructural imaging, and the opportunity to study CNS pathologies and biomarkers of structural integrity across the neuroaxis.

">Inferring Latent Behavioral Strategy from the Representational Geometry of Prefrontal Cortex Activity</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral tasks can be solved employing various strategies. Sometimes, different strategies result in the same observable behavior, making them latent. In this study, we infer the latent behavioral strategy used by monkeys in a working memory updating task by comparing the representational geometry of two prefrontal regions, the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the prearcuate cortex (PAC), with that of recurrent neural network (RNN) models trained to solve the task using different strategies. We found that neural activity patterns in both LPFC and PAC align with only one of the proposed strategies, suggesting that monkeys employ this latent strategy to perform the task. These findings open avenues for investigating the processes that lead to strategy learning and the decision-making mechanisms that determine which strategies are chosen when multiple options are available.

">Connectomic analysis of astrocyte-synapse interactions in the cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes, a main type of glia cells in the cortex, provide metabolic support to neurons, and their possible function as a synaptic partner has given rise to the notion of "tripartite" synapses, suggesting a contribution to neuronal computations. For astrocytes to serve such purposes, the interactions with synapses in neuronal circuits require a level of specificity beyond overall synaptic support. A systematic mapping of the astrocyte-connectome relationship would enable the testing of these hypotheses - such analysis is however still lacking, in particular for circuits in the cerebral cortex. Here, utilizing previously published connectomic data of more than 200,000 synapses, we systematically analyzed the spatial relation between astrocytes and synapses in mouse somatosensory cortex. We developed a quantitative assessment of astrocyte-synapse proximity, finding that only 22.7% of synapses are contacted by astrocytic processes for more than 50% of their synaptic circumference. This non-ubiquitous astrocytic attachment would render astrocyte-synapse specificity plausible. Astrocytic coverage depended strongly on synapse types, with thalamocortical shaft synapses being the most covered by astrocytic processes. We furthermore observed a strong dependence of astrocytic synaptic coverage on synapse size, which was exclusive for excitatory spine synapses. We then investigated the possible relation of astrocytic synaptic coverage to neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, finding ultrastructural evidence for substantially reduced astrocytic support at synapses consistent with long-term depression, but not for astrocytic coverage dependence on baseline neuronal presynaptic activity. Together, our data demonstrate a high level of specificity of astrocyte-synapse interactions for particular synaptic types. They indicate the potential relevance of astrocytic coverage for synapse stability, in particular for large synapses, suggesting a contribution to long-term maintenance of learned synaptic states. These methods will allow a systematic testing of hypotheses about glial-neuronal interaction in various brain regions, disease models and species including human.

">The forkhead transcription factor FKH-7/FOXP acts in chemosensory neurons to regulate developmental decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with many associated genetic factors, including the forkhead transcription factor FOXP1. Although FOXP1's neuronal role is well-studied, the specific molecular consequences of different FOXP1 pathogenic variants in physiologically-relevant contexts are unknown. Here we ascribe the first function to Caenorhabditis elegans FKH-7/FOXP, which acts in two chemosensory neuron classes to promote the larval decision to enter the alternative, developmentally-arrested dauer life stage. We demonstrate that human FOXP1 can functionally substitute for C. elegans FKH-7 in these neurons and that engineering analogous FOXP1 hypomorphic missense mutations in the endogenous fkh-7 locus also impairs developmental decision-making. In a fkh-7/FOXP1 missense variant, single-cell transcriptomics identifies downregulated expression of autism-associated kcnl-2/KCNN2 calcium-activated potassium channel in a serotonergic sensory neuron. Our findings establish a novel framework linking two evolutionarily-conserved autism-associated genes for deeper characterization of variant-specific molecular pathology at single neuron resolution in the context of a developmental decision-making paradigm.

">Specific neuroblast-derived signals control both cell migration and fate in the rostral migratory stream</a></h4>

              
                Functional neuronal circuits require neuroblasts migrate to appropriate locations and then differentiate into neuronal subtypes. However, it remains unknown how neuroblasts in the subventricular zone (SVZ) are guided through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb (OB). Here we define EphB2 as a neuroblast-derived cue that controls migration along the RMS and helps to determine cell fate. Within the RMS, EphB2 is expressed selectively in, kinase-active in, and required for the migration of neuroblasts. As neuroblasts enter the OB and differentiate, EphB kinase activity is down-regulated, and in the granule cell layer (GCL), EphB2 expression is down-regulated. Blocking EphB kinase activity or knocking down EphB2 results in defects in migration and premature cellular differentiation in the RMS. Unexpectedly, premature loss of EphB2 expression causes neuroblasts to stop migrating and differentiate into astrocyte-like cells. Thus, EphB2 kinase activity and expression are linked to migration and specification of neuroblast fate.

">Targeting the ClpP-αSynuclein Interaction with a Decoy Peptide to Mitigate Neuropathology in Parkinson's Disease Models</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorder, is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and the accumulation of -synuclein (Syn)-rich inclusions. Despite advances in understanding PD pathophysiology, disease-modifying therapies remain elusive, underscoring gaps in our knowledge of its underlying mechanisms. Mitochondria are key targets of Syn toxicity, and growing evidence suggests that Syn-mitochondrial interactions contribute to PD progression. Our recent findings identify mitochondrial protease ClpP as a crucial regulator of Syn pathology, with pathological Syn binding to and impairing ClpP function, thereby exacerbating mitochondrial impairment and neurodegeneration. To disrupt this deleterious interaction, we developed a decoy peptide, CS2, which directly binds to the non-amyloid-{beta} component (NAC) domain of Syn, preventing its association with ClpP. CS2 treatment effectively mitigated Syn toxicity in an Syn-stable neuronal cell line, primary cortical neurons inoculated with Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs), and DA neurons derived from PD patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Notably, subcutaneous administration of CS2 in transgenic mThy1-hSNCA PD mice rescued cognitive and motor deficits while reducing Syn aggregation and neuropathology. These findings establish the ClpP-Syn interaction as a druggable target in PD and position CS2 as a promising therapeutic candidate for PD and other Syn-associated neurodegenerative disorders.

">Functional interaction of electrical coupling and H-current and its putative impact on inhibitory transmission</a></h4>

              
                The flow of information within neural circuits depends on the communication between neurons, primarily taking place at chemical and electrical synapses. The coexistence of these two modalities of synaptic transmission and their dynamical interaction with voltage-gated membrane conductances enables a rich repertoire of complex functional operations. One such operation, coincidence detection, allows electrically coupled neurons to respond more strongly to simultaneous synaptic inputs than to temporally dispersed ones. Using the mesencephalic trigeminal (MesV) nucleus (a structure composed of large, somatically coupled neurons) as an experimental model, we first demonstrate that electrical coupling strength in the hyperpolarized voltage range is highly time-dependent due to the involvement of the IH current. We then show how this property influences the coincidence detection of hyperpolarizing signals. Specifically, simultaneous hyperpolarizing inputs induce larger membrane potential changes, resulting in stronger IH current activation. This, in turn, shortens the temporal window for coincidence detection. We propose that this phenomenon may be crucial for networks dynamics in circuits of electrically coupled neurons that receive inhibitory synaptic inputs and express the IH current. In particular, molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) of the cerebellar cortex provide an ideal model for studying coincidence detection of inhibitory synaptic inputs, and how this operation is shaped by the voltage-dependent conductances like the IH current, potentially impacting on motor coordination and learning.

">Cortical substrates of perceptual confusion between pitch and timbre</a></h4>

              
                Pitch and timbre, two fundamental perceptual attributes of sound, are commonly regarded as distinct features, but can be confused when varied simultaneously. Here we combine human behavior and fMRI to demonstrate a neural substrate to explain the well-known perceptual confusion effects. We identify orderly mappings of both pitch and timbral brightness within auditory cortex and reveal two independent lines of evidence for cortical confusion between them. First, voxels' preferred pitch decreases systematically as brightness increases, and vice versa, consistent with predictions based on perceptual confusion. Second, pitch and brightness mapping share a common high-low-high gradient across auditory cortex, implying a shared trajectory of cortical activation for changes in each dimension. The results provide a cortical substrate at both local and global scales for an established auditory perceptual phenomenon that is thought to reflect efficient coding of ubiquitous features in natural sound statistics.

">Rhythmic modulation of dorsal hippocampus across distinct behavioral timescales during spatial set-shifting</a></h4>

              
                Previous work has shown frequency-specific modulation of dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) neural activity during simple behavioral tasks, suggesting shifts in neural population activity throughout different task phases and animal behaviors. Relatively little is known about task-relevant orchestrated shifts in theta, beta, and gamma rhythms across multiple behavioral timescales during a complex task that requires repeated adaptation of behavioral strategies based on changing reward contingencies. To address this gap in knowledge, we used a spatial set-shifting task to determine whether dHPC plays a specific role in strategy switching. The task requires rats to use two spatial strategies on an elevated plus maze: 1) alternating between East and West reward locations or 2) always going to the same reward location (e.g., only East or only West). Across specific timescales (session-based alignments, comparisons of trial types, within trial epochs), dHPC associated differentially with all three temporal categories. Across a session, we observed a decrease in theta and beta power before, and an increase in theta power after, the target strategy changed. Beta power was increased around the point at which rats learn the current rule. Comparing trial types, on trials before a rat learned the correct strategy, beta power increased. Within a single trial, after an incorrect (but not correct) choice, beta and gamma power increased while the rat returned to start a new trial. If gamma (but not beta) power was high during this return, the rat was more likely to make a correct choice on the next trial. On the other hand, low gamma power during the return was associated with incorrect trials. Rhythmic activity in dHPC, therefore, appears to track task demands, with the strength of each rhythmic frequency differentially associating with specific behaviors across three distinct timescales.

	<p>Background/Objectives: As the global population ages, the need for effective nonpharmacological interventions to support cognitive health has become increasingly urgent. Singing has been identified as a promising strategy to enhance cognitive function and emotional well-being in older adults. While substantial research has focused on the neurocognitive benefits of musical training, the specific effects of singing on neuroplasticity and cognition in aging populations remain underexplored. Methods: This review synthesizes findings from PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar to examine the impact of singing on cognitive health, particularly in mitigating cognitive decline and promoting mental well-being. Results: Key benefits of singing include improvements in verbal fluency, executive function, and episodic memory. Structural changes such as increased white matter integrity and enhanced auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor integration highlight the potential of singing to stimulate neuroplasticity. Among individuals with dementia, singing fosters episodic memory, mood enhancement, and social connection, while healthy older adults demonstrate improved verbal flexibility and cognitive resilience. However, methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes and cross-sectional designs, preclude definitive conclusions about long-term benefits. Conclusions: Future research should explore the specific neural mechanisms underlying these effects, with an emphasis on longitudinal studies and diverse populations. Tailored, inclusive singing programs could address individual cognitive and physical abilities while fostering sustained engagement and social connection. As a low-cost, scalable intervention, singing holds promise for addressing cognitive and emotional challenges associated with aging, offering an accessible avenue to support healthy aging and enhance quality of life across diverse populations.</p>

	<p>Background: Natural nootropic compounds are evidenced to restore brain function in clinical and older populations and are purported to enhance cognitive abilities in healthy cohorts. This study aimed to provide neurocomputational insight into the discrepancies between the remarkable self-reports and growing interest in nootropics among healthy adults and the inconclusive performance-enhancing effects found in the literature. Methods: Towards this end, we devised a randomised, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled study where participants performed a visual categorisation task prior to and following 60 days of supplementation with a plant-based nootropic, while electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were concurrently captured. Results: We found that although no improvements in choice accuracy or reaction times were observed, the application of multivariate information-theoretic measures to the EEG source space showed broadband increases in similar and complementary interdependencies across brain networks of various spatial scales. These changes not only resulted in localised increases in the redundancy among brain network interactions but also more significant and widespread increases in synergy, especially within the delta frequency band. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that natural nootropics can improve overall brain network cohesion and energetic efficiency, computationally demonstrating the beneficial effects of natural nootropics on brain health. However, these effects could not be related to enhanced rapid perceptual decision-making performance in a healthy adult sample. Future research investigating these specific compounds as cognitive enhancers in healthy populations should focus on complex cognition in deliberative tasks (e.g., creativity, learning) and over longer supplementation durations.

	<p>Background: In rare cases, isolated hypoglossal palsy may arise from dissection and/or pseudoaneurysm of either the internal carotid artery (ICA) or the vertebral artery (VA). However, the mechanism of this pathology has not been elucidated, and no high-quality randomized data exist to guide its management. Case Description: A 43-year-old man without a significant medical history presented with signs of isolated right hypoglossal palsy following a vigorous coughing episode. Imaging demonstrated dissection and pseudoaneurysm of the left ICA in addition to dissection of the right VA. After 2 weeks on 325 mg aspirin daily, the patient presented with left (rather than right) tongue symptoms and worsening ICA and VA stenosis. While on 325 mg aspirin plus 75 mg clopidogrel daily without additional endovascular intervention, the patient improved with no residual symptoms at 6 weeks from symptom onset. Conclusions: Acute hypoglossal nerve palsy may present with ipsilateral swelling, which could be mistaken for contralateral atrophy. We suggest ordering a CT angiogram initially to delineate a potential ICA versus VA dissection, as well as to rule out other etiologies. In our case, dissection and pseudoaneurysm from the ICA likely led to hypoglossal palsy through a mass effect on the nerve. Our comprehensive literature review favors initial management with dual-antiplatelet agents, and to then escalate to procedural interventions if symptoms worsen.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Violent behaviors are uncommon in patients with schizophrenia (Sch), but when present, exacerbate stigma and challenge treatment. The following study aimed to identify the structural abnormalities associated with violent behaviors in Sch by implementing a validated tool specifically designed to evaluate violent behaviors in psychiatric populations, as well as by performing region-of-interest neuroimaging analyses, focused on areas commonly associated with the neurobiology of violence and aggression. Methods: Eighty-three participants were divided into three groups: Sch with violent behaviors (Sch+V, n = 34), Sch without violent behaviors (Sch-V, n = 28), and healthy controls (HC, n = 21). Structural neuroimaging analyses were performed across groups to assess gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness (CT) differences in regions previously implicated in aggressive behaviors. Results: The data revealed significant reductions in GMV in the right amygdala and diminished cortical thickness (CT) in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC) in patients with Sch+V compared to patients with Sch-V and HCs. Right amygdalar volume also demonstrated a negative correlational trend with hostility scores in patients with Sch+V. Conclusions: These findings underscore disruptions in the structural integrity of the dlPFC&amp;amp;mdash;responsible for inhibitory control&amp;amp;mdash;and the amygdala&amp;amp;mdash;central to emotional processing in violent patients with Sch. Future research should aim to investigate potential functional interactions at a network level to gain a deeper understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of violent behaviors in this population.</p>

	<p>The present review describes the use and effectiveness of mental imagery in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease-related dementia. Six databases were thoroughly searched from January 2010 to December 2024. Different types of studies were retrieved and reviewed for imagery of the motor, cognitive, and emotional states and quality of life of the elderly with dementia. Although the scarce results showed the positive effect of mental imagery to the every-day life of older adults with dementia, more research should be conducted with larger homogenous samples and more valid tools. Future recommendations are provided.</p>

	<p>Background: The embodied cognition approach, as applied to concrete knowledge, is centred on the role of the perceptual and motor aspects of experience. To extend the embodied framework to abstract knowledge, some studies have suggested that further dimensions, such as affective or social experiences, are relevant for the semantic representations of abstract concepts. The objective of this study is to develop a measure that can quantitatively capture the multidimensional nature of abstract concepts. Methods: We used dimension-rating methods, known to be suitable, to account for the semantic representations of abstract concepts, to develop a new database of 964 Italian words, rated by 542 participants. Besides classical psycholinguistic variables (i.e., concreteness, imageability, familiarity, age of acquisition, semantic diversity) and affective norms (i.e., valence, arousal), we collected ratings on selected dimensions characterizing the semantic representations of abstract concepts, i.e., introspective, mental state, quantitative, spatial, social, moral, theoretical, and economic dimensions. The measure of exclusivity was incorporated to quantify the number of dimensions, and the respective relevance, for each concept. Concepts with a high value of exclusivity rely on only one/a few dimension/s with high value on the respective rating scale. Results: A multidimensional representation characterized most abstract concepts, with two robust major clusters. The first was characterized by dense intersections among introspective, mental state, social, and moral dimensions; the second, less interconnected, cluster revolved around quantitative, spatial, theoretical, and economic dimensions. Quantitative, theoretical, and economic concepts obtained higher exclusivity values. Conclusions: The present study contributes to the investigation of the semantic organization of abstract words and supports a controlled selection and definition of stimuli for clinical and research settings.</p>

                <p>Speech intelligibility declines with age and sensorineural hearing damage (SNHL). However, it remains unclear whether cochlear synaptopathy (CS), a recently discovered form of SNHL, significantly contributes to this issue. CS refers to damaged auditory-nerve synapses that innervate the inner hair cells and there is currently no go-to diagnostic test available. Furthermore, age-related hearing damage can comprise various aspects (e.g., hair cell damage, CS) that each can play a role in impaired sound perception. To explore the link between cochlear damage and speech intelligibility deficits, this study examines the role of CS for word recognition among older listeners. We first validated an envelope-following response (EFR) marker for CS using a Budgerigar model. We then applied this marker in human experiments, while restricting the speech material&rsquo;s frequency content to ensure that both the EFR and the behavioral tasks engaged similar cochlear frequency regions. Following this approach, we identified the relative contribution of hearing sensitivity and CS to speech intelligibility in two age-matched (65-year-old) groups with clinically normal (<I>n</I> = 15, 8 females) or impaired audiograms (<I>n</I> = 13, 8 females). Compared to a young normal-hearing control group (<I>n</I> = 13, 7 females), the older groups demonstrated lower EFR responses and impaired speech reception thresholds. We conclude that age-related CS reduces supra-threshold temporal envelope coding with subsequent speech coding deficits in noise that cannot be explained based on hearing sensitivity alone.</p>

                <p>Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a severe neurological disease associated with Th17/Treg cell imbalance and dysregulation of the Wnt/&beta;-catenin signaling pathway. This study investigates whether miR-155 inhibition can activate Wnt/&beta;-catenin signaling, improve Th17/Treg balance, and provide neuroprotection against stroke. We conducted a multilevel experimental design, including high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, in vivo mouse models, and in vitro cell experiments. High-throughput sequencing revealed significant differential gene expression between the miR-155 antagomir&ndash;treated and control groups (BioProject: PRJNA1152758). Bioinformatics analysis identified key genes linked to Wnt/&beta;-catenin signaling and Th17/Treg imbalance. In vitro experiments confirmed that miR-155 inhibition activated Wnt/&beta;-catenin signaling and improved Th17/Treg ratios. In vivo studies demonstrated that miR-155 antagomir treatment provided significant neuroprotection against AIS. These findings suggest that targeting miR-155 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke by modulating immune balance and key signaling pathways.</p>

                Background The danger of earthquakes poses a serious threat to people worldwide. One of the most significant challenges is preparing communities to cope effectively with this disaster. Therefore, understanding earthquake hazards is critically important for preparedness, mitigation, and an effective response to this threat. This report aims to observe and conduct a preliminary assessment of the degree to which community preparedness for earthquake disasters has been implemented. Methods Empirical data were obtained from survey respondents and interviews. The respondents were members of a community affected by the Cianjur earthquake, which occurred on November 21, 2022. The data were analysed using the mean range approach, based on Likert scales. Additionally, the Spearman correlation method was employed to indicate the relationship between community awareness and infrastructure readiness. Result Based on empirical evidence and preliminary analysis, it is evident that the preparedness of the community to respond effectively to earthquake catastrophes is inadequate. An apparent lack of readiness is observed in the inadequate construction of housing that fails to meet disaster standards, and the absence of disaster response facilities is notable. Conclusions Based on our initial assumption, it appears that knowledge related to disaster resilience in this area has not been adequately disseminated or socialized. However, this premise requires further investigation.

                This report presents the successful orthodontic management of a case of odontoma associated with impaction of the mandibular right permanent canine and Molar-incisor-hypomineralization (MIH). Although case studies have reported the management of odontomas and MIH as separate entities, there is a lack of evidence regarding the comprehensive management of patients presenting with a combination of odontoma, dental impaction, and MIH. A 15-year, 7-month-old female patient complained of the appearance of her smile and the delayed eruption of her mandibular right permanent canine. She was diagnosed with Angle’s Class I molar relationship and Class II canine relationship with the maxillary permanent right lateral incisor in a lingual crossbite. Furthermore, she had mandibular right permanent canine impaction, retained mandibular right primary canine, and MIH in the permanent anterior teeth and first molars. The management involved the removal of the odontoma to allow for orthodontic traction of the lower permanent right canine. After that, the esthetic appearance of the teeth was improved through restorative treatment.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The work experience of seafarers differs significantly from other land-based occupations due to several factors, particularly remoteness and the restricted work environment. This study seeks to examine the impact of burnout and health impairment in the maritime industry, using the Job Demand-Resources theory as a framework. Methods To investigate these phenomena, an online questionnaire was sent to 629 Italian seafarers and we conducted analysis on a valid sample of 239 respondents (94.6% men, Mage = 39.44, SD = 12.8). We tested a mediated Structural Equation Model (SEM) aimed at predicting negative health outcomes. Results The results show that burnout plays a mediating role between job demands (such as workload and cognitive strain) and health impairment (such as sleep quality and physical well-being) (Total Indirect Effect = 0.443, p < .0001) as well as between job resources (such as social support and transformational leadership) and health impairment (Total Indirect Effect = -0.249, p < .0001). Furthermore, the findings highlight the direct influence of occupational resources on seafarers’ health. Conclusions The discussion highlights the urgent need for more research in the field of organisational psychology in the maritime industry and the discrepancies between these findings, which are consistent with the existing maritime literature, and other studies that do not include seafarers in their sample groups.

                Background The mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 has been commonly considered the best response to the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis. However, assessment of its real-world effect can be performed by analysis of all-cause mortality by vaccination status. The UK is perhaps the only country which has made publicly available all-cause mortality data by vaccination status. Methods Data from April 2021 to May 2023 published by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) were retrospectively analyzed by age groups and vaccination status; the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause and non-COVID-19 mortality was calculated against the corresponding unvaccinated groups. Results We found that across all age groups, all-cause mortality SMRs increased from a certain date, dependent on the age group. Across all age groups, all-cause mortality SMRs were initially much lower than 1. However, due to their increase, by a certain date for the 18-39, 80-89 and 90+ age groups they exceeded the reference value. For the other age groups, the date at which the SMR would reach 1 can be predicted, provided the trend is maintained. Non-COVID-19 SMRs’ trends were very similar. Their initial values much lower than 1 are suggestive of significant biases in the ONS dataset, leading to underestimate the risks for the vaccinated people, as it is implausible that COVID-19 vaccines protect against non-COVID-19 deaths. Conclusions The increase over time in all-cause death SMRs in vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated, and their excess from the reference values for certain age groups, should be carefully considered to understand the underlying factors. Furthermore, since the initial values of the SMRs are much lower than 1, we assume the presence of significant biases in the ONS dataset, leading to understimate the risks for the vaccinated people, as it is implausible that COVID-19 vaccines protect against non-COVID-19 deaths. It would be desirable for other major countries to systematically collect all-cause mortality by vaccination status and, in the meantime, a pending indepth investigations, much greater caution should be exercised in promoting mass vaccination campaigns.

                <p>by Pasquale Casaburi, Lorenzo Dall’Amico, Nicolò Gozzi, Kyriaki Kalimeri, Anna Sapienza, Rossano Schifanella, Tiziana Di Matteo, Leo Ferres, Mattia Mazzoli</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of non-traditional data sources, such as mobile phone data, to inform effective public health interventions and monitor adherence to such measures. Previous studies showed how socioeconomic characteristics shaped population response during restrictions and how repeated interventions eroded adherence over time. Less is known about how different population strata changed their response to repeated interventions and how this impacted the resulting mobility network. We study population response during the first and second infection waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile and Spain. Via spatial lag and regression models, we investigate the adherence to mobility interventions at the municipality level in Chile, highlighting the significant role of wealth, labor structure, COVID-19 incidence, and network metrics characterizing business-as-usual municipality connectivity in shaping mobility changes during the two waves. We assess network structural similarities in the two periods by defining mobility hotspots and traveling probabilities in the two countries. As a proof of concept, we simulate and compare outcomes of an epidemic diffusion occurring in the two waves. While differences exist between factors associated with mobility reduction across waves in Chile, underscoring the dynamic nature of population response, our analysis reveals the resilience of the mobility network across the two waves. We test the robustness of our findings recovering similar results for Spain. Finally, epidemic modeling suggests that historical mobility data from past waves can be leveraged to inform future disease spatial invasion models in repeated interventions. This study highlights the value of historical mobile phone data for building pandemic preparedness and lessens the need for real-time data streams for risk assessment and outbreak response. Our work provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of factors driving mobility across repeated interventions, aiding in developing targeted mitigation strategies.

                <p>by Bente Winkler, Dominik Funke, Christian Klämbt</p>

The central nervous system is well-separated from external influences by the blood–brain barrier. Upon surveillance, infection or neuroinflammation; however, peripheral immune cells can enter the brain where they often cause detrimental effects. To invade the brain, immune cells not only have to breach cellular barriers, but they also need to traverse associated extracellular matrix barriers. Neither in vertebrates nor in invertebrates is it fully understood how these processes are molecularly controlled. We recently established <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a model to elucidate peripheral immune cell invasion into the brain. Here, we show that neuroinflammation leads to the expression of Unpaired cytokines that activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in glial cells of the blood–brain barrier. This in turn triggers the expression of matrix metalloproteinases enabling remodeling of the extracellular matrix enclosing the fly brain and a subsequent invasion of immune cells into the brain. Our study demonstrates conserved mechanisms underlying immune cell invasion of the nervous system in invertebrates and vertebrates and could, thus, further contribute to understanding of JAK/STAT signaling during neuroinflammation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by the misfolding and deposition of the transthyretin (TTR) protein. This study aimed to describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of ATTRv in a large multicenter Chinese cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients from 14 centers were included in the study. The clinical and genetic characteristics of all patients were summarized. The peripheral blood white blood cell mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was detected in offspring from different genders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 202 individuals with ATTRv from 148 families were identified. The average age of onset was 50.6 ± 12.4 years. Among these cases, 117 (57.9%) were classified as late-onset (≥50 years) and 85 (42.1%) as early-onset. Overall, the length dependent axonal sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy was the predominant phenotype (89.1%). A total of 42 heterozygous missense variants and 1 deletion variant were identified. The most common variants were Val30Met (19.8%) and Ala97Ser (15.8%) and patients with Val30Met and Ala97Ser were mostly late-onset in our cohort. Thirty-nine of these patients died with a mean age of 56.1 ± 13.5 years. Anticipation according to gender groups of offspring-parent pairs was different, and mother-son pairs showed the largest anticipation. The copies of mtDNA in the mother's offspring outnumbered those of the father's offspring (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study highlights that ATTRv patients in China exhibit high heterogeneity in their initial symptoms. The most common variants observed in this cohort is Val30Met. The mtDNA copy number shows gender-linked effects. These results can impact ATTRv diagnosis and patient care strategies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by altered metabolome and energy homeostasis, manifesting with body mass index changes and hypermetabolism—both prognostic of disease progression and survival. The cross-sectional ALS metabolome has been characterized, but longitudinal correlations to functional decline are lacking.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally evaluated metabolomes from ALS plasma and terminal postmortem spinal cord and brain motor cortex tissue. We constructed 3 plasma models. A linear mixed effects model correlated all metabolite levels across all timepoints to their corresponding functional scores. An interaction model predicted a longitudinal change in function from baseline metabolites, whereas a progression model identified metabolites linked to a 20% or 50% drop in function. In postmortem samples, differential metabolites in onset versus second spinal cord segments served as a surrogate of disease progression. Mendelian randomization assessed potential causality from metabolites.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In plasma, all models primarily selected lipid metabolites and sub-pathways, in addition to amino acids, xenobiotics, and various less frequently selected pathways. Among lipids, fatty acids and sphingomyelins were predominant, along with plasmalogens, phosphatidylcholines, and lysophospholipids. Sex interaction findings were nominal. In the spinal cord, sphingomyelin and long-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were more abundant in the onset segment tissue, whereas phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were less abundant. Mendelian randomization suggested that impaired carnitine and short chain acylcarnitine metabolism may be genetically determined in ALS, along with various antioxidant derivatives.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest metabolomic changes primarily involving different lipid classes and carnitine metabolism may underscore ALS severity and progression. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed at evaluating the brain metabolic features of fused in sarcoma amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<i>FUS</i>-ALS) compared with sporadic ALS (sALS), using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We employed the 2-sample <i>t</i>-test model of SPM12, implemented in MATLAB, to compare 12 <i>FUS</i>-ALS cases with 40 healthy controls (HC) and 48 sALS, randomly collected from the series of patients who underwent brain 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET at the ALS Center of Turin (Italy) at diagnosis from 2009 to 2019. In the comparisons between cases and HC, we included age at PET and sex as covariates. Because <i>FUS</i>-ALS usually shows early onset in spinal regions, in the comparison between <i>FUS</i>-ALS and sALS, we included singularly the following covariates in a second step, to evaluate the determinants of eventual metabolic differences: age at PET, sex, and onset (spinal/bulbar).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>sALS patients showed significant relative hypometabolism in bilateral fronto-temporo-occipital cortex and right insula as compared with <i>FUS</i>-ALS. After adjusting for age, the relative hypometabolism remained in the bilateral precentral gyrus and in the right middle and inferior temporal gyrus. As compared with HC, <i>FUS</i> patients displayed a significant relative hypermetabolism in the pontobulbar region and right cerebellar tonsil, dentate nucleus, and uvula, while sALS showed relative hypometabolism in bilateral frontal and occipital cortices and in left temporal and parietal regions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with <i>FUS</i>-ALS show relative preservation of motor cortex metabolism compared with those with sALS, possibly reflecting the prevalence of lower motor neuron impairment in their phenotype. Prospective studies are necessary to investigate the possible role of 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET as a biomarker to track disease spreading in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Introduction Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is the material of choice for pulp therapy. However, Ca(OH)2 has drawbacks such as toxicity, poor sealing, and tunnel defect formation. Alternative materials have been developed to provide more biocompatible materials with better dentin formation ability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of composites containing gelatin (G), chitosan (CH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and Ca(OH)2, namely G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 (Extended data) on inflammation of the dental pulp (expression of COX-2, PGP 9.5, TNF-α, and neutrophil number). Materials and methods A total of 16 Wistar rat models of acute pulp injury were prepared and divided into two groups, treatment and control, 8 with each. In the treatment group, we applied a pulp-capping material using G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 and Ca(OH)2. On the 1st and 3rd days, rats were sacrificed. Tissue samples from 4 rats in each group were processed for histological preparation. COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α were observed using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and neutrophil numbers were observed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Image analysis of COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α expression was performed using ImageJ software. Results The results showed a decrease significantly in COX-2 expression while PGP 9.5 and TNF-α expression were significantly higher than those in the control group. Neutrophil numbers were lower in the treatment group than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion The G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 composite material may have potential as an exposed pulp medicament by reducing mediator of inflammation (COX-2 expression) and increasing the regeneration factor (TNF-α expression) and nerve (PGP 9.5 expression).

                Background The cestode Hymenolepis diminuta is a cosmopolitan parasite, which in the adult stage is usually found in the small intestine of rats and accidentally in humans. Case report We describe the finding of eggs of this parasite in an asymptomatic 3-year-old child. The child had extremely high IgE values of 1,376 IU/ml. After receiving treatment with Albendazole suspension 400mg/20mL, on the 10th day post-treatment, he showed no H. diminuta eggs in his fecal matter Conclusions Detailed morphological review of Hymenolepis nana-like eggs is recommended to distinguish them from H. diminuta eggs.

In the kinetic proofreading mechanism, the ligand-bound receptor must pass through a sequence of states before reaching the signaling state. In the multimeric receptor signaling mechanism, receptor subunits are bound by a multivalent ligand to form a signaling complex. A key result of this paper is that the multimeric receptor is capable of achieving the same maximum specificity as the kinetic proofreading receptor.</p><img src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRE/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.024408.png" width="200" height=\"100\"><br/><p>[Phys.

                Background Research integrity, essential for ethical scientific research, has been inadequately addressed in Ethiopia, resulting in gaps in addressing misconduct like plagiarism, falsification and fabrication. The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude and factors associated with research misconduct at a public university in Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of researchers. Data were collected via a self-administered, structured questionnaire, which was adapted from a similar study. The collected data were analysed using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression. Result A total of 244 researchers participated in the study, resulting in an 82% response rate. In our study, 37.7% of participants reported engaging in at least one form of misconduct, 95% CI [31.6%, 44.1%]. Authorship misconduct was the most common form of self-reported misconduct (47.5%), 95% CI [41.1%, 54.0%], followed by fabrication and falsification (40.6%), 95% CI [34.4%, 47.0%]. Publication pressure was significantly associated with research misconduct (AOR = 3.18; 95% CI: [1.02, 9.95]). Conclusion This study highlights the prevalence of research misconduct and questionable research practices among academic researchers, with authorship misconduct, fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism being the most commonly reported types. Attitudes toward research misconduct and self-reported involvement were influenced by academic position, research experience, and publication pressure, with junior researchers being more likely to report engaging in misbehavior. While ethics training has occasionally been associated with reduced rates of research misconduct, its effectiveness remains uncertain, as institutional culture, supervision, and mentorship may play a more significant role. Addressing research misconduct requires a comprehensive approach that extends beyond ethical instruction, incorporating targeted support for early-career researchers, open dialogue, and institutional policy reforms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-224/v1?src=rss">Influence of Iron Deficiency Anaemia on Glycated Haemoglobin in Non-diabetics [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) is a valuable marker in the management of Diabetes Mellitus, aiding in screening and diagnosis, and as a predictor of complications. Iron deficiency anaemia in developing countries has been found to affect the blood levels of HbA1C, decreasing its sensitivity. This study was undertaken to analyse the influence of iron deficiency anaemia on HbA1c levels, and thereby assess the reliability of A1C as a diagnostic marker for diabetes mellitus in iron deficient patients Methods This cross-sectional observational case-control study was conducted in a single tertiary care center. A total of 164 patients were recruited, 82 each from the case and control groups. The groups were matched for age and sex. Cases were nondiabetics with iron deficiency, and controls were nondiabetics without iron deficiency Results Age and sex were matched between cases and controls. The median ferritin levels were 5.9 ng/dl (n= 82) and 144 ng/dl (n= 82) among cases and controls. Transferrin saturation was distributed among cases, with a median of 3.4% for males (n= 36) and 3.2% for females (n= 46). Median hemoglobin levels were compared among each age group, with more severe anemia being seen as age increased. HbA1C was also compared age -wise, with results being statistically significant across each category. There was a statistically significant difference between HbA1C levels in cases and controls (p<0.0001), with some cases having A1C in the diabetic range, without any signs and symptoms of diabetes, and normal fasting and post prandial glucose Conclusion The results of our study suggest that although HbA1C is a diagnostic marker for type 2 diabetes mellitus, it loses its reliability when there is a co-existing iron deficiency anaemia. Hence certain amount of vigilance is mandated to confirm diabetes mellitus based on HbA1C, when the patient also has iron deficiency.

                Sex hormones shape behavior through diverse mechanisms. In a recent study, Zallar et al. have uncovered a rapid, nongenomic estrogen signaling pathway mediating binge drinking in female mice via membrane-associated estrogen receptor α (ERα) in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). These findings reveal sex-specific neurobiological underpinnings of alcohol use linked to naturally circulating hormone levels.

                Hamnett, Bendrick, et al. identify two populations of glutamatergic enteric neurons—longitudinal descending interneurons and a previously unreported population of circumferential neurons. They observe that these VGLUT2+ neurons form synaptic contact with diverse enteric neuronal subtypes and promote the initiation of ex vivo colonic motility.

                Moissoglu et al. study the mechanisms of mRNA targeting to mammalian cell protrusions. They show that the RNA-binding protein CNBP binds 3′ UTR GA-rich sequences in protrusion-localized mRNAs and recruits the KIF1C kinesin for mRNA trafficking on microtubules. This work reveals a new motor-adaptor complex for microtubule-based mRNA transport.

                Hasel et al. show that molecularly and morphologically specialized astrocytes make up the brain and spinal cord surface, thereby creating the glia limitans superficialis. These astrocytes selectively express the gene Myocilin, and their cell bodies create the brain surface and have processes that reach into the parenchyma.

                Meissner-Bernard et al. combined experiments and modeling to analyze specific functions of inhibition in a memory network. Inhibition was found to be important not only to stabilize overall activity levels but also to maintain activity patterns in an informative regime, consistent with models assuming balanced, non-random connectivity between assemblies of neurons.

                Feng et al. examine the role of RNA-dependent DNA methylation in plant embryogenesis using a multi-omic method. They discover that 21/22-nt sRNA rises in response to decreased CHH methylation. After being harvested, the mutant embryos do not survive desiccation due to abnormal WOX/auxin signaling.

                Barnes et al. used an assay of spine plasticity in hippocampal slices to study non-ionotropic NMDA-receptor signaling. Signaling is initiated via the GluN2B carboxy-terminal domain and modulates spine morphology, protein synthesis, and protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity. Augmenting GluN2B signaling reverses core phenotypes in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100652">Robust variability of grid cell properties within individual grid modules enhances encoding of local space</a></h4>

              
                Although grid cells are one of the most well-studied functional classes of neurons in the mammalian brain, whether there is a single orientation and spacing value per grid module has not been carefully tested. We analyze a recent large-scale recording of medial entorhinal cortex to characterize the presence and degree of heterogeneity of grid properties within individual modules. We find evidence for small, but robust, variability and hypothesize that this property of the grid code could enhance the encoding of local spatial information. Performing analysis on synthetic populations of grid cells, where we have complete control over the amount heterogeneity in grid properties, we demonstrate that grid property variability of a similar magnitude to the analyzed data leads to significantly decreased decoding error. This holds even when restricted to activity from a single module. Our results highlight how the heterogeneity of the neural response properties may benefit coding and opens new directions for theoretical and experimental analysis of grid cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99141">Impact of liver-specific survival motor neuron (SMN) depletion on central nervous system and peripheral tissue pathology</a></h4>

              
                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (<i>SMN1</i>) gene. While traditionally viewed as a motor neuron disorder, there is involvement of various peripheral organs in SMA. Notably, fatty liver has been observed in SMA mouse models and SMA patients. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether intrinsic depletion of SMN protein in the liver contributes to pathology in the peripheral or central nervous systems. To address this, we developed a mouse model with a liver-specific depletion of SMN by utilizing an <i>Alb-Cre</i> transgene together with one <i>Smn<sup>2B</sup></i> allele and one <i>Smn1</i> exon 7 allele flanked by loxP sites. Initially, we evaluated phenotypic changes in these mice at postnatal day 19 (P19), when the severe model of SMA, the <i>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></i> mice, exhibit many symptoms of the disease. The liver-specific SMN depletion does not induce motor neuron death, neuromuscular pathology or muscle atrophy, characteristics typically observed in the <i>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></i> mouse at P19. However, mild liver steatosis was observed, although no changes in liver function were detected. Notably, pancreatic alterations resembled that of <i>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></i>mice, with a decrease in insulin-producing β-cells and an increase in glucagon-producingα-cells, accompanied by a reduction in blood glucose and an increase in plasma glucagon and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1). These changes were transient, as mice at P60 exhibited recovery of liver and pancreatic function. While the mosaic pattern of the Cre-mediated excision precludes definitive conclusions regarding the contribution of liver-specific SMN depletion to overall tissue pathology, our findings highlight an intricate connection between liver function and pancreatic abnormalities in SMA.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99352">Systems genomics of salinity stress response in rice</a></h4>

              
                Populations can adapt to stressful environments through changes in gene expression. However, the fitness effect of gene expression in mediating stress response and adaptation remains largely unexplored. Here, we use an integrative field dataset obtained from 780 plants of <i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp. <i>indica</i> (rice) grown in a field experiment under normal or moderate salt stress conditions to examine selection and evolution of gene expression variation under salinity stress conditions. We find that salinity stress induces increased selective pressure on gene expression. Further, we show that <i>trans</i>-eQTLs rather than <i>cis</i>-eQTLs are primarily associated with rice’s gene expression under salinity stress, potentially via a few master-regulators. Importantly, and contrary to the expectations, we find that <i>cis-trans</i> reinforcement is more common than <i>cis-trans</i> compensation which may be reflective of rice diversification subsequent to domestication. We further identify genetic fixation as the likely mechanism underlying this compensation/reinforcement. Additionally, we show that <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-eQTLs are under balancing and purifying selection, respectively, giving us insights into the evolutionary dynamics of gene expression variation. By examining genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic variation across a rice population, we gain insights into the molecular and genetic landscape underlying adaptive salinity stress responses, which is relevant for other crops and other stresses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91425">Reduced discrimination between signals of danger and safety but not overgeneralization is linked to exposure to childhood adversity in healthy adults</a></h4>

              
                Childhood adversity is a strong predictor of developing psychopathological conditions. Multiple theories on the mechanisms underlying this association have been suggested which, however, differ in the operationalization of ‘exposure.’ Altered (threat) learning mechanisms represent central mechanisms by which environmental inputs shape emotional and cognitive processes and ultimately behavior. 1402 healthy participants underwent a fear conditioning paradigm (acquisition training, generalization), while acquiring skin conductance responses (SCRs) and ratings (arousal, valence, and contingency). Childhood adversity was operationalized as (1) dichotomization, and following (2) the specificity model, (3) the cumulative risk model, and (4) the dimensional model. Individuals exposed to childhood adversity showed blunted physiological reactivity in SCRs, but not ratings, and reduced CS+/CS- discrimination during both phases, mainly driven by attenuated CS+ responding. The latter was evident across different operationalizations of ‘exposure’ following the different theories. None of the theories tested showed clear explanatory superiority. Notably, a remarkably different pattern of increased responding to the CS- is reported in the literature for anxiety patients, suggesting that individuals exposed to childhood adversity may represent a specific sub-sample. We highlight that theories linking childhood adversity to (vulnerability to) psychopathology need refinement.
