              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Reduction in cognitive processing speed surrounding multiple sclerosis relapse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the longitudinal relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses and information processing efficiency among persons with relapsing-remitting MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Swedish nationwide cohort study of persons with incident relapsing-remitting MS (2001-2019). Relapse information and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) scores were obtained from the Swedish MS Registry. Follow-up was categorized into two periods based on relapse status: “relapse” (90 days pre-relapse to 730 days post-relapse, subdivided into 10 periods) and “remission”. Linear mixed models compared SDMT scores during the relapse periods to SDMT scores recorded during remission (reference) with results reported as β-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age, sex, SDMT type (written vs oral), time-varying disease-modifying therapy exposure and sequence of SDMT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.7 (4.3) years, 31,529 distinct SDMTs were recorded among 3877 persons with MS. There was a significant decline in information processing efficiency that lasted from 30 days pre-relapse up to 550 days post-relapse, with the largest decline occurring 0-30 days post-relapse (β-coefficient:-4.00 (95%CI: -4.61 to -3.39), relative to the period of remission.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found evidence of cognitive change up to one month prior to relapse onset. The reduction in SDMT lasted 1.5 years and was clinically significant up to three months post-relapse. These results suggest that the effects of a relapse on cognition are longer than previously thought and highlight the importance of reducing relapse rates as a potential means of preserving cognitive function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Parkinson disease and STN‐DBS: cognitive effects in GBA mutation carriers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the rate of change in cognition between <i>glucocerebrosidase</i> (<i>GBA)</i> mutation carriers and non-carriers with and without subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson’s disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and genetic data from 12 datasets were examined. Global cognition was assessed using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS). Subjects were examined for mutations in <i>GBA</i> and categorized as <i>GBA</i> carriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>+DBS+, <i>GBA</i>+DBS-), and non-carriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>-DBS+, <i>GBA</i>-DBS-). <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers were subcategorized according to mutation severity (risk variant, mild, severe). Linear mixed modeling was used to compare rate of change in MDRS scores over time among the groups according to <i>GBA</i> and DBS status and then according to <i>GBA</i> severity and DBS status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Data were available for 367 subjects: 58 <i>GBA</i>+DBS+, 82 <i>GBA</i>+DBS-, 98 <i>GBA</i>-DBS+, and 128 <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects who were longitudinal followed (range 36 to 60 months after surgery). Using the MDRS, <i>GBA</i>+DBS+ subjects declined on average 2.02 points/year more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects (95% CI = -2.35, -1.69), 1.71 points/year more than <i>GBA</i>+DBS- subjects (95% CI = -2.14, -1.28), and 1.49 points/year more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS+ subjects (95% CI = -1.80, -1.18).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although non-randomized, this composite analysis suggests that the combined effects of <i>GBA</i> mutations and STN-DBS negatively impact cognition. We advise that DBS candidates be screened for <i>GBA</i> mutations as part of the pre-surgical decision-making process. We advise that <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers be counseled regarding potential risks associated with STN-DBS and alternative options may be considered.</p>

                Relaxation of quantum systems is a central problem in nonequilibrium physics. In contrast to classical systems, the underlying quantum dynamics results not only from atomic interactions but also from the long-range coherence of the many-body wave function. Experimentally, nonequilibrium states of quantum fluids are usually created using moving objects or...

                Background: The application of insecticides for malaria vector control has led to a global problem, which is the current trend of increased resistance against these chemicals. This study aimed to review the insecticide resistance status was previously determined in Asia and how to implement the necessary interventions. Moreover, the implications of resistance in malaria vector control in this region were studied. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using a predefined protocol based on PRISMA-retrieved articles from four science databases, namely ProQuest, Science Direct, EBSCO, and PubMed in the last ten years (2009 to 2019). The searching process utilized four main combinations of the following keywords: malaria, vector control, insecticide, and Asia. In ProQuest, malaria control, as well as an insecticide, were used as keywords. The following criteria were included in the filter, namely full text, the source of each article, scholarly journal, Asia, and publication date as in the last ten years. Results: There were 1408 articles retrieved during the initial search (ProQuest=722, Science Direct=267, EBSCO=50, PubMed=285, and Scopus=84). During the screening, 27 articles were excluded because of duplication, 1361 based on title and abstract incompatibility with the inclusion criteria, and 20 due to content differences. In the final screening process, 15 articles were chosen to be analyzed. From the 15 articles, it is known that there was organochlorine (DDT), organophosphate (malathion), and pyrethroids resistance in several Anopheles species with a less than 80% mortality rate. Conclusion: This review found multiple resistance in several Anopheles includes resistance to pyrethroid. The reports of pyrethroid resistance were quite challenging because it is considered effective in the malaria vector control. Several countries in Asia are implementing an insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy against malaria vectors following the Global Plan for IRM.

Methods: Applying long-term personal vital care data for 28 months for an elderly patient, I investigated and evidenced adverse reactions after the first dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccination. Results: The precise, detailed, and continuous data statistically clarified the long-term fevers associated with no meals or drinks. Interrupted time series analysis showed significant and fluctuating increases of body temperatures, pressures, and pulses, although solely long-term plots showed an abrupt and timely increase in these vital data after the vaccine. Conclusions: Anorexia was fatal, and newly reported in the present care records since the patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Pandemic management requires reliable and efficient dynamical simulation to predict and control disease spreading. The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is mitigated by several non-pharmaceutical interventions, but it is hard to predict which of these are the most effective for a given population. We developed the computationally effective and scalable, agent-based microsimulation framework <i>PanSim</i>, allowing us to test control measures in multiple infection waves caused by the spread of a new virus variant in a city-sized societal environment using a unified framework fitted to realistic data. We show that vaccination strategies prioritising occupational risk groups minimise the number of infections but allow higher mortality while prioritising vulnerable groups minimises mortality but implies an increased infection rate. We also found that intensive vaccination along with non-pharmaceutical interventions can substantially suppress the spread of the virus, while low levels of vaccination, premature reopening may easily revert the epidemic to an uncontrolled state. Our analysis highlights that while vaccination protects the elderly from COVID-19, a large percentage of children will contract the virus, and we also show the benefits and limitations of various quarantine and testing scenarios. The uniquely detailed spatio-temporal resolution of <i>PanSim</i> allows the design and testing of complex, specifically targeted interventions with a large number of agents under dynamically changing conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Formation, collective motion, and merging of macroscopic bacterial aggregates</a></h4>

              
                <p>by George Courcoubetis, Manasi S. Gangan, Sean Lim, Xiaokan Guo, Stephan Haas, James Q. Boedicker</p>

Chemotactic bacteria form emergent spatial patterns of variable cell density within cultures that are initially spatially uniform. These patterns are the result of chemical gradients that are created from the directed movement and metabolic activity of billions of cells. A recent study on pattern formation in wild bacterial isolates has revealed unique collective behaviors of the bacteria <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i>. As in other bacterial species, <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> form macroscopic aggregates. Once formed, these bacterial clusters can migrate several millimeters, sometimes resulting in the merging of two or more clusters. To better understand these phenomena, we examine the formation and dynamics of thousands of bacterial clusters that form within a 22 cm square culture dish filled with soft agar over two days. At the macroscale, the aggregates display spatial order at short length scales, and the migration of cell clusters is superdiffusive, with a merging acceleration that is correlated with aggregate size. At the microscale, aggregates are composed of immotile cells surrounded by low density regions of motile cells. The collective movement of the aggregates is the result of an asymmetric flux of bacteria at the boundary. An agent-based model is developed to examine how these phenomena are the result of both chemotactic movement and a change in motility at high cell density. These results identify and characterize a new mechanism for collective bacterial motility driven by a transient, density-dependent change in motility.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Terrestrial reproduction and parental care drive rapid evolution in the trade-off between offspring size and number across amphibians</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrew I. Furness, Chris Venditti, Isabella Capellini</p>

The trade-off between offspring size and number is central to life history strategies. Both the evolutionary gain of parental care or more favorable habitats for offspring development are predicted to result in fewer, larger offspring. However, despite much research, it remains unclear whether and how different forms of care and habitats drive the evolution of the trade-off. Using data for over 800 amphibian species, we demonstrate that, after controlling for allometry, amphibians with direct development and those that lay eggs in terrestrial environments have larger eggs and smaller clutches, while different care behaviors and adaptations vary in their effects on the trade-off. Specifically, among the 11 care forms we considered at the egg, tadpole and juvenile stage, egg brooding, male egg attendance, and female egg attendance increase egg size; female tadpole attendance and tadpole feeding decrease egg size, while egg brooding, tadpole feeding, male tadpole attendance, and male tadpole transport decrease clutch size. Unlike egg size that shows exceptionally high rates of phenotypic change in just 19 branches of the amphibian phylogeny, clutch size has evolved at exceptionally high rates in 135 branches, indicating episodes of strong selection; egg and tadpole environment, direct development, egg brooding, tadpole feeding, male tadpole attendance, and tadpole transport explain 80% of these events. By explicitly considering diversity in parental care and offspring habitat by stage of offspring development, this study demonstrates that more favorable conditions for offspring development promote the evolution of larger offspring in smaller broods and reveals that the diversity of parental care forms influences the trade-off in more nuanced ways than previously appreciated.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Spinal Cord Atrophy Predicts Progressive Disease in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A major challenge in multiple sclerosis (MS) research is the understanding of silent progression and Progressive MS. Using a novel method to accurately capture upper cervical cord area from legacy brain MRI scans we aimed to study the role of spinal cord and brain atrophy for silent progression and conversion to secondary progressive disease (SPMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From a single-center observational study, all RRMS (n = 360) and SPMS (n = 47) patients and 80 matched controls were evaluated. RRMS patient subsets who converted to SPMS (n = 54) or silently progressed (n = 159), respectively, during the 12-year observation period were compared to clinically matched RRMS patients remaining RRMS (n = 54) or stable (n = 147), respectively. From brain MRI, we assessed the value of brain and spinal cord measures to predict silent progression and SPMS conversion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients who developed SPMS showed faster cord atrophy rates (−2.19%/yr) at least 4 years before conversion compared to their RRMS matches (−0.88%/yr, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Spinal cord atrophy rates decelerated after conversion (−1.63%/yr, <i>p</i> = 0.010) towards those of SPMS patients from study entry (−1.04%). Each 1% faster spinal cord atrophy rate was associated with 69% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and 53% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) shorter time to silent progression and SPMS conversion, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Silent progression and conversion to secondary progressive disease are predominantly related to cervical cord atrophy. This atrophy is often present from the earliest disease stages and predicts the speed of silent progression and conversion to Progressive MS. Diagnosis of SPMS is rather a late recognition of this neurodegenerative process than a distinct disease phase. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>We are the first investigating the effects of participant's handedness in a motor imagery (MI) and movement execution task in both right and left-handed individuals at the cortical and subcortical levels. Twenty-six right-handed and 25 left-handed participants were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the imagination and execution of repetitive self-paced movements of squeezing a ball with their dominant, non-dominant, and both hands.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The human brain functional lateralization has been widely studied over the past decades, and neuroimaging studies have shown how activation of motor areas during hand movement execution (ME) is different according to hand dominance. Nevertheless, there is no research directly investigating the effects of the participant's handedness in a motor imagery (MI) and ME task in both right and left-handed individuals at the cortical and subcortical level. Twenty-six right-handed and 25 left-handed participants were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the imagination and execution of repetitive self-paced movements of squeezing a ball with their dominant, non-dominant, and both hands. Results revealed significant statistical difference (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) between groups during both the execution and the imagery task with the dominant, non-dominant, and both hands both at cortical and subcortical level. During ME, left-handers recruited a spread bilateral network, while in right-handers, activity was more lateralized. At the critical level, MI between-group analysis revealed a similar pattern in right and left-handers showing a bilateral activation for the dominant hand. Differentially at the subcortical level, during MI, only right-handers showed the involvement of the posterior cerebellum. No significant activity was found for left-handers. Overall, we showed a partial spatial overlap of neural correlates of MI and ME in motor, premotor, sensory cortices, and cerebellum. Our results highlight differences in the functional organization of motor areas in right and left-handed people, supporting the hypothesis that MI is influenced by the way people habitually perform motor actions.</p>

                <p>Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a chronic sleep disorder correlated with loss of hypocretin(orexin). In NT1 post-mortem brains, we observed 88% reduction in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and significantly less CRH-positive fibers in the median eminence, while CRH-neurons in the locus coeruleus and thalamus, and other PVN neuronal populations were spared: i.e. vasopressin, oxytocin, tyrosine hydroxylase and thyrotropin releasing hormone-expressing neurons. Other hypothalamic cell groups, i.e. the suprachiasmatic, ventrolateral preoptic, infundibular and supraoptic nuclei and nucleus basalis of Meynert were unaffected. The surprising selective decrease in CRH-neurons provide novel targets for diagnostics and therapeutic interventions.</p>

                <p>Since 2016, three innovative therapies for spinal muscular atrophy have changed the face of disease. Although these therapies often result in remarkable improvements in infants and children, benefits in adults are modest and treatment is not curative. Concerns have been raised about the enormous costs of these medications, the ultimate burden to taxpayers, and the costs to society of withholding treatments and sacrificing or disadvantaging some individuals. Physicians are best positioned to serve our patients by carefully considering the costs, benefits, implications for quality of life, and the interplay of these factors within the framework of core ethical principles that guide clinical care.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Risk factors for phenoconversion in REM sleep behavior disorder</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To follow up predictive factors for α-synuclein-related neurodegenerative diseases in a multicenter cohort of idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD from 12 centers underwent a detailed assessment for potential environmental and lifestyle risk factors via a standardized questionnaire at baseline. Patients were then prospectively followed and received assessments for parkinsonism or dementia during follow-up. The cumulative incidence of parkinsonism or dementia was estimated with competing risk analysis. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictive value of environmental/lifestyle factors over a follow-up period of 11 years, adjusting for age, sex, and center.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 319 patients who were free of parkinsonism or dementia, 281 provided follow-up information. After a mean follow-up of 5.8 years, 130 (46.3%) patients developed neurodegenerative disease. The overall phenoconversion rate was 24.2% after 3 years, 44.8% after 6 years, and 67.5% after 10 years. Patients with older age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05), and nitrate derivative use (aHR 2.18) were more likely to phenoconvert, whereas prior pesticide exposure (aHR 0.21–0.64), rural living (aHR 0.53), lipid-lowering medication use (aHR 0.59), and respiratory medication use (aHR 0.36) were associated with lower phenoconversion risk. Risk factors for those converting to primary dementia and parkinsonism were generally similar, with dementia-first converters having lower coffee intake and beta-blocker intake, and higher occurrence of family history of dementia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings elucidate the predictive values of environmental factors and comorbid conditions in identifying RBD patients at higher risk of phenoconversion.</p>

<p>The drawing at the top shows coronal sections through a gyrified human brain (at left) and a lissencephalic (‘’smooth,” i.e., lacking normal convolutions) human brain (at right). The lower half of the image shows exemplary images of primate brains with a strongly gyrified cortex (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>) versus a comparatively smooth brain surface (<i>Perodicticus potto</i>). Although the pre-alpha layer in <i>Pongo pygmaeus</i> (at left) displays cellular islands, these are lacking in the lissencephalic primate (at right). The images are identical to those shown in Figure 1.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the main interface between the sensory association areas of the neocortex and the hippocampus. It is crucial for the evaluation and processing of sensory data for long-term memory consolidation and shows damage in many brain diseases, for example, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and developmental disorders.</p>
<p>The pre-alpha layer of the EC in humans (layer II) displays a remarkable distribution of neurons in islands. These cellular islands give rise to a portion of the perforant path—the major reciprocal data stream for neocortical information into the hippocampal formation. However, the functional relevance of the morphological appearance of the pre-alpha layer in cellular islands and the precise timing of their initial appearance during primate evolution are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a comparative study of the EC from 38 nonhuman primates and <i>Homo sapiens</i> and found a strong relationship between gyrification index (GI) and the presence of the pre-alpha cellular islands. The formation of cellular islands also correlated with brain and body weight as well as neopallial volume. In the two human lissencephalic cases, the cellular islands in the pre-alpha layer were lacking. These findings emphasize the relationship between cortical folding and island formation in the EC from an evolutionary perspective and suggest a role in the pathomechanism of developmental brain disorders.</p>

                Cui et al. demonstrate that glutamate is required for itch transmission in MRGPRA3+ primary afferents, which also use the neuropeptide NMB to enhance signaling. Because both glutamate and Nmb are broadly available in primary afferents, this suggests that distinct neurotransmitters are not necessary to confer itch modality specificity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptional regulation of neural stem cell expansion in adult hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Experience governs neurogenesis from radial-glial neural stem cells (RGLs) in the adult hippocampus to support memory. Transcription factors in RGLs integrate physiological signals to dictate self-renewal division mode. Whereas asymmetric RGL divisions drive neurogenesis during favorable conditions, symmetric divisions prevent premature neurogenesis while amplifying RGLs to anticipate future neurogenic demands. The identities of transcription factors regulating RGL symmetric self-renewal, unlike those that regulate RGL asymmetric self-renewal, are not known. Here, we show in mice that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 9 (<i>Klf9</i>) is elevated in quiescent RGLs and inducible, deletion of <i>Klf9</i> promotes RGL activation state. Clonal analysis and longitudinal intravital 2-photon imaging directly demonstrate that Klf9 functions as a brake on RGL symmetric self-renewal. <i>In vivo</i> translational profiling of RGLs lacking Klf9 generated a molecular blueprint for RGL symmetric self-renewal that was characterized by upregulation of genetic programs underlying Notch and mitogen signaling, cell-cycle, fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis. Together, these observations identify Klf9 as a transcriptional regulator of neural stem cell expansion in the adult hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Autophagosomes fuse to phagosomes and facilitate the degradation of apoptotic cells in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Autophagosomes are double-membrane intracellular vesicles that degrade protein aggregates, intracellular organelles, and other cellular components. During the development of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, many somatic and germ cells undergo apoptosis. These cells are engulfed and degraded by their neighboring cells. We discovered a novel role of autophagosomes in facilitating the degradation of apoptotic cells using a real-time imaging technique. Specifically, the double-membrane autophagosomes in engulfing cells are recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells and subsequently fuse to phagosomes, allowing the inner vesicle to enter the phagosomal lumen. Mutants defective in the production of autophagosomes display significant defects in the degradation of apoptotic cells, demonstrating the importance of autophagosomes to this process. The signaling pathway led by the phagocytic receptor CED-1, the adaptor protein CED-6, and the large GTPase dynamin (DYN-1) promotes the recruitment of autophagosomes to phagosomes. Moreover, the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with phagosomes requires the functions of the small GTPase RAB-7 and the HOPS complex components. Further observations suggest that autophagosomes provide apoptotic cell-degradation activities in addition to and in parallel of lysosomes. Our findings reveal that, unlike the single-membrane, <span class="underline">L</span>C3-<span class="underline">a</span>ssociated <span class="underline">p</span>hagocytosis (LAP) vesicles reported for mammalian phagocytes, the canonical double-membrane autophagosomes facilitate the clearance of <i>C. elegans</i> apoptotic cells. These findings add autophagosomes to the collection of intracellular organelles that contribute to phagosome maturation, identify novel crosstalk between the autophagy and phagosome maturation pathways, and discover the upstream signaling molecules that initiate this crosstalk.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chlamydomonas ARMC2/PF27 is an obligate cargo adapter for IFT of radial spokes</a></h4>

              
                Intraflagellar transport (IFT) carries proteins into flagella but how IFT trains interact with the large number of diverse proteins required to assemble flagella remains largely unknown. Here, we show that IFT of radial spokes in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> requires ARMC2/PF27, a conserved armadillo repeat protein associated with male infertility and reduced lung function. <i>Chlamydomonas</i> ARMC2 was highly enriched in growing flagella and tagged ARMC2 and the spoke protein RSP3 comigrated on anterograde trains. In contrast, a cargo and an adapter of inner and outer dynein arms moved independently of ARMC2, indicating that unrelated cargoes distribute stochastically onto the IFT trains. After concomitant unloading at the flagellar tip, RSP3 attached to the axoneme whereas ARMC2 diffused back to the cell body. In <i>armc2/pf27</i> mutants, IFT of radial spokes was abolished and the presence of radial spokes was limited to the proximal region of flagella. We conclude that ARMC2 is a cargo adapter required for IFT of radial spokes to ensure their assembly along flagella. ARMC2 belongs to a growing class of cargo-specific adapters that enable flagellar transport of preassembled axonemal substructures by IFT.

                Hyperventilation reliably provokes seizures in patients diagnosed with absence epilepsy. Despite this predictable patient response, the mechanisms that enable hyperventilation to powerfully activate absence seizure-generating circuits remain entirely unknown. By utilizing gas exchange manipulations and optogenetics in the WAG/Rij rat, an established rodent model of absence epilepsy, we demonstrate that absence seizures are highly sensitive to arterial carbon dioxide, suggesting that seizure-generating circuits are sensitive to pH. Moreover, hyperventilation consistently activated neurons within the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, a structure implicated in seizure generation.  We show that intralaminar thalamus also contains pH-sensitive neurons. Collectively, these observations suggest that hyperventilation activates pH-sensitive neurons of the intralaminar nuclei to provoke absence seizures.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel through one of two binding sites</a></h4>

              
                Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) but the mechanism of inhibition is not well understood. The PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), inhibits agonist responses of the pLGIC, ELIC, more effectively than palmitic acid, similar to the effects observed in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Using photo-affinity labeling and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we identified two fatty acid binding sites in the outer transmembrane domain (TMD) of ELIC. Fatty acid binding to the photolabeled sites is selective for DHA over palmitic acid, and specific for an agonist-bound state. Hexadecyl-methanethiosulfonate modification of one of the two fatty acid binding sites in the outer TMD recapitulates the inhibitory effect of PUFAs in ELIC. The results demonstrate that DHA selectively binds to multiple sites in the outer TMD of ELIC, but that state-dependent binding to a single intrasubunit site mediates DHA inhibition of ELIC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Similar neural and perceptual masking effects of low-power optogenetic stimulation in primate V1</a></h4>

              
                Can direct stimulation of primate V1 substitute for a visual stimulus and mimic its perceptual effect? To address this question, we developed an optical-genetic toolkit to 'read' neural population responses using widefield calcium imaging, while simultaneously using optogenetics to 'write' neural responses into V1 of behaving macaques. We focused on the phenomenon of visual masking, where detection of a dim target is significantly reduced by a co-localized medium-brightness mask [1, 2]. Using our toolkit, we tested whether V1 optogenetic stimulation can recapitulate the perceptual masking effect of a visual mask. We find that, similar to a visual mask, low-power optostimulation can significantly reduce visual detection sensitivity, that a sublinear interaction between visual and optogenetic evoked V1 responses could account for this perceptual effect, and that these neural and behavioral effects are spatially selective. Our toolkit and results open the door for further exploration of perceptual substitutions by direct stimulation of sensory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Establishment of developmental gene silencing by ordered polycomb complex recruitment in early zebrafish embryos</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrate embryos achieve developmental competency during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) by establishing chromatin states that silence yet poise developmental genes for subsequent lineage-specific activation. Here, we reveal the order of chromatin states in establishing developmental gene poising in preZGA zebrafish embryos. Poising is established at promoters and enhancers that initially contain open/permissive chromatin with 'Placeholder' nucleosomes (bearing H2A.Z, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac), and DNA hypomethylation. Silencing is initiated by the recruitment of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), and H2Aub1 deposition by catalytic Rnf2 during preZGA and ZGA stages. During postZGA, H2Aub1 enables Aebp2-containing PRC2 recruitment and H3K27me3 deposition. Notably, preventing H2Aub1 (via Rnf2 inhibition) eliminates recruitment of Aebp2-PRC2 and H3K27me3, and elicits transcriptional upregulation of certain developmental genes during ZGA. However, upregulation is independent of H3K27me3 - establishing H2Aub1 as the critical silencing modification at ZGA. Taken together, we reveal the logic and mechanism for establishing poised/silent developmental genes in early vertebrate embryos.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dissociation of impulsive traits by subthalamic metabotropic glutamate receptor 4</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral strategies require gating of premature responses to optimize outcomes. Several brain areas control impulsive actions, but the neuronal basis of natural variation in impulsivity between individuals remain largely unknown. Here, by combining a Go/No-Go behavioral assay with  resting state (rs) functional MRI in mice, we identified the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a known gate for motor control in the basal ganglia, as a major hot spot for trait impulsivity. In vivo recorded STN neural activity encoded impulsive action as a separable state from basic motor control, characterized by decoupled STN/Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) mesoscale networks. Optogenetic modulation of STN activity bi-directionally controlled impulsive behavior. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations showed that these impulsive actions are modulated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4) function in STN and its coupling to SNr in a behavioral trait-dependent manner, and independently of general motor function. In conclusion, STN circuitry multiplexes motor control and trait impulsivity, which are molecularly dissociated by mGlu4. This provides a potential mechanism for the genetic modulation of impulsive behavior, a clinically relevant predictor for developing psychiatric disorders associated with impulsivity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fluorescence activation mechanism and imaging of drug permeation with new sensors for smoking-cessation ligands</a></h4>

              
                Nicotinic partial agonists provide an accepted aid for smoking cessation and thus contribute to decreasing tobacco-related disease. Improved drugs constitute a continued area of study. However, there remains no reductionist method to examine the cellular and subcellular pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds in living cells. Here, we developed new intensity-based drug sensing fluorescent reporters ('iDrugSnFRs') for the nicotinic partial agonists dianicline, cytisine, and two cytisine derivatives - 10-fluorocytisine and 9-bromo-10-ethylcytisine. We report the first atomic-scale structures of liganded periplasmic binding protein-based biosensors, accelerating development of iDrugSnFRs and also explaining the activation mechanism. The nicotinic iDrugSnFRs detect their drug partners in solution, as well as at the plasma membrane (PM) and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cell lines and mouse hippocampal neurons. At the PM, the speed of solution changes limits the growth and decay rates of the fluorescence response in almost all cases. In contrast, we found that rates of membrane crossing differ among these nicotinic drugs by &gt; 30 fold. The new nicotinic iDrugSnFRs provide insight into the real-time pharmacokinetic properties of nicotinic agonists and provide a methodology whereby iDrugSnFRs can inform both pharmaceutical neuroscience and addiction neuroscience.

                Visual perspective taking (VPT), particularly level 2 VPT (VPT2), which allows an individual to understand that the same object can be seen differently by others, is related to the theory of mind (ToM), because both functions require a decoupled representation from oneself. Although previous neuroimaging studies have shown that VPT and ToM activate the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), it is unclear whether common neural substrates are involved in VPT and ToM. To clarify this point, the present study directly compared the TPJ activation patterns of individual participants performing VPT2 and ToM tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging and within-subjects design. VPT2-induced activations were compared with activations observed during a mental rotation task as a control task, whereas ToM-related activities were identified with a standard ToM localizer using false-belief stories. A whole-brain analysis revealed that VPT2 and ToM activated overlapping areas in the posterior part of the TPJ. By comparing the activations induced by VPT2 and ToM in individual participants, we found that the peak voxels induced by ToM were located significantly more anteriorly and dorsally within the bilateral TPJ than those measured during the VPT2 task. We further confirmed that these activity areas were spatially distinct from the nearby extrastriate body area (EBA), visual motion area (MT+), and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) using independent localizer scans. Our findings revealed that VPT2 and ToM have distinct representations, albeit partially overlapping, indicating the functional heterogeneity of social cognition within the TPJ.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proteomic identification of phosphorylation dependent Septin 7 interactors that drive dendritic spine formation</a></h4>

              
                Septins are a family of cytoskeletal proteins that regulate several important aspects of neuronal development. Septin 7 (Sept7) is enriched at the base of dendritic spines in excitatory neurons and mediates both spine formation and spine-synapse maturation. Phosphorylation at a conserved C-terminal tail residue of Sept7 mediates its translocation into the dendritic spine head to allow spine-synapse maturation. The mechanistic basis for postsynaptic stability and compartmentalization conferred by phosphorylated Sept7, however, is not known. We report herein the proteomic identification of Sept7 phosphorylation dependent neuronal interactors. Using Sept7 C-terminal phosphopeptide pulldown and biochemical assays, we show that the 14-3-3 family of proteins specifically interact with Sept7 when phosphorylated at the T426 residue. Biochemically, we validate the interaction between Sept7 and 14-3-3 isoform gamma, and show that 14-3-3 gamma is also enriched in mature dendritic spine head. Further, we demonstrate that interaction of phosphorylated Sept7 with 14-3-3 protects it from dephosphorylation, as expression of a 14-3-3 antagonist significantly decreases phosphorylated Sept7 in neurons. This study identifies 14-3-3 proteins as an important physiological regulator of Sept7 function in neuronal development.

                Neural codes are thought to be reorganized during memory formation by long-term potentiation (LTP) of synapses. Here, using a novel approach for selectively blocking LTP, we found that eliminating LTP in hippocampal or striatal circuits only produces limited effects on learning and memory. To reconcile the discrepancy between the large physiological effect of blocking LTP and the absent effect on learning, we studied how LTP impacts neuronal computations in the hippocampus using in-vivo Ca2+-imaging. Contrary to current conceptual frameworks, we found that hippocampal CA1-region LTP is not required for accurate representations of space in hippocampal neurons, but rather endows these neurons with reward- and novelty-coding properties. Thus, instead of driving formation of cognitive maps and memory engrams, CA1-region LTP incorporates salience information into cognitive representations.

                Many experimental studies have examined behavioral and electrophysiological responses of mosquitoes to odors. However, the differences across studies in data collection, processing, and reporting make it difficult to perform large-scale analyses combining data from multiple studies. Here we extract and standardize data for 12 mosquito species, along with Drosophila melanogaster for comparison, from over 170 studies and curate the Mosquito Olfactory Response Ensemble (MORE), publicly available at https://neuralsystems.github.io/MORE. We demonstrate the ability of MORE in generating biological insights by finding patterns across studies. Our analyses reveal that ORs are tuned to specific ranges of several physicochemical properties of odorants; the empty-neuron recording technique for measuring OR responses is more sensitive than the Xenopus oocyte technique; there are systematic differences in the behavioral preferences reported by different types of assays; and odorants tend to become less attractive or more aversive at higher concentrations.

                Intracellular trafficking of AMPA receptors is a tightly regulated process which involves several adaptor proteins, and is crucial for the activity of excitatory synapses in both basal conditions and during synaptic plasticity. We found that, in rat hippocampal neurons, an intracellular pool of the tetraspanin TSPAN5 specifically promotes exocytosis of newly synthesised GluA2-containing AMPA receptors without affecting their internalisation. TSPAN5 mediates this function by interacting with AP-4 and Stargazin and possibly using recycling endosomes as a delivery route. This work highlights TSPAN5 as a new adaptor regulating AMPA receptor trafficking. In addition, it provides a possible mechanism for the intellectual disability symptoms that occur in AP-4 deficiency syndrome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Encoding of speech in convolutional layers and the brain stem based on language experience</a></h4>

              
                Comparing artificial neural networks (ANNs) with outputs of brain imaging techniques has recently seen substantial advances in (computer) vision and text-based language models. Here, we propose a framework to compare biological and artificial neural computations of spoken language representations and propose several new challenges to this paradigm. Using a technique proposed by Begus and Zhou (2021b), we can analyze encoding of any acoustic property in intermediate convolutional layers of an artificial neural network. This allows us to test similarities in speech encoding between the brain and artificial neural networks in a way that is more interpretable than the majority of existing proposals that focus on correlations and supervised models. We introduce fully unsupervised deep generative models (the Generative Adversarial Network architecture) trained on raw speech to the brain-and-ANN-comparison paradigm, which enable testing of both the production and perception principles in human speech. We present a framework that parallels electrophysiological experiments measuring complex Auditory Brainstem Response (cABR) in human brain with intermediate layers in deep convolutional networks. We compared peak latency in cABR relative to the stimulus in the brain stem experiment, and in intermediate convolutional layers relative to the input/output in deep convolutional networks. We also examined and compared the effect of prior language exposure on the peak latency in cABR, and in intermediate convolutional layers of a phonetic property. Specifically, the phonetic property (i.e., VOT =10 ms) is perceived differently by English vs. Spanish speakers as voiced (e.g. [ba]) vs voiceless (e.g. [pa]). Critically, the cABR peak latency to the VOT phonetic property is different between English and Spanish speakers, and peak latency in intermediate convolutional layers is different between English-trained and Spanish-trained computational models. Substantial similarities in peak latency encoding between the human brain and intermediate convolutional networks emerge based on results from eight trained networks (including a replication experiment). The proposed technique can be used to compare encoding between the human brain and intermediate convolutional layers for any acoustic property.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal Volume, Neurite Density and Trace Eye-Blink Conditioning in Young Children</a></h4>

              
                The current study examined the relations between hippocampal structure (e.g., volume and neurite density) and performance on a trace eye blink conditioning (EBC) task in young children. Our first aim assessed whether individual differences in hippocampal volume were associated with trace EBC performance, using both percent Conditioned Responses (% CR) and CR onset latency or the average latency (ms) at which the child started their blink, as measures of hippocampal-dependent associative learning. Our second aim evaluated whether individual differences in hippocampal neurite density were associated with EBC performance using the same outcome measures. Typically developing 4- to 6-year-olds (N = 31; 14 girls; Mage = 5.67; SDage = 0.89) completed T1 and diffusion-weighted MRI scans and a 15-minute trace eyeblink conditioning task outside of the scanner. % CR and CR onset latency were computed across all tone-puff and tone-alone trials. While hippocampal volume was not associated with any of our EBC measures, greater hippocampal neurite density bilaterally, was associated with later CR onset. In other words, children with greater left and right hippocampal neurite density blinked closer to the US (i.e., air puff) than children with less hippocampal neurite density, indicating that structural changes in the hippocampus assisted in the accurate timing of conditioned responses.

                Background: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can synthesize brain images from image or noise input. So far, the gold standard for assessing the quality of the generated images has been human expert ratings. However, due to limitations of human assessment in terms of cost, scalability, and the limited sensitivity of the human eye to more subtle statistical relationships, a more automated approach towards evaluating GANs is required. New method: We investigated to what extent visual quality can be assessed using image quality metrics and we used group analysis and spatial independent components analysis to verify that the GAN reproduces multivariate statistical relationships found in real data. Reference human data was obtained by recruiting neuroimaging experts to assess real Magnetic Resonance (MR) images and images generated by a Wasserstein GAN. Image quality was manipulated by exporting images at different stages of GAN training. Results: Experts were sensitive to changes in image quality as evidenced by ratings and reaction times, and the generated images reproduced group effects (age, gender) and spatial correlations moderately well. We also surveyed a number of image quality metrics which consistently failed to fully reproduce human data. While the metrics Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) showed good overall agreement with human assessment for lower-quality images (i.e. images from early stages of GAN training), only a Deep Quality Assessment (QA) model trained on human ratings was sensitive to the subtle differences between higher-quality images. Conclusions: We recommend a combination of group analyses, spatial correlation analyses, and both distortion metrics (SSIM, NIQE) and perceptual models (Deep QA) for a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of brain images produced by GANs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual search training benefits from the integrative effect of enhanced covert attention and optimized overt eye movements</a></h4>

              
                Visual search in a complex environment requires efficient discrimination between target and distractors. Training serves as an effective approach to improve visual search performance when the target does not automatically pop out from the distractors. In the present study, we trained subjects on a conjunction visual search task and examined the training effects in behavior and eye movement from Experiments 1 to 4. The results showed that training improved behavioral performance and reduced the number of saccades and overall scanning time. Training also increased the search initiation time before the first saccade and the proportion of trials in which the subjects correctly identified the target without any saccade, but these effects were modulated by stimulus' parameters. In Experiment 5, we replicated these training effects when eye movements and EEG signals were recorded simultaneously. The results revealed significant N2pc components after the stimulus onset (i.e., stimulus-locked) and before the first saccade (i.e., saccade-locked) when the search target was the trained one. These N2pc components can be considered as the neural signatures for the training-induced boost of covert attention to the trained target. The enhanced covert attention led to a beneficial tradeoff between search initiation time and the number of saccades as a small amount of increase in search initiation time could result in a larger reduction in scanning time. These findings suggest that the enhanced covert attention to target and optimized overt eye movements are coordinated together to facilitate visual search training.

                Successful goal-directed actions require constant fine-tuning in response to errors introduced by changes in the body and environment. This implicit adaptive process has been assumed to operate in a statistically optimal fashion, reducing its sensitivity to errors when sensory uncertainty is high. However, recent work has shown that visual uncertainty attenuates implicit adaptation for small errors, but not large errors, a result that is at odds with an optimal integration hypothesis. This error size interaction has motivated a new hypothesis that sensory uncertainty impacts the distribution of the perceived error locations but not the system's sensitivity to errors. To examine these competing hypotheses, previous studies have experimentally manipulated uncertainty. But it is unknown which hypothesis best describes motor adaptation to sensory uncertainty experienced during daily life. To address this question, we recruited individuals with low vision due to diverse clinical conditions impacting visual uncertainty and matched controls. The groups were tested on visuomotor tasks designed to isolate implicit adaptation and maintain tight control over the error size. In two experiments, low vision was associated with attenuated implicit adaptation only for small errors, but not for large errors. Taken together with prior work in which visual uncertainty was experimentally manipulated, these results support the notion that increasing sensory uncertainty increases the likelihood that errors are mis-localized but does not affect error sensitivity, offering a novel account for the motor learning deficits seen in low vision.

                Imagine practicing a piece of music, or a speech, solely within the mind, without any sensory input or motor output. Our ability to implement dynamic internal representations is key for successful behavior, yet how the brain achieves this is not fully understood. Here we trained primates to perceive, and internally maintain, rhythms of different tempos and performed large-scale recordings of neuronal activity across multiple areas spanning the sensory-motor processing hierarchy. Results show that perceiving and maintaining rhythms engage multiple brain areas, including visual, parietal, premotor, prefrontal, and hippocampal regions. Each area displayed oscillatory activity that reflected the temporal and spatial characteristics of an internal metronome which flexibly encoded fast, medium, and slow tempos on a trial-by-trial basis. The presence of widespread metronome-related activity across the brain, in the absence of stimuli and overt actions, is consistent with the idea that time and rhythm are maintained by a mechanism that internally replays the stimuli and actions that define well-timed behavior.

                Spontaneously fluctuating brain activity patterns emerge at rest and relate to brain functional networks involved in task conditions. Despite detailed descriptions of the spatio-temporal brain patterns, our understanding of their generative mechanism is still incomplete. Using a combination of computational modeling and dynamical systems analysis we provide a complete mechanistic description in terms of the constituent entities and the productive relation of their causal activities leading to the formation of a resting state manifold via the network connectivity. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaking by the connectivity creates a characteristic flow on the manifold, which produces the major empirical data features including spontaneous high amplitude co-activations, neuronal cascades, spectral cortical gradients, multistability and characteristic functional connectivity dynamics. The understanding of the brain's resting state manifold is fundamental for the construction of task-specific flows and manifolds used in theories of brain function such as predictive coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Got Milk? Maternal immune activation during the mid-lactational period affects nutritional milk quality and adolescent offspring sensory processing in male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                The neonatal environment requires a high level of maternal demand in terms of both breastfeeding and other forms of maternal care. Previous studies have underscored the importance of these maternal factors on offspring development and behavior. However, their contribution as dynamic variables in animal models of early life stress are often overlooked. In the present study, we show that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal immune activation (MIA) on postnatal day (P)10 immediately elevated milk corticosterone concentrations, which recovered by P11. In contrast, both milk triglyceride and percent creamatocrit values demonstrated a prolonged decrease following inflammatory challenge. Sustained inflammatory-induced changes to the nutritional quality of milk were also evidenced by its composition of microbial communities associated with inefficient energy and lipid metabolism. Nutritional deficits in early development have been associated with metabolic dysfunction later in life. Indeed, MIA-associated changes in the nutritional profile of milk were reflected by increased adolescent offspring bodyweights. While MIA did not decrease maternal care quality, there was a significant compensatory increase in maternal licking and grooming the day that followed the inflammatory challenge. However, this did not protect against disrupted neonatal huddling or later-life alterations in sensorimotor gating and mechanical allodynia in MIA offspring. Animal models of early life stress can impact both parents and their offspring. One mechanism that can mediate the effects of such stressors is changes to maternal lactation quality which our data show can confer multifaceted and compounding effects on offspring physiology and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of PDF Receptor signaling controlling daily locomotor rhythms in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) trigger second messenger signaling cascades following activation by cognate ligands. GPCR signaling ceases following receptor desensitization or uncoupling from G proteins. Each day and in conjunction with ambient daylight conditions, neuropeptide PDF regulates the phase and amplitude of locomotor activity rhythms in Drosophila through its receptor, a Family B GPCR. Its time of action - when it starts signaling and when it stops - must change every day to following changing day lengths. We studied the process by which PDF Receptor (PDFR) signaling turns off in vivo, by modifying as many as half of the 28 potential sites of phosphorylation in its C terminal tail. We report that many such sites are conserved evolutionarily, and that in general their conversion to a non-phosphorylatable residue (alanine) creates a specific behavioral syndrome opposite to loss of function phenotypes previously described for pdfr. Such "gain of function" pdfr phenotypes include increases in the amplitudes of both Morning and Evening behavioral peaks as well as multi-hour delays of their phases. Such effects were most clearly associated with a few specific serine residues, and were seen following alanine-conversion of as few as one or two residues. The behavioral phenotypes produced by these PDFR sequence variants are not a consequence of changes to the pharmacological properties or of changes in their surface expression, as measured in vitro. We conclude that the mechanisms underlying termination of PDFR signaling are complex and central to an understanding of how this critical neuropeptide modulates daily rhythmic behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A role for Lin28a in aging-associated decline of adult hippocampal neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal neurogenesis declines with aging. Wnt ligands and antagonists within the hippocampal neurogenic niche regulate the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and the development of new neurons, and the changes of their levels in the niche mediate aging-associated decline of neurogenesis. We found that RNA-binding protein Lin28a remained existent in neural progenitor cells and granule neurons in the adult hippocampus, and decreased with aging. Loss of Lin28a inhibited the responsiveness of neural progenitor cells to niche Wnt agonist and reduced neurogenesis, thus impairing pattern separation. Overexpression of Lin28a increased the proliferation of neural progenitor cells, promoted the functional integration of newborn neurons, restored neurogenesis in Wnt-deficient dentate gyrus, and rescued the impaired pattern separation in aging mice. Our data suggest that Lin28a regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis as an intracellular mechanism by responding to niche Wnt signals, and its decrease is involved in aging-associated decline of hippocampal neurogenesis as well as related cognitive functions.

                The acceleration of the head and hip along the x-, y-, and z-axis of 14 healthy subjects was recorded during two sessions of 12 consecutive hours. The magnitude, frequency content, and root mean square of the acceleration signals were used to determine the type of physical activity (sitting, standing, walking, etc.) during normal daily life on Earth. The acceleration signal slope (jerk) was also calculated to assess whether these activities were sufficient to maintain bone mineral density. These measurements indicated that the changes in vertical acceleration experienced by our subjects during normal daily life were presumably sufficient to maintain bone mineral density. However, these changes might not be sufficient for postmenopausal women and astronauts during long-term exposure to weightlessness during spaceflight

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The rosy future paradox: Positive future thinking without task relevance enhances negative biases and anxiety for aversive events</a></h4>

              
                Expectations have an important role in guiding behavior and the interpretation of novel information, but can contain negative biases such as is the case in anxiety disorders. Positive future thinking may provide an accessible way to attenuate these negatively biases. However, much is still unclear about the optimal form of such positive interventions, and it is unknown if the effects go beyond subjective experience. Here, we used a positive future thinking intervention to adapt the way a stressful event is experienced. Participants imagined either task-relevant (N = 21) or irrelevant (N = 21) positive future events before being subjected to the Trier Social Stress Task, or did not receive the intervention (N= 20). We recorded resting state EEG during the anticipation and recovery phases of the TSST to assess intervention and trait anxiety related differences in the level of frontal delta-beta coupling, which is considered a neurobiological substrate of emotion regulation. Results show that the intervention reduces event-related stress and anxiety, and increases social fixation behavior and task performance, but only if future thinking is task relevant. Paradoxically, task-irrelevant positive future thoughts enhance negative perceptual biases and stress reactivity. This increase in stress reactivity in the task-irrelevant group was corroborated by the elevated levels frontal delta-beta coupling during event anticipation, especially for those with high trait anxiety. This suggests an increased demand for emotion regulation following the task-irrelevant intervention, possibly due to the contextual incongruence between positive imagery and the stressor. Together, these results show that positive future thinking can mitigate the negative emotional, behavioral and neurobiological consequences of a stressful event, but that it should not be applied indiscriminately. Task-relevant positive future thinking can be an accessible way to boost efficacy of exposure therapy for pathological anxiety, and can help people deal with negative anticipation in daily life.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cardiac arrest (CA) is a major health burden with brain damage being a significant contributor to mortality. We found lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), including a species containing docosahexaenoic acid (LPC-DHA), was significantly decreased in plasma post-CA, supplementation of which significantly improved neurological outcomes. The aim of this study is to understand the protective role of LPC-DHA supplementation on the brain post-CA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We first evaluated associations between the plasma level of LPC-DHA and neurological injury and outcomes of human CA patients. We then utilized a rat CA model and cell cultures to investigate therapeutic and mechanistic aspects of plasma LPC-DHA supplementation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that decreased plasma LPC-DHA was strongly associated with neurological outcomes and disappearance of difference between gray and white matter in the brain after CA in human patients. In rats, the decreased plasma LPC-DHA was associated with decreased levels of brain LPC-DHA after CA, and supplementing plasma LPC-DHA normalized brain levels of LPC-DHA and alleviated neuronal cell death, activation of astrocytes, and expression of various inflammatory and mitochondrial dynamics genes. We also observed deceased severity of metabolic alterations with LPC-DHA supplementation using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Furthermore, LPC treatment showed a similar protective effect for neurons and astrocytes in mixed primary brain cell cultures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed neuroprotection accompanied with normalized brain LPC-DHA level by plasma supplementation implicate the importance of preventing the decrease of brain LPC-DHA post-CA for attenuating brain injury. Furthermore, the data supports the causative role of decreased plasma LPC-DHA for brain damage after CA.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Gastropods use lens-bearing eyes to detect ambient light. The retina contains photoreceptors that directly project to the brain. Here we identified the neurotransmitters that the retinal cells use for projection to the brain in the terrestrial slug <i>Limax</i>. We identified 12 genes encoding neuropeptides as well as a novel vesicular glutamate transporter, a marker of glutamatergic neuron, expressed in the retinal cells. Spatial expression profiles of the neuropeptide genes were determined by in situ hybridization. WWamide/MIP1/Pedal peptide2 were co-expressed in the neurons of the accessory retina. In the main retina, prohormone-4 was expressed in the ventro-lateral region. Clionin was expressed in the ventro-medial region. Pedal peptide was expressed in the anterior region of the main retina and in the accessory retina. Enterin was expressed in many neurons, including the accessory retina, but not in the dorsal region. FxRIamide1 and 2 were co-expressed in the posterior region. Prohormone-4 variant was uniformly expressed in many neurons but scarcely in the accessory retina. MIP2 was widely expressed throughout the dorso-ventral axis in the posterio-lateral region of the main retina. Myo1 was expressed in many neurons of the main retina but predominantly in the dorsal region. These expression patterns were confirmed by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies against the neuropeptides. Projections of these peptidergic retinal neurons were confirmed by immunostaining of the optic nerve. Our present study revealed regional differentiation of the retina with respect to the neurotransmitters that the retinal cells use.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Proper function of the hippocampus is critical for executing cognitive tasks such as learning and memory. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other neurological disorders are commonly associated with cognitive deficits and hippocampal dysfunction. Although there are many existing models of individual subregions of the hippocampus, few models attempt to integrate the primary areas into one system. In this work, we developed a computational model of the hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1. The subregions are represented as an interconnected neuronal network, incorporating well-characterized ex vivo slice electrophysiology into the functional neuron models and well-documented anatomical connections into the network structure. In addition, since plasticity is foundational to the role of the hippocampus in learning and memory as well as necessary for studying adaptation to injury, we implemented spike-timing-dependent plasticity among the synaptic connections. Our model mimics key features of hippocampal activity, including signal frequencies in the theta and gamma bands and phase-amplitude coupling in area CA1. We also studied the effects of spike-timing-dependent plasticity impairment, a potential consequence of TBI, in our model and found that impairment decreases broadband power in CA3 and CA1 and reduces phase coherence between these two subregions, yet phase-amplitude coupling in CA1 remains intact. Altogether, our work demonstrates characteristic hippocampal activity with a scaled network model of spiking neurons and reveals the sensitive balance of plasticity mechanisms in the circuit through one manifestation of mild traumatic injury.</p>

                The etiology of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (iPD) is multifactorial, and both genetics and environmental exposures are risk factors. While mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) that are associated with increased kinase activity are the most common cause of autosomal dominant PD, the role of LRRK2 in iPD, independent of mutations, remains uncertain. In this review, we discuss how the architecture of LRRK2 influences kinase activation and how enhanced LRRK2 substrate phosphorylation might contribute to pathogenesis.

                Internal states can profoundly alter innate behavioral responses to releasing stimuli. Liu et al. identify distinct neural subpopulations within a single hypothalamic nucleus (VMHvl) that causally control female mating versus aggressive behaviors. Changes in the subpopulations’ relative cue sensitivity underlies a state-dependent switch in social behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Volatile anesthetics inhibit presynaptic cGMP signaling to depress presynaptic excitability in rat hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Volatile anesthetics alter presynaptic function including effects on Ca2+ influx and neurotransmitter release. These actions are proposed to play important roles in their pleiotropic neurophysiological effects including unconsciousness and amnesia. The nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO/cGMP) signaling pathway has been implicated in presynaptic mechanisms, and disruption of NO/cGMP signaling has been shown to alter sensitivity to volatile anesthetics in vivo. We investigated NO/cGMP signaling in relation to volatile anesthetic actions in cultured rat hippocampal neurons using pharmacological tools and genetically encoded biosensors of cGMP levels. Using the fluorescent biosensor cGull we found that electrical stmulation-evoked NMDA-type glutamate receptor-independent presynaptic cGMP transients were inhibited -33.2% by isoflurane (0.51 mM) and -23.8% by sevoflurane (0.57 mM) (p<0.0001) compared to a stimulation without anesthetic. Isoflurane and sevoflurane inhibition of stimulation-evoked increases in presynaptic Ca2+ concentration, measured with synaptophysin-GCaMP6f, and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, measured with synaptophysin-pHlourin, were reduced by in neurons expressing the cGMP scavenger sponGee. This reduction in anesthetic effect was recapitulated by inhibiting HCN channels, a cGMP-modulated effector that can facilitate glutamate release. We propose that volatile anesthetics depress presynaptic cGMP signaling and downstream effectors like HCN channels that are essential to presynaptic function and excitability. These findings identify a novel mechanism by which volatile anesthetics depress synaptic transmission via second messenger signaling involving the NO/cGMP pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seed-competent tau monomer initiates pathology in PS19 tauopathy mice</a></h4>

              
                Tau aggregation into ordered assemblies causes myriad neurodegenerative tauopathies. We previously reported that tau monomer exists in either inert (Mi) or seed-competent (Ms) conformational ensembles, and that Ms encodes strains, which are biologically active, self-propagating assemblies. We have previously isolated Ms from tauopathy brains, but it is unknown if disease begins with Ms formation followed by fibril assembly, or if Ms derives from fibrils and is an epiphenomenon. Consequently, we studied a tauopathy mouse model (PS19) that expresses full-length human (1N4R) tau containing a disease-associated mutation (P301S). Using tau repeat domain biosensor cells, we detected insoluble tau seeding activity at 2 months. We found insoluble tau protein assemblies by immunoblot at 3 months. We next immunopurified monomer from mice aged 1-6 weeks using size exclusion chromatography. We detected soluble seeding activity at 4 weeks, before insoluble material or larger assemblies, with assemblies ranging from n=1-3 tau units. By 5 and 6 weeks, large soluble assemblies had formed. This indicated the first detectable pathological forms of tau were Ms. We next tested for post-translational modifications of tau monomer from 1-6 weeks. We detected no phosphorylation unique to Ms in PS19 or Alzheimer disease brain. We conclude that tauopathy begins with formation of Ms monomer, whose activity is phosphorylation-independent. Ms self-assembles to form oligomers before it forms insoluble fibrils. The conversion of tau monomer from Mi to Ms thus constitutes the first detectable step in the initiation of tauopathy in this mouse model, with obvious implications for origins of disease in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SARS-CoV-2 entry sites are present in all structural elements of the human glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves: clinical implications</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections result in the temporary loss of smell and taste (anosmia and dysgeusia) in about one third of confirmed cases. Several investigators have reported that the viral spike protein receptor is present in olfactory neurons. However, no study has been published to date showing the presence of viral entry sites angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neuropilin1 (NRP1), and TMPRSS2, the serine protease necessary for priming the viral proteins, in human nerves that are responsible for taste sensation (cranial nerves: VII, IX and X). We used immunocytochemistry to examine three postmortem donor samples of the IXth (glossopharyngeal) and Xth (vagal) cranial nerves where they leave/join the medulla from three donors to confirm the presence of ACE2, NRP1 and TMPRSS2. Two samples were paraffin embedded; one was a frozen sample. In addition to staining sections from the latter, we isolated RNA from it, made cDNA, and performed PCR to confirm the presence of the mRNAs that encode the proteins visualized. All three of the proteins required for SARS-CoV-2 infections appear to be present in the human IXth and Xth nerves near the medulla. Direct infection of these nerves by the COVID-19 virus is likely to cause the loss of taste experienced by many patients. In addition, potential viral spread through these nerves into the adjacent brainstem respiratory centers might also aggravate the respiratory problems patients are experiencing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrated genomic analysis of AgRP neurons reveals that IRF3 regulates leptin's hunger-suppressing effects</a></h4>

              
                AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) coordinate homeostatic changes in appetite associated with fluctuations in food availability and leptin signaling. Identifying the relevant transcriptional regulatory pathways in these neurons has been a priority, yet such attempts have been stymied due to their low abundance and the rich cellular diversity of the ARC. Here we generated AgRP neuron-specific transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles during opposing states of fasting-induced hunger and leptin-induced hunger suppression. Cis-regulatory analysis of these integrated datasets enabled the identification of 28 putative hunger-promoting and 29 putative hunger-suppressing transcriptional regulators in AgRP neurons, 16 of which were predicted to be transcriptional effectors of leptin. Within our dataset, Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) emerged as a leading candidate mediator of leptin-induced hunger-suppression. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in vivo confirm the role of IRF3 in mediating the acute satiety-evoking effects of leptin in AgRP neurons, while live-cell imaging in vitro indicate that leptin can activate neuronal IRF3 in a cell autonomous manner. Finally, we employ CUT&RUN to uncover direct transcriptional targets of IRF3 in AgRP neurons in vivo. Thus, our findings identify AgRP neuron-expressed IRF3 as a key transcriptional effector of the hunger-suppressing effects of leptin.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Essential regulatory functions of CaMKII T286 phosphorylation in LTP and two distinct forms of LTD</a></h4>

              
                The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) mediates both long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) of excitatory synapses, two opposing forms of synaptic plasticity induced by strong versus weak stimulation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). NMDAR-dependent LTD is prevalent in juvenile hippocampus, but in mature hippocampus, LTD is still readily induced by stimulating metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Here we show that mGluR-dependent LTD also requires CaMKII and its T286 autophosphorylation that induces Ca2+-independent autonomous kinase activity. This autophosphorylation (i) accelerated CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses after LTP stimuli and (ii) was required for the movement to inhibitory synapses after NMDAR-LTD stimuli. Similar to NMDAR-LTD, the mGluR-LTD stimuli did not induce any CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. However, in contrast to NMDAR-LTD, the mGluR-LTD did not involve CaMKII movement to inhibitory synapses and did not require additional T305/306 autophosphorylation. Taken together, even though CaMKII T286 autophosphorylation has a longstanding prominent role in LTP, it is also required for both major forms of LTD in hippocampal neurons, albeit with differential requirements for the heterosynaptic communication of excitatory signals to inhibitory synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term dynamic changes of NMDA receptors following an excitotoxic challenge</a></h4>

              
                Excitotoxicity is a form of neuronal death characterized by the sustained activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) triggered by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. NADPH-diaphorase neurons [also known as nNOS (+) neurons] are a subpopulation of aspiny interneurons, largely spared following excitotoxic challenges. Unlike nNOS (-) cells, nNOS (+) neurons fail to generate reactive oxygen species in response to NMDAR activation, a key divergent step in the excitotoxic cascade. However, additional mechanisms underlying the reduced vulnerability of nNOS (+) neurons to NMDAR-driven neuronal death have not been explored. Using functional, genetic, and molecular analysis in striatal cultures, we demonstrate that nNOS (+) neurons possess distinct NMDAR properties. These specific features are primarily driven by the peculiar redox milieu of this subpopulation. In addition, we found that nNOS (+) neurons exposed to a pharmacological maneuver set to mimic chronic excitotoxicity alter their responses to NMDAR-mediated challenges. These findings suggest the presence of mechanisms providing long-term dynamic regulation of NMDARs that can have critical implications in neurotoxic settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Retrieval context determines whether event boundaries impair or enhance temporal order memory</a></h4>

              
                Meaningful changes in context create "event boundaries", segmenting continuous experience into distinct episodes in memory. A foundational finding in this literature is that event boundaries impair memory for the temporal order of stimuli spanning a boundary compared to equally spaced stimuli within an event. This seems surprising in light of intuitions about memory in everyday life, where the order of within-event experiences (did I have coffee before the first bite of bagel?) often seems more difficult to recall than the order of events per se (did I have breakfast or do the dishes first?). Here, we aimed to resolve this discrepancy by manipulating whether stimuli carried information about their encoding context during retrieval, as they often do in everyday life (e.g., bagel-breakfast). In Experiments 1 and 2, we show that stimuli inherently associated with a unique encoding context produce a "flipped" order memory effect, whereby temporal memory was superior for cross-boundary than within-event item pairs. In Experiments 3 and 4, we added context information at retrieval to a standard laboratory event memory protocol where stimuli were encoded in the presence of arbitrary context cues (colored frames). We found that whether temporal order memory for cross-boundary stimuli was enhanced or impaired relative to within-event items depended on whether the context was present or absent during the memory test. Taken together, we demonstrate that the effect of event boundaries on temporal memory is malleable, and determined by the availability of context information at retrieval.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Properties and computational consequences of fast dendritic spikes during natural behavior</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic membrane potential was recently measured for the first time in drug-free, naturally behaving rats over several days. These showed that neuronal dendrites generate a lot of sodium spikes, up to ten times as many as the somatic spikes. These key experimental findings are reviewed here, along with a discussion of computational models, and computational consequences of such intense spike traffic in dendrites. We overview the experimental techniques that enabled these measurements as well as a variety of models, ranging from conceptual models to detailed biophysical models. The biophysical models suggest that the intense dendritic spiking activity can arise from the biophysical properties of the dendritic voltage-dependent and synaptic ion channels, and delineate some computational consequences of fast dendritic spike activity. One remarkable aspect is that in the model, with fast dendritic spikes, the efficacy of synaptic strength in terms of driving the somatic activity is much less dependent on the position of the synapse in dendrites. This property suggests that fast dendritic spikes is a way to confer to neurons the possibility to grow complex dendritic trees with little computational loss for the distal most synapses, and thus form very complex networks with high density of connections, such as typically in the human brain. Another important consequence is that dendritically localized spikes can allow simultaneous but different computations on different dendritic branches, thereby greatly increasing the computational capacity and complexity of neuronal networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell analysis of microglial transcriptomic diversity in subarachnoid hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe stroke and the advanced treatment for SAH is still limited. Recent studies have shown that microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SAH. Microglia can transform their states in response to central nervous system injury. However, the transcriptomic features of microglia remained unknown in SAH. Recent developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a possible way to solve this problem.

MethodsEndovascular perforation (EVP) murine SAH model was established to reproduce experimental SAH. Microglia states are examined with immune staining and quantitate analysis. Post-SAH microglial single-cell suspension were harvest and sequenced using 10X scRNA-seq platform. Then, the detailed single-cell transcriptomic characterization of post-SAH microglia were analyzed with bioinformatics.

ResultsTranscriptional analysis revealed at least ten diverse microglial subgroups, including SAH-associated microglia (SAM), inflammatory-associated microglia (IAM) and proliferation-associated microglia (PAM), which all exhibit distinct marker gene expression patterns. Microglia subsets interaction reveals the functional relationship between elevated signaling pathways and microglial sub-populations in SAH. Receptor-ligand pair analysis revealed that complex inter-cellular interactions exist between the microglia subsets and other cell types, and indicated that microglia are important mediators of neuroinflammation after SAH. Integrated analysis with normal microglia further proved the existence of these microglia subpopulations and different gene markers associated with SAH were clarified.

ConclusionsCollectively, we first report the single-cell transcriptome of post-SAH microglia and found specific biomarkers related to the neuroinflammation in SAH. These results enhanced our understanding of the pathological mechanisms of microglial response to SAH, and may guide future development of SAH monitoring methods and therapeutics.

                The maintenance and differentiation of the adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) are controlled by cell-intrinsic molecular pathways that interact with extrinsic signaling cues. How neurogenesis in the SVZ is regulated by neural circuit activity remains poorly understood. Here we identified a novel neural circuit that regulates the state of lateral ventricular wall (LV) NSCs. Our results demonstrate that direct glutamatergic inputs from the frontal cortex, as well as local inhibitory interneurons, control the activity of subependymal cholinergic neurons. In vivo optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of defined neuronal populations within this circuit were sufficient to control LV NSC proliferation and SVZ neurogenesis. Moreover, acetylcholine (Ach), which activates M1 muscarinic ACh receptors, triggers the activation of quiescent NSCs. These findings shed light on neural activity-dependent regulation of postnatal and adult LV NSCs activation and SVZ neurogenesis.

                The primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) has greatly expanded to evolve specialized architecture, but its roles in top-down brain control remain enigmatic. Based on connectomics mapping of the marmoset PFC, we characterized two contrasting features of corticocortical and corticostriatal projections. One is the  focalness of projections, exemplified by multiple columnar axonal terminations in the cortical layers and the other is the  widespreadness of weaker projections, whose patterns consisted of several common motifs representing the framework of PFC connectivity. We clarified the topographic rules of distribution for these features, which should constrain how PFC neurons can coordinate to control the target regions as populations. These features are observed only primitively in rodents and are considered critical in understanding the roles of the PFC in neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Progress toward the development of brain-computer interfaces has signaled the potential to restore, replace, or augment lost or impaired neurological function in a variety of disease states. Existing brain-computer interfaces rely on invasive surgical procedures or brain-penetrating electrodes, which limit addressable applications of the technology and the number of eligible patients. Here we describe a novel approach to constructing a neural interface, comprising conformable thin-film electrode arrays and a minimally invasive surgical delivery system that together facilitate communication with large portions of the cortical surface in bidirectional fashion (enabling both recording and stimulation). We demonstrate the safety and feasibility of rapidly delivering reversible implants containing over 2,000 microelectrodes to multiple functional regions in both hemispheres of the Gottingen minipig brain simultaneously, without requiring a craniotomy, at an effective insertion rate faster than 40 ms per channel, without damaging the cortical surface. We further demonstrate the performance of this system for high-density neural recording, focal cortical stimulation, and accurate neural decoding. Such a system promises to accelerate efforts to better decode and encode neural signals, and to expand the patient population that could benefit from neural interface technology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient simulation of 3D reaction-diffusion in models of neurons and networks</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity is the result of both the electrophysiology and chemophysiology. A neuron can be well represented for the purposes of electrophysiological simulation as a tree composed of connected cylinders. This representation is also apt for 1D simulations of their chemophysiology, provided the spatial scale is larger than the diameter of the cylinders and there is radial symmetry. Higher dimensional simulation is necessary to accurately capture the dynamics when these criteria are not met, such as with wave curvature, spines, or diffusion near the soma.

We have developed a solution to enable efficient finite volume method simulation of reaction-diffusion kinetics in intracellular 3D regions in neuron and network models and provide an implementation within the NEURON simulator. An accelerated version of the CTNG 3D reconstruction algorithm transforms morphologies suitable for ion-channel based simulations into consistent 3D voxelized regions. Kinetics are then solved using a parallel algorithm based on Douglas-Gunn that handles the irregular 3D geometry of a neuron; these kinetics are coupled to NEURONs 1D mechanisms for ion channels, synapses, etc. The 3D domain may cover the entire cell or selected regions of interest. Simulations with dendritic spines and of the soma reveal details of dynamics that would be missed in a pure 1D simulation. We describe and validate the methods and discuss their performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Region-specific alterations of perineuronal net expression in postmortem autism brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variance in ASD is often associated with mechanisms that broadly fall into the category of neuroplasticity. Parvalbumin positive neurons and their surrounding perineuronal nets (PNNs) are important factors in critical period plasticity and have both been implicated in ASD. PNNs are found in high density within output structures of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, two regions that are densely connected to many other brain areas and have the potential to participate in the diverse array of symptoms present in an ASD diagnosis. The dentate nucleus and globus pallidus were therefore assessed for differences in PNN expression in human postmortem ASD brain tissue. While Purkinje cell loss is a consistent neuropathological finding in ASD, in this cohort, the Purkinje cell targets within the dentate nucleus did not show differences in number of cells with or without a PNN. However, the density of parvalbumin positive neurons with a PNN were significantly reduced in the globus pallidus internus and externus of ASD cases, which was not dependent on seizure status. It is unclear whether these alterations manifest during development or are a consequence of activity-dependent mechanisms that lead to altered network dynamics later in life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal cell-type and circuit basis for visual predictive processing</a></h4>

              
                Bayesian Brain theory suggests brain utilises predictive processing framework to interpret the noisy world. Predictive processing is essential to perception, action, cognition and psychiatric disease, but underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain undelineated. Here we show the neuronal cell-type and circuit basis for visual predictive processing in awake, head-fixed mice during self-initiated running. Preceding running, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing inhibitory interneurons (INs) in primary visual cortex (V1) are robustly activated in absence of structured visual stimuli. This pre-running activation is mediated via distal top-down projections from frontal, parietal and retrosplenial areas known for motion planning, but not local excitatory inputs associated with the bottom-up pathway. Somatostatin (SST) INs show pre-running suppression and post-running activation, indicating a VIP-SST motif. Differential VIP-SST peri-running dynamics anisotropically suppress neighbouring pyramidal (Pyr) neurons, preadapting Pyr neurons to the incoming running. Our data delineate key neuron types and circuit elements of predictive processing brain employs in action and perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in vivo pig model for testing novel PET radioligands targeting cerebral protein aggregates</a></h4>

              
                Positron emission tomography (PET) has become an essential clinical tool for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal accumulation of proteins like amyloid-{beta} or tau. Despite many attempts, it has not been possible to develop an appropriate radioligand for imaging aggregated -synuclein, which is seen in, e.g., Parkinson's Disease. Access to a large animal model with -synuclein pathology would critically enable a more translationally appropriate evaluation of novel radioligands. We here established a pig model with cerebral injections of -synuclein preformed fibrils or brain homogenate from postmortem human brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia with Lewy body (DLB) into the pig's brain using minimally invasive surgery and validated against saline injections. In the absence of a suitable -synuclein radioligand, we validated the model with an unselective amyloid-{beta} tracer [11C]PIB, which has a high affinity for {beta}-sheet structures in aggregates. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI confirmed that the blood-brain barrier function was intact. A few hours post-injection, pigs were PET scanned with [11C]PIB. Quantification was done with Logan invasive graphical analysis and simplified reference tissue model 2 using the occipital cortex as a reference region. After the scan, we retrieved the brains to confirm successful injection using autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. We found four times higher [11C]PIB uptake in AD-homogenate-injected regions and two times higher uptake in -synuclein-preformed-fibrils-injected regions compared to the saline-injected regions. The [11C]PIB uptake was the same in the occipital cortex, cerebellum, DLB-homogenate, and saline-injected regions. With its large brains and ability to undergo repeated PET scans as well as neurosurgical procedures, the pig provides a robust, cost-effective, and good translational model for assessment of novel radioligands including, but not limited to, proteinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-individual deep image reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                The sensory cortex is characterized by general organizational principles such as topography and hierarchy. However, measured brain activity given identical input exhibits substantially different patterns across individuals. While anatomical and functional alignment methods have been proposed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, it remains unclear whether and how hierarchical and fine-grained representations can be converted between individuals while preserving the encoded perceptual contents. In this study, we evaluated machine learning models called neural code converters that predict one's brain activity pattern (target) from another's (source) given the same stimulus by the decoding of hierarchical visual features and the reconstruction of perceived images. The training data for converters consisted of fMRI data obtained with identical sets of natural images presented to pairs of individuals. Converters were trained using the whole visual cortical voxels from V1 through the ventral object areas, without explicit labels of visual areas. We decoded the converted brain activity patterns into hierarchical visual features of a deep neural network (DNN) using decoders pre-trained on the target brain and then reconstructed images via the decoded features. Without explicit information about visual cortical hierarchy, the converters automatically learned the correspondence between the visual areas of the same levels. DNN feature decoding at each layer showed higher decoding accuracies from corresponding levels of visual areas, indicating that hierarchical representations were preserved after conversion. The viewed images were faithfully reconstructed with recognizable silhouettes of objects even with relatively small amounts of data for converter training. The conversion also allows pooling data across multiple individuals, leading to stably high reconstruction accuracy compared to those converted between individuals. These results demonstrate that the conversion learns hierarchical correspondence and preserves the fine-grained representations of visual features, enabling visual image reconstruction using decoders trained on other individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abnormal larval neuromuscular junction morphology and physiology in Drosophila Prickle isoform mutants with defective axonal transport and adult seizure behavior</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations of the Drosophila planar cell polarity gene prickle (pk) result in altered microtubule-mediated vesicular transport in larval motor axons, as well as adult neuronal circuit hyperexcitability and epileptic behavior. It is also known that mutant alleles of the prickle-prickle (pkpk) and prickle-spiny-legs (pksple) isoforms differ in phenotype but display isoform counterbalancing effects in heteroallelic pkpk/pksple flies to ameliorate adult motor circuit and behavioral hyperexcitability. We have further investigated the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and uncovered robust phenotypes in both pkpk and pksple alleles (heretofore referred to as pk and sple alleles, respectively), including synaptic terminal overgrowth, as well as irregular motor axon terminal excitability, poor vesicle release synchronicity, and altered efficacy of synaptic transmission. We observed significant increase in whole-cell excitatory junctional potential (EJP) in pk homozygotes, which was restored to near WT level in pk/sple heterozygotes. We further examined motor terminal excitability sustained by presynaptic Ca2+ channels, under the condition of pharmacological blockade of Na+ and K+ channel function. Such manipulation revealed extreme Ca2+ channel-dependent nerve terminal excitability in both pk and sple mutants. However, when combined in pk/sple heterozygotes, such terminal hyper-excitability was restored to nearly normal. Focal recording from individual synaptic boutons revealed asynchronous vesicle release in both pk and sple homozygotes, which nevertheless persisted in pk/sple heterozygotes without indications of isoform counter-balancing effects. Similarly, the overgrowth at NMJs was not compensated in pk/sple heterozygotes, exhibiting an extremity comparable to that in pk and sple homozygotes. Our observations uncovered differential roles of the pk and sple isoforms and their distinct interactions in the various structural and functional aspects of the larval NMJ and adult neural circuits.

                Hippocampal CA1 cells take part in reliable, time-locked activity sequences in tasks that involve an association between stimuli, in a manner that tiles the interval between the stimuli. Such cells have been termed time cells. Here we adopt a first-principles approach to comparing diverse analysis and detection algorithms for identifying time cells. We developed a resource for generating synthetic activity datasets using calcium signals recorded in vivo from mouse hippocampus using 2-photon imaging, for template response waveforms. We assigned known, ground truth values for properties of time cells in this synthetic dataset, including noise, timing imprecision, hit-trial ratio and calcium event width. These datasets were the input to a pipeline for testing multiple algorithms for time cell detection to determine the conditions for which they were best suited, and evaluate their effective operating ranges. We find that most algorithms are sensitive to noise. Only a few methods benefit from larger event widths. Reassuringly, most methods are insensitive to timing imprecision, and exhibit successful time cell detection even at low hit trial ratios. Importantly, all methods show good concordance in identifying cells as time cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced synaptic activity and dysregulated extracellular matrix pathways are common phenotypes in midbrain neurons derived from sporadic and mutation-associated Parkinson's disease patients</a></h4>

              
                Several mutations that cause Parkinson's disease (PD) have been identified over the past decade. These account for 15-25% of PD cases; the rest of the cases are considered sporadic. Currently, it is accepted that PD is not a single monolithic disease but rather a constellation of diseases with some common phenotypes. While rodent models exist for some of the PD-causing mutations, research on the sporadic forms of PD is lagging due to a lack of cellular models. In our study, we differentiated PD patient-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of several PD-causing mutations as well as from sporadic PD patients. Strikingly, we observed a common neurophysiological phenotype: Neurons derived from PD patients had a severe reduction in the rate of synaptic currents compared to those derived from healthy controls. While the relationship between mutations in genes such as the SNCA and LRRK2 and a reduction in synaptic transmission has been investigated before, here we show evidence that the pathogenesis of the synapses in neurons is a general phenotype in PD. Analysis of RNA sequencing results displayed changes in gene expression in different synaptic mechanisms as well as other affected pathways such as extracellular matrix-related pathways. Some of these dysregulated pathways are common to all PD patients (monogenic or idiopathic). Our data, therefore, shows pathways and mechanisms that are central and convergent to PD and suggests a strong involvement of the tetra-partite synapse in PD pathology.

                It is unclear why and how children learn more efficiently than adults, although inhibitory systems, which play an important role in stabilizing learning, are immature in children. Here, we found that despite a lower baseline concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in early visual cortical areas in children (8 to 11 years old) than adults (18 to 35 years old), children exhibited a rapid boost of GABA immediately after visual training, whereas the concentration of GABA in adults remained unchanged after training. Moreover, behavioral experiments showed that children stabilized visual learning much faster than adults, showing rapid development of resilience to retrograde interference. These results together suggest that inhibitory systems in children's brains are more dynamic and adapt more quickly to stabilize learning than in adults.

                The tubulin protein fulfills a variety of cellular functions that range from chromosomal separation to locomotion. The functional diversity of tubulin is achieved through the expression of specific tubulin isotypes in different cell types or developmental time periods. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of tubulin also are vital for specific intracellular tasks, such as binding and recruiting motor proteins. In neurons, the isotypic expression profile for tubulin is well characterized, and the importance of PTMs for proper neuronal function has gained recent attention due to their implication in neurodegenerative disorders. In contrast, the role of tubulin specializations in the specification of neural cell fate has received minimal attention and studies of tubulin PTMs and isotypes in neuroglia such as astrocytes are relatively few. To bridge this knowledge gap, we undertook an analysis of PTMs in neurons and astrocytes derived from the federally approved H9 hESC-derived human neural stem cell (hNSC) line. In hNSCs, basal cells can be directed to assume neural fate as neurons or astrocytes by specifying different media growth conditions. Immunocytochemical methods, fluorescent antibody probes, and confocal microscopy facilitated image acquisition of fluorescent signals from class III {beta}- tubulin ({beta}III-tubulin), acetylated tubulin, and polyglutamylated tubulin. Fluorescent probe intensities were assessed with the EBImage package for the statistical programming language R and compared using Student's t-tests. Qualitative analysis indicated that {beta}III-tubulin, acetylated tubulin, and polyglutamylated tubulin were expressed to some degree in basal hNSCs and their media-differentiated hNSC neuronal and astroglial progeny. In media-differentiated hNSC astrocyte progeny, quantification and statistical analysis of fluorescence probe intensity showed that acetylated tubulin/ {beta}III-tubulin ratios were greater than the ratio for polyglutamylated tubulin/ {beta}III-tubulin. These findings represent a snapshot of the dynamic and varied changes tubulin expression profile during the specification of neural cell fate. Results imply that investigations of tubulin PTMs have the potential to advance our understanding of the generation and regeneration of nervous tissue.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maturation of prefrontal input to dorsal raphe increases behavioral persistence in mice</a></h4>

              
                The ability to persist towards a desired objective is a fundamental aspect of behavioral control whose impairment is implicated in several behavioral disorders. One of the prominent features of behavioral persistence is that its maturation occurs relatively late in development. This is presumed to echo the developmental time course of a corresponding circuit within late-maturing parts of the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex, but the specific identity of the responsible circuits is unknown. Here, we describe the maturation of the projection from layer 5 neurons of the prefrontal cortex to the dorsal raphe nucleus in mice. We show using pathway-specific optogenetic stimulation that this connection undergoes a dramatic increase in synaptic potency between postnatal weeks 3 and 8, corresponding to the transition from juvenile to adult. We then show that this period corresponds to an increase in the behavioral persistence that mice exhibit in a foraging task. Finally, we use genetic targeting to selectively ablate this pathway in adulthood and show that mice revert to a behavioral phenotype similar to juveniles. These results suggest that the prefrontal to dorsal raphe pathway is a critical anatomical and functional substrate of the development and manifestation of behavioral control.

While the drift of these representations is mostly characterized in relation to external stimuli or tasks, behavioural or internal state of the animal is also known to modulate the neural activity. We therefore asked how the variability of such modulatory mechanisms can contribute to representational drift. By analysing publicly available datasets from the Allen Brain Observatory, we found that behavioural variability significantly contributes to changes in stimulus-induced neuronal responses across various cortical areas in the mouse. This effect could not be explained by a gain model in which change in the behavioural state scaled the signal or the noise. A better explanation was provided by a model in which behaviour contributed independently to neuronal tuning. Our results are consistent with a view in which behaviour modulates the low-dimensional, slowly-changing setpoints of neurons, upon which faster operations like sensory processing are performed. Importantly, our analysis suggests that reliable but variable behavioural signals might be misinterpreted as representational drift, if neuronal representations are only characterized in the stimulus space and marginalised over behavioural parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiplex labeling and manipulation of endogenous neuronal proteins using sequential CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in methods enable labeling of individual endogenous proteins with fluorophores, to determine their spatiotemporal expression in intact biological preparations. However, multiplex knock-in methods remain limited, particularly in postmitotic cells, due to a high degree of crosstalk between genome editing events. We present Conditional Activation of Knock-in Expression (CAKE), which delivers efficient, flexible and accurate multiplex genome editing in neurons. CAKE is based on sequential gRNA expression operated by a Cre- or Flp-recombinase to control the time window for genomic integration of each donor sequence, which diminishes crosstalk between genome editing events. Importantly, CAKE is compatible with multiple CRISPR/Cas9 strategies, and we show the utilization of CAKE for co-localization of various endogenous proteins, including synaptic scaffolds, ion channels and neurotransmitter receptor subunits. Knock-in efficacy was highly sensitive to DNA vector amount, while knock-in crosstalk was dependent on the rate of donor DNA integration and timing of Cre activation. We applied CAKE to study the co-distribution of endogenous synaptic proteins using dual-color single-molecule localization microscopy, and we introduced dimerization modules to acutely control synaptic receptor dynamics in living neurons. Taken together, CAKE is a versatile method for multiplex protein labeling, enabling accurate detection, precise localization and acute manipulation of endogenous proteins in single cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Testing the state-dependent model of time perception against experimental evidence</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated movements, speech and other actions are impossible without precise timing. Realistic computational models of interval timing in the mammalian brain are expected to provide key insights into the underlying mechanisms of timing. Existing computational models of time perception have only been partially replicating experimental observations, such as the linear increase of time, the dopaminergic modulation of this increase, and the scalar property, i.e., the linear increase of the standard deviation of temporal estimates. In this work, we incorporate the state-dependent computational model, which encodes time in the dynamic evolution of network states without the need for a specific network structure into a biologically plausible prefrontal cortex (PFC) model based on in vivo and in vitro recordings of rodents. Specifically, we stimulated 1000 neurons in the beginning and in the end of a range of different time intervals, extracted states of neurons and trained the readout layer based on these states using least squares to predict the respective inter stimulus interval. We show that the naturally occurring heterogeneity in cellular and synaptic parameters in the PFC is sufficient to encode time over several hundreds of milliseconds. The readout faithfully represents the duration between two stimuli applied to the superficial layers of the network, thus fulfilling the requirement of a linear encoding of time. A simulated activation of the D2 dopamine receptor leads to an overestimation and an inactivation to an underestimation of time, in line with experimental results. Furthermore, we show that the scalar property holds true for intervals of several hundred milliseconds, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the origin of the scalar property as well as its deviations. We conclude that this model can represent durations up to 750 ms in a biophysically plausible setting, compatible with experimental findings in this regime.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expectation violations produce error signals in mouse V1</a></h4>

              
                Repeated exposure to visual sequences changes the form of evoked activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). Predictive coding theory provides a potential explanation for this, namely that plasticity shapes cortical circuits to encode spatiotemporal predictions and that subsequent responses are modulated by the degree to which actual inputs match these expectations. Here we use a recently developed statistical modeling technique called Model-Based Targeted Dimensionality Reduction (MbTDR) to study visually-evoked dynamics in mouse V1 in context of a previously described experimental paradigm called "sequence learning". We report that evoked spiking activity changed significantly with training, in a manner generally consistent with the predictive coding framework. Neural responses to expected stimuli were suppressed in a late window (100-150ms) after stimulus onset following training, while responses to novel stimuli were not. Omitting predictable stimuli led to increased firing at the expected time of stimulus onset, but only in trained mice. Substituting a novel stimulus for a familiar one led to changes in firing that persisted for at least 300ms. In addition, we show that spiking data can be used to accurately decode time within the sequence. Our findings are consistent with the idea that plasticity in early visual circuits is involved in coding spatiotemporal information.

                Fear regulation changes as a function of age and adolescence is a key developmental period for the continued maturation of fear neural circuitry. The involvement of prelimbic proBDNF in fear memory extinction and its mediated signaling were reported previously. Given the inherent high level of proBDNF during juvenile period, we tested whether prelimbic proBDNF regulated synaptic and neuronal functions allowing to influencing retrieval-dependent memory processing. By examining freezing behavior of auditory fear conditioned rats, we found high levels of prelimbic proBDNF in juvenile rats enhanced destabilization of the retrieval-dependent weak but not strong fear memory through activating p75NTR-GluN2B signaling. This modification was attributed to the increment in proportion of thin type spine and promotion in synaptic function, as evidence by facilitation of NMDA-mediated EPSCs and GluN2B-dependent synaptic depression. The strong prelimbic theta- and gamma-oscillation coupling predicted the suppressive effect of proBDNF on the recall of post-retrieval memory. Our results critically emphasize the importance of developmental proBDNF for modification of retrieval-dependent memory and provide a potential critical targeting to inhibit threaten memories associated with neurodevelopment disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast parametric curve matching (FPCM) for automatic spike detection</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a widely spread neurological disease, whose treatment often requires resection of the pathological cortical tissue. Interictal spike analysis observed in the non-invasively collected EEG or MEG data offers an attractive way to localize epileptogenic cortical structures for surgery planning purposes. Interictal spike detection in lengthy multichannel data is a daunting task that is still often performed manually. This frequently limits such an analysis to a small portion of the data which renders the appropriate risks of missing the potentially epileptogenic region. While a plethora of automatic spike detection techniques have been developed each with its own assumptions and limitations, non of them is ideal and the best results are achieved when the output of several automatic spike detectors are combined. This is especially true in the low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To this end we propose a novel biomimetic approach for automatic spike detection based on a constrained mixed spline machinery that we dub as fast parametric curve matching (FPCM). Using the peak-wave shape parametrization, the constrained parametric morphological model is constructed and convolved with the observed multichannel data to very efficiently determine mixed spline parameters corresponding to each time-point in the dataset. Then the logical predicates that directly map to verbalized text-book like descriptions of the expected interictal event morphology allow us to accomplish the spike detection task. The results of simulations mimicking typical low SNR scenario show the robustness and high ROC AUC values of the FPCM method as compared to the spike detection performed by the means of more conventional approaches such as wavelet decomposition, template matching or simple amplitude thresholding. Applied to the real MEG and EEG data from the human patients and to ECoG data from the rat, the FPCM technique demonstrates reliable detection of the interictal events and localization of epileptogenic zones concordant with independent conclusions made by the epileptologist. Since the FPCM is computationally light, tolerant to high amplitude artifacts and flexible to accommodate verbalized descriptions of the arbitrary target morphology, it may complement the existing arsenal of means for analysis of noisy interictal datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta- and gamma-band oscillatory uncoupling in the macaque hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Nested hippocampal oscillations in the rodent gives rise to temporal coding that may underlie learning, memory, and decision making. Theta/gamma coupling in rodent CA1 occurs during exploration and sharp-wave ripples during quiescence. Whether these oscillatory regimes extend to primates is less clear. We therefore sought to identify correspondences in frequency bands, nesting, and behavioral coupling taken from macaque hippocampus. We found that, in contrast to the rodent, theta and gamma frequency bands in macaque CA1 were segregated by behavioral states. Beta/gamma (15-70Hz) had greater power during visual search while theta (7-10 Hz) dominated during quiescence. Moreover, delta/theta (3-8 Hz) amplitude was strongest when beta2/slow gamma (20-35 Hz) amplitude was weakest, though the low frequencies coupled with higher, ripple frequencies (60-150 Hz). The distribution of spike-field coherence revealed three peaks matching the 3-10 Hz, 20-30 Hz and 60-150 Hz bands; however, the low frequency effects were primarily due to sharp-wave ripples. Accordingly, no intrinsic theta spiking rhythmicity was apparent. These results support a role for beta2/slow gamma modulation in CA1 during active exploration in the primate that is decoupled from theta oscillations. These findings diverge from the rodent oscillatory canon and call for a shift in focus and frequency when considering the primate hippocampus.

                Structural connectivity of the brain at different ages is analyzed using diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The largest decrease of the number and average length of stream- lines is found for the long inter-hemispheric links, with the strongest impact for frontal regions. From the BOLD functional MRI (fMRI) time series we identify age-related changes of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) and spatial covariation features of the FC links captured by meta- connectivity (MC). They indicate more constant dFC, but wider range and variance of MC. Finally we applied computational whole-brain network model based on oscillators, which mechanistically expresses the impact of the spatio-temporal structure of the brain (weights and the delays) to the dynamics. With this we tested several hypothesis, which revealed that the spatio-temporal reorga- nization of the brain with ageing, supports the observed functional fingerprints only if the model accounts for: (i) compensation of the individual brains for the overall loss of structural connectivity, and (ii) decrease of propagation velocity due to the loss of myelination. We also show that having these two conditions, it is sufficient to decompose the time-delays as bimodal distribution that only distinguishes between intra- and inter-hemispheric delays, and that the same working point also captures the static FC the best.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Patterns of Arc mRNA expression in the rat brain following dual recall of fear- and reward-based socially acquired information</a></h4>

              
                The ability to learn new information and behaviors is a vital component of survival in most animal species. This learning can occur via direct experience or through observation of another individual (i.e., social learning). While research focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of direct learning is prevalent, less work has aimed at understanding the brain circuitry mediating the acquisition and recall of socially acquired information. We aimed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying recall of socially acquired information by having rats sequentially recall a socially transmitted food preference (STFP) and a fear association via fear conditioning by-proxy (FCbP). Brain tissue was processed for mRNA expression of the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc, which reliably expresses in the cell nucleus following transcription before migrating to the cytoplasm over the next 25 minutes. Given this timeframe, we were able to identify whether Arc transcription was triggered by STFP recall, FCbP recall, or following recall of both memories. Surprisingly - and contrary to past research examining expression of other IEGs following STFP or FCbP recall separately - we found no differences in any of the Arc expression measures across a number of prefrontal regions and the vCA3 of the hippocampus between controls, demonstrators, and observers, though we did detect an overall effect of sex in a number of regions. We theorize that these results may indicate that relatively little Arc-dependent neural restructuring is taking place in the prefrontal cortices following recall of a recently socially acquired information or directly acquired fear associations in these areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxytocin modulates social brain network correlations in resting and task state</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide that modulates social behaviors and the social brain. The effects of OT on the social brain can be tracked by assessing the neural activity in the resting and task states, providing a system-level framework for characterizing state-based functional relationships of its distinct effect. Here, we contribute to this framework by examining how OT modulates social brain network correlations during the resting and task states using fMRI. Firstly, we investigated network activation, followed by analyzing the relationship between networks and individual differences measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the Big-Five scales. Subsequently, we evaluated functional connectivity in both states. Finally, the relationship between networks across the states was represented by the predictive power of networks in the resting state for task-evoked activity. The difference in predicted accuracy between subjects displayed individual variations in this relationship. Our results showed decreased dorsal default mode network (DDMN) for OT group in the resting state. Additionally, only in the OT group, the activity of the DDMN in the resting state had the largest predictive power for task-evoked activation of the precuneus network (PN). The results also demonstrated OT reduced individual variation of PN, specifically, the difference of accuracy between predicting a subject's own and others' PN task activation. These findings suggest a distributed but modulatory effect of OT on the association between resting brain networks and task-dependent brain networks, showing increased DDMN to PN connectivity after OT administration, which may support OT-induced distributed processing during task performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A systematic characterization of intrinsically formed microglia-like cells during retinal organoid differentiation.</a></h4>

              
                Brain organoids differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells provide a unique opportunity to investigate the development, organization and connectivity of neurons in a complex cellular environment. However, organoids usually lack microglia, brain-resident immune cells which are both present in the early human embryonic brain and participate in neuronal circuit development. Here, we find that microglia innately develop in unguided retinal organoid differentiation between week 3 and 4 in 2.5D culture and appear later in floating, non-pigmented, 3D-cystic compartments. We enriched for cystic structures using a low-dosed BMP4 application and performed mass spectrometry, thus defining the protein composition of microglia-containing compartments. We found that cystic compartments expressed both mesenchymal and epithelial markers with microglia enriched in the mesenchymal region. Interestingly, microglia-like cells started to express the border-associated macrophage marker CD163. The preferential localization of human microglia to a mesenchymal compartment provides insight into the behavior and migration of microglia. The model will ultimately allow detailed study of these enigmatic cells and how they enter and distribute within the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">V1 receptive field structure contributes to neuronal response latency</a></h4>

              
                The timing of neuronal responses is considered to be important for information transferring and communication across individual neurons. However, the sources of variabilities in the timing of neuronal responses are not well understood and sometimes over-interpreted. A systematic variability in the response latencies of the primary visual cortex has been reported in presence of drifting grating stimulus. Whereas the response latencies are systematically dependent on stimulus orientation. To understand the underlying mechanism of these systematic latencies, we recorded the neuronal response of the cat visual cortex, area 17, and simulated the response latency of V1 neurons, with two geometric models. We showed that outputs of these two models significantly predict the response latencies of the electrophysiology recording during orientation tasks. The periodic patterns created in the raster plots were dependent on the relative position of the stimulus rotation center and the receptive-field sub-regions. We argue the position of stimulus is contributing to systematic response latencies, dependent on drifting orientation. Therefore, we provide a toolbox based on our geometrical model for determining the exact location of RF sub-regions. Our result indicates that a major source of neuronal variability is the lack of fine-tuning in the task parameters. Considering the simplicity of the orientation selectivity task, we argue fine-tuning of stimulus properties is crucial for deduction of neural variability in higher-order cortical areas and understanding their neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired endogenous neurosteroid signaling contributes to behavioral deficits associated with chronic stress</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress is a major risk factor for psychiatric illnesses, including depression; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby stress leads to mood disorders remain unclear. The recent FDA approval of antidepressants with novel mechanisms of action, like Zulresso(R), a synthetic neuroactive steroid analog with molecular pharmacology similar to allopregnanolone, has spurred interest in new therapeutic targets and, potentially, novel pathophysiological mechanisms for depression. Allopregnanolone acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (GABAARs), acting preferentially at {delta} subunit-containing receptors ({delta}-GABAARs). Accumulating clinical and preclinical evidence supports the antidepressant effects of exogenous administration of allopregnanolone and allopregnanolone analogs; however, the role of endogenous neurosteroids in the pathophysiology of depression remains unknown. Here, we examine whether altered neurosteroid signaling may contribute to behavioral deficits following chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in mice. We first identified reductions in expression of {delta}-GABAARs, the predominant site of action of 5a-reduced neuroactive steroids, following CUS. Additionally, utilizing LC-MS/MS we discovered a decrease in levels of allopregnanolone in the BLA, but not plasma of mice following CUS, an indication of impaired neurosteroid synthesis. CRISPR knockdown the rate-limiting enzymes involved in allopregnanolone synthesis, 5-reductase type 1 and 2, in the BLA mimicked the behavioral deficits associated with CUS in mice. Furthermore, overexpression expression of 5-reductase type 1 and 2 in the BLA improved behavioral outcomes. Collectively, this suggests chronic stress impairs endogenous neurosteroid signaling in the BLA which is sufficient to induce behavioral deficits similar to those observed following CUS. Further, these studies suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of allopregnanolone-based treatments may be due to their ability to directly target the underlying pathophysiology of mood disorders. Therefore, targeting endogenous neurosteroidogenesis may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of mood disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The synaptic organization in the  C. elegans neural network suggests significant local compartmentalized computations</a></h4>

              
                Neurons are characterized by elaborate tree-like dendritic structures that support local computations by integrating multiple inputs from upstream presynaptic neurons. It is less clear if simple neurons, consisting of a few or even a single neurite, may perform local computations as well. To address this question, we focused on the compact neural network of C. elegans animals for which the full wiring diagram is available, including the coordinates of individual synapses. We find that the positions of the chemical synapses along the neurites are not randomly distributed, nor can they be explained by anatomical constraints. Instead, synapses tend to form clusters, an organization that supports local compartmentalized computations. In mutually-synapsing neurons, connections of opposite polarity cluster separately, suggesting that positive and negative feedback dynamics may be implemented in discrete compartmentalized regions along neurites. In triple-neuron circuits, the non-random synaptic organization may facilitate local functional roles, such as signal integration and coordinated activation of functionally-related downstream neurons. These clustered synaptic topologies emerge as a guiding principle in the network presumably to facilitate distinct parallel functions along a single neurite, effectively increasing the computational capacity of the neural network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors modulate HCN channel properties in vestibular ganglion neurons</a></h4>

              
                Vestibular efferent neurons play an important role in shaping vestibular afferent excitability and accordingly, on the information encoded by their spike patterns. Efferent-modulation is linked to muscarinic signaling cascades that affect ion channel conductances, most notably low-voltage gated potassium channels such as KCNQ. Here we tested and found that muscarinic signaling cascades also modulate hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide gated channels (HCN). HCN channels play a key role in controlling spike-timing regularity and a non-chemical form of transmission between type I hair cells and vestibular afferents. The impact of cholinergic efferent input on HCN channels was assessed using voltage-clamp methods, which measure currents in the disassociated cell bodies of vestibular ganglion neurons (VGN). Membrane properties in VGN were characterized before and after administration of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist Oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M). We found that Oxo-M shifted the voltage-activation range of HCN channels in the positive direction by 4.1 +/- 1.1 mV, which more than doubled the available current when held near rest at -60 mV (a 184 +/- 90.1% increase, n=19). This effect was not blocked by pre-treating the cells with a KCNQ channel blocker, linopirdine, which suggests that this effect is not dependent on KCNQ currents. We also found that HCN channel properties in the baseline condition and sensitivity to mAChR activation depended on cell size and firing patterns. Large-bodied neurons with onset firing patterns had the most depolarized activation range and least sensitivity to mAChR activation. Together, our results highlight the complex and dynamic regulation of HCN channels in VGN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">INFLUENCE OF RAT CENTRAL THALAMIC NEURONS ON FORAGING BEHAVIOR IN A HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BL) is a major regulator of foraging behavior. Following BL inactivation, rats become indifferent to predators. However, at odds with the view that the amygdala detects threats and generate defensive behaviors, most BL neurons have reduced firing rates during foraging and at proximity of the predator. In search of the signals determining this unexpected activity pattern, this study considered the contribution of the central medial thalamic nucleus (CMT), which sends a strong projection to BL, mostly targeting its principal neurons. Inactivation of CMT or BL with muscimol abolished the rats normally cautious behavior in the foraging task. Moreover, unit recordings revealed that CMT neurons showed large but heterogeneous activity changes during the foraging task, with many neurons decreasing or increasing their discharge rates, with a modest bias for the latter. A generalized linear model revealed that CMT neurons encode many of the same task variables as principal BL cells. However, the nature (inhibitory vs. excitatory) and relative magnitude of the activity modulations seen in CMT neurons differed markedly from those of principal BL cells but were very similar to those of fast-spiking BL interneurons. Together, these findings suggest that, during the foraging task, CMT inputs fire some principal BL neurons, recruiting feedback interneurons in BL, resulting in the widespread inhibition of principal BL cells.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease in which upper and lower motor neuron loss is the primary phenotype, leading to muscle weakness and wasting, respiratory failure, and death. Although a portion of ALS cases are linked to one of over 50 unique genes, the vast majority of cases are sporadic in nature. However, the mechanisms underlying the motor neuron loss in either familial or sporadic ALS are not entirely clear. Here we used induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a set of identical twin brothers discordant for ALS to assess the role of astrocytes and microglia on the expression and accumulation of neurofilament proteins in motor neurons. We found that motor neurons derived from the affected twin exhibited increased transcript levels of all three neurofilament isoforms and increased expression of phosphorylated neurofilament puncta. We further found that treatment of the motor neurons with astrocyte conditioned medium and microglial conditioned medium significantly impacted neurofilament deposition. Together, these data suggest that glial-secreted factors can alter neurofilament pathology in ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A common human brain-derived neurotrophic factor polymorphism leads to sustained depression of excitatory synaptic transmission by isoflurane in hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Multiple presynaptic and postsynaptic targets have been identified for the reversible neurophysiological effects of general anesthetics on synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. However, the synaptic mechanisms involved in persistent depression of synaptic transmission resulting in more prolonged neurological dysfunction following anesthesia are less clear. Here, we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor implicated in synaptic plasticity and dysfunction, enhances glutamate synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and that attenuation of vesicular BDNF release by isoflurane contributes to transient depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in mice. This reduction in synaptic vesicle exocytosis was irreversible in neurons that release less endogenous BDNF due to a polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) compared to wild-type mouse hippocampal neurons following isoflurane exposure. These effects were prevented by exogenous application of BDNF. Our findings identify a role for a common human BDNF single nucleotide polymorphism (Val66Met; rs6265) in persistent changes of synaptic function following isoflurane exposure. These persistent alterations in excitatory synaptic transmission have important implications for the role of genotype in anesthetic effects on synaptic plasticity and neurocognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Superficial white matter microstructure affects processing speed in cerebral small vessel disease</a></h4>

              
                White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a typical feature of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). This condition contributes to about 50% of dementias worldwide, a massive health burden in aging. Microstructural alterations in the deep white matter (DWM) have been widely examined in CSVD. However, little is known about abnormalities in the superficial white matter (SWM) and their relevance for processing speed, the main cognitive deficit in CSVD. In this paper, 141 patients with CSVD were studied. Processing speed was assessed by the completion time of the Trail Making Test Part A. White matter abnormalities were assessed by WMH burden (lesion volume on T2-FLAIR) and diffusion MRI, including DTI and free-water (FW) imaging microstructure measures. The results of our study indicate that the superficial white matter may play a particularly important role in cognitive decline in CSVD. SWM imaging measures resulted in a large contribution to processing speed, despite a relatively small WMH burden in the SWM. SWM FW had the strongest association with processing speed among all imaging markers and, unlike the other diffusion MRI measures, significantly increased between two patient subgroups with the lowest WMH burdens (possibly representing early stages of disease). When comparing two patient subgroups with the highest WMH burdens, the involvement of WMH in the SWM was accompanied by significant differences in processing speed and white matter microstructure. Given significant effects of WMH volume and regional FW on processing speed, we performed a mediation analysis. SWM FW was found to fully mediate the association between WMH volume and processing speed, while no mediation effect of DWM FW was observed. Overall, our findings identify SWM abnormalities in CSVD and suggest that the SWM has an important contribution to processing speed. Results indicate that FW in the SWM is a sensitive marker of microstructural changes associated with cognition in CSVD. This study extends the current understanding of CSVD-related dysfunction and suggests that the SWM, as an understudied region, can be a potential target for monitoring pathophysiological processes in future research.

                To identify conserved components of synapse function that are also associated with human diseases, we conducted a genetic screen. We used the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model. We employed RNA interference (RNAi) on selected targets and assayed synapse function by electrophysiology. We focused our screen on genetic factors known to be conserved from human neurological or muscle functions (321 total RNAi lines screened). Knockdown of a particular Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunit gene (ND-20L) lowered levels of NMJ neurotransmission. Due to the severity of the phenotype, we studied MCI function further. Knockdown of core MCI subunits concurrently in neurons and muscle led to impaired neurotransmission. Further, pharmacology targeting MCI phenocopied the impaired neurotransmission phenotype. Finally, MCI subunit knockdowns led to profound cytological defects, including reduced NMJ growth and altered NMJ morphology. Mitochondria are essential for cellular bioenergetics and produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Five multi-protein complexes achieve this task, and MCI is the largest. Impaired Mitochondrial Complex I subunits in humans are associated with disorders such as Parkinsons disease, Leigh syndrome, and cardiomyopathy. Together, our data present an analysis of Complex I in the context of synapse function and plasticity. We speculate that in the context of human MCI dysfunction, similar neuronal and synaptic defects could contribute to pathogenesis.

Fish and amphibians are useful models for investigating ototoxicity because their inner ear hair cells, like those of mammals, are susceptible to damage by ototoxins. Moreover, amphibian mechanosensation is augmented by a lateral line organ on the body surface that comprises external mechanosensory hair cells. The lateral line hair cells are arranged in clusters (neuromasts) and are structurally and functionally similar to inner ear hair cells, but are more accessible for experimental manipulation. Herein, we implemented neuromasts of the amphibian (Xenopus) lateral line as an organ system for evaluating the effects of ototoxic chemicals, such as antibiotics, on mechanosensory hair cell bundles. Methods: We examined the ultrastructure of larval Xenopus laevis neuromasts with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after larvae were continuously exposed to ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotics at sub-lethal concentrations (gentamicin; streptomycin; neomycin) for 72 hours. Results: SEM images demonstrated that 72 hours of exposure to antibiotic concentrations greater than 25 M reduced the hair cell bundle number in lateral line neuromasts. Conclusion: Therapeutic drug studies will benefit from the incorporation of bioassay strategies that evaluate ototoxicity across multiple species including genera of amphibian origin such as Xenopus. Our outcomes support the use of the Xenopus lateral line for identification of potential ototoxic chemicals and suggest that Xenopus neuromast hair cell bundles can withstand antibiotic exposure. The Xenopus bioassay presented here can be incorporated into drug discovery methodology as a high-resolution phenotypic screen for ototoxic effects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Decision prioritization and causal reasoning in decision hierarchies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ariel Zylberberg</p>

From cooking a meal to finding a route to a destination, many real life decisions can be decomposed into a hierarchy of sub-decisions. In a hierarchy, choosing which decision to think about requires planning over a potentially vast space of possible decision sequences. To gain insight into how people decide what to decide on, we studied a novel task that combines perceptual decision making, active sensing and hierarchical and counterfactual reasoning. Human participants had to find a target hidden at the lowest level of a decision tree. They could solicit information from the different nodes of the decision tree to gather noisy evidence about the target’s location. Feedback was given only after errors at the leaf nodes and provided ambiguous evidence about the cause of the error. Despite the complexity of task (with 10<sup>7</sup> latent states) participants were able to plan efficiently in the task. A computational model of this process identified a small number of heuristics of low computational complexity that accounted for human behavior. These heuristics include making categorical decisions at the branching points of the decision tree rather than carrying forward entire probability distributions, discarding sensory evidence deemed unreliable to make a choice, and using choice confidence to infer the cause of the error after an initial plan failed. Plans based on probabilistic inference or myopic sampling norms could not capture participants’ behavior. Our results show that it is possible to identify hallmarks of heuristic planning with sensing in human behavior and that the use of tasks of intermediate complexity helps identify the rules underlying human ability to reason over decision hierarchies.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adropin is a secreted peptide, which is composed of 43 amino acids and shows an effective role in regulating energy metabolism and insulin resistance. Motor coordination and locomotor activity were improved by adropin in the cerebellum. However, it is not known whether adropin administration has an effect on spatial learning and memory. In this study, we investigated the effect of adropin on spatial learning and memory and characterized the biochemical properties of adropin in the hippocampus. Thirty male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups as control and adropin groups. The control group received 0.9% NaCl intracerebroventricular for 6 days, while the adropin groups received 1 nmol of adropin dissolved in 0.9% NaCl (for 6 days). The Morris water maze, Y maze, and object location recognition tests were performed to evaluate learning and memory. Also, the locomotor activity tests were measured to assess the motor function. The expression of Akt, phospho-Akt, CREB, phospho-CREB, Erk1/2, phospho-Erk1/2, glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), phospho-GSK3β, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit were determined in the hippocampal tissues by using western blot. Behavior tests showed that adropin significantly increase spatial memory performance. Meanwhile, the western blot analyses revealed that the phosphorylated form of the Akt and CREB were enhanced with adropin administration in the hippocampus. Also, the expression of BDNF showed an enhancement in adropin group in comparison to the control group. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that adropin exerts its enhancing effect on spatial memory capacity through Akt/CREB/BDNF signaling pathways.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Generation and diversification of recombinant monoclonal antibodies</a></h4>

              
                Antibodies are indispensable tools used for a large number of applications in both foundational and translational bioscience research; however, there are drawbacks to using traditional antibodies generated in animals. These include a lack of standardization leading to problems with reproducibility, high costs of antibodies purchased from commercial sources, and ethical concerns regarding the large number of animals used to generate antibodies. To address these issues, we have developed practical methodologies and tools for generating low-cost, high-yield preparations of recombinant monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments directed to protein epitopes from primary sequences. We describe these methods here, as well as approaches to diversify monoclonal antibodies, including customization of antibody species specificity, generation of genetically encoded small antibody fragments, and conversion of single chain antibody fragments (<i>e.g.</i> scFv) into full-length, bivalent antibodies. This study focuses on antibodies directed to epitopes important for mitosis and kinetochore function; however, the methods and reagents described here are applicable to antibodies and antibody fragments for use in any field.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Superior colliculus drives stimulus-evoked directionally biased saccades and attempted head movements in head-fixed mice</a></h4>

              
                Animals investigate their environments by directing their gaze towards salient stimuli. In the prevailing view, mouse gaze shifts entail head rotations followed by brainstem-mediated eye movements, including saccades to reset the eyes. These 'recentering' saccades are attributed to head movement-related vestibular cues. However, microstimulating mouse superior colliculus (SC) elicits directed head and eye movements resembling SC-dependent sensory-guided gaze shifts in other species, suggesting that mouse gaze shifts may be more flexible than has been recognized. We investigated this possibility by tracking eye and attempted head movements in a head-fixed preparation that eliminates head movement-related sensory cues. We found tactile stimuli evoke directionally biased saccades coincident with attempted head rotations. Differences in saccade endpoints across stimuli are associated with distinct stimulus-dependent relationships between initial eye position and saccade direction and amplitude. Optogenetic perturbations revealed SC drives these gaze shifts. Thus, head-fixed mice make sensory-guided, SC-dependent gaze shifts involving coincident, directionally biased saccades and attempted head movements. Our findings uncover flexibility in mouse gaze shifts and provide a foundation for studying head-eye coupling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A theory of synaptic transmission</a></h4>

              
                Rapid and precise neuronal communication is enabled through a highly synchronous release of signaling molecules neurotransmitters within just milliseconds of the action potential. Yet neurotransmitter release lacks a theoretical framework that is both phenomenologically accurate and mechanistically realistic. Here, we present an analytic theory of the action-potential-triggered neurotransmitter release at the chemical synapse. The theory is demonstrated to be in detailed quantitative agreement with existing data on a wide variety of synapses from electrophysiological recordings in vivo and fluorescence experiments in vitro. Despite up to ten orders of magnitude of variation in the release rates among the synapses, the theory reveals that synaptic transmission obeys a simple, universal scaling law, which we confirm through a collapse of the data from strikingly diverse synapses onto a single master curve. This universality is complemented by the ability of the theory to readily extract, through a fit to the data, the kinetic and energetic parameters that uniquely identify each synapse. The theory provides a means to detect cooperativity among the SNARE complexes that mediate vesicle fusion and reveals such cooperativity in several existing data sets. The theory is further applied to establish connections between molecular constituents of synapses and synaptic function. The theory allows competing hypotheses of short-term plasticity to be tested and identifies the regimes where particular mechanisms of synaptic facilitation dominate or, conversely, fail to account for the existing data for the paired-pulse ratio. The derived trade-off relation between the transmission rate and fidelity shows how transmission failure can be controlled by changing the microscopic properties of the vesicle pool and SNARE complexes. The established condition for the maximal synaptic efficacy reveals that no fine tuning is needed for certain synapses to maintain near-optimal transmission. We discuss the limitations of the theory and propose possible routes to extend it. These results provide a quantitative basis for the notion that the molecular-level properties of synapses are crucial determinants of the computational and information-processing functions in synaptic transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Defining the interactome of the human mitochondrial ribosome identifies SMIM4 and TMEM223 as respiratory chain assembly factors</a></h4>

              
                Human mitochondria express a genome that encodes thirteen core subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). These proteins insert into the inner membrane co-translationally. Therefore, mitochondrial ribosomes engage with the OXA1L-insertase and membrane-associated proteins, which support membrane insertion of translation products and early assembly steps into OXPHOS complexes. To identify ribosome-associated biogenesis factors for the OXPHOS system, we purified ribosomes and associated proteins from mitochondria. We identified TMEM223 as a ribosome-associated protein involved in complex IV biogenesis. TMEM223 stimulates the translation of COX1 mRNA and is a constituent of early COX1 assembly intermediates. Moreover, we show that SMIM4 together with C12ORF73 interacts with newly synthesized cytochrome <i>b</i> to support initial steps of complex III biogenesis in complex with UQCC1 and UQCC2. Our analyses define the interactome of the human mitochondrial ribosome and reveal novel assembly factors for complex III and IV biogenesis that link early assembly stages to the translation machinery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SSNA1 stabilizes dynamic microtubules and detects microtubule damage</a></h4>

              
                Sjögren's Syndrome Nuclear Autoantigen 1 (SSNA1/NA14) is a microtubule-associated protein with important functions in cilia, dividing cells and developing neurons. However, the direct effects of SSNA1 on microtubules are not known. We employed <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution with purified proteins and TIRF microscopy to investigate the activity of human SSNA1 on dynamic microtubule ends and lattices. Our results show that SSNA1 modulates all parameters of microtubule dynamic instability - slowing down the rates of growth, shrinkage and catastrophe, and promoting rescue. We find that SSNA1 forms stretches along growing microtubule ends and binds cooperatively to the microtubule lattice. Furthermore, SSNA1 is enriched on microtubule damage sites, occurring both naturally, as well as induced by the microtubule severing enzyme spastin. Finally, SSNA1 binding protects microtubules against spastin's severing activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SSNA1 is both a potent microtubule stabilizing protein and a novel sensor of microtubule damage; activities that likely underlie SSNA1's functions on microtubule structures in cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">pH-dependent 11° F1FO ATP synthase sub-steps reveal insight into the FO torque generating mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Most cellular ATP is made by rotary F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> ATP synthases using proton translocation-generated clockwise torque on the F<sub>O</sub> c-ring rotor, while F<sub>1</sub>-ATP hydrolysis can force counterclockwise rotation and proton pumping. The F<sub>O</sub> torque-generating mechanism remains elusive even though the F<sub>O</sub> interface of stator subunit-a, which contains the transmembrane proton half-channels, and the c-ring is known from recent F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> structures. Here, single-molecule F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> rotation studies determined that the pKa values of the half-channels differ, show that mutations of residues in these channels change the pKa values of both half-channels, and reveal the ability of F<sub>O</sub> to undergo single c-subunit rotational stepping. These experiments provide evidence to support the hypothesis that proton translocation through F<sub>O</sub> operates via a Grotthuss mechanism involving a column of single water molecules in each half-channel linked by proton translocation-dependent c-ring rotation. We also observed pH-dependent 11° ATP synthase-direction sub-steps of the <i>E. coli</i> c<sub>10</sub>-ring of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> against the torque of F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase-dependent rotation that result from H<sup>+</sup> transfer events from F<sub>O</sub> subunit-a groups with a low pKa to one c-subunit in the c-ring, and from an adjacent c-subunit to stator groups with a high pKa. These results support a mechanism in which alternating proton translocation-dependent 11° and 25° synthase-direction rotational sub-steps of the c<sub>10</sub>-ring occur to sustain F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> ATP synthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Robust T cell activation requires an eIF3-driven burst in T cell receptor translation</a></h4>

              
                Activation of T cells requires a rapid surge in cellular protein synthesis. However, the role of translation initiation in the early induction of specific genes remains unclear. Here we show human translation initiation factor eIF3 interacts with select immune system related mRNAs including those encoding the T cell receptor (TCR) subunits TCRA and TCRB. Binding of eIF3 to the <i>TCRA</i> and <i>TCRB</i> mRNA 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) depends on CD28 coreceptor signaling and regulates a burst in TCR translation required for robust T cell activation. Use of the <i>TCRA</i> or <i>TCRB</i> 3'-UTRs to control expression of an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) improves the ability of CAR-T cells to kill tumor cells <i>in vitro</i>. These results identify a new mechanism of eIF3-mediated translation control that can aid T cell engineering for immunotherapy applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential regulation of prelimbic and thalamic transmission to the basolateral amygdala by acetylcholine receptors</a></h4>

              
                The amygdalar anterior basolateral nucleus (BLa) plays a vital role in emotional behaviors. This region receives dense cholinergic projections from basal forebrain which are critical in regulating neuronal activity and synaptic transmission. Cholinergic signaling in BLa is thought to occur through both a slow mode of volume transmission as well as a rapid, phasic mode. However, the relative effect of each mode of signaling in BLa is not understood. Here, we used electrophysiology and optogenetics in mouse brain slices to compare regulation of afferent input from cortex and thalamus to the BLa by these two modes of transmission. Phasic ACh release evoked by single pulse stimulation of cholinergic terminals had a biphasic effect on glutamatergic transmission at cortical input, producing rapid nicotinic receptor-mediated facilitation followed by slower muscarinic receptor (mAChR)-mediated depression. In contrast, tonic elevation of ACh through application of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine suppressed glutamatergic transmission at cortical inputs through mAChRs only. This suppression was not observed at thalamic inputs to BLa. In agreement with this pathway-specificity, the mAChR agonist, muscarine more potently suppressed transmission at inputs from prelimbic cortex (PL) than thalamus. Muscarinic inhibition at PL input was dependent on presynaptic M4 mAChRs, while at thalamic input it depended upon M3 mAChR-mediated stimulation of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. Muscarinic inhibition at both pathways was frequency-dependent, allowing only high frequency activity to pass. These findings demonstrate complex cholinergic regulation of afferent input to BLa that depends upon the mode of ACh release and is both pathway specific and frequency dependent.

                Three apparently unrelated findings led to the discovery of the temperature receptors: a better understanding of pain-sensing, the molecular nature of the channels in charge of touch and proprioception, and the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine bestowed to David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian. In 1953, state-of-the-art research in...
