Abstract: A phenomenological model for aesthetic appraisal is proposed in terms of pragmatic information for a dynamic update semantics over belief states on an aesthetic appreciator. The model qualitatively correlates with aesthetic pleasure ratings in an experimental study on cadential effects in Western tonal music. Finally, related computational and neurodynamical accounts are discussed.

                arXiv:2411.10596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimalistic representation model for the head direction (HD) system, aiming to learn a high-dimensional representation of head direction that captures essential properties of HD cells. Our model is a representation of rotation group $U(1)$, and we study both the fully connected version and convolutional version. We demonstrate the emergence of Gaussian-like tuning profiles and a 2D circle geometry in both versions of the model. We also demonstrate that the learned model is capable of accurate path integration.

                arXiv:2411.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human vision is mediated by a complex interconnected network of cortical brain areas jointly representing visual information. While these areas are increasingly understood in isolation, their representational relationships remain elusive. Here we developed relational neural control (RNC), and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate fMRI responses of early- and mid-level visual areas. RNC generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. A large portion of representational content was shared across areas, unique representational content increased with cortical distance, and we isolated the visual features determining these effects. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11143">Integrated Ising Model with global inhibition for decision making</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.11143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans and other organisms make decisions choosing between different options, with the aim to maximize the reward and minimize the cost. The main theoretical framework for modeling the decision-making process has been based on the highly successful drift-diffusion model, which is a simple tool for explaining many aspects of this process. However, new observations challenge this model. Recently, it was found that inhibitory tone increases during high cognitive load and situations of uncertainty, but the origin of this phenomenon is not understood. Motivated by this observation, we extend a recently developed model for decision making while animals move towards targets in real space. We introduce an integrated Ising-type model, that includes global inhibition, and use it to explore its role in decision-making. This model can explain how the brain may utilize inhibition to improve its decision-making accuracy. Compared to experimental results, this model suggests that the regime of the brain's decision-making activity is in proximity to a critical transition line between the ordered and disordered. Within the model, the critical region near the transition line has the advantageous property of enabling a significant decrease in error with a small increase in inhibition and also exhibits unique properties with respect to learning and memory decay.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10458">Neural decoding from stereotactic EEG: accounting for electrode variability across subjects</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.10458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning based neural decoding from stereotactic electroencephalography (sEEG) would likely benefit from scaling up both dataset and model size. To achieve this, combining data across multiple subjects is crucial. However, in sEEG cohorts, each subject has a variable number of electrodes placed at distinct locations in their brain, solely based on clinical needs. Such heterogeneity in electrode number/placement poses a significant challenge for data integration, since there is no clear correspondence of the neural activity recorded at distinct sites between individuals. Here we introduce seegnificant: a training framework and architecture that can be used to decode behavior across subjects using sEEG data. We tokenize the neural activity within electrodes using convolutions and extract long-term temporal dependencies between tokens using self-attention in the time dimension. The 3D location of each electrode is then mixed with the tokens, followed by another self-attention in the electrode dimension to extract effective spatiotemporal neural representations. Subject-specific heads are then used for downstream decoding tasks. Using this approach, we construct a multi-subject model trained on the combined data from 21 subjects performing a behavioral task. We demonstrate that our model is able to decode the trial-wise response time of the subjects during the behavioral task solely from neural data. We also show that the neural representations learned by pretraining our model across individuals can be transferred in a few-shot manner to new subjects. This work introduces a scalable approach towards sEEG data integration for multi-subject model training, paving the way for cross-subject generalization for sEEG decoding.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10720">Multi Scale Graph Neural Network for Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular A\b{eta} plaques, neurofibrillary tau tangles, glial activation, and neuronal degeneration, involving multiple cell types and pathways. Current models often overlook the cellular context of these pathways. To address this, we developed a multiscale graph neural network (GNN) model, ALZ PINNACLE, using brain omics data from donors spanning the entire aging to AD spectrum. ALZ PINNACLE is based on the PINNACLE GNN framework, which learns context-aware protein, cell type, and tissue representations within a unified latent space. ALZ PINNACLE was trained on 14,951 proteins, 206,850 protein interactions, 7 cell types, and 48 cell subtypes or states. After pretraining, we investigated the learned embedding of APOE, the largest genetic risk factor for AD, across different cell types. Notably, APOE embeddings showed high similarity in microglial, neuronal, and CD8 cells, suggesting a similar role of APOE in these cell types. Fine tuning the model on AD risk genes revealed cell type contexts predictive of the role of APOE in AD. Our results suggest that ALZ PINNACLE may provide a valuable framework for uncovering novel insights into AD neurobiology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11061">Beyond Human-Like Processing: Large Language Models Perform Equivalently on Forward and Backward Scientific Text</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.11061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) has led to their consideration as models of human language processing. Instead, we suggest that the success of LLMs arises from the flexibility of the transformer learning architecture. To evaluate this conjecture, we trained LLMs on scientific texts that were either in a forward or backward format. Despite backward text being inconsistent with the structure of human languages, we found that LLMs performed equally well in either format on a neuroscience benchmark, eclipsing human expert performance for both forward and backward orders. Our results are consistent with the success of transformers across diverse domains, such as weather prediction and protein design. This widespread success is attributable to LLM's ability to extract predictive patterns from any sufficiently structured input. Given their generality, we suggest caution in interpreting LLM's success in linguistic tasks as evidence for human-like mechanisms.

                arXiv:2205.08734v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain waves still cannot reliably distinguish between awake and asleep states. Here, I present new original indices, voltage subthreshold wave $\tau$ and abovethreshold wave burst, for advanced LFP/EEG readings. Assuming that $\tau$ is a microwave that fluctuates every sample such as the equipotential, the total number of $\tau$ ($N\tau$) is inferred to be the maximum, and the amplitude of burst (Abst) is inferred to be the minimum. In fact, they invariably had a mean $\tau$ duration ($M\tau$) of 2-3 sample intervals in any case. In addition, $\tau$ and burst exhibited self-similarity for sample frequency while occupying approximately 30% and 70% of LFP in the natural state, respectively. Its threshold and Abst were correlated with the vigilance state and decreased to 70% by doubling the sample frequency. The dose of sevoflurane, which inhibits and synchronizes neural activity, was linearly correlated with decreases in the threshold and $N\tau$. Thus, $\tau$ could reflect the uncertainty of the membrane potential. I propose that $\tau$ and burst represent a pause and an activity such as the rhythm of the brain.

                arXiv:2408.10234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is about the neural conundrum behind the slowness of human behavior. The information throughput of a human being is about 10 bits/s. In comparison, our sensory systems gather data at ~10^9 bits/s. The stark contrast between these numbers remains unexplained and touches on fundamental aspects of brain function: What neural substrate sets this speed limit on the pace of our existence? Why does the brain need billions of neurons to process 10 bits/s? Why can we only think about one thing at a time? The brain seems to operate in two distinct modes: the "outer" brain handles fast high-dimensional sensory and motor signals, whereas the "inner" brain processes the reduced few bits needed to control behavior. Plausible explanations exist for the large neuron numbers in the outer brain, but not for the inner brain, and we propose new research directions to remedy this.

                arXiv:2410.11064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Divergent brain connectivity is thought to underlie the behavioral and cognitive symptoms observed in many neurodevelopmental disorders. Quantifying divergence from neurotypical connectivity patterns offers a promising pathway to inform diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. While advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as diffusion MRI (dMRI), have facilitated the mapping of brain's structural connectome, the challenge lies in accurately modeling developmental trajectories within these complex networked structures to create robust neurodivergence markers. In this work, we present the Brain Representation via Individualized Deep Generative Embedding (BRIDGE) framework, which integrates normative modeling with a bio-inspired deep generative model to create a reference trajectory of connectivity transformation as part of neurotypical development. This will enable the assessment of neurodivergence by comparing individuals to the established neurotypical trajectory. BRIDGE provides a global neurodivergence score based on the difference between connectivity-based brain age and chronological age, along with region-wise neurodivergence maps that highlight localized connectivity differences. Application of BRIDGE to a large cohort of children with autism spectrum disorder demonstrates that the global neurodivergence score correlates with clinical assessments in autism, and the regional map offers insights into the heterogeneity at the individual level in neurodevelopmental disorders. Together, the neurodivergence score and map form powerful tools for quantifying developmental divergence in connectivity patterns, advancing the development of imaging markers for personalized diagnosis and intervention in various clinical contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10715">Self-Attention Limits Working Memory Capacity of Transformer-Based Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.10715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has revealed striking limits in their working memory capacity, similar to what has been found in human behavioral studies. Specifically, these models' performance drops significantly on N-back tasks as N increases. However, there is still a lack of mechanistic interpretability as to why this phenomenon would arise. Inspired by the executive attention theory from behavioral sciences, we hypothesize that the self-attention mechanism within Transformer-based models might be responsible for their working memory capacity limits. To test this hypothesis, we train vanilla decoder-only transformers to perform N-back tasks and find that attention scores gradually aggregate to the N-back positions over training, suggesting that the model masters the task by learning a strategy to pay attention to the relationship between the current position and the N-back position. Critically, we find that the total entropy of the attention score matrix increases as N increases, suggesting that the dispersion of attention scores might be the cause of the capacity limit observed in N-back tasks. Our findings thus offer insights into the shared role of attention in both human and artificial intelligence. Moreover, the limitations of the self-attention mechanism revealed in the current study could inform future efforts to design more powerful model architectures with enhanced working memory capacity and cognitive capabilities.

                arXiv:2411.06414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Psycho Frame, a sophisticated system primarily used in Universal Century (U.C.) series mobile suits for NEWTYPE pilots, has evolved as an integral component in harnessing the latent potential of mental energy. Its ability to amplify and resonate with the pilot's psyche enables real-time mental control, creating unique applications such as psychomagnetic fields and sensory-based weaponry. This paper presents the development of a novel robotic control system inspired by the Psycho Frame, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and deep learning for real-time control of robotic systems. By capturing and interpreting brainwave data through EEG, the system extends human cognitive commands to robotic actions, reflecting the seamless synchronization of thought and machine, much like the Psyco Frame's integration with a Newtype pilot's mental faculties. This research demonstrates how modern AI techniques can expand the limits of human-machine interaction, potentially transcending traditional input methods and enabling a deeper, more intuitive control of complex robotic systems.

Abstract: Dennler et al. submit that they have discovered limitations affecting some of the conclusions drawn in our 2020 paper, Rapid online learning and robust recall in a neuromorphic olfactory circuit. Specifically, they assert (1) that the public dataset we used suffers from sensor drift and a nonrandomized measurement protocol, (2) that our neuromorphic EPL network is limited in its ability to generalize over repeated presentations of an odorant, and (3) that our EPL network results can be performance matched by using a more computationally efficient distance measure. Though they are correct in their description of the limitations of that public dataset, they do not acknowledge in their first two assertions how our utilization of those data sidestepped these limitations. Their third claim arises from flaws in the method used to generate their distance measure. We respond below to each of these three claims in turn.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14964">Elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of surrogate gradient learning in spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.14964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training spiking neural networks to approximate universal functions is essential for studying information processing in the brain and for neuromorphic computing. Yet the binary nature of spikes poses a challenge for direct gradient-based training. Surrogate gradients have been empirically successful in circumventing this problem, but their theoretical foundation remains elusive. Here, we investigate the relation of surrogate gradients to two theoretically well-founded approaches. On the one hand, we consider smoothed probabilistic models, which, due to the lack of support for automatic differentiation, are impractical for training multi-layer spiking neural networks but provide derivatives equivalent to surrogate gradients for single neurons. On the other hand, we investigate stochastic automatic differentiation, which is compatible with discrete randomness but has not yet been used to train spiking neural networks. We find that the latter gives surrogate gradients a theoretical basis in stochastic spiking neural networks, where the surrogate derivative matches the derivative of the neuronal escape noise function. This finding supports the effectiveness of surrogate gradients in practice and suggests their suitability for stochastic spiking neural networks. However, surrogate gradients are generally not gradients of a surrogate loss despite their relation to stochastic automatic differentiation. Nevertheless, we empirically confirm the effectiveness of surrogate gradients in stochastic multi-layer spiking neural networks and discuss their relation to deterministic networks as a special case. Our work gives theoretical support to surrogate gradients and the choice of a suitable surrogate derivative in stochastic spiking neural networks.

                arXiv:2411.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolutionary computing community, the remarkable language-handling capabilities and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the functionality of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), enabling them to tackle optimization problems involving structured language or program code. Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs.

                arXiv:2411.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing of artificial intelligence-of-things calls for higher energy-efficient edge computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic agents leveraging brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) models based on spatiotemporally sparse binary activations. However, the lack of efficient and high-accuracy deep SNN learning algorithms prevents them from practical edge deployments with a strictly bounded cost. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal orthogonal propagation (STOP) algorithm to tack this challenge. Our algorithm enables fully synergistic learning of synaptic weights as well as firing thresholds and leakage factors in spiking neurons to improve SNN accuracy, while under a unified temporally-forward trace-based framework to mitigate the huge memory requirement for storing neural states of all time-steps in the forward pass. Characteristically, the spatially-backward neuronal errors and temporally-forward traces propagate orthogonally to and independently of each other, substantially reducing computational overhead. Our STOP algorithm obtained high recognition accuracies of 99.53%, 94.84%, 74.92%, 98.26% and 77.10% on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-Gesture and DVS-CIFAR10 datasets with adequate SNNs of intermediate scales from LeNet-5 to ResNet-18. Compared with other deep SNN training works, our method is more plausible for edge intelligent scenarios where resources are limited but high-accuracy in-situ learning is desired.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological neural networks, has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex machine learning tasks with greater efficiency and lower power consumption. The integration of biologically plausible learning algorithms, such as the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm (GHA), is key to enhancing the performance of neuromorphic systems. In this paper, we explore the application of GHA in large-scale neuromorphic platforms, specifically SpiNNaker, a hardware designed to simulate large neural networks. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy, showcasing the potential of biologically inspired learning algorithms in advancing the field of neuromorphic computing.

                arXiv:2411.10536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kin selection theory has proven to be a popular and widely accepted account of how altruistic behaviour can evolve under natural selection. Hamilton's rule, first published in 1964, has since been experimentally validated across a range of different species and social behaviours. In contrast to this large body of work in natural populations, however, there has been relatively little study of kin selection \emph{in silico}. In the current work, we offer what is to our knowledge the first demonstration of kin selection emerging naturally within a population of agents undergoing continuous neuroevolution. Specifically, we find that zero-sum transfer of resources from parents to their infant offspring evolves through kin selection in environments where it is hard for offspring to survive alone. In an additional experiment, we show that kin selection in our simulations relies on a combination of kin recognition and population viscosity. We believe that our work may contribute to the understanding of kin selection in minimal evolutionary systems, without explicit notions of genes and fitness maximisation.

                arXiv:2411.10558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent systems such as hospital robots and package delivery drones often operate in highly uncertain environments and are expected to achieve complex temporal task objectives while ensuring safety. While learning-based methods such as reinforcement learning are popular methods to train single and multi-agent autonomous systems under user-specified and state-based reward functions, applying these methods to satisfy trajectory-level task objectives is a challenging problem. Our first contribution is the use of weighted automata to specify trajectory-level objectives, such that, maximal paths induced in the weighted automaton correspond to desired trajectory-level behaviors. We show how weighted automata-based specifications go beyond timeliness properties focused on deadlines to performance properties such as expeditiousness. Our second contribution is the use of evolutionary game theory (EGT) principles to train homogeneous multi-agent teams targeting homogeneous task objectives. We show how shared experiences of agents and EGT-based policy updates allow us to outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods in minimizing path length by nearly 30\% in large spaces. We also show that our algorithm is computationally faster than deep RL methods by at least an order of magnitude. Additionally our results indicate that it scales better with an increase in the number of agents as compared to other methods.

                arXiv:2411.10573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widely used ReLU is favored for its hardware efficiency, {as the implementation at inference is a one bit sign case,} yet suffers from issues such as the ``dying ReLU'' problem, where during training, neurons fail to activate and constantly remain at zero, as highlighted by Lu et al. Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue often introduce more complex and less hardware-friendly activation functions. In this work, we propose a Hysteresis Rectified Linear Unit (HeLU), an efficient activation function designed to address the ``dying ReLU'' problem with minimal complexity. Unlike traditional activation functions with fixed thresholds for training and inference, HeLU employs a variable threshold that refines the backpropagation. This refined mechanism allows simpler activation functions to achieve competitive performance comparable to their more complex counterparts without introducing unnecessary complexity or requiring inductive biases. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HeLU enhances model generalization across diverse datasets, offering a promising solution for efficient and effective inference suitable for a wide range of neural network architectures.

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality poses a significant challenge to modern multilayer perceptron-based architectures, often causing performance stagnation and scalability issues. Addressing this limitation typically requires vast amounts of data. In contrast, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks have gained attention in the machine learning community for their bold claim of being unaffected by the curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and the mathematical principles underlying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, which enable their scalability and high performance in high-dimensional spaces. We begin with an introduction to foundational concepts necessary to understand Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, including interpolation methods and Basis-splines, which form their mathematical backbone. This is followed by an overview of perceptron architectures and the Universal approximation theorem, a key principle guiding modern machine learning. This is followed by an overview of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, including its mathematical formulation and implications for overcoming dimensionality challenges. Next, we review the architecture and error-scaling properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, demonstrating how these networks achieve true freedom from the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we discuss the practical viability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, highlighting scenarios where their unique capabilities position them to excel in real-world applications. This review aims to offer insights into Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks' potential to redefine scalability and performance in high-dimensional learning tasks.

                arXiv:2411.10692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TinyML models often operate in remote, dynamic environments without cloud connectivity, making them prone to failures. Ensuring reliability in such scenarios requires not only detecting model failures but also identifying their root causes. However, transient failures, privacy concerns, and the safety-critical nature of many applications-where systems cannot be interrupted for debugging-complicate the use of raw sensor data for offline analysis. We propose DEBUG-HD, a novel, resource-efficient on-device debugging approach optimized for KB-sized tinyML devices that utilizes hyper-dimensional computing (HDC). Our method introduces a new HDC encoding technique that leverages conventional neural networks, allowing DEBUG-HD to outperform prior binary HDC methods by 27% on average in detecting input corruptions across various image and audio datasets.

                arXiv:2411.10958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. SageAttention utilizes 8-bit matrix multiplication, 16-bit matrix multiplication with 16-bit accumulator, and precision-enhancing methods, implementing an accurate and 2x speedup kernel compared to FlashAttention2. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a warp-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$ and $V$, enhancing the accuracy of attention with INT4 $QK$ and FP8 $PV$. Third, we analyze the quantization accuracy across timesteps and layers, then propose an adaptive quantization method to ensure the end-to-end metrics over various models. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

                arXiv:2411.11275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over an extensive duration, administrators and clinicians have endeavoured to predict Emergency Department (ED) visits with precision, aiming to optimise resource distribution. Despite the proliferation of diverse AI-driven models tailored for precise prognostication, this task persists as a formidable challenge, besieged by constraints such as restrained generalisability, susceptibility to overfitting and underfitting, scalability issues, and complex fine-tuning hyper-parameters. In this study, we introduce a novel Meta-learning Gradient Booster (Meta-ED) approach for precisely forecasting daily ED visits and leveraging a comprehensive dataset of exogenous variables, including socio-demographic characteristics, healthcare service use, chronic diseases, diagnosis, and climate parameters spanning 23 years from Canberra Hospital in ACT, Australia. The proposed Meta-ED consists of four foundational learners-Catboost, Random Forest, Extra Tree, and lightGBoost-alongside a dependable top-level learner, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), by combining the unique capabilities of varied base models (sub-learners). Our study assesses the efficacy of the Meta-ED model through an extensive comparative analysis involving 23 models. The evaluation outcomes reveal a notable superiority of Meta-ED over the other models in accuracy at 85.7% (95% CI ;85.4%, 86.0%) and across a spectrum of 10 evaluation metrics. Notably, when compared with prominent techniques, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, LightGBoost, and Extra Tree (ExT), Meta-ED showcases substantial accuracy enhancements of 58.6%, 106.3%, 22.3%, 7.0%, and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, incorporating weather-related features demonstrates a 3.25% improvement in the prediction accuracy of visitors' numbers. The encouraging outcomes of our study underscore Meta-ED as a foundation model for the precise prediction of daily ED visitors.

                arXiv:2411.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC), is a class of computational methods such as Echo State Networks (ESN) and Liquid State Machines (LSM) describe a generic method to perform pattern recognition and temporal analysis with any non-linear system. This is enabled by Reservoir Computing being a shallow network model with only Input, Reservoir, and Readout layers where input and reservoir weights are not learned (only the readout layer is trained). LSM is a special case of Reservoir computing inspired by the organization of neurons in the brain and generally refers to spike-based Reservoir computing approaches. LSMs have been successfully used to showcase decent performance on some neuromorphic vision and speech datasets but a common problem associated with LSMs is that since the model is more-or-less fixed, the main way to improve the performance is by scaling up the Reservoir size, but that only gives diminishing rewards despite a tremendous increase in model size and computation. In this paper, we propose two approaches for effectively ensembling LSM models - Multi-Length Scale Reservoir Ensemble (MuLRE) and Temporal Excitation Partitioned Reservoir Ensemble (TEPRE) and benchmark them on Neuromorphic-MNIST (N-MNIST), Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), and DVSGesture datasets, which are standard neuromorphic benchmarks. We achieve 98.1% test accuracy on N-MNIST with a 3600-neuron LSM model which is higher than any prior LSM-based approach and 77.8% test accuracy on the SHD dataset which is on par with a standard Recurrent Spiking Neural Network trained by Backprop Through Time (BPTT). We also propose receptive field-based input weights to the Reservoir to work alongside the Multi-Length Scale Reservoir ensemble model for vision tasks. Thus, we introduce effective means of scaling up the performance of LSM models and evaluate them against relevant neuromorphic benchmarks

                arXiv:2411.11545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-core neuromorphic processors are becoming increasingly significant due to their energy-efficient local computing and scalable modular architecture, particularly for event-based processing applications. However, minimizing the cost of inter-core communication, which accounts for the majority of energy usage, remains a challenging issue. Beyond optimizing circuit design at lower abstraction levels, an efficient multicast addressing scheme is crucial. We propose a hierarchical bit string encoding scheme that largely expands the addressing capability of state-of-the-art symbol-based schemes for the same number of routing bits. When put at work with a real neuromorphic task, this hierarchical bit string encoding achieves a reduction in area cost by approximately 29% and decreases energy consumption by about 50%.

Abstract: The human brain is a dynamical system whose extremely complex sensor-driven neural processes give rise to conceptual, logical cognition. Understanding the interplay between nonlinear neural dynamics and concept-level cognition remains a major scientific challenge. Here I propose a mechanism of neurodynamical organization, called conceptors, which unites nonlinear dynamics with basic principles of conceptual abstraction and logic. It becomes possible to learn, store, abstract, focus, morph, generalize, de-noise and recognize a large number of dynamical patterns within a single neural system; novel patterns can be added without interfering with previously acquired ones; neural noise is automatically filtered. Conceptors help explaining how conceptual-level information processing emerges naturally and robustly in neural systems, and remove a number of roadblocks in the theory and applications of recurrent neural networks.

                arXiv:2407.17305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the use of bio-inspired learning techniques such as Hebbian learning and its closely-related Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) variant have drawn significant attention for the design of compute-efficient AI systems that can continuously learn on-line at the edge. A key differentiating factor regarding this emerging class of neuromorphic continual learning system lies in the fact that learning must be carried using a data stream received in its natural order, as opposed to conventional gradient-based offline training, where a static training dataset is assumed available a priori and randomly shuffled to make the training set independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). In contrast, the emerging class of neuromorphic continual learning systems covered in this survey must learn to integrate new information on the fly in a non-i.i.d manner, which makes these systems subject to catastrophic forgetting. In order to build the next generation of neuromorphic AI systems that can continuously learn at the edge, a growing number of research groups are studying the use of Sparse and Predictive Coding-based Hebbian neural network architectures and the related Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) equipped with STDP learning. However, since this research field is still emerging, there is a need for providing a holistic view of the different approaches proposed in the literature so far. To this end, this survey covers a number of recent works in the field of neuromorphic continual learning based on state-of-the-art Sparse and Predictive Coding technology; provides background theory to help interested researchers quickly learn the key concepts; and discusses important future research questions in light of the different works covered in this paper. It is hoped that this survey will contribute towards future research in the field of neuromorphic continual learning.

Abstract: In this survey, we introduce Meta-Black-Box-Optimization~(MetaBBO) as an emerging avenue within the Evolutionary Computation~(EC) community, which incorporates Meta-learning approaches to assist automated algorithm design. Despite the success of MetaBBO, the current literature provides insufficient summaries of its key aspects and lacks practical guidance for implementation. To bridge this gap, we offer a comprehensive review of recent advances in MetaBBO, providing an in-depth examination of its key developments. We begin with a unified definition of the MetaBBO paradigm, followed by a systematic taxonomy of various algorithm design tasks, including algorithm selection, algorithm configuration, solution manipulation, and algorithm generation. Further, we conceptually summarize different learning methodologies behind current MetaBBO works, including reinforcement learning, supervised learning, neuroevolution, and in-context learning with Large Language Models. A comprehensive evaluation of the latest representative MetaBBO methods is then carried out, alongside an experimental analysis of their optimization performance, computational efficiency, and generalization ability. Based on the evaluation results, we meticulously identify a set of core designs that enhance the generalization and learning effectiveness of MetaBBO. Finally, we outline the vision for the field by providing insight into the latest trends and potential future directions. Relevant literature will be continuously collected and updated at \url{https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Awesome-MetaBBO}.

                arXiv:2411.08735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in diverse applications, prompting the need for a solid theoretical foundation. Recent research has identified the minimal width $\max\{2,d_x,d_y\}$ required for neural networks with input dimensions $d_x$ and output dimension $d_y$ that use leaky ReLU activations to universally approximate $L^p(\mathbb{R}^{d_x},\mathbb{R}^{d_y})$ on compacta. Here, we present an alternative proof for the minimal width of such neural networks, by directly constructing approximating networks using a coding scheme that leverages the properties of leaky ReLUs and standard $L^p$ results. The obtained construction has a minimal interior dimension of $1$, independent of input and output dimensions, which allows us to show that autoencoders with leaky ReLU activations are universal approximators of $L^p$ functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalizing flow LU-Net serves as a distributional universal approximator. We broaden our results to show that smooth invertible neural networks can approximate $L^p(\mathbb{R}^{d},\mathbb{R}^{d})$ on compacta when the dimension $d\geq 2$, which provides a constructive proof of a classical theorem of Brenier and Gangbo. In addition, we use a topological argument to establish that for FNNs with monotone Lipschitz continuous activations, $d_x+1$ is a lower bound on the minimal width required for the uniform universal approximation of continuous functions $C^0(\mathbb{R}^{d_x},\mathbb{R}^{d_y})$ on compacta when $d_x\geq d_y$.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an extension for semi-supervised Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering (MSSC) problems of MDEClust, a memetic framework based on the Differential Evolution paradigm for unsupervised clustering. In semi-supervised MSSC, background knowledge is available in the form of (instance-level) "must-link" and "cannot-link" constraints, each of which indicating if two dataset points should be associated to the same or to a different cluster, respectively. The presence of such constraints makes the problem at least as hard as its unsupervised version and, as a consequence, some framework operations need to be carefully designed to handle this additional complexity: for instance, it is no more true that each point is associated to its nearest cluster center. As far as we know, our new framework, called S-MDEClust, represents the first memetic methodology designed to generate a (hopefully) optimal feasible solution for semi-supervised MSSC problems. Results of thorough computational experiments on a set of well-known as well as synthetic datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.

Abstract: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into Neural Networks, enabling them to learn complex patterns. Different activation functions vary in speed and accuracy, ranging from faster but less accurate options like ReLU to slower but more accurate functions like SiLU or SELU. Typically, same activation function is used throughout an entire model architecture. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of using mixed activation functions in YOLO-based models, evaluating their impact on latency, memory usage, and accuracy across CPU, NPU, and GPU edge devices. We also propose a novel approach that leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design YOLO models with optimized mixed activation functions.The best model generated through this method demonstrates a slight improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to baseline model (SiLU), while it is 22.28% faster and consumes 64.15% less memory on the reference NPU device.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95346">Development of a new genotype–phenotype linked antibody screening system</a></h4>

              
                Antibodies are powerful tools for the therapy and diagnosis of various diseases. In addition to conventional hybridoma-based screening, recombinant antibody-based screening has become a common choice; however, its application is hampered by two factors: (1) screening starts after Ig gene cloning and recombinant antibody production only, and (2) the antibody is composed of paired chains, heavy and light, commonly expressed by two independent expression vectors. Here, we introduce a method for the rapid screening of recombinant monoclonal antibodies by establishing a Golden Gate-based dual-expression vector and in-vivo expression of membrane-bound antibodies. Using this system, we demonstrate the rapid isolation of influenza cross-reactive antibodies with high affinity from immunized mice within 7 days. This system is particularly useful for isolating therapeutic or diagnostic antibodies, for example during foreseen pandemics.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The current reinforcement learning framework focuses exclusively on performance, often at the expense of efficiency. In contrast, biological control achieves remarkable performance while also optimizing computational energy expenditure and decision frequency. We propose a decision-bounded Markov decision process (DB-MDP) that constrains the number of decisions and computational energy available to agents in reinforcement learning environments. Our experiments demonstrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms struggle within this framework, leading to either failure or suboptimal performance. To address this, we introduce a biologically inspired, temporally layered architecture (TLA), enabling agents to manage computational costs through two layers with distinct timescales and energy requirements. TLA achieves optimal performance in decision-bounded environments and in continuous control environments, matching state-of-the-art performance while using a fraction of the computing cost. Compared to current reinforcement learning algorithms that solely prioritize performance, our approach significantly lowers computational energy expenditure while maintaining performance. These findings establish a benchmark and pave the way for future research on energy and time-aware control.</span>

Here we show that the shortest path distances can be found by a simple matrix inversion: if the edges are given by the adjacency matrix Aij, then with a suitably small value of γ, the shortest path distances are Dij=ceil(logγ[(I-γA)-1]ij).We derive several graph-theoretic bounds on the value of γ and explore its useful range with numerics on different graph types. Even when the distance function is not globally accurate across the entire graph, it still works locally to instruct pursuit of the shortest path. In this mode, it also extends to weighted graphs with positive edge weights. For a wide range of dense graphs, this distance function is computationally faster than the best available alternative. Finally, we show that this method leads naturally to a neural network solution of the all-pairs-shortest-path problem.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural network pruning is a popular approach to reducing the computational costs of training and/or deploying a network and aims to do so while minimizing accuracy loss. Pruning methods that remove individual weights (fine granularity) can remove more total network parameters before reaching a given degree of accuracy loss, while methods that preserve some or all of a network’s structure (coarser granularity, such as pruning channels from a CNN) take better advantage of hardware and software optimized for dense matrix computations. We compare intelligent iterative pruning using several different criteria sampled from the literature against random pruning at initialization across multiple granularities on two different architectures and three image classification tasks. Our work is the first direct and comprehensive investigation of the relationship between granularity and the efficacy of intelligent pruning relative to a random-pruning baseline. We find that the accuracy advantage of intelligent over random pruning decreases dramatically as granularity becomes coarser, with minimal advantage for intelligent pruning at granularity coarse enough to fully preserve network structure. For instance, at pruning rates where random pruning leaves ResNet-20 at 85.0% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 after 30,000 training iterations, intelligent weight pruning with the best-in-context criterion leaves it at about 90.0% accuracy (on par with the unpruned network), kernel pruning leaves it at about 86.5%, and channel pruning leaves it at about 85.5%. Our results suggest that compared to coarse pruning, fine pruning combined with efficient implementation of the resulting networks is a more promising direction for easing the trade-off between high accuracy and low computational cost.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The sparse coding model posits that the visual system has evolved to efficiently code natural stimuli using a sparse set of features from an overcomplete dictionary. The original sparse coding model suffered from two key limitations; however: (1) computing the neural response to an image patch required minimizing a nonlinear objective function via recurrent dynamics and (2) fitting relied on approximate inference methods that ignored uncertainty. Although subsequent work has developed several methods to overcome these obstacles, we propose a novel solution inspired by the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. We introduce the sparse coding variational autoencoder (SVAE), which augments the sparse coding model with a probabilistic recognition model parameterized by a deep neural network. This recognition model provides a neurally plausible feedforward implementation for the mapping from image patches to neural activities and enables a principled method for fitting the sparse coding model to data via maximization of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). The SVAE differs from standard VAEs in three key respects: the latent representation is overcomplete (there are more latent dimensions than image pixels), the prior is sparse or heavy-tailed instead of gaussian, and the decoder network is a linear projection instead of a deep network. We fit the SVAE to natural image data under different assumed prior distributions and show that it obtains higher test performance than previous fitting methods. Finally, we examine the response properties of the recognition network and show that it captures important nonlinear properties of neurons in the early visual pathway.</span>

In this work, we analyze the gradients in GRU and propose the use of orthogonal matrices to prevent exploding gradient problems and enhance long-term memory. We study where to use orthogonal matrices and propose a Neumann series–based scaled Cayley transformation for training orthogonal matrices in GRU, which we call Neumann-Cayley orthogonal GRU (NC-GRU). We present detailed experiments of our model on several synthetic and real-world tasks, which show that NC-GRU significantly outperforms GRU and several other RNNs.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Associative learning is a behavioral phenomenon in which individuals develop connections between stimuli or events based on their co-occurrence. Initially studied by Pavlov in his conditioning experiments, the fundamental principles of learning have been expanded on through the discovery of a wide range of learning phenomena. Computational models have been developed based on the concept of minimizing reward prediction errors. The Rescorla-Wagner model, in particular, is a well-known model that has greatly influenced the field of reinforcement learning. However, the simplicity of these models restricts their ability to fully explain the diverse range of behavioral phenomena associated with learning. In this study, we adopt the free energy principle, which suggests that living systems strive to minimize surprise or uncertainty under their internal models of the world. We consider the learning process as the minimization of free energy and investigate its relationship with the Rescorla-Wagner model, focusing on the informational aspects of learning, different types of surprise, and prediction errors based on beliefs and values. Furthermore, we explore how well-known behavioral phenomena such as blocking, overshadowing, and latent inhibition can be modeled within the active inference framework. We accomplish this by using the informational and novelty aspects of attention, which share similar ideas proposed by seemingly contradictory models such as Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall models. Thus, we demonstrate that the free energy principle, as a theoretical framework derived from first principles, can integrate the ideas and models of associative learning proposed based on empirical experiments and serve as a framework for a better understanding of the computational processes behind associative learning in the brain.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention owing to their adeptness in processing temporal information, low power consumption, and enhanced biological plausibility. Despite these advantages, the development of efficient and high-performing learning algorithms for SNNs remains a formidable challenge. Techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN)-to-SNN conversion can convert ANNs to SNNs with minimal performance loss, but they necessitate prolonged simulations to approximate rate coding accurately. Conversely, the direct training of SNNs using spike-based backpropagation (BP), such as surrogate gradient approximation, is more flexible and widely adopted. Nevertheless, our research revealed that the shape of the surrogate gradient function profoundly influences the training and inference accuracy of SNNs. Importantly, we identified that the shape of the surrogate gradient function significantly affects the final training accuracy. The shape of the surrogate gradient function is typically manually selected before training and remains static throughout the training process. In this article, we introduce a novel k-based leaky integrate-and-fire (KLIF) spiking neural model. KLIF, featuring a learnable parameter, enables the dynamic adjustment of the height and width of the effective surrogate gradient near threshold during training. Our proposed model undergoes evaluation on static CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets, as well as neuromorphic CIFAR10-DVS and DVS128-Gesture data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that KLIF outperforms the leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model across multiple data sets and network architectures. The superior performance of KLIF positions it as a viable replacement for the essential role of LIF in SNNs across diverse tasks.</span>

                <p>The study of ideological asymmetries in empathy has consistently yielded inconclusive findings. Yet, until recently these inconsistencies relied exclusively on self-reports, which are known to be prone to biases and inaccuracies when evaluating empathy levels. Very recently, we reported ideological asymmetries in cognitive-affective empathy while relying on neuroimaging for the first time to address this question. In the present investigation which sampled a large cohort of human individuals from two distant countries and neuroimaging sites, we re-examine this question, but this time from the perspective of empathy to physical pain. The results are unambiguous at the neural and behavioral levels and showcase no asymmetry. This finding raises a novel premise: the question of whether empathy is ideologically asymmetrical depends on the targeted component of empathy (e.g., physical pain vs cognitive-affective) and requires explicit but also unobtrusive techniques for the measure of empathy. Moreover, the findings shed new light on another line of research investigating ideological (a)symmetries in physiological responses to vicarious pain, disgust, and threat.</p>

                <p>Impulsive individuals excessively discount the value of delayed rewards, and this is thought to reflect deficits in brain regions critical for impulse control such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Delay discounting (DD) is an established measure of cognitive impulsivity, referring to the devaluation of rewards delayed in time. This study used male Wistar rats performing a DD task to test the hypothesis that neural activity states in ACC ensembles encode strategies that guide decision-making. Optogenetic silencing of ACC neurons exclusively increased impulsive choices at the 8&nbsp;s delay by increasing the number of consecutive low-value, immediate choices. In contrast to shorter delays where animals preferred the delay option, no immediate or delay preference was detected at 8&nbsp;s. These data suggest that ACC was critical for decisions requiring more deliberation between choice options. To address the role of ACC in this process, large-scale multiple single-unit recordings were performed and revealed that 4 and 8&nbsp;s delays were associated with procedural versus deliberative neural encoding mechanisms, respectively. The 4 and 8&nbsp;s delay differed in encoding of strategy corresponding to immediate and delay run termination. Specifically, neural ensemble states at 4&nbsp;s were relatively stable throughout the choice but exhibited temporal evolution in state space during the choice epoch that resembled ramping during the 8&nbsp;s delay. Collectively, these findings indicate that ensemble states in ACC facilitate strategies that guide decision-making, and impulsivity increases with disruptions of deliberative encoding mechanisms.</p>

                In this paper, we apply the concept of bipolar fuzzy sets to pseudo-UP ideals in pseudo-UP algebras. We prove that the intersection of two bipolar fuzzy pseudo-UP ideals is also a bipolar fuzzy pseudo-UP ideal, while the union of two such ideals does not always result in a bipolar fuzzy pseudo-UP ideal. Additionally, we discuss the concepts of bipolar fuzzy pseudo-UP ideals under homomorphism and explore several related properties. The homomorphic image and inverse image of bipolar fuzzy pseudo-UP ideals in a pseudo-UP algebra are also examined in detail. Furthermore, we study the notion of a bipolar fuzzy pseudo-UP ideal under the Cartesian product of pseudo-UP algebra. The Cartesian product of any two bipolar fuzzy pseudo-UP ideals is also the bipolar fuzzy pseudo-UP ideal of pseudo-UP algebra, and then some related results are obtained.

                The varied geography (Bekele, 1996) and rapid economic growth of Ethiopia (World Bank, 2020) might have impact its air pollution patterns, with topography, elevation, and climate variability (Lemma Gonfa, 1996) playing significant roles. Environmental challenges, including deforestation and climate change, also affect air quality. This study offers a systematic review of air pollution research in Ethiopia, providing a thorough analysis of its health, environmental, and economic impacts, regional variations, and policy suggestions. It addresses both indoor and outdoor air pollution, assessing their wide-ranging effects. Data were gathered through an extensive search of peer-reviewed articles, policies, and guidelines using Google Scholar and reputable sources, following PRISMA guidelines. The review highlights critical sources of air pollution in Ethiopia, including indoor biomass fuel combustion and outdoor emissions from traffic and industries. Indoor air pollution, particularly from traditional biomass fuels like wood and dung, affects rural and peri-urban areas, leading to high levels of particulate matter and carbon monoxide. Outdoor pollution, driven by urbanization, industrial expansion, and vehicle emissions, worsens health issues and environmental damage. The study identifies severe health consequences, such as respiratory infections and cardiovascular diseases, with air pollution contributing to premature deaths and rising healthcare costs. Economic analysis highlights the significant costs related to healthcare, lost productivity, and infrastructure damage. Environmental impacts include harm to plant health, soil degradation, and contributions to climate change. Despite initiatives to improve air quality monitoring and regulation, challenges persist due to outdated policies, limited infrastructure, and insufficient data. The study emphasizes the need for more comprehensive research and regulations to tackle air pollution crisis.

                Background COVID-19 disease has spread rapidly worldwide, causing high mortality. Accessible biomarkers capable of early identification of patients at risk of severe form are needed in clinical practice. The aim of the study was to determine the biological markers that predict a critical condition. Methods Retrospective study including patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized between September 2020 and June 2021. The primary endpoint was progression to critical status within 7 days from admission. We defined two groups: Critical group: Patients who developed a critical condition or died or transferred to the ICU before or at 7th day. Non-critical group: Patients who remained in non-critical respiratory status until 7th day or discharged before or at 7th day. Results Our study included 456 patients, with a sex ratio of 1.32 and an average age of 62 years. At the 7th day of hospitalization, 115 (25.2%) patients were in the critical group and 341 (74.8%) patients were in the non-critical group. The univariate logistic regression indicated that laboratory findings between non-critical and critical groups showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.047), D-Dimer (p=0.011), creatinine (0.026), creatine kinase (p=0.039), lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.04), and troponin (p=0.001) were all higher among patients in critical group. However, lymphocyte (p<0.001) and platelet (p<0.001) counts were significantly lower among the critical group. Multivariate logistic regression model, identified four independent risk factors: lymphopenia (OR=2.771, 95%CI=1.482-5.181, p=0.001), Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) (OR=2.286, 95%CI=1.461-3.578, p<0.001), thrombocytopenia (OR=1.944, 95%CI=1.092-3.459, p=0.024), and CRP>71.5 (OR=1.598, 95% CI=1.042-2.45, p=0.032) were associated to critical group. Conclusions Our results show the predictive value of lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, high NLR and CRP levels to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. A prognostic score could be proposed for guiding clinical care and improving patient outcomes.

                Background The Indian government is committed to addressing various manifestations of malnutrition, including overweight and obesity, inorder to improve individual health and well-being. The scoping review aims to map existing national policy instruments (programmes, schemes, regulations and guidelines) addressing overweight and obesity in India and analysing them for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) strategies. Methods Systematic identification and selection of policy instruments using ‘Arksey and O’Malley’ framework was conducted from central government ministry websites, between March and June 2023. These instruments focused on nutrition and/or physical activity, targeting specific demographic groups like pregnant women, lactating mothers, children (0-5 years and 5-9 years), or adolescents (10-19 years); excluding those focusing on specific diseases like micronutrient deficiencies, wasting, and stunting. Based on search strategy six policy instruments were included and analysed for SBCC strategies. Results While many policy instruments incorporated SBCC plans; the ‘National Programme for Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD)’ stands out as a significant policy initiative specifically targeting the prevention of overweight and obesity within the broader context of Non-Communicable Diseases. It adopts a comprehensive approach addressing key drivers contributing to overweight/obesity across multiple levels of behavioural influence i.e., individual, interpersonal, community and organisation for health promotion. However, there’s need to strengthen SBCC strategies related to prevention and management of obesity, especially screening and counselling, to cover all age groups with a particular focus on adolescents and youth. SBCC strategies can also be incorporated into India’s Integrated Nutrition Support Programme (POSHAN 2.0) and/or Reproductive, Maternal, New-born, Child, Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) under the National Health Mission. Conclusion This paper underscores the necessity for comprehensive strategies to address multifaceted origins of overweight and obesity. The NP-NCD stands out as a noteworthy initiative, and there is considerable potential for other programmes to emulate SBCC strategies to bolster their overall effectiveness. Note : *Policy instruments throughout the paper have been used to cover programmes, schemes, regulations and guidelines.

                Background The demand for online education promotion platforms has increased. In addition, the digital library system is one of the many systems that support teaching and learning. However, most digital library systems store books in the form of libraries that were developed or purchased exclusively by the library, without connecting data with different agencies in the same system. Methods A hybrid recommender system model for digital libraries, developed from multiple online publishers, has created a prototype digital library system that connects various important knowledge sources from multiple digital libraries and online publishers to create an index and recommend e-books. The developed system utilizes an API-based linking process to connect various important sources of knowledge from multiple data sources such as e-books on education from educational institutions, e-books from government agencies, and e-books from religious organizations are stored separately. Then, a hybrid recommender system suitable for users was developed using Collaborative Filtering (CF) model together with Content-Based Filtering. This research proposed the hybrid recommender system model, which took into account the factors of book category, reading habits of users, and sources of information. The evaluation of the experiments involved soliciting feedback from system users and comparing the results with conventional recommendation methods. Results A comparison of NDCG scores, and Precision scores were conducted for Hybrid Score 50:50, Hybrid Score 20:80, Hybrid Score 80:20, CF-score and CB-score. The experimental result was found that the Hybrid Score 80:20 method had the highest average NDCG score. Conclusions Using a hybrid recommender system model that combines 80% Collaborative Filtering, and 20% Content-Based Filtering can improve the recommender method, leading to better referral efficiency and greater overall efficiency compared to traditional approaches.

                Background Multiple medical conditions arising from reduced physical and physiological functioning, including cognitive decline, manifest in older persons. This study aims to examine the relationship between cognitive function and associated risk factors in older persons living in long-term care facilities in Indonesia. Methods This study involved 350 elderly individuals residing in long-term care institutions. A cross-sectional design utilizing an analytical survey methodology was implemented. Data were gathered via interviews employing a demographic questionnaire and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 23). Results Univariate analysis demonstrated significant correlations between cognitive performance and gender, ethnicity, level of education, medical history, subjective memory issues, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, and employment history (p < 0.05). Higher education (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56–0.84) and reduced subjective memory complaints (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.20–0.44) correlated positively with enhanced cognitive function, but alcohol intake (OR = 6.79, 95% CI: 2.42–19.1) correlated with impaired cognitive function. Conclusions the level of education, subjective memory complaints, and alcohol intake are substantially correlated with cognitive performance in older persons residing in long-term care facilities. Evaluating demographic characteristics in elderly individuals can assist healthcare professionals in the early detection of cognitive impairment, facilitating prompt interventions in long-term care environments.

                <p>by Fei Cai, Yuehua Wei, Daniel Kirchhofer, Andrew Chang, Yingnan Zhang</p>

Peptides are an emerging modality for developing therapeutics that can either agonize or antagonize cellular pathways associated with disease, yet peptides often suffer from poor chemical and physical stability, which limits their potential. However, naturally occurring disulfide-constrained peptides (DCPs) and <i>de novo</i> designed Hyperstable Constrained Peptides (HCPs) exhibiting highly stable and drug-like scaffolds, making them attractive therapeutic modalities. Previously, we established a robust platform for discovering peptide therapeutics by utilizing multiple DCPs as scaffolds. However, we realized that those libraries could be further improved by considering the foldability of peptide scaffolds for library design. We hypothesized that specific sequence patterns within the peptide scaffolds played a crucial role in spontaneous folding into a stable topology, and thus, these sequences should not be subject to randomization in the original library design. Therefore, we developed a method for designing highly diverse DCP libraries while preserving the inherent foldability of each scaffold. To achieve this, we first generated a large-scale dataset from yeast surface display (YSD) combined with shotgun alanine scan experiments to train a machine-learning (ML) model based on techniques used for natural language understanding. Then we validated the ML model with experiments, showing that it is able to not only predict the foldability of peptides with high accuracy across a broad range of sequences but also pinpoint residues critical for foldability. Using the insights gained from the alanine scanning experiment as well as prediction model, we designed a new peptide library based on a <i>de novo</i>-designed HCP, which was optimized for enhanced folding efficiency. Subsequent panning trials using this library yielded promising hits having good folding properties. In summary, this work advances peptide or small protein domain library design practices. These findings could pave the way for the efficient development of peptide-based therapeutics in the future.

                <p>by Chao Wang, Quan Zou</p>

Protein phosphorylation is essential in various signal transduction and cellular processes. To date, most tools are designed for model organisms, but only a handful of methods are suitable for predicting task in fungal species, and their performance still leaves much to be desired. In this study, a novel tool called MFPSP is developed for phosphorylation site prediction in multi-fungal species. The amino acids sequence features were derived from physicochemical and distributed information, and an offspring competition-based genetic algorithm was applied for choosing the most effective feature subset. The comparison results shown that MFPSP achieves a more advanced and balanced performance to several state-of-the-art available toolkits. Feature contribution and interaction exploration indicating the proposed model is efficient in uncovering concealed patterns within sequence. We anticipate MFPSP to serve as a valuable bioinformatics tool and benefiting practical experiments by pre-screening potential phosphorylation sites and enhancing our functional understanding of phosphorylation modifications in fungi. The source code and datasets are accessible at https://github.com/AI4HKB/MFPSP/.

                <p>by Qiangwei Peng, Xiaojie Qiu, Tiejun Li</p>

The time-resolved scRNA-seq (tscRNA-seq) provides the possibility to infer physically meaningful kinetic parameters, e.g., the transcription, splicing or RNA degradation rate constants with correct magnitudes, and RNA velocities by incorporating temporal information. Previous approaches utilizing the deterministic dynamics and steady-state assumption on gene expression states are insufficient to achieve favorable results for the data involving transient process. We present a dynamical approach, Storm (Stochastic models of RNA metabolic-labeling), to overcome these limitations by solving stochastic differential equations of gene expression dynamics. The derivation reveals that the new mRNA sequencing data obeys different types of cell-specific Poisson distributions when jointly considering both biological and cell-specific technical noise. Storm deals with measured counts data directly and extends the RNA velocity methodology based on metabolic labeling scRNA-seq data to transient stochastic systems. Furthermore, we relax the constant parameter assumption over genes/cells to obtain gene-cell-specific transcription/splicing rates and gene-specific degradation rates, thus revealing time-dependent and cell-state-specific transcriptional regulations. Storm will facilitate the study of the statistical properties of tscRNA-seq data, eventually advancing our understanding of the dynamic transcription regulation during development and disease.

                <p>by Aaron R. Allred, Caroline R. Austin, Lanna Klausing, Nicholas Boggess, Torin K. Clark</p>

Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is an emergent tool for stimulating the vestibular system, offering the potential to manipulate or enhance processes relying on vestibular-mediated central pathways. However, the extent of GVS’s influence on the perception of self-orientation pathways is not understood, particularly in the presence of physical motions. Here, we quantify roll tilt perception impacted by GVS during passive whole-body roll tilts in humans (N = 11). We find that GVS systematically amplifies and attenuates perceptions of roll tilt during physical tilt, dependent on the GVS waveform. Subsequently, we develop a novel computational model that predicts 6DoF self-motion and self-orientation perceptions for any GVS waveform and motion by modeling the vestibular afferent neuron dynamics modulated by GVS in conjunction with an observer central processing model. This effort provides a means to systematically alter spatial orientation perceptions using GVS during concurrent physical motion, and we find that irregular afferent dynamics alone best describe resultant perceptions.

                <p>by Salah Bazzi, Stephan Stansfield, Neville Hogan, Dagmar Sternad</p>

Humans are skillful at manipulating objects that possess nonlinear underactuated dynamics, such as clothes or containers filled with liquids. Several studies suggested that humans implement a predictive model-based strategy to control such objects. However, these studies only considered unconstrained reaching without any object involved or, at most, linear mass-spring systems with relatively simple dynamics. It is not clear what internal model humans develop of more complex objects, and what level of granularity is represented. To answer these questions, this study examined a task where participants physically interacted with a nonlinear underactuated system mimicking a cup of sloshing coffee: a cup with a ball rolling inside. The cup and ball were simulated in a virtual environment and subjects interacted with the system via a haptic robotic interface. Participants were instructed to move the system and arrive at a target region with both cup and ball at rest, ’zeroing out’ residual oscillations of the ball. This challenging task affords a solution known as ‘input shaping’, whereby a series of pulses moves the dynamic object to the target leaving no residual oscillations. Since the timing and amplitude of these pulses depend on the controller’s internal model of the object, input shaping served as a tool to identify the subjects’ internal representation of the cup-and-ball. Five simulations with different internal models were compared against the human data. Results showed that the features in the data were correctly predicted by a simple internal model that represented the cup-and-ball as a single rigid mass coupled to the hand impedance. These findings provide evidence that humans use simplified internal models along with mechanical impedance to manipulate complex objects.

Mitochondrial hyperfission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating and regulating the complex process of mitochondrial fission. We develop a nonlinear dynamical systems model of dynamin related protein one (Drp1)-dependent mitochondrial fission and use it to identify parameters which can regulate the total fission rate (TFR) as a function of time. The TFR defined from a nondimensionalization of the model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k - where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) and <i>k</i><sub>+</sub> and <i>k</i><sub>−</sub> are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The variable <i>μ</i> can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. Though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters, we found the TFR and the cumulative total fission (TF) depend strongly on only one, <i>μ</i>. Interestingly, the cumulative TF does not monotonically increase as <i>μ</i> increases. Instead it increases with <i>μ</i> to a certain point and then begins to decrease as <i>μ</i> continues to increase. This non-monotone dependence on <i>μ</i> suggests interventions targeting <i>k</i><sub>+</sub>, <i>k</i><sub>−</sub>, or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Thus understanding the impact of regulatory parameters, such as <i>μ</i>, may assist future therapeutic target selection.

The composition of the gut microbiota is a known factor in various diseases and has proven to be a strong basis for automatic classification of disease state. A need for a better understanding of microbiota data on the functional scale has since been voiced, as it would enhance these approaches’ biological interpretability. In this paper, we have developed a computational pipeline for integrating the functional annotation of the gut microbiota into an automatic classification process and facilitating downstream interpretation of its results. The process takes as input taxonomic composition data, which can be built from 16S or whole genome sequencing, and links each component to its functional annotations through interrogation of the UniProt database. A functional profile of the gut microbiota is built from this basis. Both profiles, microbial and functional, are used to train Random Forest classifiers to discern unhealthy from control samples. SPARTA ensures full reproducibility and exploration of inherent variability by extending state-of-the-art methods in three dimensions: increased number of trained random forests, selection of important variables with an iterative process, repetition of full selection process from different seeds. This process shows that the translation of the microbiota into functional profiles gives non-significantly different performances when compared to microbial profiles on 5 of 6 datasets. This approach’s main contribution however stems from its interpretability rather than its performance: through repetition, it also outputs a robust subset of discriminant variables. These selections were shown to be more consistent than those obtained by a state-of-the-art method, and their contents were validated through a manual bibliographic research. The interconnections between selected taxa and functional annotations were also analyzed and revealed that important annotations emerge from the cumulated influence of non-selected taxa.

Aberrant DNA methylation contributes to gene expression deregulation in cancer. However, these alterations’ precise regulatory role and clinical implications are still not fully understood. In this study, we performed expression-methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (emQTL) analysis to identify deregulated cancer-driving transcriptional networks linked to CpG demethylation pan-cancer. By analyzing 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified and confirmed significant correlations between CpG methylation and gene expression (emQTL) in <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i>, both across and within cancer types. Bipartite network analysis of the emQTL revealed groups of CpGs and genes related to important biological processes involved in carcinogenesis including proliferation, metabolism and hormone-signaling. These bipartite communities were characterized by loss of enhancer methylation in specific transcription factor binding regions (TFBRs) and the CpGs were topologically linked to upregulated genes through chromatin loops. Penalized Cox regression analysis showed a significant prognostic impact of the pan-cancer emQTL in many cancer types. Taken together, our integrative pan-cancer analysis reveals a common architecture where hallmark cancer-driving functions are affected by the loss of enhancer methylation and may be epigenetically regulated.

Bacterial pathogens pose a major risk to human health, leading to tens of millions of deaths annually and significant global economic losses. While bacterial infections are typically treated with antibiotic regimens, there has been a rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacterial strains due to antibiotic overuse. Because of this, treatment of infections with traditional antimicrobials has become increasingly difficult, necessitating the development of innovative approaches for deeply understanding pathogen function. To combat issues presented by broad- spectrum antibiotics, the idea of narrow-spectrum antibiotics has been previously proposed and explored. Rather than interrupting universal bacterial cellular processes, narrow-spectrum antibiotics work by targeting specific functions or essential genes in certain species or subgroups of bacteria. Here, we generate a collection of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) of pathogens through an automated computational pipeline. We used these GENREs to identify subgroups of pathogens that share unique metabolic phenotypes and determined that pathogen physiological niche plays a role in the development of unique metabolic function. For example, we identified several unique metabolic phenotypes specific to stomach pathogens. We identified essential genes unique to stomach pathogens in silico and a corresponding inhibitory compound for a uniquely essential gene. We then validated our in silico predictions with an in vitro microbial growth assay. We demonstrated that the inhibition of a uniquely essential gene, <i>thyX</i>, inhibited growth of stomach-specific pathogens exclusively, indicating possible physiological location-specific targeting. This pioneering computational approach could lead to the identification of unique metabolic signatures to inform future targeted, physiological location-specific, antimicrobial therapies, reducing the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics.

                <p>by Jingdi Li, Nele Guttmann, Georgia C. Drew, Tobias E. Hector, Justyna Wolinska, Kayla C. King</p>

Climate change is causing extreme heating events and leading to more infectious disease outbreaks, putting species persistence at risk. The extent to which warming temperatures and infection may together impair host health is unclear. Using a meta-analysis of >190 effect sizes representing 101 ectothermic animal host–pathogen systems, we demonstrate that warming significantly increased the mortality of hosts infected by bacterial pathogens. Pathogens that have been evolutionarily established within the host species showed higher virulence under warmer temperatures, too. Conversely, the effect of warming on novel infections—from pathogens without a shared evolutionary history with the host species—were more pronounced with larger differences between compared temperatures. We found that compared to established infections, novel infections were more deadly at lower/baseline temperatures. Moreover, we revealed that the virulence of fungal pathogens increased only when temperatures were shifted upwards towards the pathogen thermal optimum. The magnitude of all these significant effects was not impacted by host life-stage, immune complexity, pathogen inoculation methods, or exposure time. Overall, our findings reveal distinct patterns in changes of pathogen virulence during warming. We highlight the importance of pathogen taxa, thermal optima, and evolutionary history in determining the impact of global change on infection outcomes.

                <p>by Olena Kim, Yuji Okamoto, Walter A. Kaufmann, Nils Brose, Ryuichi Shigemoto, Peter Jonas</p>

It is widely believed that information storage in neuronal circuits involves nanoscopic structural changes at synapses, resulting in the formation of synaptic engrams. However, direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. To test this conjecture, we combined chemical potentiation, functional analysis by paired pre-postsynaptic recordings, and structural analysis by electron microscopy (EM) and freeze-fracture replica labeling (FRL) at the rodent hippocampal mossy fiber synapse, a key synapse in the trisynaptic circuit of the hippocampus. Biophysical analysis of synaptic transmission revealed that forskolin-induced chemical potentiation increased the readily releasable vesicle pool size and vesicular release probability by 146% and 49%, respectively. Structural analysis of mossy fiber synapses by EM and FRL demonstrated an increase in the number of vesicles close to the plasma membrane and the number of clusters of the priming protein Munc13-1, indicating an increase in the number of both docked and primed vesicles. Furthermore, FRL analysis revealed a significant reduction of the distance between Munc13-1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, suggesting reconfiguration of the channel-vesicle coupling nanotopography. Our results indicate that presynaptic plasticity is associated with structural reorganization of active zones. We propose that changes in potential nanoscopic organization at synaptic vesicle release sites may be correlates of learning and memory at a plastic central synapse.

                <p>by Farhan Mohammad, Yishan Mai, Joses Ho, Xianyuan Zhang, Stanislav Ott, James Charles Stewart, Adam Claridge-Chang</p>

The brain must guide immediate responses to beneficial and harmful stimuli while simultaneously writing memories for future reference. While both immediate actions and reinforcement learning are instructed by dopamine, how dopaminergic systems maintain coherence between these 2 reward functions is unknown. Through optogenetic activation experiments, we showed that the dopamine neurons that inform olfactory memory in <i>Drosophila</i> have a distinct, parallel function driving attraction and aversion (valence). Sensory neurons required for olfactory memory were dispensable to dopaminergic valence. A broadly projecting set of dopaminergic cells had valence that was dependent on dopamine, glutamate, and octopamine. Similarly, a more restricted dopaminergic cluster with attractive valence was reliant on dopamine and glutamate; flies avoided opto-inhibition of this narrow subset, indicating the role of this cluster in controlling ongoing behavior. Dopamine valence was distinct from output-neuron opto-valence in locomotor pattern, strength, and polarity. Overall, our data suggest that dopamine’s acute effect on valence provides a mechanism by which a dopaminergic system can coherently write memories to influence future responses while guiding immediate attraction and aversion.

                As post-hoc analyses show, interactive marketing in the new media age has served as a fragmented technique for transitioning from traditional modes of operation to dynamic and customized environments that blur the lines between brands and consumers. Several research papers have been published on interactive marketing, the impact of social media engagement, and brand loyalty. However, they remain fragmented because most produce different results based on different samples at various stages of business development. Nonetheless, there are no systematic reviews that combine all these findings into a comprehensive framework. However, many interactive marketing studies focus on short-term outcomes and do not take into account long-term effects such as brand equity and customer lifetime value. Selected articles were understudied with the requirement of a rigorous review process, which includes a thorough examination of the relevant literature. The implementation of this process is expected to result in the absence of a room for subjective judgment, as all selected studies were carefully evaluated using predetermined criteria. It was determined that the use of these technologies allows brands to interact with their customers in novel and creative ways, resulting in more engaging and dynamic experiences. That is, evaluating the effectiveness of marketing initiatives is critical to understanding their impact.

                Background Conventional multi-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CMLC) has become the current ‘gold standard’ technique in gallbladder disease. Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has gained attention due to its benefits in improving patient cosmetic results and pain reduction. We aim to assess the latest evidence on the feasibility, safety and surgical outcomes of SILC and CMLC. Methods We conducted searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and Europe PMC between December 2011 and 2021. The latest search was conducted in January 2022. We analyzed several outcomes, including perioperative complications, estimated blood loss, operation time, conversion to open surgery, hospital stay, pain score, cosmesis, and days of return to work. Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2.0 tool was used to evaluate quality of studies. Mantel-Haenszel’s formula and Inverse Variance method were conducted to synthesize results. This study was accomplished in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Results A total of 37 studies were eligible, with a total of 2,129 and 2,392 patients who underwent SILC and CMLC. Our study demonstrated a superiority of SILC for the visual analog score (VAS) at six hours post-operation [mean difference (MD) -0.58 (95% CI -1.11, -0.05), p=0.03], cosmesis one-month post-operation [standard MD 2.12 (95% CI 1.10, 3.13), p<0.0001], and cosmesis six months post-operation [standard MD 0.53 (95% CI 0.06, 0.99), p<0.0001]. Meanwhile, SILC showed a longer operation time [MD 10.45 (95% CI 6.74, 14.17), p<0.00001]. In terms of VAS at four time points (4, 8, 12, and 24 hours), perioperative complications, estimated blood loss, conversion to open surgery, hospital stay and days to return to work, SILC did not differ from CMLC. Conclusions SILC is a safe, feasible and favorable procedure in terms of pain reduction and cosmetic results. The option between both procedures is based on surgeon preferences. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022306532; 23 February 2022).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1382/v1?src=rss">Methodological literature on the reporting of systematic reviews of health economic evaluations: a scoping review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Systematic reviews of health economic evaluations play a crucial role in informing evidence-based healthcare decisions, yet they lack standardized reporting guidelines. A project has been initiated that aims to extend the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline for systematic reviews of health economic evaluations (PRISMA-EconEval). This scoping review forms a foundation for the PRISMA-EconEval project, aiming to identify, map, and extract candidate reporting items from the methodological literature. The scoping review will follow the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist and involve comprehensive searches in databases such as PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science, covering the period from 2015 to 2024. Supplementary searching, reference checking and citation searching will target grey literature, overlooked studies and evidence prior to 2015. Inclusion criteria will focus on methodological papers that provide frameworks or recommendations for reporting systematic reviews of health economic evaluations and enhanced case studies that critically discuss methods and reporting structures. The extracted data will be coded and analyzed to produce an initial list of candidate reporting items, structured according to conventional sections of a systematic review (e.g., title, abstract, methods, results). This initial list will be used in the subsequent stages of the project and disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and presentations at international conferences. The outcome of this scoping review will significantly contribute to the development of a comprehensive PRISMA-EconEval reporting guideline, aimed at enhancing the transparency, consistency, and quality of systematic reviews of health economic evaluations, and provide an essential tool for authors, editors, peer-reviewers, and stakeholders.

                Wearable sensors have become integral tools for monitoring biomechanical and physiologic aspects of athletic training and performance. A prominent trend in fitness technology, wearable devices now measure a variety of health characteristics, including movement and posture, physiologic measures (eg, heart rate and energy expenditure), and fluid and electrolyte losses, to understand an athlete’s physiologic responses during activity. Sleep has proven integral to athletic performance, and sleep monitoring wearable devices (eg, watches, rings, and headbands) use various measures, such as actigraphy and pulse oximetry, to analyze sleep quality. Young athletes benefit from wearable devices during training sessions, where multimodal data are collected and analyzed to assess performance. Wearable devices are also useful for resistance training, biofeedback, and electrical muscle stimulation, providing athletes with tools to optimize their training regimens. Moreover, these devices play a crucial role in athlete safety by monitoring cardiac physiology, head impacts, and muscle rehabilitation after injury. We provide a comprehensive review of current wearable technology and its application in youth athletics, describe where and how these sensors are used to help enhance physiologic, biomechanical, and performance parameters, and discuss future directions for wearable devices to advance sports science and athlete management.

                Background Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are diseases of the stomatognathic system characterized by various signs and symptoms. TMD treatment must be multidisciplinary because its causes are multifactorial. Noninvasive conservative treatment strategies should be carried out before considering invasive treatment options that may lead to irreparable damage. Physical therapy is an effective noninvasive therapy for managing the signs and symptoms of TMD. To date, the most effective therapeutic approach for managing TMD pain remains controversial. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the most effective physical therapy for pain management, symptom control, and quality of life improvement in patients with TMD. Methods Data search was performed using the PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Sciences databases. The results are reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for systematic reviews. Interventions based on physical therapy, including physical exercise, manual therapy, myofacial muscle manipulation, and postural therapy, with pain relief, increased mouth opening, or improved quality of life as primary outcomes, were examined. Results Twenty eligible articles were analyzed. Most interventions demonstrated statistically significant improvements as measured by the study outcomes. Conclusions Most types of physical therapy demonstrated positive effects on patients with TMD. Furthermore, physical therapy for both cervical and regional TMJ manipulation can be an alternative long-term treatment for TMD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1379/v1?src=rss">Correlation of prolonged sitting time and sitting posture on low back pain: A cross-sectional study among medical students at Universitas Sumatera Utara [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Low Back Pain (LBP) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder in the world. Medical students, particularly those who use computers for study purposes, are more vulnerable to LBP due to prolonged sitting times and improper sitting posture during lectures. However, prior research showed that the prevalence of LBP among medical students appeared lower when they were enrolled during online pandemic learning. Hence, this research is performed to determine the correlation between the duration of sitting and sitting posture on the incidence of LBP among medical students in Universitas Sumatera Utara, Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study with an analytical descriptive design was conducted in September 2023 among randomly selected 147 medical students at Universitas Sumatera Utara, Indonesia. The inclusion criteria of the research sample are students with BMI< 23 kg/m2 while the exclusion criteria are students who have abnormalities and a history of trauma or spinal fractures. Data was obtained from filling out questionnaires of The Pain and Distress Scale (PAD) and Body Awareness of Postural Habit in Young People (BAPHY). A Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to analyze data with a p-value < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results The study’s findings revealed that 40.1% of students reported having LBP problems, 72.1% reported sitting for more than seven hours each day, and 33.3% reported having a bad sitting posture. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant correlation between sitting duration and posture on complaints of lower back pain (RR = 1.69, p = 0.041 and RR = 1.69, p = 0.009). At a risk of 2,438 times, sitting posture is the main factor contributing to LBP among medical students at Universitas Sumatera Utara, Indonesia. Conclusions This research showed a significant correlation between duration and sitting posture on the incidence of low back pain.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1378/v1?src=rss">Decoding Investor Sentiments in the Indian Stock Market: A Structural Equation Modelling Approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study This research examines how psychological and social biases affect individual investors’ investing decisions. Investor sentiment significantly influences financial markets, frequently causing stock prices to deviate from their intrinsic values. In rising economies such as India, where retail investors are significantly affected by psychological factors, comprehending these attitudes is crucial. Methods This study analyses data from a comprehensive questionnaire that was conducted throughout the nation and included 552 retail investors. The investigation employed structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the elements that influence the decision-making of individuals who invest in the Indian stock market. Findings The research offers insight on the influence that investor attitude has on investment decision-making as well as the factors that precede it. The study demonstrates that investors make financial decisions based on sentiment. In addition to assessing the efficacy of the Indian financial market, this study sought to ascertain the rationality of investors’ choices by exploring the factors that influence their decision-making process. Conclusion The outcome of the study shows that information seeking, anchoring, herding, representativeness, and overconfidence all have a big impact on investors. Moreover, the study has proven investors’ irrationality and stock market inefficiency. The findings may be employed to further examine the trading practices of international investors and encourage further study in the field of behavioural finance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1377/v1?src=rss">Systematic review  of mitigation approaches in Ethiopia's energy sector: Strategies for sustainable development and climate resilience [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract The global energy sector is a primary contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, predominantly through fossil fuel combustion for electricity, heating, and transportation (IEA, 2021). This study systematically reviews Ethiopia’s energy sector mitigation approaches, focusing on renewable energy strategies and energy efficiency initiatives. While Ethiopia has made significant progress in hydropower, accounting for over 90% of its electricity generation, challenges remain in diversifying its energy mix to include geothermal and wind energy (Ethiopian Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Energy (2019) and African Development Bank, 2020). The Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy sets ambitious targets for achieving carbon neutrality by 2030, challenges remain in diversifying its energy mix to include geothermal and wind energy (Benti, Woldegiyorgis, et al., 2023 and Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2011), yet its implementation faces barriers, including financial constraints, technological gaps, and weak institutional capacity (Silitonga et al., 2020). The study highlights the potential of Ethiopia’s vast renewable energy resources, such as geothermal and wind, to enhance energy security and foster economic growth through job creation. Despite the hurdles, opportunities exist for scaling up mitigation efforts, particularly through public-private partnerships and improved policy frameworks. This review underscores the importance of addressing barriers to achieve a sustainable energy transition in Ethiopia, contributing to local and global climate mitigation goals. Thus, the policymakers should boost investments in solar, wind, and geothermal energy, reduce reliance on hydropower through incentives, and establish an inter-agency task force for policy alignment. And also, exploring green bonds and fostering human capital development through training and partnerships are essential. A strong monitoring and evaluation framework is crucial for tracking progress towards energy sustainability goals.

                Background Third molar extraction is one of the most common oral surgical procedures globally. This study assessed patients’ knowledge of third molar extraction procedures. Methods A self-administered questionnaire was administered to patients (N=384) of the dental hospital at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University in the eastern province. The questionnaire covered demographic data, knowledge of third molar extraction, and patients’ perception questions. SPSS Version 24 was used for statistical analysis. Chi-square and Fisher’s Exact test were used. P-values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results According to the demographical characteristics of the patient who received 3rd molar removal surgery. As per the history of the extraction, 45% had previous 3rd molar extraction experience, whereas 55% had no previous dental surgical experience. There was no significant difference between the groups with the knowledge about the extraction (p-0.187). Patients with no previous history were more aware of the correct time for 3rd molar extraction at 27% vs 19%, respectively (P=0.046*). Patients with a previous history of third molar extraction showed significant results of knowledge in terms of taking medication prior to 3rd molar surgical procedure. Conclusion The patient with previous experience with third molar extraction showed low misconceptions. However, further studies should consider increasing the knowledge and correcting the patients’ perceptions.

<p>
•The laminar organization of the monkey perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices supports the view that high-order association cortices are characterized by relatively large superficial layers, with larger neurons and a lower neuronal density.
•Species differences in the relative size and number of neurons in these areas indicate a greater relative development of the entorhinal cortex in the rat and of the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in primates.

<p>The perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices are key components of the medial temporal lobe memory system. Despite their essential roles in mnemonic and perceptual functions, there is limited quantitative information regarding their structural characteristics. Here, we implemented design-based stereological techniques to provide estimates of neuron number, neuronal soma size, and volume of the different layers and subdivisions of the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in adult macaque monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>, 5–9 years of age). We found that areas 36r and 36c of the perirhinal cortex and areas TF and TH of the parahippocampal cortex exhibit relatively large superficial layers, which are characteristic of the laminar organization of higher order associational cortices. In contrast, area 35 of the perirhinal cortex exhibits relatively large deep layers. Although neuronal soma size varies between subdivisions and layers, neurons are generally larger in the perirhinal cortex than in the parahippocampal cortex and even larger in the entorhinal cortex. These morphological characteristics are consistent with the hierarchical organization of these cortices within the medial temporal lobe. Comparing data in rats, monkeys, and humans, we found species differences in the relative size of these structures, showing that the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices have expanded in parallel to the cerebral cortex and may play a greater role in the integration of information in the neocortical–hippocampal loop in primates. Altogether, these normative data provide an essential reference to extrapolate findings from experimental studies in animals and create realistic models of the medial temporal lobe memory system.</p>

<p>Imperfect mimicry may be due to trade-offs between accuracy and vital biological function. Using microCT to compare the CNS of ant-mimicking jumping spiders (A), with a non-mimic (B), we found that mimics had relatively smaller CNS than non-mimics, supporting a trade-off function between mimic accuracy and neural anatomy.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In Batesian mimicry, mimetic traits are not always as convincing as predicted by theory—in fact, inaccurate mimicry with only a superficial model resemblance is common and taxonomically widespread. The “<i>selection trade-offs hypothesis</i>” proposes a life-history trade-off between accurate mimetic traits and one or more vital biological functions. Here, using an accurate myrmecomorphic (ant-mimicking) jumping spider species, <i>Myrmarachne smaragdina</i>, we investigate how myrmecomorphic modifications to the body shape impact the internal anatomy in a way that could be functionally limiting. Specifically, via x-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT), we quantify how the spider's constricted prosoma, which emulates the head and thorax of ants, impacts the size of the central nervous system (CNS) and the venom glands. Although, relative to their whole-body mass, we found no significant difference in venom gland volume, the CNS of the ant-mimicking jumping spider was significantly smaller when compared with a relatively closely related non-mimic jumping spider, indicating that some trade-off between mimic accuracy and size of neural anatomy, as articulated by the “<i>selection trade-offs hypothesis</i>,” is a possibility. Our explorative evidence enables and encourages broader investigation of how variable mimic accuracy impacts the neuroanatomy in ant mimics as a direct test of the “<i>selection trade-offs hypothesis</i>.”</p>

                Kato and Bruno show that, despite responding to sounds, rodent primary somatosensory cortex (S1) encodes neither the identity of pure auditory stimuli nor simultaneous auditory-tactile stimulus pairs. Moreover, this insensitivity to auditory and audio-tactile stimulus identity remains unchanged even following prolonged passive exposure to audio-tactile correlations and reward-reinforced behavioral training with audio-tactile stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99018">Electrophysiological dynamics of salience, default mode, and frontoparietal networks during episodic memory formation and recall revealed through multi-experiment iEEG replication</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic interactions between large-scale brain networks underpin human cognitive processes, but their electrophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. The triple network model, encompassing the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and frontoparietal network (FPN), provides a framework for understanding these interactions. We analyzed intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 177 participants across four diverse episodic memory experiments, each involving encoding as well as recall phases. Phase transfer entropy analysis revealed consistently higher directed information flow from the anterior insula (AI), a key SN node, to both DMN and FPN nodes. This directed influence was significantly stronger during memory tasks compared to resting state, highlighting the AI’s task-specific role in coordinating large-scale network interactions. This pattern persisted across externally driven memory encoding and internally governed free recall. Control analyses using the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) showed an inverse pattern, with DMN and FPN exerting higher influence on IFG, underscoring the AI’s unique role. We observed task-specific suppression of high-gamma power in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus node of the DMN during memory encoding, but not recall. Crucially, these results were replicated across all four experiments spanning verbal and spatial memory domains with high Bayes replication factors. Our findings advance understanding of how coordinated neural network interactions support memory processes, highlighting the AI’s critical role in orchestrating large-scale brain network dynamics during both memory encoding and retrieval. By elucidating the electrophysiological basis of triple network interactions in episodic memory, our study provides insights into neural circuit dynamics underlying memory function and offer a framework for investigating network disruptions in memory-related disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97399">Patch-walking, a coordinated multi-pipette patch clamp for efficiently finding synaptic connections</a></h4>

              
                Significant technical challenges exist when measuring synaptic connections between neurons in living brain tissue. The patch clamping technique, when used to probe for synaptic connections, is manually laborious and time-consuming. To improve its efficiency, we pursued another approach: instead of retracting all patch clamping electrodes after each recording attempt, we cleaned just one of them and reused it to obtain another recording while maintaining the others. With one new patch clamp recording attempt, many new connections can be probed. By placing one pipette in front of the others in this way, one can ‘walk’ across the mouse brain slice, termed ‘patch-walking.’ We performed 136 patch clamp attempts for two pipettes, achieving 71 successful whole cell recordings (52.2%). Of these, we probed 29 pairs (i.e. 58 bidirectional probed connections) averaging 91 μm intersomatic distance, finding three connections. Patch-walking yields 80–92% more probed connections, for experiments with 10–100 cells than the traditional synaptic connection searching method.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94214">A scale-invariant log-normal droplet size distribution below the critical concentration for protein phase separation</a></h4>

              
                Many proteins have been recently shown to undergo a process of phase separation that leads to the formation of biomolecular condensates. Intriguingly, it has been observed that some of these proteins form dense droplets of sizeable dimensions already below the critical concentration, which is the concentration at which phase separation occurs. To understand this phenomenon, which is not readily compatible with classical nucleation theory, we investigated the properties of the droplet size distributions as a function of protein concentration. We found that these distributions can be described by a scale-invariant log-normal function with an average that increases progressively as the concentration approaches the critical concentration from below. The results of this scaling analysis suggest the existence of a universal behaviour independent of the sequences and structures of the proteins undergoing phase separation. While we refrain from proposing a theoretical model here, we suggest that any model of protein phase separation should predict the scaling exponents that we reported here from the fitting of experimental measurements of droplet size distributions. Furthermore, based on these observations, we show that it is possible to use the scale invariance to estimate the critical concentration for protein phase separation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99782">Unanticipated mechanisms of covalent inhibitor and synthetic ligand cobinding to PPARγ</a></h4>

              
                Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that regulates gene expression programs in response to ligand binding. Endogenous and synthetic ligands, including covalent antagonist inhibitors GW9662 and T0070907, are thought to compete for the orthosteric pocket in the ligand-binding domain (LBD). However, we previously showed that synthetic PPARγ ligands can cooperatively cobind with and reposition a bound endogenous orthosteric ligand to an alternate site, synergistically regulating PPARγ structure and function (Shang et al., 2018). Here, we reveal the structural mechanism of cobinding between a synthetic covalent antagonist inhibitor with other synthetic ligands. Biochemical and NMR data show that covalent inhibitors weaken—but do not prevent—the binding of other ligands via an allosteric mechanism, rather than direct ligand clashing, by shifting the LBD ensemble toward a transcriptionally repressive conformation, which structurally clashes with orthosteric ligand binding. Crystal structures reveal different cobinding mechanisms including alternate site binding to unexpectedly adopting an orthosteric binding mode by altering the covalent inhibitor binding pose. Our findings highlight the significant flexibility of the PPARγ orthosteric pocket, its ability to accommodate multiple ligands, and demonstrate that GW9662 and T0070907 should not be used as chemical tools to inhibit ligand binding to PPARγ.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91722">Brain state and cortical layer-specific mechanisms underlying perception at threshold</a></h4>

              
                Identical stimuli can be perceived or go unnoticed across successive presentations, producing divergent behavioral outcomes despite similarities in sensory input. We sought to understand how fluctuations in behavioral state and cortical layer and cell class-specific neural activity underlie this perceptual variability. We analyzed physiological measurements of state and laminar electrophysiological activity in visual area V4 while monkeys were rewarded for correctly reporting a stimulus change at perceptual threshold. Hit trials were characterized by a behavioral state with heightened arousal, greater eye position stability, and enhanced decoding performance of stimulus identity from neural activity. Target stimuli evoked stronger responses in V4 in hit trials, and excitatory neurons in the superficial layers, the primary feed-forward output of the cortical column, exhibited lower variability. Feed-forward interlaminar population correlations were stronger on hits. Hit trials were further characterized by greater synchrony between the output layers of the cortex during spontaneous activity, while the stimulus-evoked period showed elevated synchrony in the feed-forward pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that a state of elevated arousal and stable retinal images allow enhanced processing of sensory stimuli, which contributes to hits at perceptual threshold.

">Simultaneous loss of CAMK2A and CAMK2B reveals endogenous in vivo substrates</a></h4>

              
                Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CAMK2) plays a critical role in calcium signaling. Recent gene knockout studies show that CAMK2A and CAMK2B can have distinct roles yet also partially compensate for each other in yet unknown brain functions. In order to provide insight into potential novel CAMK2 functions, we performed parallel phosphoproteomic analyses on non-stimulated cortex tissue from inducible Camk2a and Camk2b double knockout (Camk2af/f;Camk2bf/f;CAG-CreESR) mice and from wild type mice. A total of 5622 phosphorylated peptides derived from 2080 proteins were identified. Phosphorylation at serine/threonine residues in 130 proteins were downregulated in the double knockout mice, including residues in 113 proteins that have not previously been identified as potential CAMK2 substrates. Comparison of amino acid sequences surrounding the downregulated phosphorylation residues provided new insights into the CAMK2-substrate consensus sequences in vivo. This dataset provides an important resource for future studies examining novel roles for CAMK2 in the brain.

">Enhancing information extraction from field potentials in electrophysiology studies</a></h4>

              
                Multi-channel recordings from the brain serve as the primary approach to address various mechanistic and behavioral questions about neural activity and the underlying circuitry. While electrodes can detect neural activity at a distance from their source generators, activity from other concurrently active neural sources is also volume conducted to the electrodes, thus creating linear dependencies among the channels. These dependencies pose challenges in discerning specific communication patterns between different neuronal populations, and their behavioral implications. In this study, we demonstrate the capability of a marked point process (MPP) representation of channel activity, focusing on oscillatory bursts, to curtail the effects of volume conduction noise. By characterizing the localized spectral information within oscillatory bursts, we achieved a 45% average reduction in channel correlations across three recording modalities of field potentials (electroencephalography, electrocorticography, and local field potentials). We further provide evidence that the implemented sparse representation preserves both behavioral and causal information in the signal. We illustrate our findings with two examples: 1) retention of finger-level movement information in field potentials recorded from humans, demonstrated using a simple online classifier, and 2) retention of top-down connectivity information between the prefrontal and motor cortices of behaving rats. Overall, our results underscore the novelty of using a marked point process representation of oscillatory bursts to concisely encode behavioral and connectivity information while attenuating the effects of volume conduction from the causal signal sources.

">Mapping of dI3 neuron sensorimotor circuits across the cervical and lumbar spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                From the fine control of hand movements to the dynamic corrective adjustments during locomotion, spinal circuits integrate descending supraspinal and sensory inputs to modulate diverse motor functions. The integration of such a wide range of signals across the spinal cord is primarily mediated by propriospinal interneurons. In this study, we investigate the connectivity of a population of propriospinal interneurons marked by the expression of Isl1, called dI3 neurons. These dI3s integrate supraspinal and sensory signals to facilitate many important functions, such as hand grasp, locomotion, and motor recovery after spinal cord injury; however, we have a limited understanding of how subpopulations of dI3s modulate network activity across the spinal cord to contribute to these behaviors. Their functional connectivity to motor circuits across the cervical and lumbar spinal cord was assessed through optogenetic activation of dI3s localized in different spinal segments. Our data demonstrates that cervical and lumbar dI3 subpopulations can form local, commissural, intersegmental, and long propriospinal pathways. Furthermore, dI3 subpopulations can be tonically stimulated to elicit locomotor activity. These extensive projection patterns of dI3s across the cervical and lumbar spinal cord suggest that dI3 subpopulations can modulate the activity of multiple motor networks within their respective spinal cord segments or across distant forelimb and hindlimb segments to facilitate a wide variety of motor functions.

">Inhibition of Notch Signaling Attenuates Epileptic Discharges in the Adolescent Rat Brain after Status Epilepticus Induction</a></h4>

              
                Background Notch signaling plays a critical role in neuroregeneration after injuries such as those caused by status epilepticus (SE). Objective To explore the effects of Notch signaling on epileptogenesis and the underlying mechanisms in adolescent rat brains in the acute phase after SE induction. Methods N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), which indirectly inhibits Notch, was injected into rats during the acute phase after SE induction to inhibit Notch signaling. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to observe spontaneous recurrent seizures. Differences in the synaptic structures of the hippocampus were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Nissl staining and Timm staining were used to observe the loss of hippocampal neurons and sprouting of mossy fibers, respectively, in the hippocampus at 28 days after SE. Results EEG illustrated that DAPT treatment reduced the severity of epileptic discharges after SE induction. Transmission electron microscopy revealed reductions in the presynaptic membrane active band length and postsynaptic membrane dense matter thickness in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Meanwhile, Nissl staining demonstrated that DAPT treatment reduced the loss of hippocampal neuronal cell degeneration, and the hippocampal structure was repaired to a certain extent. Meanwhile, Timm staining illustrated that DAPT treatment did not affect mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) after SE induction. Conclusion Inhibiting Notch signaling reduced EEG epileptic activity, attenuated synaptic damage, and partially restored the hippocampal neuronal structure. However, it did not alter MFS after SE induction.

">Predicting whole-brain neural dynamics from prefrontal cortex fNIRS signal during movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers a portable, cost-effective alternative to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for non-invasively measuring neural activity. However, fNIRS measurements are limited to cortical regions near the scalp, missing important medial and deeper brain areas. We introduce a predictive model that maps prefrontal fNIRS signals to whole-brain fMRI activity during movie-watching. By aligning neural responses to a common audiovisual stimulus, our approach leverages shared dynamics across imaging modalities to map fNIRS signals to broader neural activity patterns. We scanned participants with fNIRS and utilized a publicly available fMRI dataset of participants watching the same TV episode. The model was trained on the first half of the episode and tested on a held-out participant watching the second half to assess cross-individual and cross-stimulus generalizability. The model significantly predicted fMRI time courses in 66 out of 122 brain regions, including in areas otherwise inaccessible to fNIRS. The predicted fMRI time course also replicated intersubject functional connectivity patterns and retained semantic information about the movie content. Our publicly available model enables researchers to infer broader neural dynamics from localized fNIRS data, offering new opportunities for studying the neural basis of complex cognitive processes during naturalistic tasks.

">Nonlinear brain connectivity from neurons to networks: quantification, sources and localization.</a></h4>

              
                Since the first studies in functional connectivity, Pearson's correlation has been the primary tool to determine relatedness between the activity of different brain locations. Over the years, concern over the information neglected by correlation pushed toward using different measures accounting for non-linearity. However, some studies suggest that, at the typical observation scale, a linear description of the brain captures a vast majority of the information. Therefore, we measured the fraction of information that would be lost using a linear description and which regions would be affected the most. We considered fMRI, EEG, iEEG, and single unit spikes to assess how the observation scale impacts the amount of non-linearity. We observe that the information loss is reduced for modalities with large temporal or spatial averaging (fMRI and EEG) and gains relevance on more fine descriptions of the activity (iEEG and single unit spikes). We conclude that for most human applications, Pearson's correlation coefficient adequately describes pairwise interactions in time series from current recording techniques.

">Haploinsufficiency of lysosomal enzyme genes in Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                There is growing evidence suggesting that the lysosome or lysosome dysfunction is associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). Pathway analysis of post mortem brain-derived proteomic data from AD patients shows that the lysosomal system is perturbed relative to similarly aged unaffected controls. However, it is unclear if these changes contributed to the pathogenesis or are a response to the disease. Consistent with the hypothesis that lysosome dysfunction contributes to AD pathogenesis, whole genome sequencing data indicate that heterozygous pathogenic mutations and predicted protein-damaging variants in multiple lysosomal enzyme genes are enriched in AD patients compared to matched controls. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1), alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), {beta}-glucuronidase (GUSB), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), and galactocerebrosidase (GALC) genes have a gene-dosage effect on Abeta40 levels in brain interstitial fluid in C57BL/6 mice and significantly increase Abeta plaque formation in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, thus providing in vivo validation of the human genetic data. A more detailed analysis of PPT1 heterozygosity in 18-month-old mice revealed changes in alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases that favor an amyloidogenic pathway. Proteomic changes in brain tissue from aged PPT1 heterozygous sheep are consistent with both the mouse data and the potential activation of AD pathways. Finally, CNS-directed, AAV-mediated gene therapy significantly decreased Abeta plaques, increased life span, and improved behavioral performance in 5xFAD/PPT1+/- mice. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that heterozygosity of multiple lysosomal enzyme genes represent risk factors for AD and may identify precise therapeutic targets for a subset of genetically-defined AD patients.

">Representational learning by optimization of neural manifolds in an olfactory memory network</a></h4>

              
                Higher brain functions depend on experience-dependent representations of relevant information that may be organized by attractor dynamics or by geometrical modifications of continuous "neural manifolds". To explore these scenarios we analyzed odor-evoked activity in telencephalic area pDp of juvenile and adult zebrafish, the homolog of piriform cortex. No obvious signatures of attractor dynamics were detected. Rather, olfactory discrimination training selectively enhanced the separation of neural manifolds representing task-relevant odors from other representations, consistent with predictions of autoassociative network models endowed with precise synaptic balance. Analytical approaches using the framework of manifold capacity revealed multiple geometrical modifications of representational manifolds that supported the classification of task-relevant sensory information. Manifold capacity predicted odor discrimination across individuals, indicating a close link between manifold geometry and behavior. Hence, pDp and possibly related recurrent networks store information in the geometry of representational manifolds, resulting in joint sensory and semantic maps that may support distributed learning processes.

                Prior expectations guide attention and support perceptual filtering for efficient processing during decision-making. Here we show that during a visual discrimination task, mice adaptively use prior stimulus history to guide ongoing choices by estimating differences in evidence between consecutive trials (| Delta Dir |). The thalamic lateral posterior (LP)/pulvinar nucleus provides robust inputs to the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), which has been implicated in selective attention and predictive processing, but the function of the LP-ACC projection is unknown. We found that optogenetic manipulations of LP-ACC axons disrupted animals' ability to effectively estimate and use information across stimulus history, leading to | Delta Dir |-dependent ipsilateral biases. Two-photon calcium imaging of LP-ACC axons revealed an engagement-dependent low-dimensional organization of stimuli along a curved manifold. This representation was scaled by | Delta Dir | in a manner that emphasized greater deviations from prior evidence. Thus, our work identifies the LP-ACC pathway as essential for selecting and evaluating stimuli relative to prior evidence to guide decisions.

                The hippocampus has been associated with spatial information processing (OKeefe, 1976). However, it is also not clear whether such ensemble coding of spatial information extends to other brain regions in the medial temporal lobe. Hence, this study uses various classification techniques to attempt to decode spatial and valence information utilizing publicly available rodent single-unit data (Girardeau et al., 2017). We found that the spatial information is encoded sparsely and distributed among many neurons in the hippocampus. Additionally we found that both spatial and valence information could be decoded in the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the piriform cortex. We also compared the strengths and weaknesses of four different classifiers (LDA, KNN, SVM, NB) theoretically and in practice with this dataset.

">Criterial Learning and Feedback Delay: Insights from Computational Models and Behavioral Experiments</a></h4>

              
                The notion of a response criterion is ubiquitous in psychology, yet its cognitive and neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. To address this shortcoming, three computational models that capture different hypotheses about criterial learning were developed and tested. The time-dependent drift model assumes the criterion is stored in working memory and that its value drifts over time. The delay-sensitive learning model assumes that the magnitude of criterial learning is temporally discounted by feedback delay. The reinforcement-learning model assumes that criterial learning emerges from stimulus-response association learning without an explicit representation of the criterion, with learning rate also temporally discounted by feedback delay. The performance of these models was investigated under varying feedback delay and intertrial interval (ITI) durations. The time-dependent drift model predicted that long ITIs and feedback delays both impair criterial learning. In contrast, the delay-sensitive and reinforcement-learning models predicted impairments only with feedback delays. Two behavioral experiments, which tested these predictions, showed that human criterial learning is impaired by delayed feedback but not by long ITIs. These results support the delay-sensitive and reinforcement-learning models, and suggest that even in tasks that appear to rely on explicit, rule-based reasoning, criterial learning may have strong associative underpinnings.

">Grid to Place Cell Connectivity in Eleven Different Rooms</a></h4>

              
                To understand the grid to place cell connectivity, we took place cell firing data from Moser lab. In MATLAB, we created grid cell firing patterns. Connection weights between the two were learned with backpropagation algorithm. The smaller place fields could be learned from grid cells with single spatial firing frequency. But bigger, multiple and irregular place fields could only be learned from grid cells with multiple spatial firing frequencies. Weights learned were normally distributed with a wider spread and multimodal distribution for rooms with uneven, larger or multiple firing fields. We conclude that each place cell is connected to single modules of grid cells with similar spatial firing frequency. Place cells connected to multi-frequency grid cells are fewer. Our results also show that grid cells resolve the space into spatial distance, orientation, and phase offset. Unique firing patterns of the place cells codify each room with this information.

">Time affects a time-consuming, flexible component and a fast, inflexible component of sensorimotor adaptation.</a></h4>

              
                Prior learning can impair future learning when the requirements of the two memories conflict, in a phenomenon termed anterograde interference. In sensorimotor adaptation, the passage of time between initial and future learning can reduce such interference effects. However, we still do not fully understand how time affects learning, as some studies found no effect of time on interference. One possible explanation is that time affects distinct processes underpinning sensorimotor adaptation, and these processes may compensate for each others' effects on behaviour. Here, we used task manipulations that (1) dissociated adaptation processes driven by task errors from adaptation processes driven by sensory prediction errors, and (2) separated the task-error driven adaptation processes into a flexible component that could not be acquired under time-pressure, and a less-flexible component that could be acquired under time-pressure. The passage of time between initial and subsequent learning seemed to alter both the flexible and inflexible components of adaptation driven by task errors. Time also led to a small reduction of interference arising from sensory prediction errors. Thus, we provide evidence that multiple components of sensorimotor adaptation are sensitive to the passage of time.

">Comparing neurocognitive mechanisms of mathematical ability and fluency in children: insights from an fNIRS study</a></h4>

              
                Background Early proficiency in mathematics is a strong predictor of later academic success and life achievement, considering the practical skills that mastering the subject enables students to equip. Yet, there exists a paucity of research into the neural mechanisms supporting mathematical abilities in young children. Recent research utilises resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), a measure of the coherence of brain activity among brain regions in the absence of tasks, to understand the functional roles of these regions. Methods We analysed the RSFC of 45 children to investigate the intrinsic cognitive processes underpinning arithmetic processing in three regions of interest (ROIs): middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and precuneus. Correlations between RSFC among these regions and mathematics or math fluency scores, derived from the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT-III), were examined. Results RSFC between the right precuneus and both the ipsilateral middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal region may be associated with arithmetic processing speed and accuracy, while cross-hemispheric RSFC between the right precuneus and the left inferior parietal lobule appears to be associated with problem-solving and numeracy skills. RSFC between the right precuneus and left inferior parietal lobule differed in children performing below the 10th percentile in mathematics (out of 45 participants). Conclusions The results suggest that children of the same age may follow different neural development trajectories. More targeted and differentiated interventions are essential to offer additional and early support for students struggling with mathematics.

">Top-Down Effects on Translucency Perception in Relation to Shape Cues</a></h4>

              
                It is well established that object shape perception significantly influences the perception of translucency. However, how object shape cues such as motion and binocular disparity affect the perception of translucency in rich environments, like virtual reality or real visual environments, remains unclear. This study aims to psychophysically measure the extent to which multiple object shape cues influence the perception of translucency. Additionally, we examined whether top-down factors, such as changes in cognitive attitude caused by the sequence of experiments, affect translucency perception. The results revealed that while motion and binocular disparity enhance translucency perception, this effect is confined to situations where shape cues are poor. Moreover, the effect became particularly pronounced when the experiments began with weak specular reflection stimuli, followed by the experiments using stimuli with specular reflection. In the case of translucent objects without specular reflection, strong shape information cannot be derived solely from shading patterns. These findings thus suggest that top-down factors related to shape modulate the influence of shape cues on translucency perception.

	<p>Background: The aim of the present study was to analyse the association between neuroticism (one of the Big Five personality traits) and the most common secondary sensorimotor complications occurring in patients after spinal cord injury (SCI), i.e., muscle spasticity (hypertonia) and pain, and to investigate the associations between neuroticism and the effects of conventional rehabilitation (dynamic parapodium) and those using robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) in this group of patients. In addition, the association of neuroticism with self-efficacy, personal beliefs about pain control, and adopted coping strategies among SCI patients was analysed. These data can be used as a reference for designing effective forms of therapy and support dedicated to this group of patients. Methods and procedures: Quantitative analysis included 110 patients after SCI. The participants were divided by simple randomisation into a rehabilitation group with RAGT and a rehabilitation group with dynamic parapodium therapy (DPT). The following survey instruments were used for data collection: Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R); Ashworth Scale; the Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM III); the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI-II); the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS); the Pain Coping Strategies Questionnaire&amp;amp;mdash;CSQ; and the Beliefs about Pain Control Questionnaire&amp;amp;mdash;BPCQ. Outcomes and results: analyses showed a positive association between neuroticism and spastic tension (rho = 0.39; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions and implications: the study showed that a high level of neuroticism correlates with a higher level of spasticity, but no such correlation was observed for pain. Additionally, the study did not show a significant correlation between neuroticism and rehabilitation outcome depending on the rehabilitation modality (RAGT vs. DPT). The results underline the importance of carrying out a psychological diagnosis of patients to provide therapeutic support in the rehabilitation process.</p>

">Glutamate receptor-dependent cytosolic acidification in hippocampal neurons involves passive flux of protons from the extracellular space</a></h4>

              
                Glutamate receptor-dependent cytosolic acidification can be induced in hippocampal neurons by pharmacological or seizure-like stimulation. This acidification is thought to arise from Ca2+ and metabolism-related processes, however, the exact underlying mechanism as well as its functional role remains uncertain. To reassess the mechanism of cytosolic acidification in excitatory hippocampal neurons and address the physiological relevance of the phenomenon, we combined pH/Ca2+ biosensors to study activity-induced pH dynamics in hippocampal neurons. First, we addressed cytosolic acidification in relation to LTP at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. Using hippocampal slices from adult rats of both sexes, we show that LTP-inducing stimulation at the Schaffer collaterals evokes transient cytosolic acidification in hippocampal CA1 neurons. This highlights neuronal pH shifts as a trait of general hippocampal neurotransmission rather than a marker of excitotoxicity, possibly serving as a secondary messenger. Moreover, using dissociated hippocampal neurons from rat embryos, we show that glutamate receptor agonists typically induce larger cytosolic acid shifts compared to simple depolarization or spontaneous activity, suggesting that glutamate receptor-mediated acidification involves several separate mechanisms; pyruvate-dependent dampening of neuronal acidification may reflect a direct inhibition of NMDA receptors rather than reduced glycolytic activity, questioning the previously reported involvement of metabolism in cytosolic acidification; and whereas acid shifts induced by simple depolarization show exclusive dependence on cytosolic Ca2+, AMPA-induced acidification depends both on cytosolic Ca2+ and on an inward electrochemical driving force for protons. These results suggest that glutamate receptor-induced cytosolic acidification relies both on cytosolic Ca2+ and on a passive proton influx, possibly mediated by the receptor itself.

">Biophysical network modeling of temporal and stereotyped sequence propagation of neural activity in the premotor nucleus HVC</a></h4>

              
                Stereotyped neural sequences are often exhibited in the brain, yet the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. Birdsong is a prominent model to study such behavior particularly because juvenile songbirds progressively learn from their tutors and by adulthood are able to sing stereotyped song patterns. The songbird premotor nucleus HVC coordinate motor and auditory activity responsible for learned vocalizations. The HVC comprises three neural populations that has distinct in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological responses. Typically, models that explain HVCs network either rely on intrinsic HVC circuitry to propagate sequential activity, rely on extrinsic feedback to advance the sequence or rely on both. Here, we developed a physiologically realistic neural network model incorporating the three classes of HVC neurons based on the ion channels and the synaptic currents that had been pharmacologically identified. Our model is based on a feedforward chain of microcircuits that encode for the different sub-syllabic segments (SSSs) and that interact with each other through structured feedback inhibition. The network reproduced the in vivo activity patterns of each class of HVC neurons, and unveiled key intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms that govern the sequential propagation of neural activity by highlighting important roles for the T-type Ca2+ current, Ca2+-dependent K+ current, A-type K+ current, hyperpolarization activated inward current, as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. The result is a biophysically realistic model that suggests an improved characterization of the HVC network responsible for song production in the songbird.

">Individual brain activity patterns during task are predicted by distinct resting-state networks that may reflect local neurobiological features</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how individual cortical features shape functional brain organization offers a promising framework for examining the principles of cognitive specialization in the human brain. This study explores the relationship between various cortical characteristics--i.e resting-state functional connectivity, structural connectivity, microstructure, morphology, and geometry--and the layout of task-specific functional activations. We employ linear models to predict the functional layout of the cortex at the individual level from each of these feature modalities. Our findings demonstrate that resting-state component loadings predict individual task activations, consistently across hemispheres and independent datasets. Whereas the first few components provide a common space for functional activations across tasks, predictive higher-order component loadings demonstrated task-specificity. Cortical microstructure/morphology was notably predictive of activation strength in the occipital cortex, highlighting its relevance for cortical functional specialization. By relating resting state components to a set of reference maps of cortical organization, we identify associations that suggest possible neurobiological underpinnings of specific cognitive functions. The remaining feature modalities were only predictive of group-level functional activations. These results advance our understanding of how distinct cortical features may contribute to functional specialization, guiding future inquiry into the organization of cognitive functions on the cortex.

">Regulation of Fentanyl Reward in Male and Female Mice by the Circadian Transcription Factor NPAS2</a></h4>

              
                Synthetic opioids like fentanyl are highly potent and prevalent in the illicit drug market, leading to tolerance, dependence, and opioid use disorder (OUD). Chronic opioid use disrupts sleep and circadian rhythms, which persist even during treatment and abstinence, increasing the risk of relapse. The body's molecular clock, regulated by transcriptional and translational feedback loops, controls various physiological processes, including the expression of endogenous opioids and their receptors. The circadian transcription factor NPAS2, highly expressed in the nucleus accumbens, may have a crucial function in opioid-related behaviors. Our study found sex-specific roles for NPAS2-mediated reward behaviors in male and female mice, including in fentanyl seeking and craving. We also identified specific cell types and transcriptional targets in the nucleus accumbens of both mice and humans by which NPAS2 may mediate the impact of fentanyl on brain physiology and in opioid reward-related behaviors. Ultimately, our findings begin to uncover the mechanisms underlying circadian rhythm dysfunction and opioid addiction.

">Visual training induced occipital fast sleep spindle clustering in humans revealed by full-night HD-EEG recordings</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the impact of extensive visual procedural training on the temporal organisation of sleep spindles in healthy young adults. We selected 39 participants aged 16-20 and employed high-density electroencephalography to assess spindle characteristics during two full nights of sleep, with daytime practising in a contour integration task in between the two nights. We utilised linear mixed models to comprehensively analyse the effects of age and training on basic, clustering- and rhythmicity-related spindle parameters. Our findings indicate no significant age effects in this age-range, and no significant change between the two nights with respect to slow spindles. Fast spindles demonstrated a significant increase in density after training, and we observed significant changes in spindle clustering and rhythmicity parameters as well. Local spindle density, train density, and the ratio of clustered spindles have increased, and inter-train interval decreased by the second night. These results contribute to the growing literature on sleep-dependent memory consolidation by demonstrating that spindle reorganisation occurs not only in motor tasks but also in visual learning contexts. The absence of age-related differences further highlights the robustness of these mechanisms across developmental stages. Our study emphasises the importance of spindle dynamics in procedural learning and suggests promising possibilities for future research into the neurophysiological basis of memory consolidation. By revealing the relationship between training and sleep spindle characteristics, our findings provide valuable insights into how sleep supports learning and memory processes in young adults, potentially informing interventions aimed at enhancing memory performance through sleep-related strategies.

">Comparative fMRI reveals differences in the functional organization of the visual cortex for animacy perception in dogs and humans</a></h4>

              
                The animate-inanimate category distinction is one of the general organizing principles in the primate high-level visual cortex. Much less is known about the visual cortical representations of animacy in non-primate mammals with a different evolutionary trajectory of visual capacities. To compare the functional organization underlying animacy perception of a non-primate to a primate species, here we performed an fMRI study in dogs and humans, investigating how animacy structures neural responses in the visual cortex of the two species. Univariate analyses identified animate-sensitive bilateral occipital and temporal regions, non-overlapping with early visual areas, in both species. Multivariate tests confirmed the categorical representations of animate stimuli in these regions. Regions sensitive to different animate stimulus classes (dog, human, cat) overlapped less in dog than in human brains. Together, these findings reveal that the importance of animate-inanimate distinction is reflected in the organization of higher-level visual cortex, also beyond primates. But a key species difference, that neural representations for animate stimuli are less concentrated in dogs than in humans suggests that certain underlying organizing principles that support the visual perception of animacy in primates may not play a similarly important role in other mammals.

">Cerebellar white matter development is regulated by fractalkine-dependent microglia phagocytosis of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                Complex neurodevelopmental disorders involve motor as well as cognitive dysfunction and these impairments are associated with both cerebral and cerebellar maturity. A network of connections between these two brain regions is proposed to underlie neurodevelopmental impairments. The cerebellar gray matter has a protracted developmental timeline compared to the cerebral cortex, however, making the association of these relay pathways unclear for neurodevelopmental disabilities. We show that a population of amoeboid microglia infiltrate the cerebellar white matter through the fourth ventricular zone during early postnatal development. This infiltration is synchronized with the emergence of amoeboid microglia in the ventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and appearance in cerebral white matter. Amoeboid microglia phagocytosed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the cerebellar white matter during a restricted early postnatal time window before transitioning to a ramified morphology. Modulating fractalkine receptor signaling, shown to be involved in microglial pruning of synapses, significantly reduced microglial engulfment of OPCs resulting in increased numbers of OLs and altered myelin formation. Variants in the fractalkine receptor are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia and autism where myelin perturbations have been documented. Overall, these data support that white matter refinement by amoeboid microglia is coordinated in both cerebral and cerebellar development with important implications for altered circuit function in neurodevelopmental disabilities.

">Neural correlates of unconscious and conscious visual processing</a></h4>

              
                Postdictive effects, where later events influence the perception of earlier ones, suggest that conscious perception is not a continuous stream but occurs at discrete moments, preceded by extended periods of unconscious processing. This is evident in the Sequential Metacontrast Paradigm (SQM), where a stream of lines and vernier offsets is unconsciously integrated over several hundred milliseconds before conscious perception emerges: regardless of whether one or multiple verniers are shown, only a single offset is perceived from the first to the last line. Postdictive phenomena offer a unique opportunity to study the neural correlates of unconscious and conscious stages of perception because unconscious and conscious processing are well separated in time. Using EEG recordings during the SQM, we identified two distinct stages of neural activity. Early occipital EEG activity patterns (~200 ms after the initial vernier presentation) capture unconscious processing, while later centro-parietal EEG patterns (~400-600 ms after the onset of the stimulus stream) are associated with conscious perception, aligning closely with behavioral reports. We propose that the transition between these distinct neural topographies reflects the discrete moments when conscious perception emerges.

">Upregulating ANKHD1 in PS19 mice reduces Tau phosphorylation and mitigates Tau-toxicity-induced cognitive deficits</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal accumulation of Tau protein in the brain disrupts normal cellular function and leads to neuronal death linked with many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. An attractive approach to mitigate Tau-induced neurodegeneration is to enhance the clearance of toxic Tau aggregates. We previously showed that upregulation of the fly gene mask protects against FUS- and Tau-induced photoreceptor degeneration in fly disease models. Here we have generated a transgenic mouse line carrying Cre-inducible ANKHD1, the mouse homolog of mask, to determine whether the protective role of mask is conserved from flies to mammals. Utilizing the TauP301S-PS19 mouse model for Tau-related dementia, we observed that ANKHD1 significantly reduced hyperphosphorylated human Tau in 6-month-old mice. Additionally, there was a notable trend towards reduced gliosis levels in these mice, suggesting a protective role of ANKHD1 against TauP301S-linked degeneration. Further analysis of 9-month-old mice revealed a similar trend of effects. Moreover, we found that ANKHD1 also suppresses the cognitive defect of 9-month-old PS19 female mice in novel object recognition (NOR) behavioral assay. Unlike previous therapeutic strategies that primarily focus on inhibiting Tau phosphorylation or directly clearing aggregates, this study highlights the novel role of ANKHD1 in promoting autophagy as a means to mitigate Tau pathology. This novel mechanism not only underscores ANKHD1's potential as a unique therapeutic target for tauopathies but also provides new insights into autophagy-based interventions for neurodegenerative diseases.

">Heat Shock Factor 1 Governs Sleep-Wake Cycles Across Species</a></h4>

              
                Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) is a critical transcription factor for cellular proteostasis, but its role in sleep regulation remains unexplored. We demonstrate that nuclear HSF1 levels in the mouse brain fluctuate with sleep-wake cycles, increasing during extended wakefulness and decreasing during sleep. Using CUT&RUN and RNA-seq, we identified HSF1-regulated transcriptional changes involved in synaptic organization, expanding its known functions beyond traditional heat shock responses. Both systemic and brain-specific Hsf1 knockout mice exhibit altered sleep homeostasis, including increased delta power after sleep deprivation and upregulation of sleep-related genes. However, these knockouts struggle to maintain sleep due to disrupted synaptic organization. In Drosophila, knockout of HSF1's ortholog results in fragmented sleep patterns, suggesting a conserved role for HSF1 in sleep regulation across species. Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying sleep regulation and offer potential therapeutic targets for sleep disturbances.

">Right posterior theta reflects human parahippocampal phase resetting by salient cues during goal-directed navigation</a></h4>

              
                Animal and computational work indicate that phase resetting of theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) by salient events (e.g., reward, landmarks) facilitates the encoding of goal-oriented information during navigation. Although well-studied in animals, this mechanism has not been empirically substantiated in humans. In the present article, we present data from two studies (Study 1: asynchronous EEG-MEG | Study 2: simultaneous EEG-fMRI) to investigate theta phase resetting and its relationship to PHG BOLD activation in healthy adults (aged 18-34 years old) navigating a virtual T-maze to find rewards. In the first experiment, both EEG and MEG data revealed a burst of theta power over right-posterior scalp locations following feedback onset (termed right-posterior theta, RPT), and RPT power and measures of phase resetting were sensitive to the subject's spatial trajectory. In Experiment 2, we used probabilistic tractography data from the human connectome project to segment the anterior and posterior PHG based on differential connectivity profiles to other brain regions. This analysis resulted in a PHG subdivision consisting of four distinct anterior and two posterior PHG clusters. Next, a series of linear mixed effects models based on simultaneous EEG-fMRI data revealed that single-trial RPT peak power significantly predicted single-trial hemodynamic responses in two clusters within the posterior PHG and one in the anterior PHG. This coupling between RPT power and PHG BOLD was exclusive to trials performed during maze navigation, and not during a similar task devoid of the spatial context of the maze. These findings highlight a role of PHG theta phase resetting for the purpose of encoding salient information during goal-directed spatial navigation. Taken together, RPT during virtual navigation integrates experimental, computational, and theoretical research of PHG function in animals with human cognitive electrophysiology studies and clinical research on memory-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

">Combining NeuroPainting with transcriptomics reveals cell-type-specific morphological and molecular signatures of the 22q11.2 deletion</a></h4>

              
                Neuropsychiatric conditions pose substantial challenges for therapeutic development due to their complex and poorly understood underlying mechanisms. High-throughput, unbiased phenotypic assays present a promising path for advancing therapeutic discovery, especially within disease-relevant neural tissues. Here, we introduce NeuroPainting, a novel adaptation of the Cell Painting assay, optimized for high-dimensional morphological phenotyping of neural cell types, including neurons, neuronal progenitor cells, and astrocytes derived from human stem cells. Using NeuroPainting, we quantified cell structure and organelle behavior across various brain cell types, creating a public dataset of over 4,000 cellular traits. This extensive dataset not only sets a new benchmark for phenotypic screening in neuropsychiatric research but also serves as a gold standard for the research community, enabling comparisons and validation of results. We then applied NeuroPainting to identify morphological signatures associated with the 22q11.2 deletion, a major genetic risk factor for schizophrenia. We observed profound cell-type-specific effects of the 22q11.2 deletion, with significant alterations in mitochondrial structure, endoplasmic reticulum organization, and cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly in astrocytes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reduced expression of cell adhesion genes in 22q11.2 deletion astrocytes, consistent with recent post-mortem findings. Integrating the RNA sequencing data and morphological profiles uncovered a novel biological link between altered expression of specific cell adhesion molecules and observed changes in mitochondrial morphology in 22q11.2 deletion astrocytes. These findings underscore the power of combined phenomic and transcriptomic analyses to reveal mechanistic insights associated with human genetic variants of neuropsychiatric conditions.

">ASAP: An automatic sustained attention prediction method for infants and toddlers using wearable device signals</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention (SA) is a critical cognitive ability that emerges in infancy. The recent development of wearable technology for infants enables the collection of large-scale multimodal data in the natural environment, including physiological signals. To capitalize on these new technologies, psychologists need methods to efficiently extract valid and robust SA measures from large datasets. In this study, we present an innovative automatic sustained attention prediction (ASAP) method that harnesses electrocardiogram (ECG) and accelerometer (Acc) signals recorded with wearable sensors from 75 infants (6-, 9-, 12-, 24- and 36-months). Infants undertook various naturalistic tasks similar to those encountered in their natural environment, including free play with their caregivers. Annotated SA was validated by fixation signals from eye-tracking. ASAP was trained on temporal and spectral features derived from the ECG and Acc signals to detect attention periods, and tested against human-coded SA. ASAP's performance is similar across all age groups, demonstrating its suitability for studying development. We also investigated the relationship between attention periods and low-level perceptual features (visual saliency, visual clutter) extracted from the egocentric videos recorded during caregiver-infant free play. Saliency increased during attention vs inattention periods and decreased with age for attention (but not inattention) periods. Crucially, there was no observable difference in results from ASAP attention detection relative to the human-coded attention. Our results demonstrate that ASAP is a powerful tool for detecting infant SA elicited in natural environments. Alongside the available wearable sensors, ASAP provides unprecedented opportunities for studying infant development in the "wild".

">Whole-brain causal connectivity during decoded neurofeedback: a meta study</a></h4>

              
                Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) represents a pioneering approach in human neuroscience that enables modulation of brain activity patterns without subjective conscious awareness through the combination of real-time fMRI with multivariate pattern analysis. While this technique holds significant potential for clinical and cognitive applications, the causal mechanisms underlying successful DecNef regulation and the neural dynamics that distinguish successful learners from those who struggle remain poorly understood. To address this question, we conducted a meta-study across functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from five DecNef experiments, each with multiple fMRI sessions, to reveal causal network dynamics associated with individual differences in neurofeedback performance. Using the newly proposed CaLLTiF causal discovery method, we computed causal maps to identify causal network patterns that distinguish DecNef regulation from baseline and account for variations in neurofeedback success. We found that enhanced connectivity within the bilateral control network--particularly stronger connections involving the posterior cingulate and precuneus cortex--predicted neurofeedback success across all five studies. Whole-brain causal connectivity during DecNef further exhibited distinct network reorganizations, characterized by reduced average path lengths and increased right-limbic nodal degrees. Further, comparisons across cognition- and perception-targeted DecNef revealed a remarkable separation in connections to and from the somatomotor network, where connections between somatomotor and control-default-attention networks are larger during cognitive neurofeedback while causal effects between somatomotor and subcortical-visual-limbic networks are larger during perceptive DecNef. This is despite the fact that none of the involved studies targeted or involved motor activity. Overall, our results demonstrated the key role of bilateral medial control network in successful DecNef regulation regardless of the DecNef targets, a clear separation in somatomotor involvement between cognitive and perceptive DecNef, and general promise of whole-brain causal discovery in understanding complex neural processes such as decoded neurofeedback.

">Clock genes period and timeless control synaptogenesis in Drosophila motor terminals</a></h4>

              
                Some neurons undergo rhythmic morphological changes that persist in constant darkness and require the expression of clock genes. Flight motoneuron MN5, one of the best studied neurons of Drosophila melanogaster exhibits several examples of this type of circadian structural plasticity. During the morning, when the fly is active, synaptic boutons are larger than during the night when the fly is resting though more synaptic boutons and synapses are observed. Here, by comparing bouton numbers at different timepoints in normal flies and in flies carrying loss-of-function mutations in clock genes timeless (tim) or period (per), we investigate whether the rhythmic changes in numbers of boutons and synapses require the expression of these genes. Absence of tim expression abolished the rhythm in bouton number whereas absence of per expression appeared to increase the rhythm's amplitude. This indicates that in normal flies TIM protein is necessary to drive the normal rhythm of bouton number and PER probably has a damping effect on it. In addition, it appears that tim and per expression normally act as inhibitor of synaptogenesis because their loss-of-function mutations caused over-proliferation of synapses. Unexpectedly, TIM and PER were expressed in different cells. TIM was found in the glial sheath wrapping the motoneuron's axon and PER was predominantly found along the axon, suggesting that the control of the rhythmic change in bouton and synapse numbers requires interactions between different cell types.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Previous research has suggested that Western musicians, who generally demonstrate proficiency in reading musical scores, exhibit superior performance in visuospatial working memory tasks compared to non-musicians. Evidence indicates brain activation in regions such as the left inferior parietal lobe and the right posterior fusiform gyrus during music reading, which are associated with visuospatial processing. This study aimed to explore how musical training influences spatial working memory and to examine the relationship between self-assessment accuracy and cognitive performance. Methods: A visuospatial working memory test, the Corsi block-tapping test (CBT), was administered to 70 participants, including 35 musicians with experience in music reading and 35 non-musicians. CBT performances were compared between groups, controlling for sex and age differences using analysis of covariance. Participants were also asked to self-assess their visuospatial capabilities. Results: Musicians performed significantly better than non-musicians in the CBT and demonstrated greater metacognitive accuracy in evaluating their visuospatial memory capacities. A total of 46.34% of musicians who claimed good performance on the CBT did in fact perform well, in comparison with 14.63% of non-musicians. Sex influenced the outcomes of spatial working memory, while age did not significantly affect performance. Conclusions: This self-awareness of visuospatial capabilities reflects a form of metacompetence, encompassing reflective thinking and the ability to assess one&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive skills. Furthermore, while differences in spatial working memory between musicians and non-musicians appear to be related to executive functions associated with general music practice, further investigation is needed to explore other potential influences beyond musical experience.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Dementia involves the loss of cognitive abilities and impairs functional abilities in daily life. In motor imagery (MI) techniques, motor acts are mentally rehearsed without any overt body movements. The purpose of the randomized controlled trial was to examine the effects of MI on the motor function of older adults with dementia. Methods: Overall, 160 participants (43 men, 117 women, MMSE M = 23.20, SD = 0.15) from an Athens Day Care Center of the Alzheimer Association were randomized to (a) the MI and exercise group (experimental group) (n = 55), (b) the only exercise group (1st control group) (n = 52) and (c) the neither MI nor exercise group (2nd control group) (n = 53). The exercise session comprised 24 physiotherapy exercise sessions, lasting 45 min each, twice a week for 12 weeks. The exercises were selected from the Otago Exercise Program. Three assessments were performed: (a) one week prior to the program, (b) at one and a half months and (c) after the program. The experimental group performed a 30-minute MI with exercise program content after the end of every physiotherapy exercise session. The Multidirectional Reach Test, Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST), Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) were used to assess participants&amp;amp;rsquo; balance and functional status. Results: In the intention to treat analysis (18 participants dropped out), the 3 &amp;amp;times; 3 repeated measures ANOVA indicated statistically significant results between the three groups on (a) the TUG (F = 3.06, df (2), p = 0.04), (b) the FTSST (F = 3.00, df (2), p = 0.05), (c) the forward direction test (F = 4.14 df (2), p = 0.02), the lateral right and the lateral left direction tests (F = 3.90, df (2), p = 0.02 and F = 7.87, df (2), p = 0.00, respectively), and (d) the FGA (F = 4.35, df (2), p = 0.01). The Friedman test showed significant statistical significant differences among the three groups for BBS (X2 = 7.62, df = 2, p = 0.22), and an effect size of partial &amp;amp;eta;2 coefficient for F-tests was found. Post hoc comparisons using a Bonferroni test for ANOVA and Wilcoxon test for Friedman indicated that the mean scores for the experimental group and the 1st control were significantly better than the 2rd control group in many dependent variables. Conclusions: The study showed a positive effect of MI on balance and the functional status of older adults with early stages of dementia with possible beneficial effects on maintaining independence and reducing physical decline.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify biochemical changes in individuals at higher risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) via <i>C9orf72</i> hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) heterozygosity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional observational study of 48 asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers, 39 asymptomatic non-carrier controls, 19 people with sporadic ALS, 10 with <i>C9orf72</i> ALS, 14 with sporadic FTD, and 10 with <i>C9orf72</i> FTD. Relative abundance of 30 pre-defined cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of ALS and FTD were compared in asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers and age-matched non-carrier controls. Differential abundance of these proteins was quantified using data independent acquisition mass spectrometry or electro chemiluminescent assay for neurofilament light chain. Unbiased analysis of the entire cerebrospinal fluid proteome was then carried out.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ubiquitin carboxyl-hydrolase isozyme L1 levels were higher in asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers compared with age-matched non-carriers (log<sub>2</sub>fold change 0.20, FDR-adjusted <i>p</i>-value = 0.034), whereas neurofilament light chain levels did not significantly differ. Ubiquitin carboxyl-hydrolase isozyme L1 levels remained elevated after matching of groups by neurofilament levels (<i>p</i> = 0.011), and after adjusting for age, sex, and neurofilament levels. A significant difference was also observed when restricting analysis to younger participants (&lt;37) matched by neurofilament level (<i>p</i> = 0.007).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elevated cerebrospinal fluid ubiquitin carboxyl-hydrolase isozyme L1 levels in <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers can occur in the absence of increased neurofilament levels, potentially reflecting either compensatory or pathogenic mechanisms preceding rapid neuronal loss. This brings forward the window on changes associated with the <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carrier state, with potential to inform understanding of penetrance and approaches to prevention.

<p>Parkinson patients with mild cognitive impairment do not only show established motor (e.g., tremor and rigor) and nonmotor (e.g., depression and global cognitive impairment) symptoms. They also show deficits in some basic numerical functions: (non-) symbolic magnitude comparison and number line estimation In contrast, auditory and written transcoding skills were preserved.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have a huge impact on patients, caregivers, and the health care system. Until now, diagnosis of mild cognitive impairments in PD has been established based on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention, or working memory. However, specific numerical deficits observed in clinical practice have not yet been systematically investigated. PD-immanent deterioration of domain-general functions and domain-specific numerical areas suggests mechanisms of both primary and secondary dyscalculia. The current study systematically investigated basic number processing performance in PD patients for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of numerosity and the influence of domain-general factors. The overall sample consisted of patients with a diagnosis of PD, according to consensus guidelines, and healthy controls. PD patients were stratified into patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) or mild cognitive impairment (level I-PD-MCI based on cognitive screening). Basic number processing was assessed using transcoding, number line estimation, and (non-) symbolic number magnitude comparison tasks. Discriminant analysis was employed to assess whether basic number processing tasks can differentiate between a healthy control group and both PD groups. All participants were subjected to a comprehensive numerical and a neuropsychological test battery, as well as sociodemographic and clinical measures. Results indicate a profile of preserved (verbal representation) and impaired (magnitude representation, place × value activation) function in PD-MCI, hinting at basal ganglia dysfunction affecting numerical cognition in PD. Numerical deficits could not be explained by domain-general cognitive impairments, so that future research needs to incorporate domain-specific tasks of sufficient difficulty.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Psychiatric disorders are multifactorial conditions without clear biomarkers, influenced by genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Understanding these disorders requires identifying specific endophenotypes that help break down their complexity. Here, we undertake an in-depth analysis of one such endophenotype, namely imbalanced approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), reviewing its significant dependency on the hippocampus. Imbalanced AAC is a transdiagnostic endophenotype, being a feature of many psychiatric conditions in humans. However, it is predominantly examined in preclinical research through paradigms that subject rodents to conflict-laden scenarios. This review offers an original perspective by discussing the AAC through three distinct lights: optogenetic modulation of the AAC, which updates our understanding of the hippocampal contribution to behavioral inhibition; the impact of environmental stress, which exacerbates conflict and strengthens the stress-psychopathology axis; and inherent epigenetic aspects, which uncover crucial molecular underpinnings of environmental (mal) adaptation. By integrating these perspectives, in this review we aim to underline a cross-species causal nexus between heightened hippocampal activity and avoidance behavior. In addition, we suggest a rationale to explore epigenetic pharmacology as a potential strategy to tackle AAC-related psychopathology. This review assumes greater significance when viewed through the lens of advancing AAC-centric diagnostics in human subjects. Unlike traditional questionnaires, which struggle to accurately measure individual differences in AAC-related dimensions, new approaches using virtual reality and computer games show promise in better focusing the magnitude of AAC contribution to psychopathology.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The discovery of adult-born granule cells (aDGCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus has raised questions regarding how they develop, incorporate into the hippocampal circuitry, and contribute to learning and memory. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate the intrinsic and synaptic excitability of mouse aDGCs as they matured, enabled by using a tamoxifen-induced genetic label to birth date the aDGCs at different animal ages. Importantly, we also undertook immunofluorescence studies of the expression of the immediate early gene Egr1 and compared these findings with the electrophysiology data in the same animals. We examined two groups of animals, with aDGC birthdating when the mice were 2 months and at 7–9 months of age. In both groups, cells 4 weeks old had lower thresholds for current-evoked action potentials than older cells but fired fewer spikes during long current pulses and responded more poorly to synaptic activation. aDGCs born in both 2 and 7–9-month-old mice matured in their intrinsic excitability and synaptic properties from 4–12 weeks postgenesis, but this occurred more slowly for the older age animals. Interestingly, this pattern of intrinsic excitability changes did not correlate with the pattern of Egr1 expression. Instead, the development of Egr1 expression was correlated with the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that in order for aDGCs to fully participate in hippocampal circuitry, as indicated by Egr1 expression, they must have developed enough synaptic input, in spite of the greater input resistance and reduced firing threshold that characterizes young aDGCs.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Extensive research has been focused in the past century on structural, physiological, and molecular attributes of the hippocampus. This interest was created by the unique involvement of the hippocampus in cognitive and affective functions of the brain. Functional analysis revealed that the hippocampus has divergent properties along its axial dimension to the extent that the dorsal sector (dorsal hippocampus, DH) has different connections with the rest of the brain than those of the ventral sector (VH). Still, longitudinal pathways connect the DH with the VH and dampen the functional differences between the sectors. To be able to identify the intrinsic functional difference between the DH and VH, we produced dissociated monolayer cultures from prenatal DH and VH and examined their properties at 10–20 days after plating by imaging the spontaneous activity of the network using Fluo-2 AM, a calcium indicator. Surprisingly, while DH and VH sectors produced dissociated cultures with similar morphological attributes, VH cultures were more active spontaneously than DH cultures. Furthermore, when stimulated to produce action potentials, VH neurons triggered network bursts in postsynaptic neurons more often than DH cultures. Finally, in both DH and VH cultures, electrical stimulation of single cells produced network bursts in response to a burst of action potentials rather than to single spikes. These experiments indicate that even in dissociated cultures, neurons of the VH are more excitable and sensitive to electrical stimulation than DH; hence, they are more likely to generate network bursts and epileptic seizures, as suggested for in vivo brains.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Topographical projection patterns from the entorhinal cortex to area CA1 of the hippocampus have led to a hypothesis that proximal CA1 (pCA1, closer to CA2) is spatially more selective than distal CA1 (dCA1, closer to the subiculum). While earlier studies have shown evidence supporting this hypothesis, we recently showed that this difference does not hold true under all experimental conditions. In a complex environment with distinct local texture cues on a circular track and global visual cues, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable spatial selectivity. Correlated with the spatial selectivity differences, the earlier studies also showed differences in theta phase coding dynamics between pCA1 and dCA1 neurons. Here we show that there are no differences in theta phase coding dynamics between neurons in these two regions under the experimental conditions where pCA1 and dCA1 neurons are equally spatially selective. These findings challenge the established notion of dCA1 being inherently less spatially selective and theta modulated than pCA1 and suggest further experiments to understand theta-mediated activation of the CA1 sub-networks to represent space.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HC) is recognized for its pivotal role in memory-related plasticity and facilitating adaptive behavioral responses to reward shifts. However, the nature of its involvement in the response to reward downshifts remains to be determined. To bridge this knowledge gap, we explored the HC's function through a series of experiments in various tasks involving reward downshifts and using several neural manipulations in rats. In Experiment 1, complete excitotoxic lesions of the HC impaired choice performance in a modified T-maze after reducing the quantity of sugar pellet rewards. In Experiment 2, chemogenetic inhibition of the dorsal HC (dHC) disrupted anticipatory behavior following a food-pellet reward reduction. Experiments 3–5 impaired HC function by using peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. This treatment, which induces peripheral inflammation affecting HC function, significantly increased cytokine levels in the dHC (Experiment 3) and impaired anticipatory choice behavior (Experiment 4). None of these dorsal hippocampal manipulations affected consummatory responses in animals experiencing sucrose downshifts. Accordingly, we found no evidence of increased neural activation in either the dorsal or ventral HC, as measured by c-Fos expression, after a sucrose downshift task involving consummatory suppression (Experiment 6). The results highlight the HC's pivotal role in adaptively modulating anticipatory behavior in response to a variety of situations involving frustrative nonreward, while having no effect on adjustments on consummatory behavior. The data supporting this conclusion were obtained under heterogeneous experimental conditions derived from a multi-laboratory collaboration, ensuring the robustness and high reproducibility of our findings.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23643?af=R">Adult Neurogenesis and the Initiation of Social Aggression in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is important for social behavior and exhibits unusual structural plasticity in the form of continued production of new granule neurons throughout adulthood, but it is unclear how adult neurogenesis contributes to social interactions. In the present study, we suppressed neurogenesis using a pharmacogenetic mouse model and examined social investigation and aggression in adult male mice to investigate the role of hippocampal adult-born neurons in the expression of aggressive behavior. In simultaneous choice tests with stimulus mice placed in corrals, mice with complete suppression of adult neurogenesis in adulthood (TK mice) exhibited normal social investigation behaviors, indicating that new neurons are not required for social interest, social memory, or detection of and response to social olfactory signals. However, mice with suppressed neurogenesis displayed decreased offensive and defensive aggression in a resident-intruder paradigm, and less resistance in a social dominance test, relative to neurogenesis-intact controls, when paired with weight and strain-matched (CD-1) mice. During aggression tests, TK mice were frequently attacked by the CD-1 intruder mice, which never occurred with WTs, and normal CD-1 male mice investigated TK mice less than controls when corralled in the social investigation test. Importantly, TK mice showed normal aggression toward prey (crickets) and smaller, nonaggressive (olfactory bulbectomized) C57BL/6J intruders, suggesting that mice lacking adult neurogenesis do not avoid aggressive social interactions if they are much larger than their opponent and will clearly win. Taken together, our findings show that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in the instigation of intermale aggression, possibly by weighting a cost–benefit analysis against confrontation in cases where the outcome of the fight is not clear.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23646?af=R">Supramammillary Theta Oscillations in Water Maze Learning</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) in the hypothalamus, in conjunction with the hippocampus (HPC), has been implicated through theta oscillations in various brain functions ranging from locomotion to learning and memory. While the indispensable role of the SuM in HPC theta generation in anesthetized animals is well-characterized, the SuM is not always necessary for HPC theta in awake animals. This raises questions on the precise behavioral relevance of SuM theta activity and its interaction with HPC theta activity. We used simultaneously recorded SuM and HPC local field potentials (LFPs) in a one-day water maze (WM) learning paradigm in rats (<i>n</i> = 8), to show that theta activities recorded from the SuM itself were not positively correlated with locomotor (swimming) speed nor acceleration, but the individual relationship between acceleration and SuM theta frequency is correlated with WM learning rates. In contrast, we found that SuM-HPC theta phase coherence is strongly correlated with swimming speed and acceleration, but these do not relate to WM learning. SuM-HPC-directed coherence analysis demonstrated no swimming kinetics nor learning rate associations, but revealed that periods of high SuM-HPC theta phase coherence are driven by the SuM at relatively low (~6.2 Hz) frequencies. Additionally, we demonstrate that the SuM and the HPC also engage in non-random, non-coherent phase coupling modes where either structure preferentially displays a ± 2 Hz difference with the other. Our data indicate SuM theta LFPs do not appear to be related to either speed coding or spatial learning in swimming rats and display non-random out-of-phase theta frequency coupling with the HPC.</p>

	<p>Background: Hypofunction of the glutamate system in the brain is one of the pathophysiological hypotheses for schizophrenia. Accumulating animal and clinical studies show that sarcosine (N-methylglycine), a glycine transporter-1 inhibitor, is effective in ameliorating the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. The aims of the present study were to observe the effects of sarcosine on neuronal activity in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) hippocampal neurons within an NMDA receptor hypofunction model induced by MK801. Methods: We applied in vivo calcium imaging to observe the dynamics of fluorescence from the dCA1 hippocampal neurons when the mice were exploring in an open field. Using this tool, we directly measured and compared neuronal properties between sarcosine-treated and untreated mice. At the same time, the physiological function of the neurons was also quantified by measuring their place fields. Results: Our data demonstrated that MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg) diminished the fluorescence intensity of dCA1 neurons that had been genetically modified with a calcium indicator. MK-801 also significantly increased the correlation coefficient between the fluorescence dynamics of pairs of cells, a feature that may be linked to the symptom of disorganization in human patients with schizophrenia. The spatial correlations of place fields in the mice were impaired by MK-801 as well. Injected sarcosine (500 mg or 1000 mg/kg) significantly alleviated the abovementioned abnormalities. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence to support the use of sarcosine to alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia, especially hippocampus-related functions.</p>

	<p>Background: To investigate the behavior of spiking neural networks (SNNs), the sensitivity of input perturbation serves as an effective metric for assessing the influence on the network output. However, existing methods fall short in evaluating the sensitivity of SNNs featuring biologically plausible leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons due to the intricate neuronal dynamics during the feedforward process. Methods: This paper first defines the sensitivity of a temporal-coded spiking neuron (SN) as the deviation between the perturbed and unperturbed output under a given input perturbation with respect to overall inputs. Then, the sensitivity algorithm of an entire SNN is derived iteratively from the sensitivity of each individual neuron. Instead of using the actual firing time, the desired firing time is employed to derive a more precise analytical expression of the sensitivity. Moreover, the expectation of the membrane potential difference is utilized to quantify the magnitude of the input deviation. Results/Conclusions: The theoretical results achieved with the proposed algorithm are in reasonable agreement with the simulation results obtained with extensive input data. The sensitivity also varies monotonically with changes in other parameters, except for the number of time steps, providing valuable insights for choosing appropriate values to construct the network. Nevertheless, the sensitivity exhibits a piecewise decreasing tendency with respect to the number of time steps, with the length and starting point of each piece contingent upon the specific parameter values of the neuron.</p>

	<p>Background: Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of vision, commonly caused by strabismus or anisometropia during early childhood. While studies demonstrated that perceptual learning improves visual acuity and stereopsis in adults with amblyopia, accompanying changes in visual cortical function remain unclear. Methods: We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses before and after perceptual learning in seven adults with amblyopia. Our learning tasks involved dichoptic high-attention-demand tasks that avoided V1 function-related tasks and required high-level cortical functions (e.g., intraparietal sulcus) to train the amblyopic eye. Results: Perceptual learning induced low-level visual cortical function changes, which were strongly associated with the etiology of amblyopia and visual function improvements. Anisometropic amblyopes showed functional improvements across all regions of interest (ROIs: V1, V2, V3, V3A, and hV4), along with improvements in visual acuity and stereoacuity. In contrast, strabismic amblyopes showed robust improvements in visual cortical functions only in individuals who experienced significant gains in visual acuity and stereoacuity. Notably, improvements in V1 functions were significantly correlated with the magnitude of visual acuity and stereoacuity improvements when combining both anisometropic and strabismic amblyopes. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that learning occurs in both high-level and low-level cortical processes. Our study suggests that early intervention to correct eye alignment (e.g., strabismus surgery) is critical for restoring both visual and cortical functions in strabismic amblyopia.</p>

Blood coagulation is a vital physiological process involving a complex network of biochemical reactions, which converge to form a blood clot that repairs vascular injury. This process unfolds in three phases: initiation, amplification, and propagation, ultimately leading to thrombin formation. Coagulation begins when tissue factor (TF) is exposed on an injured vessel’s wall. The first step is when activated factor VII (VIIa) in the plasma binds to TF, forming complex TF:VIIa, which activates factor X. Activated factor X (Xa) is necessary for coagulation, so the regulation of its activation is crucial. Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) is a critical regulator of the initiation phase as it inhibits the activation of factor X. While previous studies have proposed two pathways—direct and indirect binding—for TFPI’s inhibitory role, the specific biochemical reactions and their rates remain ambiguous. Many existing mathematical models only assume an indirect pathway, which may be less effective under physiological flow conditions. In this study, we revisit datasets from two experiments focused on activated factor X formation in the presence of TFPI. We employ an adaptive Metropolis method for parameter estimation to reinvestigate a previously proposed biochemical scheme and corresponding rates for both inhibition pathways. Our findings show that both pathways are essential to replicate the static experimental results. Previous studies have suggested that flow itself makes a significant contribution to the inhibition of factor X activation. We added flow to this model with our estimated parameters to determine the contribution of the two inhibition pathways under these conditions. We found that direct binding of TFPI is necessary for inhibition under flow. The indirect pathway has a weaker inhibitory effect due to removal of solution phase inhibitory complexes by flow.

Mosquitoes transmit medically important human pathogens, including viruses like dengue virus and parasites such as <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., the causative agent of malaria. Mosquito microbiomes are critically important for the ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease-causing agents. However, while large collections of bacterial isolates and genomic data exist for vertebrate microbiomes, the vast majority of work in mosquitoes to date is based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon data that provides limited taxonomic resolution and no functional information. To address this gap and facilitate future studies using experimental microbiome manipulations, we generated a bacterial Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection (MosAIC) consisting of 392 bacterial isolates with extensive metadata and high-quality draft genome assemblies that are publicly available, both isolates and sequence data, for use by the scientific community. MosAIC encompasses 142 species spanning 29 bacterial families, with members of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> comprising 40% of the collection. Phylogenomic analysis of 3 genera, <i>Enterobacter</i>, <i>Serratia</i>, and <i>Elizabethkingia</i>, reveal lineages of mosquito-associated bacteria isolated from different mosquito species in multiple laboratories. Investigation into species’ pangenomes further reveals clusters of genes specific to these lineages, which are of interest for future work to test for functions connected to mosquito host association. Altogether, we describe the generation of a physical collection of mosquito-associated bacterial isolates, their genomic data, and analyses of selected groups in context of genome data from closely related isolates, providing a unique, highly valuable resource for research on bacterial colonisation and adaptation within mosquito hosts. Future efforts will expand the collection to include broader geographic and host species representation, especially from individuals collected from field populations, as well as other mosquito-associated microbes, including fungi, archaea, and protozoa.

                Background/Objective Weight stigma has significant psychological and social implications, yet studies on perspective-taking as an intervention strategy remain scarce. This study aimed to investigate the effect of perspective-taking on weight stigma among Chinese university students and examine the potential mediating role of common ingroup identity. Methods A randomized controlled experiment with 202 Chinese university students (experimental group, perspective-taking group: n = 102; control group: n = 100) was conducted. Weight stigma was measured pre- and post-intervention using the Anti-Fat Attitudes Test. The study employed a 2 × 2 mixed design with ANCOVA and mediation analysis. Results The experimental group showed significantly lower post-test weight stigma when controlling for pre-test scores (F(1, 199) = 25.69, p < .001). Perspective-taking engagement was significantly higher in the experimental group (t = 3.13, p = .002). Common ingroup identity negatively correlated with post-test weight stigma (r = -.28, p < .001) but did not significantly mediate the perspective-taking and weight stigma reduction relationship. Conclusion Perspective-taking effectively reduces weight stigma among Chinese university students, contributing to stigma reduction strategies in university settings. Further research on underlying mechanisms is warranted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1369/v1?src=rss">Financial inclusion and stability in Ethiopia using bank-level data: A two-step system GMM estimation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper examines the impact of financial inclusion on bank stability within Ethiopian context, using panel data from 17 commercial banks over the period 2015-2023. Given the scarcity of research focused on the relationship between financial inclusion and bank stability in Ethiopia, this paper seeks to address a crucial gap by analyzing both conventional and digital aspects of financial inclusion in relation with bank stability. Methods A two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to construct a composite financial inclusion index, integrating 10 conventional and 5 digital indicators. The study applied a two-step robust system generalized method of moments (GMM) to examine the effects of financial inclusion on bank stability, complemented by Granger causality testing to examine the directionality of this relationship. Results The result reveals a significant positive effect of financial inclusion on bank stability and Granger causality tests confirms a bi-directional relationship between financial inclusion and stability, indicating that improvements in financial inclusion foster greater stability and vice versa. Our results also highlight that while bank efficiency and GDP growth rate positively effect stability, total assets and income diversification exhibit detrimental effects. Conclusions It is essential to capitalize policy synergies to promote bank stability and to enhance financial inclusion through conventional and digital channels, while carefully managing the implications of risks associated with income diversification and asset distribution. Ensuring inclusive financial system is vital for maintaining bank stability, thus positioning it as a key priority for financial institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1368/v1?src=rss">Performance of Forensic Age Estimation by Aspartic Acid Racemization and DNA Methylation: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Forensic age estimation is not difficult when the body is found in good condition, but in cases of severe decomposition or damage, such as burnt or separated body parts, then the analysis can only be done with bones and teeth. There has been abundant research and development in the field of related biochemistry over the years. Various molecular changes occur in hard tissues and long-lived proteins, such as those in bones and teeth during the physiological process of aging. Aspartic acid racemization and DNA methylation are still the most frequently used age estimation methods because of their advantages in accuracy. Method This study aimed to compare the accuracy of DNA methylation and aspartic acid racemization methods for age estimation. Journal articles were searched in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar of 2017-2022 according to PRISMA guidelines. Result Twelve journal articles were eligible for review. The DNA methylation method is quite simple to use because of commercially available methylation kits. Furthermore, the results can be obtained relatively quickly without requiring many samples, and the method is less sensitive to thermal and other damage than the aspartic acid racemization method. Conclusion The aspartic acid racemization method for age estimation has high accuracy, especially in determining age at death. However, temperature and the condition of the teeth affect the racemization of aspartic acid. Given that DNA methylation is generally stable in a wide range of temperatures, it provides a better approach to determining the chronological age even from charred remains.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1367/v1?src=rss">“Unmasking the Uncommon”: A case series of multi-drug resistant Elizabethkingia meningoseptica causing late-onset sepsis and meningitis in preterm neonates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is an uncommon nosocomial pathogen that causes meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis in neonates and in immunocompromised individuals. It exhibits resistance to many commonly employed first-line antibiotics used to treat gram-negative pathogens. Herein, we present three cases of late-onset sepsis with multi-drug resistant (MDR) Elizabethkingia meningoseptica in high-risk neonates. Case 1 was a one-day-old preterm low-birth-weight infant who presented with respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. The patient was intubated and administered empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents. Blood culture grew Candida krusei, hence Amphotericin B was initiated. Repeat blood culture on day 27 showed gram-negative bacilli, identified as Elizabethkingia meningoseptica by MALDI-TOF . Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) revealed resistance to Piperacillin/Tazobactam, but sensitivity to Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Minocycline. IV Vancomycin was administered, which resulted in clinical improvement and negative blood culture results. Case 2 was an eleven-day-old preterm, low-birth-weight baby who presented with fever. Initial investigations revealed normal complete blood counts (CBC) parameters and elevated CRP levels. Blood and CSF cultures isolated Elizabethkingia meningoseptica with a similar AST pattern. Intravenous Ciprofloxacin was initiated with clinical improvement and negative follow-up blood cultures. Case 3 was a one-day-old preterm baby, appropriate-to-gestational age, presenting with respiratory distress syndrome. The infant was intubated and started on inotropic support and intravenous antibiotics. Blood cultures on day 4 showed Elizabethkingia meningoseptica and Vancomycin was started. Follow-up cultures on days 6 and 14 grew Acinetobacter baumannii. A combination of Levofloxacin and Colistin was added, and blood cultures were negative after seven days, with clinical improvement. Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a significant cause of hospital-acquired infections, especially in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), leading to outbreaks. Clinicians must have a high degree of suspicion of E. meningoseptica for gram-negative bacilli causing sepsis and meningitis in high-risk patients. Recent technological advances have enabled accurate speciation to guide therapy and reduce morbidity and mortality rates.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hippocampal sclerosis (HS), the most common pathology associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), is not always visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), causing surgical delays and reduced postsurgical seizure-freedom. We developed an open-source software to characterize and localize HS to aid the presurgical evaluation of children and adults with suspected TLE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included a multicenter cohort of 365 participants (154 HS; 90 disease controls; 121 healthy controls). HippUnfold was used to extract morphological surface-based features and volumes of the hippocampus from T1-weighted MRI scans. We characterized pathological hippocampi in patients by comparing them to normative growth charts and analyzing within-subject feature asymmetries. Feature asymmetry scores were used to train a logistic regression classifier to detect and lateralize HS. The classifier was validated on an independent multicenter cohort of 275 patients with HS and 161 healthy and disease controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>HS was characterized by decreased volume, thickness, and gyrification alongside increased mean and intrinsic curvature. The classifier detected 90.1% of unilateral HS patients and lateralized lesions in 97.4%. In patients with MRI-negative histopathologically-confirmed HS, the classifier detected 79.2% (19/24) and lateralized 91.7% (22/24). The model achieved similar performances on the independent cohort, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new data. Individual patient reports contextualize a patient's hippocampal features in relation to normative growth trajectories, visualise feature asymmetries, and report classifier predictions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Automated and Interpretable Detection of Hippocampal Sclerosis (AID-HS) is an open-source pipeline for detecting and lateralizing HS and outputting clinically-relevant reports. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95720">Luminal epithelial cells integrate variable responses to aging into stereotypical changes that underlie breast cancer susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Effects from aging in single cells are heterogenous, whereas at the organ- and tissue-levels aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation. We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger &lt;30 (y)ears old and older &gt;55y women. In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as <i>SATB1</i>. Epithelial expression of gap junction protein <i>GJB6</i> increased with age, and modulation of <i>GJB6</i> expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95672">Targeting resident astrocytes attenuates neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes derive from different lineages and play a critical role in neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI). Whether selectively eliminating these main origins of astrocytes in lumbar enlargement could attenuate SCI-induced neuropathic pain remains unclear. Through transgenic mice injected with an adeno-associated virus vector and diphtheria toxin, astrocytes in lumbar enlargement were lineage traced, targeted, and selectively eliminated. Pain-related behaviors were measured with an electronic von Frey apparatus and a cold/hot plate after SCI. RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, molecular experiment, and immunohistochemistry were used to explore the potential mechanisms after astrocyte elimination. Lineage tracing revealed that the resident astrocytes but not ependymal cells were the main origins of astrocytes-induced neuropathic pain. SCI-induced mice to obtain significant pain symptoms and astrocyte activation in lumbar enlargement. Selective resident astrocyte elimination in lumbar enlargement could attenuate neuropathic pain and activate microglia. Interestingly, the type I interferons (IFNs) signal was significantly activated after astrocytes elimination, and the most activated Gene Ontology terms and pathways were associated with the type I IFNs signal which was mainly activated in microglia and further verified in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, different concentrations of interferon and Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist could activate the type I IFNs signal in microglia. These results elucidate that selectively eliminating resident astrocytes attenuated neuropathic pain associated with type I IFNs signal activation in microglia. Targeting type I IFNs signals is proven to be an effective strategy for neuropathic pain treatment after SCI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84359">Integration of overlapping sequences emerges with consolidation through medial prefrontal cortex neural ensembles and hippocampal–cortical connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Systems consolidation theories propose two mechanisms that enable the behavioral integration of related memories: coordinated reactivation between hippocampus and cortex, and the emergence of cortical traces that reflect overlap across memories. However, there is limited empirical evidence that links these mechanisms to the emergence of behavioral integration over time. In two experiments, participants implicitly encoded sequences of objects with overlapping structure. Assessment of behavioral integration showed that response times during a recognition task reflected behavioral priming between objects that never occurred together in time but belonged to overlapping sequences. This priming was consolidation-dependent and only emerged for sequences learned 24 hr prior to the test. Critically, behavioral integration was related to changes in neural pattern similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex and increases in post-learning rest connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and lateral occipital cortex. These findings suggest that memories with a shared predictive structure become behaviorally integrated through a consolidation-related restructuring of the learned sequences, providing insight into the relationship between different consolidation mechanisms that support behavioral integration.

	<p>Introduction. Previous studies have shown that probiotics have positive effects on both motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Additionally, in preclinical settings, probiotics have demonstrated the ability to counteract neuronal loss and alpha-synuclein aggregation, important pathological hallmarks of PD. Notably, preliminary in vitro studies have revealed the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of probiotics on symptoms and peripheral cytokines levels in PD patients compared to placebo. Methods. Patients were enrolled and blindly randomized to receive either active probiotics (comprising Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BS01 LMG P-21384, Bifidobacterium longum BL03 DSM 16603, Bifidobacterium adolescentis BA02 DSM 18351, Fructo-oligosaccharides and Maltodextrin-Group A) or placebo (Maltodextrin-Group B). Clinical evaluations and plasma levels cytokines (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;, IL-6, and TGF-&amp;amp;beta;) were also assessed at enrollment and after 12 weeks. Anti-parkinsonian therapy remained stable throughout the study. Results. Forty PD patients were recruited. After 12 weeks, Group A showed significant improvement in motor symptoms (UPDRS III: 13.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.08 vs. 12.74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.57, p = 0.028) and non-motor symptoms (NMSS: 34.32 &amp;amp;plusmn; 21.41 vs. 30.11 &amp;amp;plusmn; 19.89, p = 0.041), with notable improvement in the gastrointestinal sub-item (3.79 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.14 vs. 1.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.54, p = 0.021). A reduction of IFN-&amp;amp;gamma; levels was observed in both groups, but group A also showed a significant decrease in IL-6 and a slight increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-&amp;amp;beta;. Conclusions. Our data suggest that probiotics may modulate peripheral cytokines levels and improve clinical symptoms in PD patients. Probiotics may, therefore, represent a valuable adjunctive therapy to conventional anti-parkinsonian drugs.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neuropathic pain is challenging to treat, often resistant to current therapies, and associated with significant side effects. Pregabalin, an anticonvulsant that modulates calcium channels, is effective but can impair mental and motor functions, especially in older patients. To improve patient outcomes, reducing the doses of pregabalin and combining it with other drugs targeting different neuropathic pain mechanisms may be beneficial. TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; blockers such as etanercept have shown potential in addressing neuropathic pain by affecting sodium channels, synaptic transmission, and neuroinflammation. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of combining low doses of etanercept and pregabalin in allodynia and nociceptive tests. Materials and Methods: Male C57/BL6 mice underwent chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve to induce neuropathic pain. They were divided into seven groups: sham control, CCI control, low and high doses of pregabalin, low and high doses of etanercept, and a combination of low doses of both drugs. Behavioral tests, including von Frey, hot-plate, and rotarod tests, were used to assess pain responses and motor activity. Results: The results indicated that a high dose of pregabalin significantly reduced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia but impaired motor function. Conversely, low doses of etanercept alone had no significant effect. However, the combination of low doses of etanercept (20 mg/kg) and pregabalin (5 mg/kg) effectively alleviated pain without compromising locomotor activity. Conclusions: These results suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain, enhancing analgesic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Most of the rapid inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is mediated through activation of the &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (GABAA) receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel. GABAA receptor activation via GABA binding allows for an intracellular influx of Cl&amp;amp;minus; ions, thus inducing cellular hyperpolarization. Each GABAA receptor consists of a combination of five subunits, and several subunits have been proposed as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. Here, we show the expression of genes encoding &amp;amp;beta; subunits of the GABAA receptor, namely GABRB1, GABRB2, and GABRB3, across the four different molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma (MB), which is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. We also show the associations of GABAA receptor &amp;amp;beta; subunits with MB patients&amp;amp;rsquo; overall survival (OS). Methods: The expression of genes encoding GABAA receptor &amp;amp;beta; subunits was analyzed using a previously described dataset comprising 763 MB tumor samples. Patients were classified into high- and low-gene-expression groups, and the Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier estimate was used to examine the relationship between gene expression levels and patient OS. Results: High GABRB1 expression was associated with better OS within each of the four molecular subgroups. The GABRB2 gene showed higher transcript levels in Group 3 MB compared to all other subgroups, and high expression was associated with better prognosis in Group 3 tumors. GABRB3 expression was significantly higher in Group 3 and Group 4 MB, and high expression of GABRB3 genes was associated with longer OS in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup. The high expression of GABRB1, GABRB2, and GABRB3 is associated with longer patient OS in a subgroup-specific manner. Conclusions: These results indicate a role for GABAA receptors containing &amp;amp;beta; subunits in influencing MB progression.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Stroke remains a major cause of disability and death, with survivors facing significant physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges. Rehabilitation is crucial for recovery, but outcomes can vary widely. Cognitive reserve (CR) has emerged as a factor influencing these outcomes. This systematic review evaluates the role of CR in post-stroke rehabilitation, examining whether higher CR is associated with better outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted for studies published between 2004 and 2024. Studies examining social-behavior CR proxies (e.g., education, bilingualism) and their impact on post-stroke outcomes were included. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for NOn-Randomized Studies (MINORS) scale. Results: Among 3851 articles screened, 27 met the inclusion criteria. Higher education levels, bilingualism, and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities were associated with better cognitive outcomes and functional recovery. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) correlated with poorer outcomes. Early rehabilitation and dynamic CR proxies showed stronger associations with cognitive recovery than static ones. Conclusions: CR may predict post-stroke rehabilitation outcomes, with education, bilingualism, and active engagement in cognitive activities showing potential benefits. Future research should explore CR&amp;amp;rsquo;s role alongside factors like lesion location and severity in enhancing recovery.</p>

	<p>Background: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare and frequently misdiagnosed disorder characterized by a low volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) caused by the leakage of CSF through the spinal dural membrane. Patients with Marfan Syndrome (MS) and other connective tissue disorders are at an increased risk for dural ectasia, which may predispose them to spontaneous CSF leaks due to the structural weakness of their dural membranes. The management of SIH in MS patients is debated. Conservative measures, an epidural blood patch (EBP), and surgical treatments are the options generally provided. Methods: Herein, we report on the case of a 52-year-old female affected by MS, genetically confirmed, with a two-month history of sudden-onset, &amp;amp;ldquo;thunderclap&amp;amp;rdquo; headache, worsened in an upright position and horizontal diplopia. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed a bilateral chronic subdural hematoma, slit ventricles, and a caudal descent of the brainstem without overt tonsillar herniation. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the whole spine revealed dural ectasia in the lumbosacral area and presacral perineural cyst without extradural CSF collection. The case was successfully managed with bed rest and high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Then, we discuss the pertinent literature, consisting of 25 papers dealing with the treatment of SIH in patients affected by MS. Results: The literature review yielded 25 papers dealing with SIH management in patients with MS, including 28 patients overall; 21 patients underwent EBP, of whom 7 patients had multiple procedures. Overall, in 23 cases (82%), the symptoms improved. In three cases, the patients were managed conservatively with bed rest. In three of these cases, there was an improvement. In one case, the surgical fenestration of two lumbar intradural spinal meningeal cysts was performed and the patient improved after the procedure. Our patient underwent 15 days of steroid therapy (dexamethasone iv 12 mg/day for 7 days, then reduced to 4 mg/day) and intravenous hydration (Ringer lactate 1500 mL/day). In ten days, the symptoms disappeared. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient was in good clinical condition, and a CT scan showed an almost complete regression of the bilateral subdural hematoma. Conclusions: The management of SIH in MS patients is still challenging. Patients with connective tissue disorders such as MS are at an increased risk for SIH. Few studies have assessed the management of these patients and different strategies. Our case and the available literature provide further data for this type of case.</p>

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by pruritus and skin barrier dysfunction. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Pelargonium graveolens (Geraniaceae) in managing AD symptoms through its essential oil. Methods The chemical composition of Pelargonium graveolens flower essential oil (PFEO) was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties were assessed, along with the inhibitory effects of PFEO on key enzymes involved in skin repair: tyrosinase, elastase, and collagenase. An in vivo evaluation of a gel formulation containing PFEO was also conducted to assess its anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Results GC-MS analysis identified major compounds in PFEO, including Geraniol (22.83%), beta-citronellol (19.51%), naphthalenemethanol (15.36%), and Geranyl tiglate (9.38%), with minor constituents such as linalool (3.81%) and neryl formate (1.31%). PFEO exhibited bacteriostatic activity against various bacterial and fungal strains, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and Malassezia spp. The essential oil also demonstrated significant antioxidant properties and inhibited key enzymes linked to skin alterations in AD. Conclusions PFEO shows promising therapeutic potential for managing symptoms of atopic dermatitis due to its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its analgesic effects. The findings support further exploration of PFEO as a natural alternative in the treatment of AD.

                Background Cytoscape is an open-source software to visualize and analyze networks. However, large networks, such as protein interaction networks, are still difficult to analyze as a whole. Methods Here, we propose Clust&See3.0, a novel version of a Cytoscape app that has been developed to identify, visualize and manipulate network clusters and modules. It is now enriched with functionalities allowing custom annotations of nodes and computation of their statistical enrichments. Results As the wealth of multi-omics data is growing, such functionalities are highly valuable for a better understanding of biological module composition, as illustrated by the presented use case. Conclusions In summary, the originality of Clust&See3.0 lies in providing users with a complete tool for network clusters analyses: from cluster identification, visualization, node and cluster annotations to annotation statistical analyses.

                Background This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the financial technologies (fintech) era on the performance in the banking sector, measured through non-performing loans (NPL) and their coverage by provisions for NPL. It is a question of knowing whether banking investment in fintech makes it possible to better evaluate the granting of credits, and therefore makes it possible to reduce overdue credits. Methods To this end, the method used consists of using a regression analysis and a Pearson correlation applied to the financial data of Moroccan banks observed during two distinct periods, namely 2007-2014, considered pre-fintech, and the period 2015-2022, considered as the fintech period. Results With the emergence of the fintech era, the Moroccan banking situation improved slightly compared to the pre-fintech period: bad debts did not increase despite the significant increase in net banking income and the size of banking assets during the fintech era. Conclusions The implementation of fintech has improved customer relationship management, credit risk analysis and loan monitoring services, which ultimately reduces non-performing loans and improves the coverage of non-performing loans by provisions. The main implication of the results allows us to deduce that the implementation of fintech makes it possible to have a positive impact on overdue credits, and they are also likely to serve as a lever for the inclusion of those excluded from banking services.

                <p>Visual working memory (VWM) requires precise feature binding. Previous studies have revealed a close relationship between the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and feature binding during VWM; this study further examined their causal relationship through three transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) experiments. In Experiment 1 (<I>N</I> = 57), participants underwent three sessions of tDCS separately, including PPC stimulation, occipital cortex stimulation, and sham stimulation, and completed delayed estimation tasks for orientations before and after stimulation. Results showed that tDCS over PPC selectively prolonged recall response time (RT) and increased the probability of nontarget responses (a.k.a. failure of feature binding, <I>p</I>NT). In Experiment 2 (<I>N</I> = 29), combining metacognition estimation, we further investigated whether the effects of PPC stimulation were attributed to misbinding (i.e., participants self-reported "remembered" in nontarget responses) or informed guessing trials (participants self-reported "forgotten" in nontarget responses). We replicated the main findings in Experiment 1 and observed greater tDCS effects of PPC on RT in informed guessing trials while there are comparable effects on <I>p</I>NT in these two types of trials. In Experiment 3 (<I>N</I> = 28), we then examined whether the tDCS effects over PPC specifically influenced the memory retrieval process by using a change detection task. We found that PPC stimulation did not influence the recognition RT or accuracy. Together, this study provided direct causal evidence supporting the specific involvement of PPC in feature binding during VWM retrieval, from both aspects of speed and response preference, expanding our understanding of the neural basis of feature binding in VWM.</p>

                <p>Neurodevelopmental abnormalities are considered to be one of the important causes of schizophrenia. The offspring of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM)&ndash;exposed mice are recognized for the dysregulation of neurodevelopment and are well-characterized with schizophrenia-like phenotypes. However, the inhibition-related properties of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus throughout adolescence and adulthood have not been systematically elucidated. In this study, both 10 and 15&nbsp;mg/kg MAM-exposed mice exhibited schizophrenia-related phenotypes in both adolescence and adulthood, including spontaneous locomotion hyperactivity and deficits in prepulse inhibition. We observed that there was an obvious parvalbumin (PV) loss in the mPFC and hippocampus of MAM-exposed mice, extending from adolescence to adulthood. Moreover, the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pyramidal neurons at mPFC and hippocampus was significantly dampened in the 10 and 15&nbsp;mg/kg MAM-exposed mice. Furthermore, the firing rate of putative pyramidal neurons in mPFC and hippocampus was increased, while that of putative inhibitory neurons was decreased during both adolescence and adulthood. In conclusion, PV loss in mPFC and hippocampus of MAM-exposed mice may contribute to the impaired inhibitory function leading to the attenuation of inhibition in the brain both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

                Background Sustaining a ‘fit-for-purpose’ health workforce requires a better understanding of the health care worker cadres that are affected during pandemics and their outcomes. In hospitalized health care workers with confirmed COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2023 in Liberia, we determined the hospitalization and case fatality rates, type of health care worker cadres affected, their demographic and clinical characteristics and hospital exit outcomes. Methods This was a cohort study using routine data extracted from hospitalization forms for health care workers in 24 designated COVID-19 treatment facilities. Results Of the 424 health care workers with COVID-19, hospitalization rates progressively declined between 2020 and 2023, (P<0.001) with the highest rates in 2020 (24/1,000 health care workers) and 2021 (14/1,000 health care workers). Case fatality was 2% in both 2020 and 2021 with no deaths thereafter. Among those hospitalized, the highest proportions were nursing cadres with 191(45%), physicians with 63 (15%) and laboratory technicians with 42 (10%). The most frequent reported site for COVID-19 infection was the health facility (326, 89%). COVID-19 vaccination coverage in health care workers was 20%. The majority (91%) of hospitalizations were for mild symptomatic infections. Even in referral centres (n-52), 18 (35%) were for mild infections. Of the 424 who were hospitalized, 412 (97%) recovered, 9 (2%) died and 3 (1%) either left against medical advice or absconded. Of the nine deaths, none were vaccinated, seven had moderate-to-severe disease but were not referred to specialized COVID-19 treatment centers. Conclusions The hospitalized health care workers for COVID-19 were predominantly clinical and laboratory personnel who were mostly unvaccinated, and health facilities were hot-spots for contracting infections. The triage and referral system was weak with unnecessary hospitalization of mild infections. This study provides useful insights for outbreak preparedness including priority vaccination and improving health care worker safety in Liberia.

                Background Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and has poor clinical outcomes. Recently, stimulating arteriogenesis has been proposed to improve clinical outcomes. Several studies have shown that miRNAs have beneficial effects on limb ischemia related to arteriogenesis. This study aimed to review the roles of therapeutic miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia. Methods A systematic search was conducted through July 2021 using the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases. Two authors independently assessed studies that investigated the role of miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia, both in vivo and in clinical studies. Results All selected studies were in vivo studies, with a total of 36 articles and 28 types of miRNAs. miRNAs potentially regulate arteriogenesis by targeting different targets. The following miRNAs were upregulated to enhance arteriogenesis: miRNA-126-3p, -93, -675, -143-3p, -130a, -210, -146b, -21, -let-7g, -132/212, -150, and 155. Meanwhile, microRNAs needed to be downregulated, namely: miRNA-939-5p, -503, -199a-5p, -146a, -92a, -14q32 microRNA gene cluster, -15a/16, -100, -133a, -139-5p, -223, -352, -615-5p, -15b/5p, -124-3p, and 29a. MiRNA-126 was the most studied miRNA, and SPRED1 was the most common target of microRNA. However, the included studies showed high heterogeneity in terms of inducing hindlimb ischemia, the timing of administration, and the method used for evaluating arteriogenesis. Moreover, most studies presented unclear or high-risk bias. Conclusion MicroRNA application in a preclinical model of hindlimb ischemia has beneficial effects on arteriogenesis. This result indicates that miRNAs might be potentially beneficial in patients with CLTI. Registration The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024484988.

                Background Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common retinal condition with an increased risk of recurrence. Traditional approaches have made choroidal visualization challenging, but recent advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) innovation have permitted the collection of more accurate choroidal visualizations. This study aimed to measure choroidal thickness in eyes with active CSCR as well as in the unaffected opposite eyes of these same individuals. Methods This research was conducted at the ophthalmology division in Ghazi Al-Hariri Hospital from the 1st of October 2019 until the 31st of March 2020. A total of 49 people, corresponding to 65 eyes, were included in the study. Among these participants, 16 individuals presented with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), affecting a total of 32 eyes. The CSCR individuals were further split into two groups: “Group A” consisted of 20 eyes with active CSCR, and “Group B” encompassed the remaining 12 unaffected opposite eyes. Additionally, the right eyes of 33 individuals who were age and gender-matched served as controls assigned as “Group C”. Results The choroid exhibited a substantial rise in thickness across each of the nine sectors in group A as compared to group C. Similarly, group B showed a significant increase in choroidal thickness in relation to group C. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was measured as follows: 474.55μm, 437.5μm, and 292.03μm among groups A, B, and C, correspondingly. These differences were identified as clinically significant for both A vs. C and B vs. C. Conclusions This study’s findings indicate a thickening of the choroid in both eyes exhibiting active CSCR, as well as in the unaffected opposite eyes of those with the disease.

                Introduction Low and middle-income countries account for the largest proportion of women’s deaths as a result of pregnancy or childbirth-related complications. The sub-Saharan region is the most affected with approximately 70% (202 000) of maternal deaths between 2000 and 2020. These deaths could have been prevented if expectant mothers were prepared for childbirth. Birth preparedness is perceived as a better strategy that helps attain a substantial reduction in maternal mortality. This is achieved by attending early antenatal classes, receiving skilled care during childbirth, and care and support right after birth. The latest survey on antenatal class attendance conducted in South Africa provides an estimated 30.8% of expectant mothers in public healthcare facilities. Methods This study employed a qualitative approach to collect data, as a result, one focus group discussion with five (N=5) participants and two others with six (N=6) participants each (n=6X2=12) and twenty individual interviews were conducted. The study sought to explore and describe the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals regarding the birth preparedness of women in labour at selected hospitals in Durban KwaZulu-Natal. Results Expectant mothers were unprepared for both labour and postnatal care. The unprepared expectant mothers were uncooperative and made the task of midwives difficult to the extent of endangering the life of their expected newborn babies and their own. Factors such as finance, heterogeneity, staff shortage, language barrier, lack of family support, lack of interest, cultural beliefs, and confusion caused by various sources of information were responsible for birth unpreparedness. Conclusion The synergy between expectant mothers and midwives appears to be an important factor in achieving better birth preparedness.

                Digital and financial literacy are changing the landscape of the globe in terms of its approach to development. These two literacies also help to achieve women’s empowerment and, consequently, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) more quickly. This systematic literature review looks at the two literacies and their effects, focusing on women’s participation and showing how digital literacy not only increases women’s access to knowledge and connectivity but is also a door to women’s entrepreneurship and financial independence. Likewise, financial literacy, when coupled with digital skills, can be a breakthrough to the traditional socioeconomic barrier – poverty – by assisting women in making informed economic decisions, increasing their financial independence and resilience in the face of a global crisis. Empirical realities that still hinder women’s education, such as cultural norms, infrastructural deficiencies and educational gaps, still exist. However, the paper points out that to have a more equal world based on the SDGs, the double literacy strategy for women’s empowerment should not be negotiable.

                Background Studies have shown that perceived self-efficacy can influence teachers’ emotional state, thoughts and behaviours, and students’ learning. It’s also an important referential of professional satisfaction. In turn, teaching methodologies influence motor learning, as well as psychological, cognitive and social learning, with different impacts on human development and learning retention, levels of intrinsic motivation and continuity of practice in order to support a healthy lifestyle. Research on aquatic educators and teaching methodologies is scarce and at the same time necessary according to the view that aquatic literacy is an integral part of physical literacy and the only possibility of being more able to interact with this environment. Methods In this study we used an online questionnaire, aimed at aquatic professionals, which was answered voluntarily and anonymously to measure the prevalence of the use of different teaching methodologies, the comprehensive aquatic method and the perception of teacher self-efficacy. It has been deposited and can be consulted at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27316242.v1. Results All methods can generate a feeling of self-efficacy in teachers despite having different results, with the methodologies that involve students more actively (cognitivist and constructivist) being those that generate a greater feeling of self-efficacy in teachers. MAC is a method that is more closely related to methodologies focused on active student participation and, consequently, it is a method that generates a high perception of self-efficacy in teachers. Conclusions Levels of self-efficacy influence professional satisfaction, teacher physical, mental and emotional health, as well as student learning. Is recommended that aquatic professionals give prevalence to the cognitivist and constructivist teaching methodologies being MAC a privileged methodological approach for promoting active lifestyle habits throughout life.

The progressive loss of voluntary muscle function, diagnostic delays, lack of effective treatments, and challenges accessing multidisciplinary care and resources have tremendous impact on quality of life. The congressionally directed ALS committee of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, in their 2024 report “Living with ALS,” recommends critical actions for specific United States stakeholders to make ALS a livable disease over the next decade. This review summarizes the context and recommendations of the report. Advocacy efforts are critical to make these recommendations a reality for the ALS community.

                <p>Slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) indicate a progressive pathological process. Whether SELs are present in pediatric-onset MS (POMS) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is unknown. We studied 19 children with POMS and 14 with MOGAD (median age 14.3 and 9.4 years, respectively) recruited to the Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study with: (1) ≥3 research scans 12 months apart; and (2) ≥1 T2-lesions on the earliest scan. A total of 70 SELs from 16 POMS participants and 1 SEL in the MOGAD group were detected. SELs are an early feature of POMS and essentially not a feature of MOGAD.

                <p>Cryptogenic new-onset refractory status epilepticus (cNORSE) is a devastating condition with unclear pathogenesis. Here, we analyzed the genetic underprints of 31 cNORSE patients from an autoimmune encephalitis observational cohort through whole-genome sequencing. Compared to their controls, cNORSE patients exhibited elevated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for traits associated with autoimmune diseases. The individual PRS against these diseases were correlated with specific clinical phenotypes of cNORSE. The variants were enriched in genes expressed in the central nervous system and lymphocytes. These results suggest a shared genetic framework between cNORSE and other autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases, and its involvement in the disease pathogenesis.
