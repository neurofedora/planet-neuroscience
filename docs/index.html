                Background: Low Birth Weight (LBW) is a global health concern for childhood mortality and morbidity. The objectives of this study were to assess the association between the number of Antenatal Care Visits (ANC) and LBW among Bangladeshi newborns, and to identify the demographic and socio-economic predictors of LBW.   Methods: Our present cross-sectional study is based on the secondary data of the Bangladesh Demography and Health Survey (BDHS) 2014. Complete data of 4,235 (weighted) mother-child pairs were included in the analysis.   Results: The overall prevalence of LBW among newborns were found to be 19.3% (95% CI: 17.8-20.9). Among the mothers who received antenatal care services 1-3 times during pregnancy, 35% had less possibility of having LBW babies [COR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.85]. The association remained significant after adjusting the analysis with the sex of the newborn, administrative regions (division), maternal educational status, mother’s weight status and fathers’ occupation [AOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99]. Additionally, the sex of the newborn, division, maternal education, maternal weight status, and fathers’ occupational status were found to be significantly associated with LBW.   Conclusion: Increasing the coverage of antenatal services and enabling mothers to receive quality antenatal services may substantially contribute to reducing the prevalence of LBW in Bangladesh.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Convincing evidence of blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) alterations has been demonstrated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and barrier repair is imperative to prevent motor neuron dysfunction. We showed benefits of human bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells (hBM34+) and endothelial progenitor cells (hBM-EPCs) intravenous transplantation into symptomatic G93A SOD1 mutant mice on barrier reparative processes. These gains likely occurred by replacement of damaged endothelial cells, prolonging motor neuron survival. However, additional investigations are needed to confirm the effects of administered cells on integrity of the microvascular endothelium. The aim of this study was to determine tight junction protein levels, capillary pericyte coverage, microvascular basement membrane, and endothelial filamentous actin (F-actin) status in spinal cord capillaries of G93A SOD1 mutant mice treated with human bone marrow-derived stem cells. Tight junction proteins were detected in the spinal cords of cell-treated versus non-treated mice via Western blotting at four weeks after transplant. Capillary pericyte, basement membrane laminin, and endothelial F-actin magnitudes were determined in cervical/lumbar spinal cord tissues in ALS mice, including controls, by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent staining. Results showed that cell-treated versus media-treated ALS mice substantially increased tight junction protein levels, capillary pericyte coverage, basement membrane laminin immunoexpressions, and endothelial cytoskeletal F-actin fluorescent expressions. The greatest benefits were detected in mice receiving hBM-EPCs versus hBM34+ cells. These study results support treatment with a specific cell type derived from human bone marrow toward BSCB repair in ALS. Thus, hBM-EPCs may be advanced for clinical applications as a cell-specific approach for ALS therapy through restored barrier integrity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Machine learning approach for automatic recognition of tomato-pollinating bees based on their buzzing-sounds</a></h4>

Bee-mediated pollination greatly increases the size and weight of tomato fruits. Therefore, distinguishing between the local set of bees–those that are efficient pollinators–is essential to improve the economic returns for farmers. To achieve this, it is important to know the identity of the visiting bees. Nevertheless, the traditional taxonomic identification of bees is not an easy task, requiring the participation of experts and the use of specialized equipment. Due to these limitations, the development and implementation of new technologies for the automatic recognition of bees become relevant. Hence, we aim to verify the capacity of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in recognizing the taxonomic identity of visiting bees to tomato flowers based on the characteristics of their buzzing sounds. We compared the performance of the ML algorithms combined with the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and with classifications based solely on the from fundamental frequency, leading to a direct comparison between the two approaches. In fact, some classifiers powered by the MFCC–especially the SVM–achieved better performance compared to the randomized and sound frequency-based trials. Moreover, the buzzing sounds produced during sonication were more relevant for the taxonomic recognition of bee species than analysis based on flight sounds alone. On the other hand, the ML classifiers performed better in recognizing bees genera based on flight sounds. Despite that, the maximum accuracy obtained here (73.39% by SVM) is still low compared to ML standards. Further studies analyzing larger recording samples, and applying unsupervised learning systems may yield better classification performance. Therefore, ML techniques could be used to automate the taxonomic recognition of flower-visiting bees of the cultivated tomato and other buzz-pollinated crops. This would be an interesting option for farmers and other professionals who have no experience in bee taxonomy but are interested in improving crop yields by increasing pollination.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integration, coincidence detection and resonance in networks of spiking neurons expressing Gamma oscillations and asynchronous states</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eduarda Susin, Alain Destexhe</p>

Gamma oscillations are widely seen in the awake and sleeping cerebral cortex, but the exact role of these oscillations is still debated. Here, we used biophysical models to examine how Gamma oscillations may participate to the processing of afferent stimuli. We constructed conductance-based network models of Gamma oscillations, based on different cell types found in cerebral cortex. The models were adjusted to extracellular unit recordings in humans, where Gamma oscillations always coexist with the asynchronous firing mode. We considered three different mechanisms to generate Gamma, first a mechanism based on the interaction between pyramidal neurons and interneurons (PING), second a mechanism in which Gamma is generated by interneuron networks (ING) and third, a mechanism which relies on Gamma oscillations generated by pacemaker <i>chattering</i> neurons (CHING). We find that all three mechanisms generate features consistent with human recordings, but that the ING mechanism is most consistent with the firing rate change inside Gamma bursts seen in the human data. We next evaluated the responsiveness and resonant properties of these networks, contrasting Gamma oscillations with the asynchronous mode. We find that for both slowly-varying stimuli and precisely-timed stimuli, the responsiveness is generally lower during Gamma compared to asynchronous states, while resonant properties are similar around the Gamma band. We could not find conditions where Gamma oscillations were more responsive. We therefore predict that asynchronous states provide the highest responsiveness to external stimuli, while Gamma oscillations tend to overall diminish responsiveness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ISOTOPE: ISOform-guided prediction of epiTOPEs in cancer</a></h4>

Immunotherapies provide effective treatments for previously untreatable tumors and identifying tumor-specific epitopes can help elucidate the molecular determinants of therapy response. Here, we describe a pipeline, ISOTOPE (ISOform-guided prediction of epiTOPEs In Cancer), for the comprehensive identification of tumor-specific splicing-derived epitopes. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry for MHC-I associated proteins, ISOTOPE identified neoepitopes from tumor-specific splicing events that are potentially presented by MHC-I complexes. Analysis of multiple samples indicates that splicing alterations may affect the production of self-epitopes and generate more candidate neoepitopes than somatic mutations. Although there was no difference in the number of splicing-derived neoepitopes between responders and non-responders to immune therapy, higher MHC-I binding affinity was associated with a positive response. Our analyses highlight the diversity of the immunogenic impacts of tumor-specific splicing alterations and the importance of studying splicing alterations to fully characterize tumors in the context of immunotherapies. ISOTOPE is available at https://github.com/comprna/ISOTOPE.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Conventional measures of intrinsic excitability are poor estimators of neuronal activity under realistic synaptic inputs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adrienn Szabó, Katalin Schlett, Attila Szücs</p>

Activity-dependent regulation of intrinsic excitability has been shown to greatly contribute to the overall plasticity of neuronal circuits. Such neuroadaptations are commonly investigated in patch clamp experiments using current step stimulation and the resulting input-output functions are analyzed to quantify alterations in intrinsic excitability. However, it is rarely addressed, how such changes translate to the function of neurons when they operate under natural synaptic inputs. Still, it is reasonable to expect that a strong correlation and near proportional relationship exist between static firing responses and those evoked by synaptic drive. We challenge this view by performing a high-yield electrophysiological analysis of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons using both standard protocols and simulated synaptic inputs via dynamic clamp. We find that under these conditions the neurons exhibit vastly different firing responses with surprisingly weak correlation between static and dynamic firing intensities. These contrasting responses are regulated by two intrinsic K-currents mediated by Kv1 and K<sub>ir</sub> channels, respectively. Pharmacological manipulation of the K-currents produces differential regulation of the firing output of neurons. Static firing responses are greatly increased in stuttering type neurons under blocking their Kv1 channels, while the synaptic responses of the same neurons are less affected. Pharmacological blocking of K<sub>ir</sub>-channels in delayed firing type neurons, on the other hand, exhibit the opposite effects. Our subsequent computational model simulations confirm the findings in the electrophysiological experiments and also show that adaptive changes in the kinetic properties of such currents can even produce paradoxical regulation of the firing output.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Protein structural features predict responsiveness to pharmacological chaperone treatment for three lysosomal storage disorders</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jaie Woodard, Wei Zheng, Yang Zhang</p>

Three-dimensional structures of proteins can provide important clues into the efficacy of personalized treatment. We perform a structural analysis of variants within three inherited lysosomal storage disorders, comparing variants responsive to pharmacological chaperone treatment to those unresponsive to such treatment. We find that predicted ΔΔG of mutation is higher on average for variants unresponsive to treatment, in the case of datasets for both Fabry disease and Pompe disease, in line with previous findings. Using both a single decision tree and an advanced machine learning approach based on the larger Fabry dataset, we correctly predict responsiveness of three Gaucher disease variants, and we provide predictions for untested variants. Many variants are predicted to be responsive to treatment, suggesting that drug-based treatments may be effective for a number of variants in Gaucher disease. In our analysis, we observe dependence on a topological feature reporting on contact arrangements which is likely connected to the order of folding of protein residues, and we provide a potential justification for this observation based on steady-state cellular kinetics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Eliminating accidental deviations to minimize generalization error and maximize replicability: Applications in connectomics and genomics</a></h4>

Bridgeford, Shangsi Wang, Zeyi Wang, Ting Xu, Cameron Craddock, Jayanta Dey, Gregory Kiar, William Gray-Roncal, Carlo Colantuoni, Christopher Douville, Stephanie Noble, Carey E. Priebe, Brian Caffo, Michael Milham, Xi-Nian Zuo, Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility , Joshua T. Vogelstein</p>

Replicability, the ability to replicate scientific findings, is a prerequisite for scientific discovery and clinical utility. Troublingly, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis. A key to replicability is that multiple measurements of the same item (e.g., experimental sample or clinical participant) under fixed experimental constraints are relatively similar to one another. Thus, statistics that quantify the relative contributions of accidental deviations—such as measurement error—as compared to systematic deviations—such as individual differences—are critical. We demonstrate that existing replicability statistics, such as intra-class correlation coefficient and fingerprinting, fail to adequately differentiate between accidental and systematic deviations in very simple settings. We therefore propose a novel statistic, <i>discriminability</i>, which quantifies the degree to which an individual’s samples are relatively similar to one another, without restricting the data to be univariate, Gaussian, or even Euclidean. Using this statistic, we introduce the possibility of optimizing experimental design via increasing discriminability and prove that optimizing discriminability improves performance bounds in subsequent inference tasks. In extensive simulated and real datasets (focusing on brain imaging and demonstrating on genomics), only optimizing data <i>discriminability</i> improves performance on all subsequent inference tasks for each dataset. We therefore suggest that designing experiments and analyses to optimize discriminability may be a crucial step in solving the replicability crisis, and more generally, mitigating accidental measurement error.

                <p>by Milad Ghomlaghi, Guang Yang, Sungyoung Shin, David E. James, Lan K. Nguyen</p>

The PI3K/MTOR signalling network regulates a broad array of critical cellular processes, including cell growth, metabolism and autophagy. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) kinase functions as a core catalytic subunit in two physically and functionally distinct complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2, which also share other common components including MLST8 (also known as GβL) and DEPTOR. Despite intensive research, how mTORC1 and 2 assembly and activity are coordinated, and how they are functionally linked remain to be fully characterized. This is due in part to the complex network wiring, featuring multiple feedback loops and intricate post-translational modifications. Here, we integrate predictive network modelling, <i>in vitro</i> experiments and -omics data analysis to elucidate the emergent dynamic behaviour of the PI3K/MTOR network. We construct new mechanistic models that encapsulate critical mechanistic details, including mTORC1/2 coordination by MLST8 (de)ubiquitination and the Akt-to-mTORC2 positive feedback loop. Model simulations validated by experimental studies revealed a previously unknown biphasic, threshold-gated dependence of mTORC1 activity on the key mTORC2 subunit SIN1, which is robust against cell-to-cell variation in protein expression. In addition, our integrative analysis demonstrates that ubiquitination of MLST8, which is reversed by OTUD7B, is regulated by IRS1/2. Our results further support the essential role of MLST8 in enabling both mTORC1 and 2’s activity and suggest MLST8 as a viable therapeutic target in breast cancer. Overall, our study reports a new mechanistic model of PI3K/MTOR signalling incorporating MLST8-mediated mTORC1/2 formation and unveils a novel regulatory linkage between mTORC1 and mTORC2.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cerebellar complex spikes multiplex complementary behavioral information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Akshay Markanday, Junya Inoue, Peter W. Dicke, Peter Thier</p>

Purkinje cell (PC) discharge, the only output of cerebellar cortex, involves 2 types of action potentials, high-frequency simple spikes (SSs) and low-frequency complex spikes (CSs). While there is consensus that SSs convey information needed to optimize movement kinematics, the function of CSs, determined by the PC’s climbing fiber input, remains controversial. While initially thought to be specialized in reporting information on motor error for the subsequent amendment of behavior, CSs seem to contribute to other aspects of motor behavior as well. When faced with the bewildering diversity of findings and views unraveled by highly specific tasks, one may wonder if there is just one true function with all the other attributions wrong? Or is the diversity of findings a reflection of distinct pools of PCs, each processing specific streams of information conveyed by climbing fibers? With these questions in mind, we recorded CSs from the monkey oculomotor vermis deploying a repetitive saccade task that entailed sizable motor errors as well as small amplitude saccades, correcting them. We demonstrate that, in addition to carrying error-related information, CSs carry information on the metrics of both primary and small corrective saccades in a time-specific manner, with changes in CS firing probability coupled with changes in CS duration. Furthermore, we also found CS activity that seemed to predict the upcoming events. Hence PCs receive a multiplexed climbing fiber input that merges complementary streams of information on the behavior, separable by the recipient PC because they are staggered in time.

                <p>by Jai Y. Yu, Loren M. Frank</p>

The receptive field of a neuron describes the regions of a stimulus space where the neuron is consistently active. Sparse spiking outside of the receptive field is often considered to be noise, rather than a reflection of information processing. Whether this characterization is accurate remains unclear. We therefore contrasted the sparse, temporally isolated spiking of hippocampal CA1 place cells to the consistent, temporally adjacent spiking seen within their spatial receptive fields (“place fields”). We found that isolated spikes, which occur during locomotion, are strongly phase coupled to hippocampal theta oscillations and transiently express coherent nonlocal spatial representations. Further, prefrontal cortical activity is coordinated with and can predict the occurrence of future isolated spiking events. Rather than local noise within the hippocampus, sparse, isolated place cell spiking reflects a coordinated cortical–hippocampal process consistent with the generation of nonlocal scenario representations during active navigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Integrating evidence-based interventions in clinical settings in Jordan: a policy brief [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Evidence-based nursing practice (EBNP) is considered a major and very important global paradigm shift. Unfortunately, most healthcare providers and researchers embrace the concept of evidence-based practice (EBP) without integrating this concept in clinical settings. The current situation of EBP and new practice guidelines utilization in Jordan are scarce. This policy brief aimed to discusses the process of utilizing nursing EBP in clinical settings in Jordan. Methods: The authors adopted an action plan utilizing a systematic approach to develop and implement specific strategies and policies to integrate EBP in clinical settings in Jordanian hospitals. We present an experience of one country in terms of introducing a policy brief to establish an EBP policy accompanied by developing an EBP unit in the hospital's country. Results: A comprehensive description of this policy is provided with reference to the eminent steps of policy analysis and evaluation. In fact, EBP policies and clinical practice guidelines should keep a live document and revise regularly or as needed. Overall, the authors suggest the development of a unit for EBP to deal with issues related to clinical practice guidelines. Conclusions: Expected outcomes for the introduction of the EBP unit and its policy include increase research utilization and accelerated adoption of new evidence, increase the quality of care provided, increase patient, staff, and managers satisfaction, and decrease staff workload by reducing complications associated with medical errors and outdated interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 impact: Customised economic stimulus package recommender system using machine learning techniques [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Malaysian government reacted to the pandemic’s economic effect with the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package (ESP) to cushion the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) impact on households. The ESP consists of cash assistance, utility discount, moratorium, Employee Provident Fund (EPF) cash withdrawals, credit guarantee scheme and wage subsidies. A survey carried out by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) shows that households prefer different types of financial assistance. These preferences forge the need to effectively customise ESPs to manage the economic burden among low-income households. In this study, a recommender system for such ESPs was designed by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. Methods: This study used a dataset from DOSM titled “Effects of COVID-19 on the Economy and Individual - Round 2,” collected from April 10 to April 24, 2020. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining was followed to develop machine learning models to classify ESP receivers according to their preferred subsidies types. Four machine learning techniques—Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes—were used to build the predictive models for each moratorium, utility discount and EPF and Private Remuneration Scheme (PRS) cash withdrawals subsidies. The best predictive model was selected based on F-score metrics. Results: Among the four machine learning techniques, Gradient Boosted Tree outperformed the rest. This technique predicted the following: moratorium preferences with 93.8% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 87.6% F-score; utilities discount with 86% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 84% F-score; and EPF and PRS with 83.6% sensitivity, 81.2% precision and 82.4% F-score. Households that prefer moratorium subsidies did not favour other financial aids except for cash assistance.  Conclusion: Findings present machine learning models that can predict individual household preferences from ESP. These models can be used to design customised ESPs that can effectively manage the financial burden of low-income households.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Digital signature schemes with strong existential unforgeability [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Digital signature schemes (DSS) are ubiquitously used for public authentication in the infrastructure of the internet, in addition to their use as a cryptographic tool to construct even more sophisticated schemes such as those that are identity-based. The security of DSS is analyzed through the existential unforgeability under chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) experiment which promises unforgeability of signatures on new messages even when the attacker has access to an arbitrary set of messages and their corresponding signatures. However, the EUF-CMA model does not account for attacks such as an attacker forging a different signature on an existing message, even though the attack could be devastating in the real world and constitutes a severe breach of the security system. Nonetheless, most of the DSS are not analyzed in this security model, which possibly makes them vulnerable to such an attack. In contrast, a better security notion known as strong EUF-CMA (sEUF-CMA) is designed to be resistant to such attacks. This review aims to identify DSS in the literature that are secure in the sEUF-CMA model. In addition, the article discusses the challenges and future directions of DSS. In our review, we consider the security of existing DSS that fit our criterion in the sEUF-CMA model; our criterion is simple as we only require the DSS to be at least secure against the minimum of existential forgery. Our findings are categorized into two classes: the direct and indirect classes of sEUF-CMA. The former is inherently sEUF-CMA without any modification while the latter requires some transformation. Our comprehensive  review contributes to the security and cryptographic research community by discussing the efficiency and security of DSS that are sEUF-CMA, which aids in selecting robust DSS in future design considerations.

                The Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program integrates biological and neural information to create anatomical and functional maps of the peripheral nervous system. The SPARC Portal hosts a dynamic storage for the datasets, models, and resources to help the researchers find and produce data. Currently, the SPARC Portal provides a primary search tool, which lacks some features to improve the search experience. To purposefully retrieve the required information from the stored datasets and resources, we have developed an Advanced QUery Architecture (AQUA) for the SPARC Portal. Near-real-time auto-completion of the queries, close-matches suggestions, and multiple filters to narrow or sort the results are the major features of AQUA with the goal to enhance the usability of the SPARC search engine. AQUA is available from: https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/aqua

                Background Antioxidants show nephroprotective effect against vancomycin associated nephrotoxicity (VAN) in animals. This study aimed to assess the ascorbic acid nephro-protective role against VAN clinically. Methods Forty-one critically ill patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: intervention group (vancomycin IV plus ascorbic acid, n=21) or control group (vancomycin IV only, n=20). Primary outcomes were the incidence of VAN and the absolute change in creatinine parameters, while mortality rate was the secondary outcome. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (S.cr) by at least 0.5 mg/dL or 50% of baseline for at least two successive measurements. This study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03921099), April 2019. Results Mean absolute S.cr increase was significant when compared between both groups, P-value = 0.036, where S.cr increased by 0.05(0.12) and 0.34(0.55) mg/dL in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Mean absolute Cr.cl decline was significant when compared between both groups, P-value = 0.04, where Cr.cl was decreased by 5.9(17.8) and 22.3(30.4) ml/min in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Incidence of VAN was 1/21(4.7%) versus 5/20(25%) in the intervention and control groups, respectively (RR: 0.19; CI: 0.024–1.49; P-value = 0.093). Mortality was higher in the control group; however, it was not statistically significant, P-value = 0.141. Conclusion Co-administration of ascorbic acid with vancomycin preserved renal function and reduced the absolute risk of VAN by 20.3%, however, the reduction in VAN incidence didn’t reach statistical significance level. Further large multicenter prospective trials are recommended.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Any neuron can perform linearly non-separable computations [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Multiple studies have shown how dendrites enable some neurons to perform linearly non-separable computations. These works focus on cells with an extended dendritic arbor where voltage can vary independently, turning dendritic branches into local non-linear subunits. However, these studies leave a large fraction of the nervous system unexplored. Many neurons, e.g. granule cells, have modest dendritic trees and are electrically compact. It is impossible to decompose them into multiple independent subunits. Here, we upgraded the integrate and fire neuron to account for saturating dendrites. This artificial neuron has a unique membrane voltage and can be seen as a single layer. We present a class of linearly non-separable computations and how our neuron can perform them. We thus demonstrate that even a single layer neuron with dendrites has more computational capacity than without. Because any neuron has one or more layer, and all dendrites do saturate, we show that any dendrited neuron can implement linearly non-separable computations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A visual approach towards forward collision warning for autonomous vehicles on Malaysian public roads [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autonomous vehicles are important in smart transportation. Although exciting progress has been made, it remains challenging to design a safety mechanism for autonomous vehicles despite uncertainties and obstacles that occur dynamically on the road. Collision detection and avoidance are indispensable for a reliable decision-making module in autonomous driving. Methods: This study presents a robust approach for forward collision warning using vision data for autonomous vehicles on Malaysian public roads. The proposed architecture combines environment perception and lane localization to define a safe driving region for the ego vehicle. If potential risks are detected in the safe driving region, a warning will be triggered. The early warning is important to help avoid rear-end collision. Besides, an adaptive lane localization method that considers geometrical structure of the road is presented to deal with different road types. Results: Precision scores of mean average precision (mAP) 0.5, mAP 0.95 and recall of 0.14, 0.06979 and 0.6356 were found in this study. Conclusions: Experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach under different lighting and environmental conditions.

                Background: Vaccine hesitancy (VH) has been identified by the World Health Organization as one among the top ten threats to global public health. There is limited literature regarding VH from developing countries like India. Methods: In this facility based cross-sectional study, 172 mothers of under-five children were assessed regarding VH using the parental attitude towards childhood vaccination questionnaire (PACV). Results: The prevalence of VH was 3.4% (n=6). Only 7.6% (n=13) of the study participants had ever refused vaccination for their child and the most common reason cited for their refusal was that they thought it was not safe (n=6). Government health facilities was the place of routine immunization for 60.5% (n=104) participants. Health care providers (n =79, 46%) were the major source of information regarding vaccines. Conclusions: Our study highlights the presence of very low prevalence of VH in Mangalore compared to similar studies from India and other parts of the world. The limited number of participants had refused vaccination due to concerns related to vaccine safety.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Comparative description of the mRNA expression profile of Na+/K+‐ATPase isoforms in adult mouse nervous system</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in genes encoding Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1, α2, and α3 subunits cause a wide range of disabling neurological disorders, and dysfunction of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may contribute to neuronal injury in stroke and dementia. To better understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is important to determine the expression patterns of the different Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase subunits within the brain and among specific cell types. Using two available scRNA-Seq databases from the adult mouse nervous system, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of the different isoforms of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α, β and <i>Fxyd</i> subunits at the single-cell level among brain regions and various neuronal populations. We subsequently identified specific types of neurons enriched with transcripts for α1 and α3 isoforms and elaborated how α3-expressing neuronal populations govern cerebellar neuronal circuits. We further analyzed the co-expression network for α1 and α3 isoforms, highlighting the genes that positively correlated with α1 and α3 expression. The top 10 genes for α1 were <i>Chn2</i>, <i>Hpcal1</i>, <i>Nrgn</i>, <i>Neurod1</i>, <i>Selm</i>, <i>Kcnc1</i>, <i>Snrk</i>, <i>Snap25</i>, <i>Ckb</i> and <i>Ccndbp1</i> and for α3 were <i>Sorcs3</i>, <i>Eml5</i>, <i>Neurod2</i>, <i>Ckb</i>, <i>Tbc1d4</i>, <i>Ptprz1</i>, <i>Pvrl1</i>, <i>Kirrel3</i>, <i>Pvalb</i>, and <i>Asic2</i>.</p>

                Liu et al. perform integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptomes to characterize the inflammatory signatures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with COVID-19, sepsis, and HIV infection. Analysis of heterogeneity among COVID-19 patients reveals a “three-stage” model, which is related to the hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive signatures in monocytes.

                Jette et al. characterize antibodies derived from convalescent COVID-19 donors that broadly recognize sarbecoviruses and neutralize ACE2-tropic strains, including all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Structures reveal binding to a highly conserved RBD epitope using long CDRH3 loops, with an orientation that inhibits ACE2 binding to the RBD and allows IgG avidity.

We report an exact expression for these marginals in the form of a model of interacting binary variables with the explicit form of the interactions depending on the hidden node activation function. We study the properties of these interactions in detail and evaluate how the accuracy with which the RBM approximates distributions over binary variables depends on the hidden node activation function and the number of hidden nodes. When the inferred RBM parameters are weak, an intuitive pattern is found for the expression of the interaction terms, which reduces substantially the differences across activation functions. We show that the weak parameter approximation is a good approximation for different RBMs trained on the MNIST data set. Interestingly, in these cases, the mapping reveals that the inferred models are essentially low order interaction models.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Active inference (ActInf) is an emerging theory that explains perception and action in biological agents in terms of minimizing a free energy bound on Bayesian surprise. Goal-directed behavior is elicited by introducing prior beliefs on the underlying generative model. In contrast to prior beliefs, which constrain all realizations of a random variable, we propose an alternative approach through chance constraints, which allow for a (typically small) probability of constraint violation, and demonstrate how such constraints can be used as intrinsic drivers for goal-directed behavior in ActInf. We illustrate how chance-constrained ActInf weights all imposed (prior) constraints on the generative model, allowing, for example, for a trade-off between robust control and empirical chance constraint violation. Second, we interpret the proposed solution within a message passing framework. Interestingly, the message passing interpretation is not only relevant to the context of ActInf, but also provides a general-purpose approach that can account for chance constraints on graphical models. The chance constraint message updates can then be readily combined with other prederived message update rules without the need for custom derivations. The proposed chance-constrained message passing framework thus accelerates the search for workable models in general and can be used to complement message-passing formulations on generative neural models.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The transformation of synaptic input into action potential in nerve cells is strongly influenced by the morphology of the dendritic arbor as well as the synaptic efficacy map. The multiplicity of dendritic branches strikingly enables a single cell to act as a highly nonlinear processing element. Studies have also found functional synaptic clustering whereby synapses that encode a common sensory feature are spatially clustered together on the branches. Motivated by these findings, here we introduce a multibranch formal model of the neuron that can integrate synaptic inputs nonlinearly through collective action of its dendritic branches and yields synaptic clustering. An analysis in support of its use as a computational building block is offered. Also offered is an accompanying gradient descent–based learning algorithm. The model unit spans a wide spectrum of nonlinearities, including the parity problem, and can outperform the multilayer perceptron in generalizing to unseen data. The occurrence of synaptic clustering boosts the generalization efficiency of the unit, which may also be the answer for the puzzling ubiquity of synaptic clustering in the real neurons. Our theoretical analysis is backed up by simulations. The study could pave the way to new artificial neural networks.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework in neuroscience that offers a unified theory of brain function. It is also proposed as a framework for planning in AI. Unfortunately, the complex mathematics required to create new models can impede application of active inference in neuroscience and AI research. This letter addresses this problem by providing a complete mathematical treatment of the active inference framework in discrete time and state spaces and the derivation of the update equations for any new model. We leverage the theoretical connection between active inference and variational message passing as described by John Winn and Christopher M. Bishop in 2005. Since variational message passing is a well-defined methodology for deriving Bayesian belief update equations, this letter opens the door to advanced generative models for active inference. We show that using a fully factorized variational distribution simplifies the expected free energy, which furnishes priors over policies so that agents seek unambiguous states. Finally, we consider future extensions that support deep tree searches for sequential policy optimization based on structure learning and belief propagation.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Up to now, modern machine learning (ML) has been based on approximating big data sets with high-dimensional functions, taking advantage of huge computational resources. We show that biologically inspired neuron models such as the leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron provide novel and efficient ways of information processing. They can be integrated in machine learning models and are a potential target to improve ML performance. Thus, we have derived simple update rules for LIF units to numerically integrate the differential equations. We apply a surrogate gradient approach to train the LIF units via backpropagation. We demonstrate that tuning the leak term of the LIF neurons can be used to run the neurons in different operating modes, such as simple signal integrators or coincidence detectors. Furthermore, we show that the constant surrogate gradient, in combination with tuning the leak term of the LIF units, can be used to achieve the learning dynamics of more complex surrogate gradients.To prove the validity of our method, we applied it to established image data sets (the Oxford 102 flower data set, MNIST), implemented various network architectures, used several input data encodings and demonstrated that the method is suitable to achieve state-of-the-art classification performance.We provide our method as well as further surrogate gradient methods to train spiking neural networks via backpropagation as an open-source KERAS package to make it available to the neuroscience and machine learning community. To increase the interpretability of the underlying effects and thus make a small step toward opening the black box of machine learning, we provide interactive illustrations, with the possibility of systematically monitoring the effects of parameter changes on the learning characteristics.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Synapses change on multiple timescales, ranging from milliseconds to minutes, due to a combination of both short- and long-term plasticity. Here we develop an extension of the common generalized linear model to infer both short- and long-term changes in the coupling between a pre- and postsynaptic neuron based on observed spiking activity. We model short-term synaptic plasticity using additive effects that depend on the presynaptic spike timing, and we model long-term changes in both synaptic weight and baseline firing rate using point process adaptive smoothing. Using simulations, we first show that this model can accurately recover time-varying synaptic weights (1) for both depressing and facilitating synapses, (2) with a variety of long-term changes (including realistic changes, such as due to STDP), (3) with a range of pre and postsynaptic firing rates, and (4) for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We then apply our model to two experimentally recorded putative synaptic connections. We find that simultaneously tracking fast changes in synaptic weights, slow changes in synaptic weights, and unexplained variations in baseline firing is essential. Omitting any one of these factors can lead to spurious inferences for the others. Altogether, this model provides a flexible framework for tracking short- and long-term variation in spike transmission.</span>

Efforts to incorporate biological constraints and Dale's principle will help elucidate the neural representations and mechanisms of underlying circuits. We trained an excitatory-inhibitory RNN to learn neural sequences in a supervised manner and studied the representations and dynamic attractors of the trained network. The trained RNN was robust to trigger the sequence in response to various input signals and interpolated a time-warped input for sequence representation. Interestingly, a learned sequence can repeat periodically when the RNN evolved beyond the duration of a single sequence. The eigenspectrum of the learned recurrent connectivity matrix with growing or damping modes, together with the RNN's nonlinearity, were adequate to generate a limit cycle attractor. We further examined the stability of dynamic attractors while training the RNN to learn two sequences. Together, our results provide a general framework for understanding neural sequence representation in the excitatory-inhibitory RNN.</span>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic and stable brain connectivity during movie watching as revealed by functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                Spatially remote brain regions show synchronized activity as typically revealed by correlated functional MRI (fMRI) signals. An emerging line of research has focused on the temporal fluctuations of connectivity, however, its relationships with stable connectivity have not been clearly illustrated. We examined the stable and dynamic connectivity from fMRI data when the participants watched four different movie clips. Using inter-individual correlation, we were able to estimate functionally meaningful dynamic connectivity associated with different movies. Widespread consistent dynamic connectivity was observed for each movie clip as well as their differences between clips. A cartoon movie clip showed higher consistent dynamic connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus, while a court drama clip showed higher dynamic connectivity with the auditory cortex and temporoparietal junction, which suggest the involvement of specific brain processing for different movie contents. In contrast, stable connectivity was highly similar among the movie clips, and showed fewer statistical significant differences. The patterns of dynamic connectivity had higher accuracy for classifications of different movie clips than the stable connectivity and regional activity. These results support the functional significance of dynamic connectivity in reflecting functional brain changes, which could provide more functionally related information than stable connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gli1 regulates the postnatal acquisition of peripheral nerve architecture</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral nerves are organized into discrete cellular compartments. Axons, Schwann cells (SCs), and endoneurial fibroblasts (EFs) reside within the endoneurium and are surrounded by the perineurium - a cellular sheath comprised of layers of perineurial glia (PNG). SC secretion of Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) regulates this organization. In Dhh nulls, the perineurium is deficient and the endoneurium is subdivided into small compartments termed minifascicles. Human Dhh mutations cause a peripheral neuropathy with similar defects. Here we examine the role of Gli1, a canonical transcriptional effector of hedgehog signaling, in regulating peripheral nerve organization. We identify PNG, EFs, and pericytes as Gli1-expressing cells by genetic fate mapping. Although expression of Dhh by SCs and Gli1 in target cells is coordinately regulated with myelination, Gli1 expression unexpectedly persists in Dhh null EFs. Thus, Gli1 is expressed in EFs non-canonically i.e., independent of hedgehog signaling. Gli1 and Dhh also have non-redundant activities. In contrast to Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls have a normal perineurium. Like Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls form minifascicles, which we show likely arise from EFs. Thus, Dhh and Gli1 are independent signals: Gli1 is dispensable for perineurial development but functions cooperatively with Dhh to drive normal endoneurial development. During development, Gli1 also regulates endoneurial extracellular matrix production, nerve vascular organization, and has modest, non-autonomous effects on SC sorting and myelination of axons. Finally, in adult nerves, induced deletion of Gli1 is sufficient to drive minifascicle formation. Thus, Gli1 regulates the development and is required to maintain the endoneurial architecture of peripheral nerves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic sodium bromide treatment relieves autistic-like behavioral deficits in three mouse models of autism</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders whose diagnosis relies on deficient social interaction and communication together with repetitive behavior. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved that ameliorates social behavior in patients with ASD. Based on the excitation/inhibition imbalance theory of autism, we hypothesized that bromide ions, long used as an antiepileptic medication, could relieve core symptoms of ASD. We evaluated the effects of chronic sodium bromide (NaBr) administration on autistic-like symptoms in three genetic mouse models of autism: Oprm1-/- , Fmr1-/- and Shank3{Delta}ex13-16-/- mice. We showed that chronic NaBr treatment relieved autistic-like behaviors in these three models. In Oprm1-/- mice, these beneficial effects were superior to those of chronic bumetanide administration. At transcriptional level, chronic NaBr in Oprm1 null mice was associated with increased expression of genes coding for chloride ions transporters, GABAA receptor subunits, oxytocin and mGlu4 receptor. Lastly, we uncovered synergistic alleviating effects of chronic NaBr and a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of mGlu4 receptor on autistic-like behavior in Oprm1-/- mice. We evidenced in heterologous cells that bromide ions behave as PAMs of mGlu4, providing a molecular mechanism for such synergy. Our data reveal the therapeutic potential of bromide ions, alone or in combination with a PAM of mGlu4 receptor, for the treatment of ASDs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The calcium sensor synaptotagmin-1 is critical for phasic axonal dopamine release in the striatum and mesencephalon, but is dispensable for basic motor behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, a population of cells that are critical for motor control, motivated behaviors and cognition, release DA via an exocytotic mechanism from both their axonal terminals and their somatodendritic (STD) compartment. In Parkinson's disease (PD), it is striking that motor dysfunctions only become apparent after extensive loss of DA innervation. Although it has been hypothesized that this resilience is due to the ability of many motor behaviors to be sustained through a basal tone of DA and diffuse transmission, experimental evidence for this is limited. Here we conditionally deleted the calcium sensor synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) in DA neurons (cKODA mice) to abrogate most activity-dependent axonal DA release in the striatum and mesencephalon, leaving STD DA release intact. Strikingly, Syt1 cKODA mice showed intact performance in multiple unconditioned DA-dependent motor tasks, suggesting that activity-dependent DA release is dispensable for such basic motor functions. Basal extracellular levels of DA in the striatum were unchanged, suggesting that a basal tone of extracellular DA is sufficient to sustain basic movement. We also found multiple adaptations in the DA system of cKODA mice, similar to those happening at early stages of PD. Taken together, our findings reveal the striking resilience of DA-dependent motor functions in the context of a near-abolition of phasic DA release, shedding new light on why extensive loss of DA innervation is required to reveal motor dysfunctions in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GABA and IA Independently Regulate rNST Responses to Afferent Input</a></h4>

              
                Taste responses in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) influence motivated ingestive behavior via ascending pathways, and consummatory reflex behavior via local, brainstem connections. Modifications to the afferent signal within the rNST include changes in gain (the overall rate of neuron activity) and changes in gustatory tuning (the degree to which individual neurons respond to divergent gustatory qualities). These alterations of the sensory signal derive from both synaptic interactions within the nucleus and the constitutive cellular membrane properties of rNST neurons. GABA neurons are well represented within the rNST, as is expression of KV4.3, a channel for a rapidly inactivating outward K+ current (IA). GABAergic synapses suppress rNST responses to afferent input and previous studies showed that this suppression is greater in cells expressing IA, suggesting a possible interaction. Here, we examine the potential interaction between GABAergic inhibition and IA channels in a series of patch clamp experiments. Optogenetic release of GABA suppressed rNST responses to afferent (electrical) stimulation and this effect was greater in cells with IA, confirming an earlier report. We further observed that the composite inhibitory postsynaptic potential was larger in IA positive cells, suggesting one mechanism for the greater afferent suppression. Blocking IA with the channel blocker AmmTX3, enhanced the response to afferent stimulation, suggesting a suppressive role for this channel in regulating afferent input at rest. However, pharmacologic blockade of IA did not suppress GABAergic inhibition, indicating that IA and GABA independently regulate excitatory afferent input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Role for Visual Areas in Physics Simulations</a></h4>

              
                To engage with the world, we must regularly make predictions about the outcomes of physical scenes. How do we make these predictions? Recent evidence points to simulation - the idea that we can introspectively manipulate rich, mental models of the world - as one possible explanation for how such predictions are accomplished. While theories based on simulation are supported by computational models, neuroscientific evidence for simulation is lacking and many important questions remain. For instance, do simulations simply entail a series of abstract computations? Or are they supported by sensory representations of the objects that comprise the scene being simulated? We posit the latter and suggest that the process of simulating a sequence of physical interactions is likely to evoke an imagery-like envisioning of those interactions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that when participants predict how a ball will fall through an obstacle-filled display, motion-sensitive brain regions are activated. We further demonstrate that this activity, which occurs even though no motion is being sensed, resembles activity patterns that arise while participants perceive the ball's motion. This finding suggests that the process of simulating the ball's movement is accompanied by a sensory representation of this movement. These data thus demonstrate that mental simulations recreate sensory depictions of how a physical scene is likely to unfold.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Environmental and molecular modulation of motor individuality in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Innate behavioral biases such as human handedness are a ubiquitous form of inter-individual variation that are not strictly hardwired into the genome and are influenced by diverse internal and external cues. Yet, genetic and environmental factors modulating behavioral variation remain poorly understood, especially in vertebrates. To identify genetic and environmental factors that influence behavioral variation, we take advantage of larval zebrafish light-search behavior. During light-search, individuals preferentially turn in leftward or rightward loops, in which directional bias is sustained and non-heritable, and maintained by a habenula-rostral PT circuit. Here we use a medium-throughput recording strategy and unbiased analysis to show that significant individual to individual variation exists in wildtype larval zebrafish turning preference. We classify stable left, right, and unbiased turning types, with most individuals exhibiting a directional preference. Raising larvae at elevated temperature selectively reduces the leftward turning type and impacts rostral PT neurons, specifically. Exposure to conspecifics, variable salinity, environmental enrichment, and physical disturbance does not significantly impact inter-individual turning bias. Pharmacological manipulation of Notch signaling and carrying a mutant allele of a known Notch pathway affecter gene, gsx2, disrupted turn bias individuality in a dose-dependent manner. These results establish that larval zebrafish is a powerful vertebrate model for inter-individual variation with sensitivity to specific environmental perturbations and gene dosage.

                The ligand-sensing transcription factor Nurr1 emerges as a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative pathologies but Nurr1 ligands for functional studies and therapeutic validation are lacking. Here we report pronounced Nurr1 modulation by statins for which clinically relevant neuroprotective effects have been demonstrated. Several statins directly affected Nurr1 activity in cellular and cell-free settings with low micromolar to sub-micromolar potencies. Simvastatin exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in astrocytes which were abrogated by Nurr1 knockdown. Differential gene expression analysis in native and Nurr1 silenced cells revealed strong proinflammatory effects of Nurr1 knockdown while simvastatin treatment induced several neuroprotective mechanisms via Nurr1, for example, in energy utilization and reduced apoptosis. These findings suggest Nurr1 involvement in the well-documented but mechanistically elusive neuroprotection by statins.

                Microglia has been reported to be able to regulate the proliferation, differentiation and survival of adult Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) by modulating the microenvironment, which results in different consequences of adult neurogenesis. However, whether the microglial activation is beneficial or harmful to NSPCs is still controversial because of the complexity and variability of microglial activation phenotypes. In this study, we detected the expression levels of M1 marker and M2 marker in IFN-{gamma}- and IL-4-induced microglia at different time, respectively. The phenotypic markers of M1 and M2 microglia were stable for 24 h after removal of IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 intervention, but exhibited different change patterns during the next 24 h. Then, the adult NSPCs were treated by the conditioned medium from IFN-{gamma}- and IL-4-activated microglia. The conditioned medium from IFN-{gamma}-activated microglia promoted apoptosis and astroglial differentiation of NSPCs, while suppressed proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSPCs. However, the conditioned medium from IL-4-activated microglia exhibited opposite effects on these physiological processes. In addition, the direct treatment of IFN-{gamma} or IL-4 alone did not significantly affect the proliferation, differentiation and survival of NSPCs. These results suggest that the secretome of pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) microglia differently regulated the proliferation, differentiation and survival of adult NSPCs. These findings will help further study the biological mechanism of microglia regulating neurogenesis, and provide a therapeutic strategy for neurological diseases by regulating microglial phenotypes to affect neurogenesis.

                GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells in the olfactory bulb are proposed to mediate an intraglomerular high-pass filter through inhibition targeted onto a glomerulus. With this mechanism, weak stimuli (e.g., an odor with a low affinity for an odorant receptor) mainly produce PG cell-driven inhibition but strong stimuli generate enough excitation to overcome inhibition. PG cells may be particularly susceptible to being activated by weak stimuli due to their intrinsically small size and high input resistance. Here, we used dual-cell patch-clamp recordings and imaging methods in bulb slices obtained from wild-type and transgenic rats with labeled GABAergic cells to test a number of predictions of the high-pass filtering model. We first directly compared the responsiveness of PG cells with that of external tufted cells (eTCs), which are a class of excitatory interneurons that reside in a parallel but opposing position in the glomerular circuitry. PG cells were in fact found to be no more responsive than eTCs at low levels of sensory neuron activity. While PG cells required smaller currents to be excited, this advantage was offset by the fact that a given level of sensory neuron activity produced much smaller synaptic currents. We did however identify other factors that shaped the excitation/inhibition balance in a manner that would support a high-pass filter, including glial glutamate transporters and presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. We conclude that a single glomerulus may act as a high-pass filter to enhance the contrast between different olfactory stimuli through mechanisms that are largely independent cell intrinsic properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term in vivo imaging of mouse spinal cord through an optically cleared intervertebral window</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord, as part of the central nervous system, accounts for the main communication pathway between the brain and the peripheral nervous system. Spinal cord injury is a devastating and largely irreversible neurological trauma, and can result in lifelong disability and paralysis with no available cure. In vivo spinal cord imaging in mouse models without introducing immunological artifacts is critical to understand spinal cord pathology and discover effective treatments. We developed a minimal-invasive intervertebral window by retaining ligamentum flavum to protect the underlying spinal cord. By introducing an optical clearing method, we achieved repeated two-photon fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering imaging at subcellular resolution with up to 16 imaging sessions over 167 days and observed no inflammatory response. Using this optically cleared intervertebral window, we studied the neuron-glia dynamics following laser axotomy and observed strengthened contact of microglia with the nodes of Ranvier during axonal degeneration. By enabling long-term, repetitive, stable, high-resolution and inflammation-free imaging of mouse spinal cord, our method provides a reliable platform in the research aiming at understanding and treatment of spinal cord pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward enhances memory via age-varying online and offline neural mechanisms across development</a></h4>

              
                Reward motivation enhances memory through interactions between mesolimbic, hippocampal, and cortical systems - both during and after encoding. Developmental changes in these distributed neural circuits may lead to age-related differences in reward-motivated memory and the underlying neural mechanisms. Converging evidence from cross-species studies suggests that subcortical dopamine signaling is increased during adolescence, which may lead to stronger memory representations of rewarding, relative to mundane, events and changes in the contributions of underlying subcortical and cortical brain mechanisms across age. Here, we used fMRI to examine how reward motivation influences the "online" encoding and "offline" post-encoding brain mechanisms that support long-term associative memory from childhood to adulthood. We found that reward motivation led to both age-invariant as well as adolescent-specific enhancements in associative memory after 24 hours. Furthermore, reward-related memory benefits were linked to age-varying neural mechanisms. During encoding, interactions between the prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were associated with better high-reward memory to a greater degree with increasing age. Pre- to post-encoding changes in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and VTA were also associated with better high-reward memory, but more so at younger ages. Our findings suggest that there may be developmental shifts - from offline subcortical to online cortical processes - in the brain mechanisms supporting reward-motivated memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Crocin inhibited amyloid-beta (Aβ) generation via promoting non-amyloidogenic APP processing and suppressed ER stress UPR signaling in N2a/APP cells</a></h4>

              
                Background: Crocin is a major active component of saffron (Crocus sativus) with many beneficial effects. More recently, crocin has been proposed for management of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we demonstrated for the first time that crocin reduced amyloid-beta generation through promoting alpha cleavage of APP processing and inhibited ER stress by attenuating UPR signaling in N2a/APP cells. Methodology: Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells stably transfected with the Swedish mutant APP (N2a/APP) was used as a cellular model for AD pathogenesis. Vector transfected cells (N2a/vector) were employed to serve as control. The toxicity of crocin was first evaluated and non-toxic treatment of crocin (>30 micromolar for 24 h) was used for further investigations. Amyloid beta levels were determined by ELISA. Expression levels of UPR signaling proteins were determined by using Western blot. Results: Crocin significantly inhibited the protein expression of total APP in N2a/APP cells and promoted alpha cleavage of APP processing to increase sAPPalpha generation, but only modestly reduced BACE-1 and PS1, suggesting amyloid beta reduction by crocin was mainly associated with the non-amyloidogenic APP processing. Further investigation on ER stress related protein expressions showed that GRP78, CHOP, p-PERK, p-eIF2alpha, p-IREalpha, XBP1, ATF6alpha, and PDI were all significantly elevated in N2a/APP cells compared to N2a/vector. Crocin effectively reduced the levels of GRP78 and CHOP, and significantly inhibited p-PERK/p-eIF2, and AT6, while slightly reduced p-IRE1alpha. Conclusion: The present study showed that crocin was effective at blocking amyloid beta generation and inhibiting ER stress associated overactivation of UPR signaling in AD cell model N2a/APP. The results provided evidence for crocin as useful natural product for the treatment of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Divergent encoding of active avoidance behavior in corticostriatal and corticolimbic projections</a></h4>

              
                Active avoidance behavior, in which an animal performs an action to avoid a stressor, is crucial for survival and may provide insight into avoidance behaviors seen in anxiety disorders. Active avoidance requires the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which is thought to regulate avoidance via downstream projections to the striatum and amygdala. However, the endogenous activity of projection-defined dmPFC subpopulations during active avoidance learning remains unexplored. Here we utilized fiber photometry to record from the dmPFC and its downstream projections to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during active avoidance learning in mice. We examined neural activity during conditioned stimulus (CS) presentations, active avoidance, and cued freezing. Both prefrontal projections showed learning-related increases in activity during CS onset throughout active avoidance training. The dmPFC as a whole showed increased activity during avoidance and decreased activity during cued freezing. Finally, dmPFC-DMS and dmPFC-BLA projections showed divergent encoding of active avoidance behavior, with the dmPFC-DMS projection showing increased activity and the dmPFC-BLA showing decreased activity during active avoidance. Our results identify differential prefrontal encoding of active and passive coping behaviors in the same behavioral paradigm and demonstrate divergent encoding of active avoidance in projection-specific dmPFC subpopulations.

	<p>Accurate identification of the prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in adults with Down syndrome (MCI-DS) has been challenging because there are no established diagnostic criteria that can be applied for people with lifelong intellectual disabilities (ID). As such, the sequence of cognitive decline in adults with DS has been difficult to ascertain, and it is possible that domain constructs characterizing cognitive function in neurotypical adults do not generalize to this high-risk population. The present study examined associations among multiple measures of cognitive function in adults with DS, either prior to or during the prodromal stage of AD to determine, through multiple statistical techniques, the measures that reflected the same underlying domains of processing. Participants included 144 adults with DS 40–82 years of age, all enrolled in a larger, multidisciplinary study examining biomarkers of AD in adults with DS. All participants had mild or moderate lifelong intellectual disabilities. Overall AD-related clinical status was rated for each individual during a personalized consensus conference that considered performance as well as health status, with 103 participants considered cognitively stable (CS) and 41 to have MCI-DS. Analyses of 17 variables derived from 10 tests of cognition indicated that performance reflected three underlying factors: language/executive function, memory, and visuomotor. All three domain composite scores significantly predicted MCI-DS status. Based upon path modeling, the language/executive function composite score was the most affected by prodromal AD. However, based upon structural equation modeling, tests assessing the latent construct of memory were the most impacted, followed by those assessing visuomotor, and then those assessing language/executive function. Our study provides clear evidence that cognitive functioning in older adults with DS can be characterized at the cognitive domain level, but the statistical methods selected and the inclusion or exclusion of certain covariates may lead to different conclusions. Best practice requires investigators to understand the internal structure of their variables and to provide evidence that their variables assess their intended constructs.</p>

	<p>Background: The rapid expansion and severity of the COVID-19 contagion has had negative physical and psychological health implications for millions of people around the world, but even more so among children and adolescents. Given the severity of the situation and the small number of studies on the direct influence of viral infection on the cognitive development within adolescents, the present study aims at understanding the consequences of contracting the virus and being hospitalized in relation to cognitive functioning, in particular, for executive functioning, among adolescents. Methods: To all subjects included in the sample, divided into four groups based on the severity of the COVID-19 infection, were administered the WISC-IV in order to evaluate the global cognitive functioning, and subsequently, the subtests Courses and Tower of London (ToL), both part of the BVN 12–18, were administered for the evaluation of executive operation. Results: Our analyses showed that between subjects who did not contract the viral infection and those who contracted it in an asymptomatic form, there are no significant differences in cognitive functioning, but only in executive functioning. Furthermore, in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized subjects, we found lower scores especially for WM skills, while IQ scores are in a medium range. Conclusion: the present study shows that contracting the viral infection and, thus, being hospitalized, caused greater problems and difficulties as compared to those who were not hospitalized, impacting global cognitive (and executive) functioning, especially the WM. We believe that these results could allow an early detection of alterations in cognitive and executive functioning, a fundamental aspect of the interventions that occur in evolutionary phases such as those related to pre-adolescence, allowing, therefore, the activation of functional recovery pathways in a short time.</p>

	<p>Background: The combination of intralabyrinthine schwannoma (ILS) removal and cochlear implantation is the standard of care after surgical resection for audiological rehabilitation. Intracochlear ILS is not only the most frequent tumor in this group of schwannomas, but it is also, to some degree, surgically the most challenging because of its position behind the modiolus. Recent developments in the knowledge of implant position, implant magnet choice, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences make an MRI follow-up after surgical removal possible. Thus far, no results are known about the surgical success and residual rate of these kind of tumors. The aim of the present study was to perform an early MRI follow-up for the evaluation of residual or recurrent intracochlear ILS after surgical removal and cochlear implantation. Methods: In a retrospective study, we evaluated seven patients after an intracochlear ILS removal and single-stage cochlear implantation with a mean period of 13.4 months post surgery with a 3T T1 GAD 2 mm sequence for a residual ILS. Patients were operated on using an individualized technique concept. Results: In six out of seven cases, 3 T T1 GAD 2 mm MRI follow-up showed no residual or recurrent tumor. In one case, a T1 signal indicated a tumor of the upper inner auditory canal (IAC) at the MRI follow up. Conclusion: MRI follow-up as a quality control tool after ILS removal and cochlear implantation is highly important to exclude residual tumors. Long-term MRI evaluation results are needed and can be obtained under consideration of implant position, implant magnet, and MRI sequence choice. A preoperative MRI slice thickness less than 2 mm can be recommended to visualize possible modiolar and IAC expansion.</p>

	<p>Attachment scholars have long argued that insecure attachment patterns are associated with vulnerability to internalizing symptoms, such as depression and anxiety symptoms. However, accumulating evidence from the past four decades, summarized in four large meta-analyses evaluating the link between insecure attachment subtypes and internalizing symptoms, provide divergent evidence for this claim. This divergent evidence may be accounted for, at least in part, by the developmental period under examination. Specifically, children with histories of deactivating (i.e., insecure/avoidant) but not hyperactivating (i.e., insecure/resistant) attachment patterns in infancy and early childhood showed elevated internalizing symptoms. In contrast, adolescents and adults with hyperactivating (i.e., insecure/preoccupied) but not deactivating (i.e., insecure/dismissing) attachment classifications showed elevated internalizing symptoms. In this paper, we summarize findings from four large meta-analyses and highlight the divergent meta-analytic findings that emerge across different developmental periods. We first present several potential methodological issues that may have contributed to these divergent findings. Then, we leverage clinical, developmental, and evolutionary perspectives to propose a testable lifespan development theory of attachment and internalizing symptoms that integrates findings across meta-analyses. According to this theory, subtypes of insecure attachment patterns may be differentially linked to internalizing symptoms depending on their mis/match with the developmentally appropriate orientation tendency toward caregivers (in childhood) or away from them (i.e., toward greater independence in post-childhood). Lastly, we offer future research directions to test this theory.</p>

	<p>Mental activity in sleep often involves visual and auditory content. Chemosensory (olfactory and gustatory) experiences are less common and underexplored. The aim of the study was to identify olfaction-related factors that may affect the occurrence of chemosensory dream content. Specifically, we investigated the effects of all-night exposure to an ambient odour, participants’ appraisal of their current olfactory environment, their general propensity to notice odours and act on them (i.e., odour awareness), and their olfactory acuity. Sixty pre-screened healthy young adults underwent olfactory assessment, completed a measure of odour awareness, and spent three nights in weekly intervals in a sleep laboratory. The purpose of the first visit was to adapt to the experimental setting. On the second visit, half of them were exposed to the smell of vanillin or thioglycolic acid and the other half to an odourless control condition. On the third visit, they received control or stimulation in a balanced order. On each visit, data were collected twice: once from the first rapid eye movement (REM) stage that occurred after 3 a.m., and then shortly before getting up, usually from a non-REM stage. Participants were asked to report the presence of sensory dream content and to assess their current olfactory environment. Neither exposure, nor participants’ assessments of the ambient odour, or olfactory acuity affected reports of chemosensory dream content but they were more frequent in individuals with greater odour awareness. This finding may have implications for treatment when such experiences become unwanted or bothersome.</p>

	<p>Pain is an important non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD). It negatively impacts the quality of life. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pain in PD remain to be elucidated. This study sought to use electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence analysis to compare neuronal synchronization in neuronal networks between patients with PD, with and without pain. Twenty-four patients with sporadic PD were evaluated for the presence of pain. Time-frequency and coherence analyses were performed on their EEG data. Whole-brain and regional coherence were calculated and compared between pain-positive and pain-negative patients. There was no significant difference in the whole-brain coherence between the pain-positive and pain-negative groups. However, temporal–temporal coherence differed significantly between the two groups (p = 0.031). Our findings indicate that aberrant synchronization of inter-temporal regions is involved in PD-related pain. This will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain in PD.</p>

	<p>Adults with Down syndrome (DS) have an exceptionally high frequency of Alzheimer disease (AD) with a wide variability in onset, from 40 to 70 years of age. Equally prevalent in DS is hypothyroidism. In this study, we sought to quantify the relationship between the two. A total of 232 adults with DS and AD were stratified into three AD onset age groups: early (&amp;amp;lt;47 years), typical (48–59), and late (&amp;amp;gt;59). Among patients with available data, differences in the distributions of demographics, hypothyroidism variables (presence, age of onset), thyroid function tests, thyroid autoantibodies, and APOE genotypes were assessed (e.g., chi-squared, Mann–Whitney tests). Spearman and partial Spearman correlations and ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to quantify the association between ages of AD and hypothyroidism onset with and without covariate adjustments. We observed a positive association between the ages of AD and hypothyroidism onset after accounting for APOE-Ɛ4 (correlation: 0.44, 0.24, 0.60; odds ratio: 1.09, 1.05–1.14). However, an early age of hypothyroidism onset and the presence of the APOE-Ɛ4 allele were independently associated with the early age of AD onset. Similar findings were observed when accounting for other factors. Our study provides evidence for the importance of hypothyroidism and associated pathological mechanisms for risk of AD in DS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Cellular resolution anatomical and molecular atlases for prenatal human brains</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing interest in studies of prenatal human brain development, particularly using new single-cell genomics and anatomical technologies to create cell atlases, creates a strong need for accurate and detailed anatomical reference atlases. In this study, we present two cellular-resolution digital anatomical atlases for prenatal human brain at post-conceptional weeks (PCW) 15 and 21. Both atlases were annotated on sequential Nissl-stained sections covering brain-wide structures on the basis of combined analysis of cytoarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase staining and an extensive marker gene expression dataset. This high information content dataset allowed reliable and accurate demarcation of developing cortical and subcortical structures and their subdivisions. Furthermore, using the anatomical atlases as a guide, spatial expression of 37 and 5 genes from the brains respectively at PCW 15 and 21 was annotated, illustrating reliable marker genes for many developing brain structures. Finally, the present study uncovered several novel developmental features, such as the lack of an outer subventricular zone in the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex, and the apparent extension of both cortical (excitatory) and subcortical (inhibitory) progenitors into the prenatal olfactory bulb. These comprehensive atlases provide useful tools for visualization, segmentation, targeting, imaging and interpretation of brain structures of prenatal human brain, and for guiding and interpreting the next generation of cell census and connectome studies.</p>

                T cell activation is initiated by T cell receptor (TCR) phosphorylation. This requires the local depletion of large receptor-type phosphatases from “close contacts” formed when T cells interact with surfaces presenting agonistic TCR ligands, but exactly how the ligands potentiate signaling is unclear. It has been proposed that TCR ligands...

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Protein Nanoparticles Modified with PDGF-B as a Novel Therapy After Acute Cerebral Infarction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Treatment options for cerebral infarction beyond the time window of reperfusion therapy are limited, and novel approaches are needed. PDGF-B is considered neuroprotective; however, it is difficult to administer at effective concentrations to infarct areas. Nanoparticles (NPs) are small and stable; therefore, we modified PDGF-B to the surface of naturally occurring heat shock protein NPs (HSPNPs) to examine its therapeutic effect in cerebral infarction. PDGF-B modified HSPNPs (PDGF-B HSPNPs) were injected 1 d after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) in CB-17 model mice. We analyzed the infarct volume and motor functional recovery at 3 and 7 d. PDGF-B HSPNPs were specifically distributed in the infarct area, and compared with HSPNPs alone, they significantly reduced infarct volumes and improved neurologic function 3 and 7 d after administration. PDGF-B HSPNP administration was associated with strong phosphorylation of Akt in infarct areas and significantly increased neurotrophin (NT)-3 production as well as reduced cell apoptosis compared with HSPNPs alone. Moreover, astrogliosis in peri-infarct area was significantly upregulated with PDGF-B HSPNPs compared with HSPNPs alone. Treatment with PDGF-B HSPNPs might be a novel approach for treating cerebral infarction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Opsin 3 (Opn3) Expression in the Developing Nervous System during Mammalian Embryogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Opsin 3 (<I>Opn3</I>) is highly expressed in the adult brain, however, information for spatial and temporal expression patterns during embryogenesis is significantly lacking. Here, an <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP reporter mouse line was used to monitor cell body expression and axonal projections during embryonic and early postnatal to adult stages. By applying 2D and 3D fluorescence imaging techniques, we have identified the onset of Opn3 expression, which predominantly occurred during embryonic stages, in various structures during brain/head development. In addition, this study defines over twenty <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP-positive neural structures never reported before. <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP was first observed at E9.5 in neural regions, including the ganglia that will ultimately form the trigeminal, facial and vestibulocochlear cranial nerves (CNs). As development proceeds, expanded <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP expression coincided with the formation and maturation of critical components of the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS, PNS), including various motor-sensory tracts, such as the dorsal column-medial lemniscus (DCML) sensory tract, and olfactory, acoustic, and optic tracts. The widespread, yet distinct, detection of <I>Opn3</I>-eGFP already at early embryonic stages suggests that Opn3 might play important functional roles in the developing brain and spinal cord to regulate multiple motor and sensory circuitry systems, including proprioception, nociception, ocular movement, and olfaction, as well as memory, mood, and emotion. This study presents a crucial blueprint from which to investigate autonomic and cognitive opsin-dependent neural development and resultant behaviors under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">TMEM16A and TMEM16B Modulate Pheromone-Evoked Action Potential Firing in Mouse Vomeronasal Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The mouse vomeronasal system controls several social behaviors. Pheromones and other social cues are detected by sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO). Stimuli activate a transduction cascade that leads to membrane potential depolarization, increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, and increased firing. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated chloride channels TMEM16A and TMEM16B are co-expressed within microvilli of vomeronasal neurons, but their physiological role remains elusive. Here, we investigate the contribution of each of these channels to vomeronasal neuron firing activity by comparing wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mice. Performing loose-patch recordings from neurons in acute VNO slices, we show that spontaneous activity is modified by <I>Tmem16a</I> KO, indicating that TMEM16A, but not TMEM16B, is active under basal conditions. Upon exposure to diluted urine, a rich source of mouse pheromones, we observe significant changes in activity. Vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) from <I>Tmem16a</I> cKO and <I>Tmem16b</I> KO mice show shorter interspike intervals (ISIs) compared with WT mice, indicating that both TMEM16A and TMEM16B modulate the firing pattern of pheromone-evoked activity in VSNs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Cooling Temperatures via Thermal K2P Channels on Regeneration of High-Frequency Action Potentials at Nodes of Ranvier of Rat A{beta}-Afferent Nerves</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Temperature-sensitive two-pore domain potassium channels (thermal K2P) are recently shown to cluster at nodes of Ranvier (NRs) and play a key role in action potential (AP) regeneration and conduction on A&beta;-afferent nerves. Cooling temperatures affect AP regeneration and conduction on A&beta;-afferent nerves but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we have performed patch-clamp recordings directly at the NR in an <I>ex vivo</I> trigeminal nerve preparation. We have characterized the effects of cooling temperatures on intrinsic electrophysiological properties and AP regeneration at the NR on rat A&beta;-afferent nerves, and determined whether and how thermal K2P channels may be involved in the effects of cooling temperatures. We show that cooling temperatures from 35&deg;C to 15&deg;C decrease outward leak currents, increase input resistance, depolarize resting membrane potential (RMP), broaden AP width and increase latency of AP threshold at the NR. We further demonstrate that cooling temperatures impair regeneration of high-frequency AP trains at the NR. The effects of cooling temperatures on the intrinsic electrophysiological properties and regeneration of high-frequency AP trains at the NR can be partially reversed by BL-1249 (BL), arachidonic acid (AA), and intra-axonal protons, three thermal K2P activators, indicating the involvement of thermal K2P channels. Moreover, we show that at cooling temperatures there are interplays among thermal K2P channels, RMPs, and voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels, which together limit regeneration of high-frequency AP trains at the NR. Our findings demonstrate a new role of thermal K2P channels in temperature-dependent conduction of high-frequency sensory signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Glymphatic System: A Novel Component of Fundamental Neurobiology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Throughout the body, lymphatic fluid movement supports critical functions including clearance of excess fluid and metabolic waste. The glymphatic system is the analog of the lymphatic system in the CNS. As such, the glymphatic system plays a key role in regulating directional interstitial fluid movement, waste clearance, and, potentially, brain immunity. The glymphatic system enables bulk movement of CSF from the subarachnoid space along periarterial spaces, where it mixes with interstitial fluid within the parenchyma before ultimately exiting from the parenchyma via perivenous spaces. This review focuses on important questions about the structure of this system, why the brain needs a fluid transport system, and unexplored aspects of brain fluid transport. We provide evidence that astrocytes and blood vessels determine the shape of the perivascular space, ultimately controlling the movement of perivascular fluid. Glymphatic fluid movement has the potential to alter local as well as global transport of signaling molecules and metabolites. We also highlight the evidence for cross talk among the glymphatic system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, and lymphatic system. Much remains to be studied, but we propose that the glymphatic/lymphatic system acts as a cornerstone in signaling between the brain and body.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Intercellular Arc Signaling Regulates Vasodilation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Injury responses require communication between different cell types in the skin. Sensory neurons contribute to inflammation and can secrete signaling molecules that affect non-neuronal cells. Despite the pervasive role of translational regulation in nociception, the contribution of activity-dependent protein synthesis to inflammation is not well understood. To address this problem, we examined the landscape of nascent translation in murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons treated with inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We identified the activity-dependent gene, Arc, as a target of translation <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. Inflammatory cues promote local translation of Arc in the skin. Arc-deficient male mice display exaggerated paw temperatures and vasodilation in response to an inflammatory challenge. Since Arc has recently been shown to be released from neurons in extracellular vesicles (EVs), we hypothesized that intercellular Arc signaling regulates the inflammatory response in skin. We found that the excessive thermal responses and vasodilation observed in Arc defective mice are rescued by injection of Arc-containing EVs into the skin. Our findings suggest that activity-dependent production of Arc in afferent fibers regulates neurogenic inflammation potentially through intercellular signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nociceptors play prominent roles in pain and inflammation. We examined rapid changes in the landscape of nascent translation in cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) treated with a combination of inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We identified several hundred transcripts subject to rapid preferential translation. Among them is the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc. We provide evidence that Arc is translated in afferent fibers in the skin. Arc-deficient mice display several signs of exaggerated inflammation which is normalized on injection of Arc containing extracellular vesicles (EVs). Our work suggests that noxious cues can trigger Arc production by nociceptors which in turn constrains neurogenic inflammation in the skin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">G-Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER) in the Rostral Ventromedial Medulla Is Essential for Mobilizing Descending Inhibition of Itch</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic itch is a troublesome condition and often difficult to cure. Emerging evidence suggests that the periaqueductal gray (PAG)-rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) pathway may play an important role in the regulation of itch, but the cellular organization and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that a group of RVM neurons distinctively express the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which mediates descending inhibition of itch. We found that GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons in the RVM were activated in chronic itch conditions in rats and mice. Selective ablation or chemogenetic suppression of RVM GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons resulted in mechanical alloknesis and increased scratching in response to pruritogens, whereas chemogenetic activation of GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons abrogated itch responses, indicating that GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons are antipruritic. Moreover, GPER-deficient mice and rats of either sex exhibited hypersensitivity to mechanical and chemical itch, a phenotype reversible by the &micro; type opioid receptor (MOR) antagonism. Additionally, significant MOR phosphorylation in the RVM was detected in chronic itch models in wild-type but not in GPER<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> rats. Therefore, GPER not only identifies a population of medullary antipruritic neurons but may also determine the descending antipruritic tone through regulating &micro; opioid signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Therapeutic options for itch are limited because of an as yet incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of itch processing. Our data have provided novel insights into the cellular organization and molecular mechanisms of descending regulation of itch in normal and pathologic conditions. GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons (largely GABAergic) in the RVM are antipruritic neurons under tonic opioidergic inhibition, activation of GPER promotes phosphorylation of MOR and disinhibition of the antipruritic GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons from inhibitory opioidergic inputs, and failure to mobilize GPER<sup>+</sup> neurons may result in the exacerbation of itch. Our data also illuminate on some of the outstanding questions in the field, such as the mechanisms underlying sex bias in itch, pain, and opioid analgesia and the paradoxical effects of morphine on pain and itch.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">RIM-Binding Protein 2 Organizes Ca2+ Channel Topography and Regulates Release Probability and Vesicle Replenishment at a Fast Central Synapse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rab-interacting molecule (RIM)-binding protein 2 (BP2) is a multidomain protein of the presynaptic active zone (AZ). By binding to RIM, bassoon (Bsn), and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>), it is considered to be a central organizer of the topography of Ca<SUB>V</SUB> and release sites of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at the AZ. Here, we used RIM-BP2 knock-out (KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates of either sex to investigate the role of RIM-BP2 at the endbulb of Held synapse of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) with bushy cells (BCs) of the cochlear nucleus, a fast relay of the auditory pathway with high release probability. Disruption of RIM-BP2 lowered release probability altering short-term plasticity and reduced evoked EPSCs. Analysis of SV pool dynamics during high-frequency train stimulation indicated a reduction of SVs with high release probability but an overall normal size of the readily releasable SV pool (RRP). The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fast component of SV replenishment after RRP depletion was slowed. Ultrastructural analysis by superresolution light and electron microscopy revealed an impaired topography of presynaptic Ca<SUB>V</SUB> and a reduction of docked and membrane-proximal SVs at the AZ. We conclude that RIM-BP2 organizes the topography of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>, and promotes SV tethering and docking. This way RIM-BP2 is critical for establishing a high initial release probability as required to reliably signal sound onset information that we found to be degraded in BCs of RIM-BP2-deficient mice <I>in vivo</I>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Rab-interacting molecule (RIM)-binding proteins (BPs) are key organizers of the active zone (AZ). Using a multidisciplinary approach to the calyceal endbulb of Held synapse that transmits auditory information at rates of up to hundreds of Hertz with submillisecond precision we demonstrate a requirement for RIM-BP2 for normal auditory signaling. Endbulb synapses lacking RIM-BP2 show a reduced release probability despite normal whole-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and abundance of the key priming protein Munc13-1, a reduced rate of SV replenishment, as well as an altered topography of voltage-gated (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>)2.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and fewer docked and membrane proximal synaptic vesicles (SVs). This hampers transmission of sound onset information likely affecting downstream neural computations such as of sound localization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Autism Spectrum Disorder/Intellectual Disability-Associated Mutations in Trio Disrupt Neuroligin 1-Mediated Synaptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>We recently identified an autism spectrum disorder/intellectual disability (ASD/ID)-related <I>de novo</I> mutation hotspot in the Rac1-activating GEF1 domain of the protein Trio. Trio is a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) that is essential for glutamatergic synapse function. An ASD/ID-related mutation identified in Trio's GEF1 domain, Trio D1368V, produces a pathologic increase in glutamatergic synaptogenesis, suggesting that Trio is coupled to synaptic regulatory mechanisms that govern glutamatergic synapse formation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Trio regulates glutamatergic synapses are largely unexplored. Here, using biochemical methods, we identify an interaction between Trio and the synaptogenic protein Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) in the brain. Molecular biological approaches were then combined with super-resolution dendritic spine imaging and whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology in hippocampal slices from male and female rats to examine the impact ASD/ID-related Trio mutations have on NLGN1-mediated synaptogenesis. We find that an ASD/ID-related mutation in Trio's eighth spectrin repeat region, Trio N1080I, inhibits Trio's interaction with NLGN1 and prevents Trio D1368V-mediated synaptogenesis. Inhibiting Trio's interaction with NLGN1 via Trio N1080I blocked NLGN1-mediated synaptogenesis and increases in synaptic NMDA Receptor function but not NLGN1-mediated increases in synaptic AMPA Receptor function. Finally, we show that the aberrant synaptogenesis produced by Trio D1368V is dependent on NLGN signaling. Our findings demonstrate that ASD/ID-related mutations in Trio are able to pathologically increase as well as decrease NLGN-mediated effects on glutamatergic neurotransmission, and point to an NLGN1-Trio interaction as part of a key pathway involved in ASD/ID etiology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A number of genes have been implicated in the development of autism spectrum disorder/intellectual disability (ASD/ID) in humans. It is now important to identify relationships between these genes to uncover specific cellular regulatory pathways that contribute to these disorders. In this study, we discover that two glutamatergic synapse regulatory proteins implicated in ASD/ID, Trio and Neuroligin 1, interact with one another to promote glutamatergic synaptogenesis. We also identify ASD/ID-related mutations in Trio that either inhibit or augment Neuroligin 1-mediated glutamatergic synapse formation. Together, our results identify a synaptic regulatory pathway that, when disrupted, likely contributes to the development of ASD/ID. Going forward, it will be important to determine whether this pathway represents a point of convergence of other proteins implicated in ASD/ID.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Differentiation Status of Hair Cells That Regenerate Naturally in the Vestibular Inner Ear of the Adult Mouse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging, disease, and trauma can lead to loss of vestibular hair cells and permanent vestibular dysfunction. Previous work showed that, following acute destruction of ~95% of vestibular hair cells in adult mice, ~20% regenerate naturally (without exogenous factors) through supporting cell transdifferentiation. There is, however, no evidence for the recovery of vestibular function. To gain insight into the lack of functional recovery, we assessed functional differentiation in regenerated hair cells for up to 15 months, focusing on key stages in stimulus transduction and transmission: hair bundles, voltage-gated conductances, and synaptic contacts. Regenerated hair cells had many features of mature type II vestibular hair cells, including polarized mechanosensitive hair bundles with zone-appropriate stereocilia heights, large voltage-gated potassium currents, basolateral processes, and afferent and efferent synapses. Regeneration failed, however, to recapture the full range of properties of normal populations, and many regenerated hair cells had some properties of immature hair cells, including small transduction currents, voltage-gated sodium currents, and small or absent HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) currents. Furthermore, although mouse vestibular epithelia normally have slightly more type I hair cells than type II hair cells, regenerated hair cells acquired neither the low-voltage-activated potassium channels nor the afferent synaptic calyces that distinguish mature type I hair cells from type II hair cells and confer distinctive physiology. Thus, natural regeneration of vestibular hair cells in adult mice is limited in total cell number, cell type diversity, and extent of cellular differentiation, suggesting that manipulations are needed to promote full regeneration with the potential for recovery of vestibular function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Death of inner ear hair cells in adult mammals causes permanent loss of hearing and balance. In adult mice, the sudden death of most vestibular hair cells stimulates the production of new hair cells but does not restore balance. We investigated whether the lack of systems-level function reflects functional deficiencies in the regenerated hair cells. The regenerated population acquired mechanosensitivity, voltage-gated channels, and afferent synapses, but did not reproduce the full range of hair cell types. Notably, no regenerated cells acquired the distinctive properties of type I hair cells, a major functional class in amniote vestibular organs. To recover vestibular system function in adults, we may need to solve how to regenerate the normal variety of mature hair cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">An Anatomically Constrained Model of V1 Simple Cells Predicts the Coexistence of Push-Pull and Broad Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The spatial organization and dynamic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that define the receptive field (RF) of simple cells in the cat primary visual cortex (V1) still raise the following paradoxical issues: (1) stimulation of simple cells in V1 with drifting gratings supports a wiring schema of spatially segregated sets of excitatory and inhibitory inputs activated in an opponent way by stimulus contrast polarity and (2) in contrast, intracellular studies using flashed bars suggest that although ON and OFF excitatory inputs are indeed segregated, inhibitory inputs span the entire RF regardless of input contrast polarity. Here, we propose a biologically detailed computational model of simple cells embedded in a V1-like network that resolves this seeming contradiction. We varied parametrically the RF-correlation-based bias for excitatory and inhibitory synapses and found that a moderate bias of excitatory neurons to synapse onto other neurons with correlated receptive fields and a weaker bias of inhibitory neurons to synapse onto other neurons with anticorrelated receptive fields can explain the conductance input, the postsynaptic membrane potential, and the spike train dynamics under both stimulation paradigms. This computational study shows that the same structural model can reproduce the functional diversity of visual processing observed during different visual contexts.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Identifying generic connectivity motives in cortical circuitry encoding for specific functions is crucial for understanding the computations implemented in the cortex. Indirect evidence points to correlation-based biases in the connectivity pattern in V1 of higher mammals, whereby excitatory and inhibitory neurons preferentially synapse onto neurons respectively with correlated and anticorrelated receptive fields. A recent intracellular study questions this push&ndash;pull hypothesis, failing to find spatial anticorrelation patterns between excitation and inhibition across the receptive field. We present here a spiking model of V1 that integrates relevant anatomic and physiological constraints and shows that a more versatile motif of correlation-based connectivity with selectively tuned excitation and broadened inhibition is sufficient to account for the diversity of functional descriptions obtained for different classes of stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">From Receptive to Perceptive Fields: Size-Dependent Asymmetries in Both Negative Afterimages and Subcortical On and Off Post-Stimulus Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Negative afterimages are perceptual phenomena that occur after physical stimuli disappear from sight. Their origin is linked to transient post-stimulus responses of visual neurons. The receptive fields (RFs) of these subcortical ON- and OFF-center neurons exhibit antagonistic interactions between central and surrounding visual space, resulting in selectivity for stimulus polarity and size. These two features are closely intertwined, yet their relationship to negative afterimage perception remains unknown. Here we tested whether size differentially affects the perception of bright and dark negative afterimages in humans of both sexes, and how this correlates with neural mechanisms in subcortical ON and OFF cells. Psychophysically, we found a size-dependent asymmetry whereby dark disks produce stronger and longer-lasting negative afterimages than bright disks of equal contrast at sizes &gt;0.8&deg;. Neurophysiological recordings from retinal and relay cells in female cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus showed that subcortical ON cells exhibited stronger sustained post-stimulus responses to dark disks, than OFF cells to bright disks, at sizes &gt;1&deg;. These sizes agree with the emergence of center-surround antagonism, revealing stronger suppression to opposite-polarity stimuli for OFF versus ON cells, particularly in dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Using a network-based retino-geniculate model, we confirmed stronger antagonism and temporal transience for OFF-cell post-stimulus rebound responses. A V1 population model demonstrated that both strength and duration asymmetries can be propagated to downstream cortical areas. Our results demonstrate how size-dependent antagonism impacts both the neuronal post-stimulus response and the resulting afterimage percepts, thereby supporting the idea of perceptual RFs reflecting the underlying neuronal RF organization of single cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual illusions occur when sensory inputs and perceptual outcomes do not match, and provide a valuable tool to understand transformations from neural to perceptual responses. A classic example are negative afterimages that remain visible after a stimulus is removed from view. Such perceptions are linked to responses in early visual neurons, yet the details remain poorly understood. Combining human psychophysics, neurophysiological recordings in cats and retino-thalamo-cortical computational modeling, our study reveals how stimulus size and the receptive-field structure of subcortical ON and OFF cells contributes to the parallel asymmetries between neural and perceptual responses to bright versus dark afterimages. Thus, this work provides a deeper link from the underlying neural mechanisms to the resultant perceptual outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Effect of Serotonin Receptor 5-HT1B on Lateral Inhibition between Spiny Projection Neurons in the Mouse Striatum</a></h4>

              
                <p>The principal neurons of the striatum, the spiny projection neurons (SPNs), make inhibitory synaptic connections with each other via collaterals of their main axon, forming a local lateral inhibition network. Serotonin, acting via the 5-HT1B receptor, modulates neurotransmitter release from SPN terminals in striatal output nuclei, but the role of 5-HT1B receptors in lateral inhibition among SPNs in the striatum is unknown. Here, we report the effects of 5-HT1B receptor activation on lateral inhibition in the mouse striatum. Whole-cell recordings were made from SPNs in acute brain slices of either sex, while optogenetically activating presynaptic SPNs or fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). Activation of 5-HT1B receptors significantly reduced the amplitude of IPSCs evoked by optical stimulation of both direct and indirect pathway SPNs. This reduction was blocked by application of a 5-HT1B receptor antagonist. Activation of 5-HT1B receptors did not reduce the amplitude of IPSCs evoked from FSIs. These results suggest a new role for serotonin as a modulator of lateral inhibition among striatal SPNs. The 5-HT1B receptor may, therefore, be a suitable target for future behavioral experiments investigating the currently unknown role of lateral inhibition in the function of the striatum.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that stimulation of serotonin receptors reduces the efficacy of lateral inhibition between spiny projection neurons (SPNs), one of the biggest GABAergic sources in the striatum, by activation of the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor. The striatum receives serotonergic input from the dorsal raphe nuclei and is important in behavioral brain functions like learning and action selection. Our findings suggest a new role for serotonin in modulating the dynamics of neural interactions in the striatum, which extends current knowledge of the mechanisms of the behavioral effects of serotonin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Switching between Single- and Dual-Network Activity via Modulation of Intrinsic Membrane Properties</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oscillatory networks underlie rhythmic behaviors (e.g., walking, chewing) and complex behaviors (e.g., memory formation, decision-making). Flexibility of oscillatory networks includes neurons switching between single- and dual-network participation, even generating oscillations at two distinct frequencies. Modulation of synaptic strength can underlie this neuronal switching. Here we ask whether switching into dual-frequency oscillations can also result from modulation of intrinsic neuronal properties. The isolated stomatogastric nervous system of male <I>Cancer borealis</I> crabs contains two well-characterized rhythmic feeding-related networks (pyloric, ~1 Hz; gastric mill, ~0.1 Hz). The identified modulatory projection neuron MCN5 causes the pyloric-only lateral posterior gastric (LPG) neuron to switch to dual pyloric/gastric mill bursting. Bath applying the MCN5 neuropeptide transmitter Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide only partly mimics the LPG switch to dual activity because of continued LP neuron inhibition of LPG. Here, we find that MCN5 uses a cotransmitter, glutamate, to inhibit LP, unlike Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide excitation of LP. Thus, we modeled the MCN5-elicited LPG switching with Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide application and LP photoinactivation. Using hyperpolarization of pyloric pacemaker neurons and gastric mill network neurons, we found that LPG pyloric-timed oscillations require rhythmic electrical synaptic input. However, LPG gastric mill-timed oscillations do not require any pyloric/gastric mill synaptic input and are voltage-dependent. Thus, we identify modulation of intrinsic properties as an additional mechanism for switching a neuron into dual-frequency activity. Instead of synaptic modulation switching a neuron into a second network as a passive follower, modulation of intrinsic properties could enable a switching neuron to become an active contributor to rhythm generation in the second network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuromodulation of oscillatory networks can enable network neurons to switch from single- to dual-network participation, even when two networks oscillate at distinct frequencies. We used small, well-characterized networks to determine whether modulation of synaptic strength, an identified mechanism for switching, is necessary for dual-network recruitment. We demonstrate that rhythmic electrical synaptic input is required for continued linkage with a "home" network, whereas modulation of intrinsic properties enables a neuron to generate oscillations at a second frequency. Neuromodulator-induced switches in neuronal participation between networks occur in motor, cognitive, and sensory networks. Our study highlights the importance of considering intrinsic properties as a pivotal target for enabling parallel participation of a neuron in two oscillatory networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociating the Neural Correlates of Consciousness and Task Relevance in Face Perception Using Simultaneous EEG-fMRI</a></h4>

              
                <p>Current theories of visual consciousness disagree about whether it emerges during early stages of processing in sensory brain regions or later when a widespread frontoparietal network becomes involved. Moreover, disentangling conscious perception from task-related postperceptual processes (e.g., report) and integrating results across different neuroscientific methods remain ongoing challenges. The present study addressed these problems using simultaneous EEG-fMRI and a specific inattentional blindness paradigm with three physically identical phases in female and male human participants. In phase 1, participants performed a distractor task during which line drawings of faces and control stimuli were presented centrally. While some participants spontaneously noticed the faces in phase 1, others remained inattentionally blind. In phase 2, all participants were made aware of the task-irrelevant faces but continued the distractor task. In phase 3, the faces became task-relevant. Bayesian analysis of brain responses demonstrated that conscious face perception was most strongly associated with activation in fusiform gyrus (fMRI) as well as the N170 and visual awareness negativity (EEG). Smaller awareness effects were revealed in the occipital and prefrontal cortex (fMRI). Task-relevant face processing, on the other hand, led to strong, extensive activation of occipitotemporal, frontoparietal, and attentional networks (fMRI). In EEG, it enhanced early negativities and elicited a pronounced P3b component. Overall, we provide evidence that conscious visual perception is linked with early processing in stimulus-specific sensory brain areas but may additionally involve prefrontal cortex. In contrast, the strong activation of widespread brain networks and the P3b are more likely associated with task-related processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does our brain generate visual consciousness&mdash;the subjective experience of what it is like to see, for example, a face? To date, it is hotly debated whether it emerges early in sensory brain regions or later when a widespread frontoparietal network is activated. Here, we use simultaneous fMRI and EEG for high spatial and temporal resolution and demonstrate that conscious face perception is predominantly linked to early and occipitotemporal processes, but also prefrontal activity. Task-related processes (e.g., decision-making), on the other hand, elicit brain-wide activations including late and strong frontoparietal activity. These findings challenge numerous previous studies and highlight the importance of investigating the neural correlates of consciousness in the absence of task relevance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Linear Integration of Sensory Evidence over Space and Time Underlies Face Categorization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual object recognition relies on elaborate sensory processes that transform retinal inputs to object representations, but it also requires decision-making processes that read out object representations and function over prolonged time scales. The computational properties of these decision-making processes remain underexplored for object recognition. Here, we study these computations by developing a stochastic multifeature face categorization task. Using quantitative models and tight control of spatiotemporal visual information, we demonstrate that human subjects (five males, eight females) categorize faces through an integration process that first linearly adds the evidence conferred by task-relevant features over space to create aggregated momentary evidence and then linearly integrates it over time with minimum information loss. Discrimination of stimuli along different category boundaries (e.g., identity or expression of a face) is implemented by adjusting feature weights of spatial integration. This linear but flexible integration process over space and time bridges past studies on simple perceptual decisions to complex object recognition behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although simple perceptual decision-making such as discrimination of random dot motion has been successfully explained as accumulation of sensory evidence, we lack rigorous experimental paradigms to study the mechanisms underlying complex perceptual decision-making such as discrimination of naturalistic faces. We develop a stochastic multifeature face categorization task as a systematic approach to quantify the properties and potential limitations of the decision-making processes during object recognition. We show that human face categorization could be modeled as a linear integration of sensory evidence over space and time. Our framework to study object recognition as a spatiotemporal integration process is broadly applicable to other object categories and bridges past studies of object recognition and perceptual decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reactivation of Single-Episode Pain Patterns in the Hippocampus and Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aversive and rewarding experiences can exert a strong influence on subsequent behavior. While decisions are often supported by the value of single past episodes, most research has focused on the role of well-learned value associations. Recent studies have begun to investigate the influence of reward-associated episodes, but it is unclear whether these results generalize to negative experiences, such as pain. To investigate whether and how the value of previous aversive experiences modulates behavior and brain activity, in our experiments female and male human participants experienced episodes of high or low pain in conjunction with incidental, trial-unique neutral pictures. In an incentive-compatible surprise test phase, we found that participants avoided pain-paired objects. In a separate fMRI experiment, at test, participants exhibited significant pain value memory. Neurally, when participants were re-exposed to pain-paired objects, we found no evidence for reactivation of pain-related patterns in pain-responsive regions, such as the anterior insula. Critically, however, we found significant reactivation of pain-related patterns of activity in the hippocampus, such that activity significantly discriminated high versus low pain episodes. Further, stronger reactivation in the anterior hippocampus was related to improved pain value memory performance. Our results demonstrate that single incidental aversive experiences can build memories that affect decision-making and that this influence may be supported by the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aversive and rewarding experiences can exert a strong influence on our subsequent behavior. While decisions are often supported by single past negative or positive episodes, most research has focused on the role of well-learned value associations. In experiments using aversive heat pain in conjunction with incidental objects, we found that participants' choices were biased by the level of pain associated with the objects. Further, when participants saw the objects again, pain-related neural patterns in the hippocampus were re-expressed, and this was related to pain value memory performance. These results suggest a mechanism by which even single negative experiences can guide our later decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Evidence for Representational Persistence Within Events</a></h4>

              
                <p>How does the brain process continuous experiences so they can be remembered? Evidence suggests that people perceive their experience as a series of distinct and meaningful events. Information encountered within the same event shows greater temporal integration into memory as well as enhanced neural representational similarity. Although these data support the theory that the brain builds and maintains a mental model of the current event that represents recently encountered stimulus information, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. We used fMRI in humans (<I>N</I> = 21, 13 female) to test whether within-event neural similarity indicates the persistence of stimulus representations in a mental model. Participants viewed trial-unique visual images that were grouped into events. We calculated neural pattern similarity across time in the category-selective visual cortex to measure stimulus persistence. Pattern similarity was enhanced within, compared with between, events in the object-sensitive left lateral occipital (LO) cortex. This was specific to situations when objects could persist within a mental model, suggesting modulation of neural activity based on the features and structure of the event. Left LO object persistence was correlated with activity in a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) region linked to representing mental models within events. mFPC activity also correlated with pattern similarity in the hippocampus but more generally across stimulus categories. Critically, left LO similarity was related to estimates of temporal proximity in memory. The data suggest that temporal neural stability reflects stimulus persistence in mental models and highlight the importance of within-event representational stability in the transformation of experience to memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the brain process continuous experiences so they can be remembered? One idea is that information persists in mental models during stable events, facilitating the organization of events in memory. Using fMRI pattern similarity analysis, we found enhanced similarity within, compared with between, events in the object-sensitive LO but only when objects could persist within a mental model. mPFC activity correlated with left LO similarity when objects persisted within an event; in contrast, mPFC activity correlated with hippocampal similarity across stimulus categories. Left LO persistence was also related to the remembered temporal proximity of stimuli. The data suggest the brain dynamically maintains stimulus information in mental models during events, supporting the transformation of experience into memory.</p>

                Background: Several studies have investigated whether personalising trial documentation can aid recruitment and retention. We did a ‘study within a trial’ (SWAT) evaluating the effectiveness of a personalised text message compared to a non-personalised text message, on the retention rate in a large orthopaedic trial. Methods: The SWAT was embedded in the Knee Replacement Bandaging Study (KReBS) trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of 12-month questionnaires returned. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of questionnaires completed and time to questionnaire return. Binary data were analysed using logistic regression and time to return using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) are presented, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values. Results: In total, 1465 participants were included in the SWAT. In the personalised group, 644/723 (89.1%) of participants returned a questionnaire, compared to 654/742 (88.1%) in the non-personalised group. The absolute difference in return rate was 0.9% (95% CI: -2.3% to 4.2%; p=0.57). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the likelihood of returning a questionnaire (OR 1.09; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.51; p=0.61), the likelihood of returning a complete questionnaire (OR 1.11; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.51; p=0.50) nor in time to return (HR 1.05; 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.17; p=0.40). Conclusion: This SWAT adds to the growing evidence base for whether personalised text messages are effective. Registration: ISRCTN87127065 (20/02/2017); SWAT 35 (01/12/2015)

                <p>by Christian Selinger, Samuel Alizon</p>

Interactions within a population shape the spread of infectious diseases but contact patterns between individuals are difficult to access. We hypothesised that key properties of these patterns can be inferred from multiple infection data in longitudinal follow-ups. We developed a simulator for epidemics with multiple infections on networks and analysed the resulting individual infection time series by introducing similarity metrics between hosts based on their multiple infection histories. We find that, depending on infection multiplicity and network sampling, multiple infection summary statistics can recover network properties such as degree distribution. Furthermore, we show that by mining simulation outputs for multiple infection patterns, one can detect immunological interference between pathogens (i.e. the fact that past infections in a host condition future probability of infection). The combination of individual-based simulations and analysis of multiple infection histories opens promising perspectives to infer and validate transmission networks and immunological interference for infectious diseases from longitudinal cohort data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Slow manifolds within network dynamics encode working memory efficiently and robustly</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elham Ghazizadeh, ShiNung Ching</p>

Working memory is a cognitive function involving the storage and manipulation of latent information over brief intervals of time, thus making it crucial for context-dependent computation. Here, we use a top-down modeling approach to examine network-level mechanisms of working memory, an enigmatic issue and central topic of study in neuroscience. We optimize thousands of recurrent rate-based neural networks on a working memory task and then perform dynamical systems analysis on the ensuing optimized networks, wherein we find that four distinct dynamical mechanisms can emerge. In particular, we show the prevalence of a mechanism in which memories are encoded along slow stable manifolds in the network state space, leading to a phasic neuronal activation profile during memory periods. In contrast to mechanisms in which memories are directly encoded at stable attractors, these networks naturally forget stimuli over time. Despite this seeming functional disadvantage, they are more efficient in terms of how they leverage their attractor landscape and paradoxically, are considerably more robust to noise. Our results provide new hypotheses regarding how working memory function may be encoded within the dynamics of neural circuits.

                <p>by Kwang Il Ryom, Vezha Boboeva, Oleksandra Soldatkina, Alessandro Treves</p>

We discuss simple models for the transient storage in short-term memory of cortical patterns of activity, all based on the notion that their recall exploits the natural tendency of the cortex to hop from state to state—latching dynamics. We show that in one such model, and in simple spatial memory tasks we have given to human subjects, short-term memory can be limited to similar low capacity by interference effects, in tasks terminated by errors, and can exhibit similar sublinear scaling, when errors are overlooked. The same mechanism can drive serial recall if combined with weak order-encoding plasticity. Finally, even when storing randomly correlated patterns of activity the network demonstrates correlation-driven latching waves, which are reflected at the outer extremes of pattern space.

                <p>Patients with epilepsy report that sleep deprivation is a common trigger for breakthrough seizures. The basic mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. In the Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model of epilepsy, daily sleep deprivation indeed exacerbated seizures though these effects were lost after the third day. Sleep deprivation also accelerated mortality in ~ 52% of Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, not observed in controls. Voltage-clamp experiments on the day after recovery from sleep deprivation showed reductions in GABAergic tonic inhibition in dentate granule cells in epileptic Kv1.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Our results suggest that sleep deprivation is detrimental to seizures and survival, possibly due to reductions in GABAergic tonic inhibition. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                The pandemic has created challenges in all sectors of the economy and education. Traditional teaching approaches seem futile in the new context, thus the need to constantly reinvent the delivery to meet the fast-paced changes in the education domain. Hence, Design Thinking (DT) is an alternative approach that might be useful in the given context. DT is known to be a human-centric approach to innovative problem-solving processes. DT could be employed in the delivery process to develop twenty-first-century skills and enhance creativity and innovation, in an attempt to identify alternative solutions. The study explores the role of design thinking (DT) mindset in innovative delivery among teachers. It enhances and facilitates innovative content delivery by leveraging creativity. The study targeted 131 teachers from primary and secondary schools in Malaysia. Data was collected through an online survey and was analyzed using SmartPLS to establish relationships between DT and Innovative Delivery in schools. The data was further analyzed to seek co-relations between the DT steps and the successful transformation of content delivery by teachers. The study established a framework for the application of design thinking for teachers as the primary support in developing activities for their students. The outcome of this study will help fill the gap towards creating an interesting method of delivery in schools and constantly innovating the method to suit the evolving generation. It provides an in-depth reason as to why students are not interested in the teacher's lessons which, in turn, affects their performance. This insight is crucial for the Ministry of Education and policymakers to enhance teachers’ ability to innovatively deliver content to students.

                An individual with profound deafness or total hearing loss has a hearing threshold of 80dB or more. The ineffectiveness of hearing aids, surging costs and complex surgeries for cochlear implants have discouraged many to opt for these types of treatments. Hence, this research aims to provide an alternative hearing aid that stimulates “hearing” through the skin sensory, which is more affordable and accessible for the profoundly deaf or total hearing loss community. We have developed four initial vibrating transducers with single spectrum, which are strapped to a belt. The transducers pick up audible sounds through a microphone, amplifies the sound to a high-level signal, stimulating a vibration pattern on the human skin sensory. The belt was tested on 30 random people who identified as normal, partial, and profoundly deaf. When the belt was strapped to the individual’s waist, audible sound was played (stimulus) and the individual was asked whether   he/she can feel a stimulation or vibration on their skin, and if so, state the sound source direction. Based on the test, all individuals were able to feel the vibrating stimulation on their skin, and they were also able to state the directions accurately. The various vibrating pattern that stimulates the human sensory system for the profoundly deaf can be learned over time, which could serve as useful information. However, interpreting and identifying the different types of vibrating pattern perceived through the skin remains a huge challenge for profoundly deaf people. As hearing through skin sensory is a very new area of research, there are very limited research articles published in this field. Thus far, this is the first study to evaluate the method of audio spectrum to develop hearing aid through skin sensory.

                Background: This article presents findings from research conducted before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on companies located in the Zurich airport region of Switzerland, regarding the needs for global business travel and its impacts. Methods: The study involved a mixed methods approach. Five hypotheses were tested using inferential statistics on data obtained from pre-tested closed questions in a web-based survey. Deeper context was explored through an interview-based case-study conducted at a Swiss pharma company. Results: Supporting alternative hypothesis 3 (Ha(3)), a significant positive relationship was found between travel frequency and business growth, F(1, 100) = 11.31, p = 0.0011. Supporting Ha(4), corporate culture had a significant positive relationship with business travel frequency (F(1, 100) = 15.50, p = 0.0002) and average trip length (F(1, 100) = 6.39, p = 0.01). And thirdly supporting Ha(5), corporate social responsibility had a significant relationship with global business travel (91%). Ho(2) and Ho(3) were accepted. The case study found that smart corporate travel policies and regulations should be instantiated to enhance our environment, which would also benefit employee wellbeing. Travel can be reduced significantly despite being demonstrated that physical co-presence is important for building trust. The case study suggests tools to support the monitoring and management of global business travel by organizations. Conclusions: COVID-19 has impacted travel for business significantly, and future research will be necessary to assess its impact. The article explores the ongoing research in this area, and several relevant implications are proposed for future leaders. The case study found willingness to pay both corporate and individual green taxes, and a deficiency in corporate communication around the environment. Business travel is needed to build trust; however, it can be reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Strychnine poisoning due to traditional Chinese medicine: a case series [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Strychnine poisoning is rare but possibly fatal. The most reported sources of strychnine poisoning include rodenticides and adulterated street heroin. Here we report a case series of an unusual cause of strychnine poisoning – Strychni semen, a herb known as “maqianzi” in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: All cases of strychnine poisoning confirmed by the Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory (HATRL, the highest-level clinical toxicology laboratory in Hong Kong) between May 2005 and May 2018 were reviewed. Results: Twelve cases of strychnine poisoning were recorded, and Strychni semen was the exclusive source. Ten (83.3%) patients presented with muscle spasms, and four (33.3%) developed typical conscious convulsions. The poisoning was severe in two (16.7%) patients, moderate in three (25%) and mild in eight (58.3%). No case fatality was recorded. Three (25%) patients were TCM practitioners and two (16.7%) were laymen who bought the herb themselves without a proper prescription. Conclusion: The practice of TCM is becoming popular in different parts of the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The spectrum of clinical features of strychnine poisoning secondary to Strychni semen are similar to those arising from different origins. Eliciting a history of TCM use, apart from exposure to rodenticides and drugs of abuse, may allow timely diagnosis in patients with compatible clinical features. Enhancement of TCM safety could minimize the hazard.

                Background: Binahong (Anredera cordifolia (Ten.) STEENIS) is a widely available herbal plant in Indonesia and has been intensely researched for its healing abilities due to its biological activities, but few have studied its capability in accelerating hard tissue healing in post-extraction tooth sockets. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effects of 3% binahong leaf extract gel on alveolar bone healing in post-extraction sockets in Wistar rats. Methods: In this study, 48 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to twelve groups. After the extraction of the left mandibular incisor, sockets in Group I to IV were given 3% binahong leaf extract gel, group V to VIII were given a control gel, and group IX to XII were given Gengigel® for 14 days. The residual socket volume (RSV) and fibroblast proliferation were observed on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th day post-extraction, while the osteoblast and osteocyte proliferation were observed on the 7th, 14th, and 28th day post-extraction. The RSV data were analysed using repeated measure ANOVA and one-way ANOVA, while the histopathological data were analysed using one-way ANOVA. Results: The results showed that the binahong group had the lowest RSV and the highest fibroblast proliferation compared to the other groups on the 7th day (p<0.05) and the highest osteoblast and osteocyte proliferation compared to the other groups on the 14th day (p<0.05). Conclusion: The experiment showed that 3% binahong leaf extract gel could accelerate wound closure, which was characterized by a greater decrease in the RSV value in comparison to the other treatment groups and could enhance alveolar bone healing by increasing the proliferation of fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reproductive characteristics of the giant gurami sago strain (Osphronemus goramy Lacepède, 1801): basic knowledge for a future hatchery development strategy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The giant gourami sago strain (Osphronemus goramy Lacepède) has been approved in 2018 as a candidate for freshwater aquaculture in Indonesia. However, information on the species’ reproduction is minimal. This study analyzed the reproductive characteristics of the gourami sago strain broodfish to provide basic knowledge for a future hatchery development strategy. Methods: A total of 10 female and 10 male mature gourami sago strain broodfish were measured for body weight and length, and were evaluated for their reproductive characteristics.  Breeding fish were spawned naturally in a 2×1×0.6 m concrete pond with a male-female sex ratio of 1:1. Egg weight and diameter were measured in 25 eggs per female using, respectively, ACIS AD- 600i scales with 0.01 g accuracy, and a microscope (Labo model L-711) using Canon Digital Camera Software 3 . Semen was collected using plastic syringes in 3 mL aliquots, then placed in an insulated ice-cooled container, and analyzed within two hours of collection. Results: Average weights of female and male broodfish before spawning were 2180±159.78 g and 3060±134.99 g, respectively. The relative fecundity and egg diameter were 1029±36 eggs kg-1 and 2.42±0.05 mm, respectively. The hatching rate and embryo survival to an eyed-egg stage were respectively 76.40±2.27% and 94.76±0.42%.  Sperm characteristics showed that volume was 0.60±0.12 ml kg-1 and percentage of motile sperm was 70.04±2.27%. Female broodfish weight after spawning was strongly correlated with the weight before spawned (r2 = 0.999) and absolute fecundity was also strongly correlated with female broodfish weight before spawning (r2= 0.921). Sperm concentration was moderately correlated with sperm motility (r2 = 0.556) and duration of sperm motility (r2 = 0.502). Conclusions: The gourami sago strain broodfish has suitable reproductive characteristics for the development of hatcheries. Successful natural spawning should be followed by larval weaning and feeding technology to increase growth and survival.

                Background: Driving-induced lower back pain (DLBP) is associated with long driving times and awkward postures. Nonetheless, its actual causes and solutions remain unclear due to intervening causes from activities of daily living and traumatic injuries. This study investigated the causes and recommendations for DLBP using the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ). Methods: A cause-and-effect chain analysis (CECA) was conducted based on discussions with 19 ergonomics experts from Malaysia. Engineering contradictions were formulated according to the causes and associated with the parameters of the TRIZ system. These parameters were then intersected in the contradiction matrix to extract the inventive principles. Finally, recommendations were made based on these principles. Results: CECA uncovered the design- and posture-related causes of DLBP. It was implied that missing seat adjustment controls might cause drivers to sit with their knees positioned higher than their hips. This issue causes an excessive posterior pelvic tilt, resulting in DLBP. To address this issue, an inert atmosphere involving the addition of inflatable bubble wraps to elevate the posterior position was recommended. Conclusion: While there have been studies on DLBP, the present study demonstrated originality by using TRIZ to preliminarily but systematically investigate and resolve DLBP. Further triangulations, prototyping, experimentations, and verifications were not possible due to time and budgetary constraints. Nevertheless, this research uncovered the TRIZ-integrated perspectives on ergonomic solutions to DLBP that are more cost-effective than medical treatments or design overhauls.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lightning safety awareness level in Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Malaysia is one of the countries with the highest lightning flash density globally. While sufficiency of lightning protection system is crucial to ensure human safety against lightning strikes, the public awareness towards lightning safety is also equally important in Malaysia. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the current lightning safety awareness level of the Malaysian population. Methods: An online questionnaire survey which consists of 22 scientific statements of lightning was first developed in Malay and English. The questionnaire allows the respondent to also check their own score upon completion of the questionnaire. It was then distributed to the public for data collection. The sample size comprised of both genders, all layers of society from various educational level and social background. Results: Overall, the awareness on lightning safety amongst Malaysian is at moderate level with an average score of slightly above 50%. Urbanites scored marginally better than their rural counterparts. One’s education level does not dictate their awareness level of lightning safety. Discussion: In conclusion, the public in Malaysia needs to be better educated on lightning safety. Similar studies should be replicated in other countries experiencing similar levels of lightning activity to better understand the public’s perception on lightning.

                Clathrin helps maintain synaptic homeostasis, but it’s unclear how it gets to synapses. Ganguly and Sharma et al. show that clathrin assembles into stable transport packets in axons that are trapped upon reaching synapses, where packets radially organize around synaptic vesicle clusters. Synaptic clathrin packets are dynamic, and their depletion impairs synaptic function.

                Transcriptomics identifies a human L5 neuron corresponding to extratelencephalic projecting neurons in mouse neocortex. Patch-seq recordings from this cell type reveal many conserved and divergent morpho-electric features of L5 ET neurons in human cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">Action-based organization of a cerebellar module specialized for predictive control of multiple body parts</a></h4>

              
                Heiney et al. identify a small region of the cerebellum specialized for generating a predictive defensive movement that requires coordination of multiple body parts. They suggest that the cerebellum has a dual-map organization in which action-based modules for controlling ethologically relevant behaviors co-exist with the conventional body map.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">A precise and adaptive neural mechanism for predictive temporal processing in the frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Meirhaeghe et al. found that the brain encodes elapsed time relative to prior expectations: while measuring a time interval, neural responses in the frontal cortex scale in time precisely in proportion to the average expected interval. This mechanism provides a substrate for processing temporal events predictively as deviations from expectations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A modified fluctuation assay reveals a natural mutator phenotype that drives mutation spectrum variation within Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Although studies of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> have provided many insights into mutagenesis and DNA repair, most of this work has focused on a few laboratory strains. Much less is known about the phenotypic effects of natural variation within <i>S. cerevisiae</i>'s DNA repair pathways. Here, we use natural polymorphisms to detect historical mutation spectrum differences among several wild and domesticated <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains. To determine whether these differences are likely caused by genetic mutation rate modifiers, we use a modified fluctuation assay with a <i>CAN1</i> reporter to measure <i>de novo </i>mutation rates and spectra in 16 of the analyzed strains. We measure a 10-fold range of mutation rates and identify two strains with distinctive mutation spectra. These strains, known as AEQ and AAR, come from the panel's 'Mosaic beer' clade and share an enrichment for C&gt;A mutations that is also observed in rare variation segregating throughout the genomes of several Mosaic beer and Mixed origin strains. Both AEQ and AAR are haploid derivatives of the diploid natural isolate CBS 1782, whose rare polymorphisms are enriched for C&gt;A as well, suggesting that the underlying mutator allele is likely active in nature. We use a plasmid complementation test to show that AAR and AEQ share a mutator allele in the DNA repair gene<i> OGG1</i>, which excises 8-oxoguanine lesions that can cause C&gt;A mutations if left unrepaired.

                Insects have evolved diverse and remarkable strategies for navigating in various ecologies all over the world. Regardless of species, insects share the presence of a group of morphologically conserved neuropils known collectively as the central complex (CX). The CX is a navigational center, involved in sensory integration and coordinated motor activity. Despite the fact that our understanding of navigational behavior comes predominantly from ants and bees, most of what we know about the underlying neural circuitry of such behavior comes from work in fruit flies. Here we aim to close this gap, by providing the first comprehensive map of all major columnar neurons and their projection patterns in the CX of a bee. We find numerous components of the circuit that appear to be highly conserved between the fly and the bee, but also highlight several key differences which are likely to have important functional rami1cations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A nascent polypeptide sequence modulates DnaA translation elongation in response to nutrient availability</a></h4>

              
                The ability to regulate DNA replication initiation in response to changing nutrient conditions is an important feature of most cell types. In bacteria, DNA replication is triggered by the initiator protein DnaA, which has long been suggested to respond to nutritional changes; nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report a novel mechanism that adjusts DnaA synthesis in response to nutrient availability in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. By performing a detailed biochemical and genetic analysis of the <i>dnaA</i> mRNA, we identified a sequence downstream of the <i>dnaA</i> start codon that inhibits DnaA translation elongation upon carbon exhaustion. Our data show that the corresponding peptide sequence, but not the mRNA secondary structure or the codon choice, is critical for this response, suggesting that specific amino acids in the growing DnaA nascent chain tune translational efficiency. Our study provides new insights into DnaA regulation and highlights the importance of translation elongation as a regulatory target. We propose that translation regulation by nascent chain sequences, like the one described, might constitute a general strategy for modulating the synthesis rate of specific proteins under changing conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SUV39 SET domains mediate crosstalk of heterochromatic histone marks</a></h4>

              
                The SUV39 class of methyltransferase enzymes deposits histone H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation (H3K9me2/3), the hallmark of constitutive heterochromatin. How these enzymes are regulated to mark specific genomic regions as heterochromatic is poorly understood. Clr4 is the sole H3K9me2/3 methyltransferase in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</i> and recent evidence suggests that ubiquitination of lysine 14 on histone H3 (H3K14ub) plays a key role in H3K9 methylation. However, the molecular mechanism of this regulation and its role in heterochromatin formation remain to be determined. Our structure-function approach shows that the H3K14ub substrate binds specifically and tightly to the catalytic domain of Clr4, and thereby stimulates the enzyme by over 250-fold. Mutations that disrupt this mechanism lead to a loss of H3K9me2/3 and abolish heterochromatin silencing similar to <i>clr4</i> deletion. Comparison with mammalian SET domain proteins suggests that the Clr4 SET domain harbors a conserved sensor for H3K14ub, which mediates licensing of heterochromatin formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel form of bivalent chromatin associates with rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes in response to a pathogen signal in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                Temporal dynamics of gene expression underpin responses to internal and environmental stimuli. In eukaryotes, regulation of gene induction includes changing chromatin states at target genes and recruiting the transcriptional machinery that includes transcription factors. As one of the most potent defense compounds in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, camalexin can be rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections. Though several transcription factors controlling camalexin biosynthesis genes have been characterized, how the rapid activation of genes in this pathway upon a pathogen signal is enabled remains unknown. By combining publicly available epigenomic data with <i>in vivo</i> chromatin modification mapping, we found that camalexin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications with opposite effects on gene expression, H3K27me3 (repression) and H3K18ac (activation), to form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants with reduced H3K27m3 or H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response. Our study indicates that the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin, which we name a kairostat, plays an important role controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stimuli in plants.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A PX-BAR protein Mvp1/SNX8 and a dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 drive endosomal recycling</a></h4>

              
                Membrane protein recycling systems are essential for maintenance of the endosome-lysosome system. In yeast, retromer and Snx4 coat complexes are recruited to the endosomal surface where they recognize cargos. They sort cargo and deform the membrane into recycling tubules that bud from the endosome and target to the Golgi. Here, we reveal that the SNX-BAR protein, Mvp1, mediates an endosomal recycling pathway which is mechanistically distinct from the retromer and Snx4 pathways. Mvp1 deforms the endosomal membrane and sorts cargos containing a specific sorting motif into a membrane tubule. Subsequently, Mvp1 recruits the dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 to catalyze membrane scission and release of the recycling tubule. Similarly, SNX8, the human homolog of Mvp1, which has been also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, mediates formation of an endosomal recycling tubule. Thus, we present evidence for a novel endosomal retrieval pathway that is conserved from yeast to humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta oscillations in frontal cortex differentially modulate accuracy and speed in flexible stimulus- and action-based learning</a></h4>

              
                Flexible reward learning relies on frontal cortex, with substantial evidence indicating the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) play important roles. Recent studies in both rat and macaque suggest theta oscillations (5-10 Hz) may be a spectral signature that coordinates this learning. However, causal network-level interactions between ACC and OFC in flexible learning remain unclear. We investigated the learning of stimulus-outcome (S-O) and action-outcome (A-O) associations using a combination of simultaneous in-vivo electrophysiology in dorsal ACC and ventral OFC, partnered with bilateral inhibitory DREADDs in ACC. In freely-behaving male and female rats and using a within-subject design, we examined accuracy and speed of response across distinct and precisely-defined trial epochs including correct choice, incorrect choice, and reward collection. We report significant modulation of accuracy by theta power in both ACC and OFC. Both ACC and OFC theta oscillations consistently signaled accuracy in the initial discrimination phase, whereas it was OFC theta alone in the reversal phases of both S-O and A-O learning. Theta power in either region was not correlated with deliberation speed. Indeed, theta modulation of accuracy was dissociable from its involvement in speed of response which was affected by ACC inhibition, most prominently in A-O learning. Results are discussed with reference to the nonhuman primate literature, where there is by contrast more reported specialization of OFC and ACC in flexible learning of stimuli and actions. The present results also point to a specific role of OFC theta in signaling a reversal of either kind.

                SCN2A is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk gene and encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. However, the impact of autism-associated SCN2A de novo variants on human neuron development is unknown. We studied SCN2A using isogenic SCN2A-/- induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and patient-derived iPSCs harboring a p.R607* or a C-terminal p.G1744* de novo truncating variant. We used Neurogenin2 to generate excitatory glutamatergic neurons and found that SCN2A+/p.R607* and SCN2A-/- neurons displayed a reduction in synapse formation and excitatory synaptic activity using multielectrode arrays and electrophysiology. However, the p.G1744* variant, which leads to early-onset seizures in addition to ASD, altered action-potential dynamics but not synaptic activity. Proteomic and functional analysis of SCN2A+/p.R607* neurons revealed defects in neuronal morphology and bioenergetic pathways, which were not present in SCN2A+/p.G1744* neurons. Our study reveals that SCN2A de novo variants can have differential impact on human neuron function and signaling.

                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the gene Ataxin1 (ATXN1) and characterized by motor deficits, cognitive decline, changes in affect, and premature lethality. Due to the severe cerebellar degeneration in SCA1, the pathogenesis of Purkinje cells has been the main focus of previous studies. However, mutant ATXN1 is expressed throughout the brain, and pathology in brain regions beyond the cerebellar cortex likely contribute to the symptoms of SCA1. Here, we investigate early-stage SCA1 alterations in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in clinically relevant brain regions including hippocampus and brain stem of Atxn1154Q/2Q mice, a knock-in mouse model of SCA1 expressing mutant ATXN1 globally. Our results indicate shared and brain region specific astrocyte pathology early in SCA1 preceding neuronal loss. We found reduced expression of homeostatic astrocytic genes Kcnj10, Aqp4, Slc1a2 and Gja1, all of which are key for neuronal function in the hippocampus and brain stem. These gene expression changes did not correlate with classical astrogliosis. Neuronal and microglial numbers were largely unaltered at this early stage of SCA1 with the exception of cerebellar white matter, where we found significant reduction in microglial density, and the brain stem where we detected an increase in microglial cell counts. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a growth factor important for the survival and function of neurons with broad therapeutic potential for many brain diseases. We report here that BDNF expression is decreased in cerebellum and medulla of patients with SCA1. Moreover, we found that BDNF had dual effect on SCA1 and wild-type mice. Motor performance, strategy development, hippocampal neurogenesis, and expression of astrocyte homeostatic genes in the hippocampus were ameliorated in BDNF-treated SCA1 mice and further enhanced in BDNF-treated wild-type mice. On the other hand, BDNF had a negative effect on memory recall and expression of homeostatic genes in the brain stem astrocytes both in wild-type and in SCA1 mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Incidental reinstatement of faces and scenes in medial temporal lobe subregions during word recognition</a></h4>

              
                During associative retrieval, the brain reinstates neural representations that were present during encoding. The human medial temporal lobe (MTL) with its subregions hippocampus (HC), perirhinal cortex (PRC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) plays a central role in neural reinstatement. Previous studies have given compelling evidence for reinstatement in the MTL during explicitly instructed associative retrieval. High-confident recognition may be similarly accompanied by recollection of associated information from the encoding context. It is unclear, however, whether high-confident recognition memory elicits reinstatement in the MTL even in the absence of an explicit instruction to retrieve associated information. Here, we addressed this open question using high-resolution fMRI. Twenty-eight male and female human volunteers engaged in a recognition memory task for words that they had previously encoded together with faces and scenes. Using complementary uni- and multivariate approaches, we show that MTL subregions including the PRC, PHC, and HC differentially reinstate category-specific representations during high-confident word recognition, even though no explicit instruction to retrieve the associated category was given. This constitutes novel evidence that high-confident recognition memory is accompanied by incidental reinstatement of associated category information in MTL subregions, and supports a functional model of the MTL that emphasises content-sensitive representations during both encoding and retrieval.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular and cellular adaptations in hippocampal parvalbumin neurons mediate behavioral responses to chronic social stress</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Behavioral responses to stress are, in part, mediated by the hippocampus and Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons. However, whether chronic stress induces molecular and cellular adaptations in hippocampal PV neurons contribute to stress-induced behavioral outcomes remains elusive. METHOD: Using chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), we investigated the role of neuronal activity and gene expression in hippocampal PV neurons in mediating stress-resilience and -susceptibility. We first used in vivo high-density silicon probe recordings and chemogenetics to test whether the activity of PV neurons in ventral dentate gyrus (PVvDG) is associated with particular behavioral outcomes. To find critical molecular pathways associated with stress-resilience and -susceptibility, we used PV-neuron-selective translating ribosome affinity purification and RNAseq. We used immunoblotting, RNAscope, and region- or cell type-specific gene deletion to determine whether Ahnak, a molecule regulating depression-like behavior, was necessary for behavioral divergence after CSDS. RESULTS: We find CSDS modulates neuronal activity in vDG. Notably, stress-susceptibility is associated with an increase of PVvDG firing, which we find is necessary and sufficient for susceptibility. Additionally, genes involved in mitochondrial function, protein synthesis and synaptogenesis are differentially expressed in hippocampal PV neurons of stress-resilient and -susceptible mice. Interestingly, protein and mRNA levels of Ahnak, an endogenous regulator of L-type calcium channels are associated with susceptibility after CSDS. vDG- and PV cell type-specific deletions reveal that Ahnak is required for stress-susceptibility to CSDS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that CSDS-induced molecular and cellular adaptations in hippocampal PV neurons mediate behavioral consequences, proposing a mechanism underlying individual differences in stress vulnerability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">AAV-PHP.S-mediated delivery of reporters to cranial ganglion sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Because of their ease of use and low risk containment, Adeno-Associated Virus vectors are indispensable tools for much of neuroscience. Yet AAVs have been used relatively little to study the identities and connectivity of peripheral sensory neurons because methods to selectively target particular receptive fields or neuron types have been limited. The introduction of the AAVPHP.S capsid with selective tropism for peripheral neurons (Chan et al., 2017) offered a solution, which we further elaborate here. We demonstrate using AAV-PHP.S with GFP or mScarlet reporters, that all cranial sensory ganglia, i.e. for cranial nerves V, VII, IX and X, are targeted. Pseudounipolar neurons of both somatic and visceral origin, but not satellite glia, are efficiently transduced rapidly and express the gene of interest within 1 week of injection. Fluorescent reporter proteins are transported into the central and peripheral axons of these sensory neurons, permitting visualization of terminals at high resolution, and/or in intact, cleared brain using light sheet microscopy. By combining a Cre-dependent reporter with the AAVPHP.S capsid, we confirmed expression in a cell-type dependent manner for both anatomical and targeted functional analyses. The AAV-PHP.S capsid will be a powerful tool for mapping the receptive fields and circuits of molecular subtypes of many somatosensory, gustatory and visceral sensory neurons.
